990313 projection of near term global temperature trends with reasonably high confidence
990314 clearly exceeding that of 2005 can be expected within the next 2 3 years
990315 it turns out that uncertainties in the energetic responses of earth climate systems are more than 10 times larger than the entire energetic effect of increased co2
990316 i really think that your bet should be based on sattelites that look at all the atmosphere with no local bias possible
990317 the reason to show these monthly and decadal giss rss and uah data is to expose the recent nonsense that has appeared in the blogosphere to the effect that recent cooling has wiped out global warming of the past century and the earth may be headed into an ice age
990318 despite these model limitations in ipcc model inter comparisons the model used for the simulations reported here i e modele with the russell ocean fares about as well as the typical global model in the verisimilitude of its climatology comparisons so far include the oceans thermohaline circulation sun and bleck 2006 the oceans heat uptake forest et al 2006 the atmospheres annular variability and response to forcings miller et al 2006 and radiative forcing calculations collins et al 2006 the ability of the giss model to match climatology compared with other models varies from being better than average on some fields radiation quantities upper tropospheric temperature to poorer than average on others stationary wave activity sea level pressure
990319 the relatively small magnitude of the globally averaged decrease in ocean heat content anomaly
990320 assuming that the 3 2 1 1 1022 j was not transported to the deep ocean previous work suggests that the scale of the heat loss is too large to be stored in any single component of the earths climate system levitus et al 2005 a likely source of the cooling is a small net imbalance in the 340 w m2 of radiation that the earth exchanges with space
990321 the updated time series of ocean heat content presented here figure 1 and the newly estimated confidence limits figure 3 support the significance of previously reported large interannual variability in globally integrated upper ocean heat content
990322 however the physical causes for this type of variability are not yet well understood
990323 an oceanic warming rate of 0 86 0 12 watts per square meter of ocean 0 29 0 04 pw from 1993 to 2003 for the upper 750 m of the water column
990324 josh willis paper spurred my colleagues and me to compare our climate model results with observations
990325 i describe this imbalance as the smoking gun or the innate greenhouse effect
990326 its the most fundamental result that you expect from the added greenhouse gases the greenhouse mechanism works by reducing heat radiation to space and causing this imbalance so if we can quantify that imbalance through our predictions and verify that it not only is there but it is of the magnitude that we expected then thats a very big fundamental confirmation of the whole global warming problem
990327 note the slow decline of the planetary energy imbalance after 2100 fig 3b which reflects the shape of the surface temperature response to a climate forcing figure 4d in efficacy 2005 shows that 50 of the equilibrium response is achieved within 25 years but only 75 after 150 years and the final 25 requires several centuries this behavior of the coupled model occurs because the deep ocean continues to take up heat for centuries verification of this behavior in the real world requires data on deep ocean temperature change in the model heat storage associated with this long tail of the response curve occurs mainly in the southern ocean measured ocean heat storage in the past decade willis et al 2004 lyman willis et al 2006 presents limited evidence of this phenomenon but the record is too short and the measurements too shallow for full confirmation ongoing simulations with modele coupled to the current version of the bleck 2002 ocean model show less deep mixing of heat anomalies
990328 work does not support the recent claim that the 0 to 700 m layer of the global ocean experienced a substantial ohc decrease over the 2003 to 2005 time period we show that the 2003 2005 cooling is largely an artifact of a systematic change in the observing system with the deployment of argo floats reducing a warm bias in the original observing system
990329 most of the rapid decrease in globally integrated upper ocean 750 m ocha between 2003 and 2005 appears to be an artifact resulting from the combination of two different instrument biases emphasis added
990330 both biases in certain argo floats and xbts appear to have contributed equally to the spurious cooling
990331 in order to test for potential biases due to this change in the observing system to argo globally averaged ohca was also computed without profiling float data figure 1 gray line
990332 no significant warming or cooling is observed in upper ocean heat content between 2004 and 2006
990333 the cooling reported by lyman et al 2006 would have implied a very rapid increase in the rate of ice melt in order to account for the fairly steady increase in global mean sea level rise observed by satellite altimeters over the past several years the absence of a significant cooling signal in the ohca analyses presented here brings estimates of upper ocean thermosteric sea level variability into closer agreement with altimeter derived measurements of global mean sea level rise nevertheless some discrepancy remains in the globally averaged sea level budget and observations of the rate of ocean mass increase and upper ocean warming are still too small to fully account for recent rates of sea level rise willis et al 2008
990334 the extra heat is probably going back out into space
990335 response for a record that would be unambiguous and therefore clear in all estimates of the trend the 50 waiting period is somewhere around 6 years according to this rough study
990336 we all know that the forcing is not linear in concentration but it isnt decreasing it is increasing logarithmically and it is certainly not decreasing exponentially
990337 how can you expect to be taken seriously when you havent even bothered to acquaint yourself with the physics of the model you are arguing against
990338 cloud climate feedback constitutes the most important uncertainty in climate modelling and currently even its sign is still unknown in the recently published report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 6 out of 20 climate models showed a positive and 14 a negative cloud radiative feedback in a doubled co2 scenario
990339 but the the record is too short for much confidence
990340 what david douglass says is absolutely correct at the recent noaa review of gfdl modelling activities we discussed this somewhere on another thread i brought up the issue numerous times that you should not look at projections from models that do not verify well against historical observations this is particularly true if you are using the ipcc results in some sort of regional study the simulations should pass some simple observational tests a credible mean value a credible annual cycle appropriate magnitude of interannual variability toss out the models that dont pass this test and look at the projections from those that do pass the test this generated much discussion here are some of the counter arguments 1 when you do the forward projections and compare the 4 or so models that do pass the observational tests with those that dont you dont see any separation in the envelope of forward projections 2 some argue that a multiple model ensemble with a large number of multiple models even bad ones is better than a single good model my thinking on this was unswayed but arguments 1 and 2 i think you need to choose the models that perform best against the observations and that have a significant number of ensemble members from the particular model assemble the error statistics for each model and use these error statistics to create a multi model ensemble projection this whole topic is being hotly debated in climate community right now as people who are interested in various applications regional floods and droughts health issues whatever are doing things like average the results of all the ipcc models there is a huge need to figure out how to interpret the ipcc scenario simulations
990341 1 when you do the forward projections and compare the 4 or so models that do pass the observational tests with those that dont you dont see any separation in the envelope of forward projections
990342 roger everyones time is limited this is why public archives exist here is the link again as i have said many times if you want an analysis done you are best off doing it yourself
990343 whether the average relative humidity is independent of temperature is irrelevant in a model
990344 last point if co2 is to warm the atmosphere and warmer still with more co2 then if co2 rises but temperature is constant or falls the theory is disproved done where is the faulty reasoning or what is the change to the theory
990345 that is a good example because it undercuts your point completely
990346 ok jared heres a quiz how long does an el nino last how about a pdo now how long has the warming trend persisted hint its still going on other influences oscillate the only one that has increased monotonically is co2 learn the physics
990347 look 2008 is much cooler than 1998 there has been no warming in the past 10 years
990348 what is the error in cloudiness at a given latitude
990349 2 although we are far from the benchmark of doubled co2 climate forcing is already about 3 4 of what we expect from such a doubling 3 even if we attribute all warming over the past century to man made greenhouse gases which we have no basis for doing the observed warming is only about 1 3 1 6 of what models project
990350 only about 1 3 1 6 of what models project
990351 that cloudy moist regions contract when the surface warms and expand when the surface cools in each case the change acts to oppose the surface change and thus presents a strong negative feedback to climate change
990352 o k there hasnt been any trend in the cosmic ray flux since at least 1958 but actually we now realize that its the muons that are important
990353 in terms of climate forcing greenhouse gases added to the atmosphere through mans activities since the late 19th century have already produced three quarters of the radiative forcing that we expect from a doubling of co2
990354 observed trends in global surface temperature 2001 present which slightly longer than 8 years
990355 not dissimilar to the notion of intelligent design which also hides within the retreating tides of present uncertainty
990356 the observed warming is only about 1 3 1 6 of what models project
990357 even if we attribute all warming over the past century to man made greenhouse gases
990358 indeed moderate overestimate of global warming is likely because the sensitivity of the model used 12 4 2 oc per doubled co2 is larger than our current estimate for actual climate sensitivity which is 3 1 oc based mainly on paleoclimate data 17
990359 if the uncertainty is larger than the effect the effect itself becomes moot
990360 the 1990s were the warmest decade of the millennium with 1998 the warmest year so far researchers said wednesday the study adds to a growing body of evidence that the global climate has been getting steadily warmer especially the last half of the 20th century
990361 global warming is accelerating three times more quickly than feared a series of startling authoritative studies has revealed they have found that emissions of carbon dioxide have been rising at thrice the rate in the 1990s the arctic ice cap is melting three times as fast and the seas are rising twice as rapidly as had been predicted
990362 hansen notes that most previous annual global record temperatures were only a few hundredths of a degree warmer than the previous record
990363 it has become very difficult for anyone to argue that observed global warming is natural variability we have good reason for being able to say that the world will be warmer by about a quarter of a degree in the next decade its the same reason we had 10 years ago when we said that the 1990s would be warmer than the 1980s the planet is out of equilibrium
990364 the 1990s were the warmest decade of the millennium with 1998 the warmest year so far researchers said wednesday the study adds to a growing body of evidence that the global climate has been getting steadily warmer especially the last half of the 20th century
990365 the ch4 and co2 permafrost feedback isnt included in current earthsystemmodels and it is potentially large but no one really knows i think the community has been a bit slow to take up on this feedback because of the lack of data

990367 new jersey recorded the hottest temperatures ever seen in that state
990368 because of the warmer u s temperatures from october through december energy use for residential heating was 13 5 percent below average for those three months
990369 weather stations are screened for potential bias from urban heat islands by comparing station locations with maps of urbanization measurements from nearby stations in rural areas are used to correct urban station data for warming due to the heat island effect if no rural neighbors are available for comparison data from urban and peri urban stations are left out of the global average calculation

990376 an introduction to probablity theory and its apllications volume i third editiion
990377 the theoretical study of chance fluctuations confronts us with many paradoxs for example one should expect naively that in a prolonged coin tossing game the observed number of changes of lead should increase roughly in proportion to the duration of the game in a game that last twice as long peter should lead about twice as often this intuitive reasoning is false we shall show that in a sense to be made precise the number of changes of lead in n trrials increases only as sqrt n in 100n trials one should expect only 10 times as many changes of lead as in n trials this proves once again that the waiting times between successive equalizations are likely to be fantastically long
990378 how can we produce an estimate of the response to climate as a result of specified and variable forcings boundary conditions
990379 a look at the same diagnostics across all the models would be instructive since combined forcings natural variability produce a positive net toa radiative imbalance gain in ohc will depend on the amount of deep ocean mixing and tropical variability both of which vary widely in the models
990380 measured ocean heat storage in the past decade willis et al 2004 lyman willis et al 2006 presents limited evidence of deep ocean temperature change but the record is too short and the measurements too shallow for full confirmation ongoing simulations with modele coupled to the current version of the bleck 2002 ocean model show less deep mixing of heat anomalies
990381 how can we produce an estimate of the response to climate as a result of specified and variable forcings boundary conditions
990382 in terms of climate forcing greenhouse gases added to the atmosphere through mans activities since the late 19th century have already produced three quarters of the radiative forcing that we expect from a doubling of co2
990383 even if we attribute all warming over the past century to man made greenhouse gases which we have no basis for doing the observed warming is only about 1 3 1 6 of what models project
990384 he asserts weve only had 16 33 of the expected warming
990385 why dont you write collins and ask him whether he thinks gcms are of no use in predicting the future on multidecadal scales since he has done some paleoclimate work i expect he will disagree
990386 even if we attribute all warming over the past century to man made greenhouse gases which we have no basis for doing the observed warming is only about 1 3 1 6 of what models project
990387 did you state the number of runs that have been made for the pinatubo results i e how much tuning was done
990388 we use the giss global climate model to make a preliminary estimate of mount pinatubos climate impact
990389 how unexpected were the predicted results assuming the predictions came true i would think that the more unexpected ie the gcm picking by and large the right numbers from a big population of possibilities the higher the level of confidence we can have in the gcm not
990390 the ghe does not rely on the troposphere getting warmer it relies on the increased difficulty for the whole system to lose heat to space
990391 because of convection tropospheric profiles particularly in the tropics are pinned to the surface temperature the moist adiabat
990392 claims that the ipcc projection of about 0 2 c dec over the next few decades would be falsified with such an observation are equally bogus
990393 i still want an answer from someone what kind of gcm did arrhenius use back in 1896
990394 you might want to read tom vonks discussion of the pinatubo climate run on climate audit he makes the very valid scientific point that the ocean does not change that much during the time frame of the climate model
990395 i do not know if you will be able to get the complete and accurate information about what the models did and i doubt it so if you get the information i am ready to bet that it doesnt contain much more than what i sketched above envelopped in fancy vocabulary like spectral absorptivity and such
990396 the time is too short to perturbate the oceans systems
990397 response if convection is the only thing going on then tropospheric tropical trends would be larger than at the surface therefore a departure from that either implies the convection is not the only thing going on or the data arent good enough to say i at no time indicated that the models have to be right i merely implied that an apparent model data discrepancy doesnt automatically imply that the models are wrong that may be too subtle though if the data were so good that they precluded any accommodation with the model results then of course the models would need to be looked at they have been looked at in any case however that isnt the case that doesnt imply that modelled convection processes are perfect far from it but it is has proven very hard to get the models to deviate much from the moist adiabat in the long term simply assuming that the data must be perfect is not however sensible jumping to conclusions about my meaning is not either gavin
990398 in terms of climate forcing greenhouse gases added to the atmosphere through mans activities since the late 19th century have already produced three quarters of the radiative forcing that we expect from a doubling of co2
990399 2 although we are far from the benchmark of doubled co2 climate forcing is already about 3 4 of what we expect from such a doubling
990400 do you think carl wunsch would agree with your assessment and correct me if i misunderstood your drift that these guys have a lousy hypothesis
990401 the gcm is reliable it can predict it predicts in conformity with what basic science re co2 and the greenhouse effect tells us we should expect the uncertainties regarding other feedbacks climate responses etc notwithstanding
990402 a host of uncertainties result in the modeller choosing values and setting boundaries etc in such a way that the result is not a prediction but a function of the modellers whim
990403 phil felyon 259 so provide the specific changes that were made to the model mathematical equations and parameterizations so we can determine if it is possible to determine the result from perturbation theory
990404 now if the tropical troposphere was not actually warming as much as models say then that could mean still higher climate sensitivity or the models actually underestimating surface warming since the lapse rate feedback represents the most negative feedback aside from the olr thats because the more sharp the temperature drop with height the stronger your greenhouse effect is
990405 you will recall statements saying that the warming in the middle term like 50 years from now wont be stopped even if we stopped emitting co2 right now this delayed response of the surface temperatures in the models allows them to have the right prediction for today and still a catastrophic prediction for tomorrow well i just dont buy it
990406 in summary it has been shown that all four dynamical cores with 26 levels converge to within the uncertainty
990407 this means ocean acidification may be seriously impacting marine life on the continental shelf right now
990408 so jerry given that without the models we do not have a way of establishing a limit on risk or of directing our efforts to best effect is it your contention that dynamical modeling of climate is impossible given current computing resources and understanding or do you have concrete suggestions for improving the models
990409 well i dont want to give a diagnosis because im not certain of every detail and a little information can be a dangerous thing
990410 he uses this number 10 to then say that there is a 2
990411 what is the error in cloudiness at a given latitude
990412 what is the error in cloudiness at a given latitude
990413 appears to be paraphrased from the discussion in the si about the phillips perron tests and has nothing to do with the meaning of the global cloud forcing error in the article
990414 2 he then takes this 10 number and applies it to a linear system to show that the
990415 more on that in a second and b the climate system is highly non linear
990416 the significance of the non linearity of the system along with feedbacks is that uncertainties in input estimates do not propagate as frank claims
990417 indeed the cloud error is a random error which further limits the propagation of that error in the actual predictions bias or systematic errors would lead to an increasing magnitude of uncertainty but the errors in the gcms are much more random than bias
990418 even more significantly the climate system is a boundary value problem more than an initial value problem
990419 at any given latitude there is a 10 uncertainty in the amount of energy incident but the global average error is much smaller
990420 2 frank mis characterizes the system as a linear initial value problem instead of a non linear boundary value problem
990421 let me also state here frank is a phd chemist not a climate scientist
990422 theres also a reason why this article is in skeptic instead of nature or science it would not pass muster in a thorough peer review because of these glaring shortcomings
990423 when you see a rainbow you dont stop to argue the laws of optics there it is in the sky
990424 ive also seen how articles published in the more professional literature that are critical of agw never find their way into the public sphere
990425 reducing the horizontal diffusion by a factor of 3 leads to an increase of the equilibrium climate sensitivity by 13
990426 one of the best groups of fluid dynamicists in the world is arguably at los alamos national laboratory
990427 unphysically large dissipation can keep a model bounded but not necessarily accurate
990428 franks article amounts to a lengthy argument that something we can see happening isnt happening
990429 please site a reference containing a mathematical proof of this assertion
990430 methane factor of 25 larger than co2 is actually taking into account some lifetime effects already it is the
990431 the stratospheric sink is a photolytic reaction and is presumed proportional to the concentration
990432 then on what should they be contingent on personal subjective judgment perhaps
990433 cloud and radiation budget changes associated with tropical intraseasonal oscillations
990434 in science evidence takes its meaning from theory and theory only allows conclusions when its falsifiable
990435 climate models include virtually everything we can presently know about climate
990436 not at all contingent on the results of climate models
990437 response commenting on this caricature of an outline of a silhouette of an argument is probably an exercise in futility but here goes
990438 you showed it uncertainty propagation in a toy linear model that is completely divorced from either the gcms or the real world
990439 climate models include virtually everything we can presently know about climate
990440 not at all contingent on the results of climate models
990441 that is models of climate are not independent of our understanding of the climate system
990442 models of climate are not independent of our understanding of the climate system 369
990443 our conclusions regarding climate are not contingent on the results of climate models
990444 if by this you mean globally predictive conclusions regarding climate are possible without a falsifiable global theory then i find your claim as coming from a scientist incredible
990445 you wrote that the sky is blue if by this you mean the moon is made of green cheese then i find you claim incredible
990446 are meritless with respect to deriving a global impact from co2
990447 as you represent youd concede that where it has been resolved atmospheric co2 always lags temperature trends this does not support co2 as a climate driver
990448 the feedbacks especially those associated with atmospheric moisture in all its myriad forms are acting roughly as has so far been predicted bolding added
990449 why havent you posted evidence of a scientific mistake in it
990450 in effect what you are saying is that if we dont know everything we dont know anything and that is patently and demonstrably false
990451 the reality of anthropogenic causation does not require gcm you simply cant come up with a model that comes close to working without it
990452 many empirical associations have been reported between globally averaged low level cloud cover and cosmic ray fluxes e g marsh and svensmark 2000a b hypothesised to result from changing ionization of the atmosphere from solar modulated cosmic ray fluxes an empirical association of cloud cover variations during 1984 to 1990 and the solar cycle remains controversial because of uncertainties about the reality of the decadal signal itself the phasing or anti phasing with solar activity and its separate dependence for low middle and high clouds in particular the cosmic ray time series does not correspond to global total cloud cover after 1991 or to global low level cloud cover after 1994 kristj nsson and kristiansen 2000 sun and bradley 2002 without unproven de trending usoskin et al 2004 furthermore the correlation is significant with low level cloud cover based only on infrared not visible detection nor do multi decadal 1952 to 1997 time series of cloud cover from ship synoptic reports exhibit a relationship to cosmic ray flux however there appears to be a small but statistically significant positive correlation between cloud over the uk and galactic cosmic ray flux during 1951 to 2000 harrison and stephenson 2006 contrarily cloud cover anomalies from 1900 to 1987 over the usa do have a signal at 11 years that is anti phased with the galactic cosmic ray flux udelhofen and cess 2001 because the mechanisms are uncertain the apparent relationship between solar variability and cloud cover has been interpreted to result not only from changing cosmic ray fluxes modulated by solar activity in the heliosphere usoskin et al 2004 and solar induced changes in ozone udelhofen and cess 2001 but also from sea surface temperatures altered directly by changing total solar irradiance kristj nsson et al 2002 and by internal variability due to the el ni o southern oscillation kernthaler et al 1999 in reality different direct and indirect physical processes such as those described in section 9 2 may operate simultaneously
990453 we regret to advise that we have received confirmation that four seaspan employees perished in todays plane crash
990454 with the rescue beacon destroyed in the crash it was very important
990455 we tried to call that cell phone back and met with no response
990456 he can see the search and rescue planes but we cant find him
990457 i think somebody who knows me very good like my coach my fitness coach they can see that in my eyes there is no more emotions not positive no negative just empty
990458 when i won the first match i was like ok at least im one step better than the previous times then i just took one match at a time i dont know playing better
990459 today like whatever i had inside i said ok give everything what you have and the only thing just stay quiet and dont show any emotions because theyre gonna destroy me and i did it
990460 i was pretty nervous in my first big final and i wished to play better
990461 every round i beat a better player than me i just played really well in this tournament thats how i say its a great experience for me because next final you know i will be more relaxed and i will be not like you know scared about it
990462 its a new experience for her because she beat some players that she never beaten before its not easy after beating elena dementieva then go next match and you play nadia petrova its also not easy then you beat jelena jankovic so many emotions come
990463 i think she still doesnt know how to deal with this i guess i went through this a little bit earlier this year thats why i could deal a little bit better
990464 were pretty pleased given the circumstances this week already we were worried at the beginning of the year about being two weeks earlier one week before the olympics two weeks before our traditional dates with the construction holidays here in quebec
990465 and at the same time as nascar at the same time as the francofolies with the weather we had this year with the premature defeats of ivanovic and sharapova to name just a few things
990466 this is a shame on those who study to ban the al qassam brigades and this decision will greatly fail
990467 those who want to ban al qassam have to face all the palestinian people and this will be impossible
990468 i totally disagree with this verdict as i have absolutely no reason to consider myself guilty naturally i will contest this
990469 id like to apologize to the fans that we have ended up in this position albeit through no guilt of our own
990470 if these athletes who are the main contenders for gold medals are forced out of the games the new favorites will automatically be the chinese
990471 why are last years doping tests suddenly emerging as an issue one week before the start of the olympic games
990472 he thought i would be working i said even if i am working heck we can figure something out you should go and do this so he called back and reluctantly agreed
990473 when he made the olympic team it was like he didnt like stealing anybody elses thunder even when he was the guy who caught the roar
990474 ryan can take the miles with him to beijing along with the memory of having his whole community cheer him on as he takes a lap for us at the middle school before leaving for the games for those of us who wont be at the games its the next best thing
990475 he has the highest dedication to running of anybody ive ever seen
990476 removing this record is the right thing to do pure and simple
990477 we have no interest in a record that the facts not rumors have exposed as being achieved by fraudulent means by at least one athlete on the team
990478 yet what i did doesnt seem to get highlighted which makes me upset
990479 i dont think ive had half as much press as i probably could or should have had
990480 in many ways im also happy that people dont seem to talk me up
990481 id rather they forget about me its more comfortable that way because it lets me get on with things
990482 the next time i will step on my blocks will be at the olympic games in beijing
990483 put a lid on my training and not do any crazy workouts your instincts tell you to train harder but my coach dennis shaver has to keep telling me rest is crucial at this stage of preparation
990484 it feels weird people coming up to me when ive been shopping and they are offering to buy me dinner
990485 questions have been raised regarding the applicability of privacy protections and whether legislation is needed to ensure that the same protections apply regardless of the particular technologies or companies involved
990486 individual websites and search engines and their affiliates that monitor users also owe consumers constructive notice of such activities and the right to limit or thwart any personal data collection
990487 it seems like breast cancer is something that affects everybody somebody knows somebody and the awareness is the most important thing because the earliest detection is what helps cure the diesease
990488 inconsistent with the concept of an open and accessible internet
990489 in essence comcast opens its customers mail because it wants to deliver mail not based on the address on the envelope but on the type of letter contained therein
990490 while comcast has said it would stop the arbitrary blocking consumers deserve to know that the commitment is backed up by legal enforcement
990491 we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services
990492 in short we have no rules to enforce this matter would have had a better chance on appeal if we had put the horse before the cart and conducted a rulemaking issued rules and
990493 the commission will act on credible complaints of interference with internet traffic in a discriminatory way
990494 ironically todays action by the fcc may actually result in slower online speeds for 95 percent of americas internet consumers
990495 there are unbelievably many many opportunities opening up to us
990496 i cant wait for the day i can meet them and put my arms around them
990497 i knew just in my mind my words were important for my own ears to hear
990498 if we dont forgive its like poison in our own systems

990504 the redesigned aol video portal builds upon what weve learned is the critical importance of combining industry leading technology with a unique easy to navigate user experience
990505 as video usage continues to skyrocket were excited to offer consumers a compelling all in one destination for accessing their favorite clips and shows while now also providing new community features that help viewers discover and share additional relevant programming
990506 its fine if comscore decided the way visitors are rolled up in the ad focus report is not ideal and they want to change how the report is compiled
990507 but then they have to change it for everyone not just one network
990508 we agree unique visitors may not be the best number to use for video but thats the number the majority of agencies ask for
990509 the concept of networking sites provides an opportunity for individuals to communicate quickly and efficiently via a convenient online platform
990510 as the concept matured business professionals realized that such a forum could be used beyond keeping in touch if applied to business as an indispensable tool that can actually help to produce measurable results
990511 the trend is part and parcel of what the internet can provide namely an alternate more broad based interface with like minded individuals
990512 when you couple that with the failure of traditional support systems for small business the burgeoning of our community is not surprising
990513 anyone striving to narrowcast to a high caliber group of decision makers in the business community can effectively reach their target audiences by way of this very captive space
990514 brands are able to garner more bang for their bucks through online ads and marketing especially as print media continues on the decline

990524 we wanted a book that wasnt just a sql primer we wanted a book with a title that didnt start or end in some arbitrary time frame and didnt talk down to the reader most of all we wanted a book that would help you take your skills to the next level and build fast reliable systems with mysql
990525 we decided to write a book that focused not just on the needs of the mysql application developer but also on the rigorous demands of the mysql administrator who needs to keep the system up and running no matter what the programmers or users may throw at the server
990526 we assume you are already relatively experienced with mysql and ideally have read an introductory book on it

990541 man sollte jetzt nicht nachkarten wir haben gegen eine bessere mannschaft verloren aber jens lehmann ist sehr ehrgeizig f r ihn w re es m glicherweise die letzte chance auf einen titel mit der nationalmannschaft gewesen vielleicht ist er deshalb noch ver rgert
990542 wir d rfen den blick f r die realit t nicht verlieren
990543 er ist eben immer noch entt uscht wie wir alle aber wir d rfen den blick f r die realit t nicht verlieren roberto rosetti ist keinesfalls parteilichkeit zu unterstellen ich kenne ihn schon seit l ngerer zeit er hat ein sehr gutes niveau au erdem waren die spanier einfach besser das allein war der grund f r die niederlage

990556 ich habe meine meinung dazu doch klar ge u ert mehr gibt es nicht zu sagen ich freue mich auf die neue saison beim vfb
990557 dass wir eine bessere saison spielen k nnen als zuletzt die meisterschaft ist zwar nicht unser ziel aber wer wei was kommt vor zwei jahren haben wir auch nicht vom titel gesprochen

990559 es rgert mich wahnsinning dass das bild des vereins und der fans in katastrophaler weise besch digt wurde die wahrnehmung ist dass alle unsere fans gewaltbereit sind aber das stimmt ja eigentlich gar nicht es ist nur ein ganz kleiner teil von ihnen

990570 despite more than 30 years of experience organizations still face an uphill battle implementing information systems a 2002 kpmg study reported that 56 of firms had to write off at least one is project as a failure during the previous year a 2003 hackett group study reported that 30 of is projects fail further according to kpmg the average cost of failed implementations in 2002 was roughly 15 million a significant increase from the 4 2 million average per failure in 2000 overall this paints an alarming picture of how much money u s businesses lose on failed systems and technology implementations each year

990572 as many as 75 percent of all large systems may be considered to be operating failures laudon amp laudon 1996 in many of these systems the problems appear to lie not with the technology but rather with the lack of attention paid to the needs of people who had to use the technology

990587 although profit seeking firms continue to invest in information technology it the results of the empirical search for it value have been bafflingly mixed even nicholas carr and other leading pundits to argue that it has become a commodity input that from a strategic standpoint
990588 it remains difficult if not impossible to draw any broad conclusions about its effect on the competitiveness and profitability of individual businesses companies continue to make it investments in the dark without a clear conceptual understanding of the ultimate strategic and financial impact
990589 as measured by profits productivity and consumer value is constrained by the market structure
990590 a commodity input that is readily and cheaply available to firms
990591 in the absence of collusive behavior the firms will compete in product quality improvements but will be less able to gain competitive advantage and improve profitability
990592 instead of becoming a source of lasting competitive edge most strategic information systems become new and essential aspects of doing business that is profits will be competed away since the key resources of management information systems mis applications are commodities available to all competitors all competitors with similar mis strategies can develop similar systems and benefits such as reduced costs or improved service
990593 foreign reserves fell in july mainly because the government and the central bank pledged on july 7 to work together to stem the wons loss against the u s dollar

990627 no longer to my embarrassment my cardio is the extreme opposite of high intensity training
990628 more than 80 percent of the dive injuries occurred from a dive height of less than or equal to one meter so that is not the highest dive this is usually from the lowest order or the edge of the pool
990629 this really suggests the need for increased prevention efforts to lower the risk of diving related injuries
990630 theres a lot that can be done to make diving a safer recreational activity or sport
990631 having a lifeguard or other supervision present is really important
990632 what is most interesting to me as a pediatrician with a mind for prevention is what may also be among the most predictable findings of the study that diving injury peaks substantially during the summer months and that boys are far more likely to be injured than girls
990633 the summer month exposure will surprise no one males are more affected by nearly all types of injury particularly unintentional injury
990634 we tend to teach children well to stay in the shallow end when they are small
990635 we do less of a good job teaching about the risks of diving or marking dive safe zones as they grow

990647 everyone is absolutely interested in striking the most aggressive deal possible
990648 its not about being moderate or rolling over in contract talks
990649 its about putting ourselves in the strongest position possible diplomacy is not weakness
990650 parents need accurate up to date information about drugs and guidance and how to cope when drug us becomes a problem
990651 they are getting younger i know nine and 10 year olds who go out and get stoned they see it as a bit of a laugh everyone aspires to be big drug dealers
990652 they need to have a better understanding they need to know what a bad trip is
990653 people have to wake up and smell the coffee drugs are part and parcel of young peoples lives
990654 we need to take the message about drugs and the dangers to schools we need to make it part of the curriculum it is part of our lives
990655 over the last two years in hertfordshire we have trained about 5 000 teachers and other staff
990656 i think drugs are very available and part of the work we do is about building resilience in children against drug misuse
990657 we need to re energize youngsters and support them in other hobbies
990658 the good news is that the majority of parents seem to have a sound basic knowledge
990659 the good news is that the majority of parents seem to have a sound basic knowledge of the dangers of drugs
990660 parents tell us they would like to feel more confident about their knowledge of drugs and drug taking and how to handle having the drugs conversation with their child
990661 parents need accurate up to date information about drugs and guidance and how to cope when drug us becomes a problem
990662 research has shown that cannabis is not the harmless little narcotic that we are led to believe it is
990663 the reclassification would seem to have made it harder rather than easier to enforce the law
990664 if cannabis were reclassified back to a class b drug everybody would know where they stand cannabis use would fall and police could return to arresting those who use illegal drugs
990665 research has shown that cannabis is not the harmless little narcotic that we are led to believe it is
990666 the whole idea is that we will be distributing one of these leaflets to the homes of everyone in bridlington who has a child between the ages of five and 17
990667 hopefully so the parents can identify what the drugs are and secondly that they can see what the physical symptoms are what they should be looking out for and what the dangers are
990668 our findings show that exposing rats to ecstasy at a time of prenatal development that correlates with the first trimester in humans results in lasting changes in brain chemistry and behaviour
990669 this research warrants the continued monitoring of children exposed to this drug
990670 anyone who is pregnant or is about to become pregnant should not take ecstasy or any other drug
990671 little is yet known about the effects of heavy long term use of ecstasy but there are increasing concerns about the possibility of mental health problems especially chronic depression and sustained memory loss
990672 these findings are particularly disturbing women are often unaware they are pregnant in the early stages and may continue to use
990673 research has shown that clubbers are more likely to take part in unsafe sex than other groups of people this increases the likelihood of accidental pregnancy and therefore intensifies the risk that the unborn baby will be exposed to ecstasy
990674 although research in rats should always be treated with caution when applying it to humans this study highlights the need for better awareness of the dangers of ecstasy and of safe sex measures
990675 people who said they had taken just half a tablet had high depression scores compared to people in the other groups
990676 i think it could be argued that people who take ecstasy are perhaps generally more depressed
990677 but i think this is unlikely simply because we did not see similar rates of depression in those who took other drugs
990678 there is a lot of data in animals showing that ecstasy damages the neurotransmitter for serotonin which is known to be involved in depression
990679 we think there may be a connection said ms taurah
990680 these trends seem to have established themselves rapidly across the eu
990681 the main reasons people say they consume ecstasy is to feel more pleasure when they dance and to have fun
990682 other recreational drugs are consumed to gain confidence or energy or in search of new experiences
990683 the consequences and risks of recreational consumption of drugs should be the object of scientific assessment
990684 the mind altering substance most frequently consumed for recreational purposes
990685 it is normal that young people will try drugs at least once
990686 heavier drinkers along with other drinkers tend to drink more when overall consumption increases
990687 at least one bottle of wine 25 centilitres of spirits or 4 pints of beer or more during one drinking occasion
990688 it is difficult not to agree with the suggestion that most irish people have more to fear from legal drugs and medicines than from illegal drugs
990689 it has been recognised for a considerable period of time that benzodiazepine anxiolytics and hypnotics can cause drug dependence when taken on a long term basis even in prescribed therapeutic doses
990690 would appear to be taking benzodiazepines on an ongoing basis
990691 a considerable proportion of patients who are initiated on benzodiazepines continue to take them for many years
990692 the vast body of research on the consequences of cannabis use does not lend itself to simple and easy conclusions
990693 cannabis use moderately increases the risk of psychotic symptoms in young people but has a much stronger effect in those with evidence of predisposition to psychosis
990694 cannabis use increases the risk of both the incidence of psychosis in psychosis free persons and a poor prognosis for those with an established vulnerability to psychotic disorder
990695 anecdotal reports suggest that the increase in cocaine use has been across the general population not just among existing problem drug users or confined to certain urban areas
990696 though small the numbers reporting cocaine use increased consistently indicating the early years of an epidemic
990697 does not mean that there was no use of that drug in the area although it is indicative of low levels of use
990698 there have been races this year where ive been in a position to challenge for victory but had something go wrong for me
990699 congratulations to heikki for his first and very well deserved grand prix win the race could have been better for me my start was okay but felipes was better and he managed to overtake me i managed to maintain the gap during the first stint and felt comfortable in the second stint because i was matching his times but was going to be running longer to the final stops i feel i could have had a go at passing him but the damaged tyre halted my progress i dont yet know what happened but at least i scored four points and maintained my lead in the championship so this result is not too bad for me
990700 one of the oldest motor racing phrases ever coined is to finish first first you have to finish
990701 lewiss race was compromised by his losing the lead at the start but we fuelled him long for the second stint and therefore believed he was well placed to leapfrog felipe in his final pitstop sadly for him though it wasnt to be damage to his front left tyre cost him that victory chance however from lewiss perspective as bad days go it could have been a lot worse but today was heikkis day and a very good day it was and everyone at vodafone mclaren mercedes is absolutely delighted for him

990707 to say that barack obama did not intentionally inject the idea of his name and his race is a lie
990708 doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills

990713 thirty percent of the increase in the price of oil is because of the decrease in the value of the dollar
990714 we believe that there is going to be a tremendous shift back to urban areas led by those who bought homes in the outlying areas who lose their homes to foreclosure they will choose to rent near work to save money
990715 the high price of gas is playing a very important part in home buyer decisions the phrase drive until you qualify has less meaning these days as each mile becomes more expensive
990716 you have money and media access and now everybody believes that 2 2 22
990717 it shows that our climate system has the ability to make very abrupt changes all by itself
990718 of all races in an advanced stage of civilization the american is the least accessible to long views always and everywhere in a hurry to get rich he does not give a thought to remote consequences he sees only present advantages he does not remember he does not feel he lives in a materialist dream
990719 i think the strength of our team is at point
990720 we had four outstanding point guards to make the decision on
990721 jasons in there to get us off and going set the pace and set the tempo
990722 comparing chris paul two years ago and now is apples and oranges
990723 hes one of our great penetrators and hes done a great job in these games of getting into the gaps and finding guys
990724 hes always been talented his game has gotten better but i think the maturity factor has kicked in even more this year
990725 i dont mind that it gives these guys more time to get international experience and also be in different situations so thats good
990726 because hes the ultimate player and he shares his knowledge well and i think every guy on the team appreciates it none more than chris and deron
990727 to do something that has a big budget a great scope with a great director and great actors that has the quality and level of writing and the level of production design is a once in a lifetime opportunity

990735 the city has accomplished a lot but reality is setting in
990736 with a tax base like ours we are not being able to on our own keep up with expenses
990737 our ability to be as aggressive as we have been is being compromised
990738 revenue is falling below what we need to maintain infrastructure and it needs to change
990739 the council needs to find additional funding thats about as un rude as i can say it
990740 we need to educate the city council and citizens on what the issue will mean
990741 this is the kind of stuff thats gonna save us over there
990742 its a new type of war and were trying to get everyone up to speed on what the dangers are how to roll how to keep an eye on each other how to react to certain events
990743 when you look at the mrap and our technology we have things deployed in the field that can defeat just about anything he puts against us but the word of caution is this the enemy is smart
990744 its pretty accurate as far as your need to have your intervals your distance between the vehicles
990745 but its a video game in real convoys you have that sense of adrenaline still its the best we can do without sending lead downrange
990746 probably not every day but close to it but you gotta train and train and train until it becomes second nature
990747 its really nice until morning then it can get too cold
990748 i dont know if its really a story or more of a few events coupled together that served as sort of a catalyst to my involvement
990749 thats the ambulance i called for you because you said you were dying
990750 whats wrong with you you ignorant f ing c k sucking b tard a hole of a stinking c t
990751 well the next time youre drunk dont say youre dying because this ambulance is going to take you an emergency room they are going to stick an enormous needle in your arm and take some blood out of you they have to do that to see if the contents of your blood are in fact on the verge of killing you
990752 then they are going to shove a hose down your throat and pump out your stomach and after that things get quite unpleasant
990753 stop wallowing it makes it harder to be around you than it usually is
990754 i mean i saw my friends get blown up on the battlefield who are you to tell me
990755 my life has a light purple background full of silver shiny stars
990756 your folks say that you should be left alone on a mountaintop
990757 for the last forty years our thought has been trapped in hollow structures of language a stale dead but immensely successful rhetoric this has represented in my view a defeat of the intelligence and of the will
990758 this indictment proves that the government was never interested in any information that dr al arian has on the iiit i e the international institute of islamic thought matter
990759 they have indicted him despite the fact that the prosecutors admitted that he is a minor witness in the iiit investigation and he has already given two detailed statements under oath to the government and offered to take a polygraph examination to prove that he has given true information about his knowledge of iiit dr al arian has addressed every document cited by the government as the reason for his being called before the grand jury he has shown that he has no incriminating information to offer against either iiit or its officers

990766 barack obamas latest attack ads shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy
990767 after all it was senator obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
990768 reading all the tributes that have poured in one is struck by two things first is that bills life was a vivid refutation of the notion that great men dont make a difference in history second was his personal decency graciousness and warmth that is why so many of the tributes have been not only of respect but of love
990769 drug disasters are literally built into the current system of drug testing and approvals in the united states
990770 recent changes in the system have only increased the proportion of new drugs with serious risks
990771 based on our current system the designation of safe and effective on todays new drugs could be replaced with apparently safe based on incomplete information and more effective than a placebo
990772 with working memory youre just keeping it active until you use it
990773 thats the test where we really saw the most striking effects with estradiol
990774 rats treated with estradiol are definitely a lot more active and make a lot more lever presses
990775 women take them thinking theyll be a safe alternative to hormone replacement therapy and they might help hot flashes
990776 our study found that several cm types are used by nearly half of cancer survivors
990777 surprisingly other methods such as acupuncture and hypnosis were used by fewer than 2 of cancer survivors even though recent studies found them to be useful in relieving some cancer related symptoms such as pain we also found that the use of various cm types is significantly influenced by gender race age education cancer type and how far the cancer had spread
990778 spiritual work is not something you can copy from someone elses homework and get the same result their homework is specific to their spiritual needs not yours its like attending an aerobics class to slim down others may be doing the same or similar moves in different bodies but if you dont move yourself you wont gain the benefits you can observe others moving all you want but if you dont put your own energy into it nothings going to happen for you

990782 russia may take a decision about its military presence on cuba in response to the amd deployment if america deploys its amd systems closely to our border russia can also deploy its systems on the territories of the states which will accept it
990783 is ready to cooperate with russia in civil branches but its unlikely to be in favor of resuming military cooperation especially after the incident with lurdes in 2001 russias military base was quickly closed despite the cuban partys protest
990784 this guy made it i may not have an mba from columbia or anything but i have a passion for it
990785 we turned to virtualization because our data center faces a constant need to add more servers while also being limited by the physical space available without expensive expansion
990786 while it took us one year to get our high availability site up and running sungard came in and had our virtual recovery site ready to go in three weeks for our mission critical applications this experience demonstrates the value companies looking at virtualized recovery solutions can gain by tapping sungards expertise rather than handling internally
990787 server virtualization will dramatically change the it recovery services model for both the services provider and the customer with replication to a shared storage infrastructure and a virtualized server infrastructure customers can enjoy improved recovery time and recovery point objectives without the cost of dedicated and custom recovery solutions from the dr service provider
990788 the achilles heel of most virtualized it environments is that they rely on a single data center to facilitate system failover should an event occur
990789 a recovery strategy with no off site data may mean quite possibly no recovery virtual server replication services provides organizations an affordable way to have access to a secondary data center for protection of physical and virtual it environments

990803 the kind of change obama would bring makes us more of a part of some global mushy middle of the ground sic milquetoast world in which america loses its sovereignty and distinction
990804 i dont think hes the antichrist but there is a spirit of antichrist at work in the west in a very strong and open way that is leading people to want to solve their problems and have a desire to have their lives improved without christ thats what the spirit of antichrist does it denies christ
990805 is to broaden the base by returning to the principles and values that reflect the principles and values of middle america love of country love of god support for a strong but seldom deployed military and a yearning for personal freedom rather than dependency on government
990806 world problems spiritual emptiness self serving leadership extreme poverty pandemic diseases and rampant illiteracy conspire to

990816 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think that their child is a healthy weight
990817 this move isnt about pointing the finger and telling parents that their children are overweight instead it is about equipping parents with the information they need to help their children live healthier lives
990818 i find this whole approach from the department of health a bit prissy and namby pamby
990819 the americans have gone back to using the term because its the kind of shock word that makes parents sit up and take notice
990820 the department of health admits in its guidance that bmi is the best and most practical way to assess whether a child is overweight or obese but then denies parents the actual figures for their children because they say it could be confusing for some
990821 some parents may find the bmi growth charts confusing and may need someone to explain what they show
990822 we want parents to easily understand the results without the need for further explanation and that is why the sliding scale bar will be used
990823 parents need to be educated about the dangers of obesity and obesity related conditions such as type 2 diabetes

990845 seven people have died due to diarrhoea in this village in the past 24 hours due to lack of medical facilities around 18 to 20 people have died in the past one week the government is doing nothing about it
990846 i have come here for the fifth time in the last one week there is no hygiene here last time when i had come here i explained to them what all they are supposed to do those suffering from diarrhoea are undergoing fluid transfusion there is no staff here

990880 john mccains extended circle is divided on whether he should announce his running mate in the immediate days ahead but the republican is more likely to wait for barack obama to announce his choice first according to advisers by waiting to make a major announcement in the window after obamas much anticipated acceptance speech august 28 at invesco field and before he receives his partys nomination the following week for example mccain would be able to quickly shift the focus of the race following the democratic convention

990900 i have not yet decided if i will participate in the 1 500m only or in both the 800m and the 1500m events a lot will depend on how i adapt to the climate smog and time difference the namibia olympic committee has entered me for both events but my focus will be on the 1 500m for which i will target a place in the final
990901 as this is my last olympics as an athlete and i narrowly missed the final in athens by 1 100 of a second in the 800m i hope i can do better this time

990912 im really looking forward to a new challenge and im happy this contract with team csc saxo bank has fallen into place there have been several potential teams but this was my first choice i still have lots to learn and i think this is the right place to do it i already know a lot of the riders on the team and have seen how they take care of each individual rider and thats what nailed it for me in the end i feel quite humble about joining such a big team and i dont think it would be right for me to announce all sorts of big ambitions at this stage first of all im just looking forward to racing for the best cycling team in the world

990931 i can tell you that i remain undisturbed about reports that i am being investigated by the efcc there is nothing wrong for someone to stand up and write a petition but the question is what are the facts of such petition when you have people who have adopted the art of petition writings for the past 15 years or so you can then understand that they are doing what they are used to rather than justifying their actions
990932 i have not been invited by the efcc even though i have heard that the commission has received petitions from certain persons i dont see anything wrong in that since we are under a democratic government
990933 since the nullification of my election by the court i have taken time to reflect on my actions and my vision

990945 leadership is all about vision and where you want to take the people to over one year since the yaradua government came into being there has been no policy direction and very soon the government will refocus its energy towards the 2011 elections the failure of this government is a failure of the leadership to provide a roadmap to its ministers
990946 as the president confirmed in his may day television interview there was need for time to enable the presidency have a fair opportunity of assessing the ministers eight or nine months were not enough for ministers to perform and so the president felt it was right to allow people have fair chance to prove themselves two years is not a bad time frame
990947 it would not be in the interest of government to sack some of its ministers on non performance when it is clear that no one knows what will happen at the apex court so the need to maintain a united team that would act in unison in the event of annulment of the election by the court this might be a strong reason why the presidency is still tolerating the present fec membership

990968 another thing to think about with the other 90 is that some of them dont want to be found
990969 even though we hosted a solidworks user group meeting here at
990970 ive tried to get to people by forwarding helpful resources out of those couple dozens times i dont think anybody actually went to the blog or forum and starting looking for the info themselves
990971 i have no problem with animals but shouldnt we spend our resources on another issue like domestic violence or prison reform
990972 i love pets and all but our priorities are clearly out of whack
990973 this is the sort of all too common police violence and overreaction towards people of color that happens all the time
990974 its ironic that we were celebrating the work of an organization that specifically opposes state violence against marginalized communities and we experienced a police attack at our celebration
990975 we are outraged and demand that our community members be released and the police be held accountable for unnecessary use of excessive force and falsely arresting people
990976 im extremely concerned and disappointed by the 9th precincts response to the situation and how it escalated into violence this kind of aggressive behavior doesnt do them any good in community police relations

990980 what drew me to this role was every aspect of the production
990981 the writing i found to be astounding the group of people who are creating the show and then the cast they were assembling and theres an energy to it which i love from having done theater and having made films that shoot quickly
990982 the degree of intimacy that they enjoy sometimes with the people theyre advising or healing whatever you would call it
990983 and how specific and personal they are with their approach how different each person is even down to the way they lay out their office and whether there are private things in the room that they work in or not
990984 theyre very specific about what it requires what good therapy requires and psychology and about it involving emotional intensity and of course as actors were very drawn to people who are emotionally intense because thats how we work so there are some parallels there just in terms of focus that are interesting
990985 i think just the idea that you want to lay the foundations well
990986 thats always the thing from the beginning like alfre woodard her co star said that you turn up here you are whatever age you are youve had a life and that you need to know quite clearly what you are in order to have the story continued from there and be surprised
990987 my stuff has been gentle so far because norah is a slow birth so im budding up gently which is good

991027 to suggest that everton football club will suddenly and dramatically open its arms to any would be investor or buyer should the destination kirkby project be given a governmental green light is totally mischievous and wholly misleading simply because our chairman bill kenwright has made it clear at each and every agm going back five years that he will continue to sit down and discuss the clubs future with any individual or group which boasts integrity and financial clout
991028 bill has often said that premier league football has become a game not for multi millionaires but for billionaires and that pertinent analysis still holds true
991029 bill has never attempted to hide the fact that he personally does not have the funds to move his club forward to where he and the supporters want it to be and to where they believe it should be at the forefront of the english game
991030 self evidently any club which can boast a stadium which is modern fit for purpose and capable of expansion does represent a more attractive proposition to potential investors
991031 logic therefore dictates that if we do find a new home efc would as a club which has finished inside the top six on three occasions in recent years be a more attractive proposition to investors

991081 murphys play was inspired by a newspaper clipping about the queens trip to ireland during which victorias laundry was in fact sent out to be washed at the magdalene asylum an institution designed to reform prostitutes by having them process laundry all day
991082 the quanes laundry the word quane meant to portray the irish peasantry pronunciation of queen focuses on one womans story nellie clifton who after 39 years living at the laundry finally comes clean about the incident that landed her there a scandalous affair with the queens eldest son bertie eventually to be known as king edward vii
991083 in real life nellie clifton an irish actress did indeed have a scandalous affair with the future king of england the compelling story line involving the queens laundry was conjured from murphys imagination
991084 amid the play version of the scandal emerges a story of a poor irish girl born during
991085 innocent nellie through a twist of fate ends up in berties bed and is sent off as punishment to the magdalenes at age 22 where she spends the rest of her life
991086 so naturally murphy sees winning the nightgown as providence luck of the irish if you must
991087 luck or godsend murphy feels she was meant to own the nightgown just as she was meant to write this particular play
991088 thats what i told my husband it was meant to be of course all day long after winning the auction friends were calling to ask if id managed to pick him up off the floor yet murphy said of the aftershocks of the pricey peignoir
991089 pre auction estimates for all three royal garments auctioned by hansons auctioneers were so low murphy fully expected to bid on and win all three items a chemise a pair of bloomers and the nightgown
991090 my husband and i thought wouldnt that be lovely for my play
991091 murphy said during the six months she spent writing the play she found a unique way to connect with the spirit of the deceased monarch
991092 i only dressed in black queen victoria was in mourning for most of her life and i felt better and more comfortable wearing black when i was writing the play in the evening by candlelight murphy said
991093 shes already made progress toward her goal of seeing her play produced through recent connections made with some irish actors in new york city who are coming here next week to read through the play
991094 she has enjoyed the creative process and is optimistic that her compelling story and juicy dialogue will be enough to propel her play from obscurity to who knows says murphy maybe the big screen
991095 now i expect your throat should be a little bit sore from screaming
991096 britney before you go theres something i want you to have
991097 but i thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean in the end

991101 the best thing is getting to hang out with everyone and being able to perform in front of a live audience of thousands of people but the downside is trying to work on the album when you have so little time
991102 its great to feel the energy of the crowd but the hard part is being in a different city every night
991103 i had fun designing it and i wanted to do something more bohemian and summery
991104 when people talk about my style im like what style

991112 new york courts have a proud history of interpreting the new york constitution as providing greater protections for individual rights than the federal constitution this case presents an opportunity to continue that tradition by declaring that the new york constitution prohibits the government from seizing private homes simply to turn them over to a developer who covets them for a massive luxury condominium project
991113 we are confident that the court will see this for what it is government officials bending to the will of bruce ratner allowing him to wield the power of eminent domain for his personal financial benefit

991158 how can one of the most prominent yeshivos that educates tens of thousands of kids know they have a molester destroying peoples lives how can they continue with him hows that possible well we are going to stop him okay we are going to stop that from happening period but thats not the point the point is what is their thinking where is their religiosity and their commitment
991159 is there anyone out there who accepts abuse of children this mother tried to do things in a beautiful way and they betrayed her son again they just hoped she would go away her son felt maybe i accomplished something maybe i got rid of this skunk then he finds that a person who is sick and who should never be with children again is back on his job how do you face g d now how do you pray in the morning
991160 my office is devoted to this we are asking people to come forward we have staff working on this we are building cases and cases and cases the stories that i have heard this week all from our communities from lakewood to monsey to borough park to flatbush
991161 you know i gotta tell you you ask me how are you i must be honest i have not been okay since last shabbos night since doing this show because it affects me profoundly to listen to listen and to listen and you know whats putting a dagger through my heart its that people are more interested in protecting the perpetrator than dealing with the victim thats the part thats putting a dagger through my heart and soul
991162 im quite excited about being able to have my say and getting stuck in
991163 weve stayed there quite regularly and heard about this so thought wed give it a go
991164 we felt we could offer something back to the resort by being on the team
991165 i would like an addition of a terror towers style scary ride in the castle they already have in which a lift free falls through the castle through all these different zones like the twilight zone
991166 or they could utilise the ruins of alton towers itself for maybe a ghost themed roller coaster
991167 paul loves big rides but i dont really like them and i think there are a lot of people like me who would like more things like water rides and the rapids
991168 following an intensive application process alton towers has selected the six families who will help them to shape the future of the resort
991169 winners will shortly be rewarded with an annual pass for the alton towers resort giving unlimited access to the theme park for a whole year
991170 plus they will be treated to a one night stay in one of the two fabulously themed hotels
991171 following an intensive application process alton towers has selected the six families who will help them to shape the future of the resort
991172 winners will shortly be rewarded with an annual pass for the alton towers resort giving unlimited access to the theme park for a whole year

991174 winners will shortly be rewarded with an annual pass for the alton towers resort giving unlimited access to the theme park for a whole year
991175 we love the park and want to offer everyone the best experience
991176 this month we have set a priority of positive activities for children and young people and we are trying to engage with young people
991177 a day trip to alton towers would be funded providing that they behave during the summer they may well be taken off the list if they are seen drinking alcohol we will be targeting certain individuals within the community that we feel the need to engage with people who are potentially at a borderline stage of drinking and being out on the streets at night
991178 i would far rather reward good behaviour than punish bad the police and youth service are working together to engage some of the young people who may not have other things to do during the holidays
991179 this is an extremely good idea and i hope that it is taken up across the country and particularly across the borough
991180 it will teach young people that if you do something positive it is not all doom and gloom this would be a reward to show gratitude as it is not always about punishing them for misdemeanors
991181 i always think it is a good idea to engage young people in community activities and reward them with something they will appreciate
991182 i think this is a brilliant idea for norden if they want peace and quiet give the youngsters an incentive the hope has to be that when they have been to alton towers they dont fall back to their old ways

991197 if the book we are reading does not wake us as with a fist hammering on our skull why then do we read it so that it shall make us happy good god we would also be happy if we had no books and such books as make us happy we could if need be write ourselves but what we must have are those books which come upon us like ill fortune and distress us deeply like the death of one we love better than ourselves like suicide a book must be an ice axe to break the sea frozen inside of us

991203 in an urgent memo sent to gop members and staff saturday
991204 pointe claire councillors and i have a duty to spend public funds seriously
991205 the original media coverage relating to my expenses was inaccurate and many of the news stories were misleading in the extreme
991206 we will not allow pointe claires excellent reputation to be maligned by inaccurate reporting
991207 our characters are like us parts of the show are similar to our lives to a certain extent we feel blessed to be doing something we love with someone we love
991208 one woman told me her four year old sat still for two hours
991209 it seems to me that the boy got out of the hospital
991210 the girl was transferred to the hospital because she is fractured severely and had complications on her lower body
991211 the younger kids the teenagers would not be up at that time
991212 its really sad that this would happen in our city i think the family must be in a lot of pain right now
991213 the first thing im thinking about is what the family is going through
991214 the naa has received reports that three pools were broken into robbed and suffered extensive damages
991215 in the middle of the night i dont think we could install people or barbed wire around the fence of the swimming pool
991216 i would say this summer weve seen less of it just because of the lower temperature
991217 the proposal to install sidewalks is a permanent and irreversible action and an urban jungle concept that violates the essential character of our tranquil green community
991218 it is proposed because there is a lot of pedestrian traffic and 2 000 cars per day on creswell there is the potential for enough conflicts
991219 were all concerned about safety but there are other ways to solve this issue
991220 the relative absence of sidewalks is part of the attractiveness of the community
991221 the average speed of cars going through the stop sign was 27 km h its dangerous
991222 people driving on berwick will assume people going west on creswell will stop and it could cause an accident
991223 drivers are not respecting the signs so lets remove them
991224 thats not a reason for taking away stop signs why not an awareness campaign
991225 if they dont enforce the law then no one is going to pay attention
991226 we cant always count on the police getting there enforcement only works for a while
991227 theres room on the survey for comments and we will review the survey in september

991239 i think its fantastic that we have shows going on friday saturday and sunday i think there is a lot more awareness and enthusiasm about the event
991240 it was a huge success the weather co operated and it was great for local merchants and restaurants
991241 its a great experience forming a band and playing your favourite songs
991242 ive grown so much as a musician you really learn the dynamics of playing with different people
991243 most girls arent in to this kind of stuff but were treated like rockers
991244 i like camps where you can do what you love
991245 right now all of our clients are anglophones but we are looking to expand to a camp downtown where we can always hire whatever staff we need
991246 we also have plans to expand to toronto and ottawa
991247 i feel kind of a responsibility since im the one on council with the most relevant experience
991248 we might be able to know by late late fall where were going and then we obviously will put that out there for people and well have reactions from people thats an essential part of it
991249 i understand very well the issue that when people live next to a project it has more importance to them
991250 i would give additional weight to people who have to suffer the consequences
991251 my feeling is any project we do must improve the neighbourhood not make it worse so if there are current problems with traffic parking noise etc then lets see how this proposed project can help improve the situation and not make it worse i think its an opportunity to look at throwing those problems into the pot and coming out with a better solution than we have now apparently
991252 were not tying the hands of consultants that were hiring now
991253 were not asking for a president to answer his own e mail
991254 were asking for a president who understands the context of what e mail means
991255 it was a part of a peaceful revolution for guys like me
991256 christy moore was almost a mentor to me in that i followed his musical path
991257 one day my ma kicked van out of our garage for making too much noise
991258 london was a springboard to what im doing here now
991259 the first place i was taken to in montreal was the old dublin pub
991260 i was amazed at these guys who sang with phony irish accents
991261 new irish pubs like mckibbins and ye olde orchard were opening
991262 i arrived at a time when there was a wave of interest in all things celtic i was playing gigs five nights a week
991263 i was backed by a whole bunch of native drummers playing deerskin and buffalo hide drums
991264 vroeger waren de kroketten iets te vast vanbinnen en knack vond dat ze iets smeu iger mochten zijn
991265 more delinquencies look like they are on the horizon because so few of them have reset
991266 i saw a little girl in tears she was looking for her parents
991267 the religion of the indian aboriginal outside assam should be regarded as a religion of the hindu family with a special relation to the exciting dangerous catastrophic shivaite type but as having a distinct existence of its own for purposes of the census all aboriginals should be classed as hindus by religion but separate returns of their numbers by race should be provided much resentment has been caused by official missionary and even scientific attempts to separate the tribesmen from the hindus on religious grounds and some of the hostility to the census classified tribal religion as animist later the expression followers of tribal religion was used the test proposed was to ask a person whether he worshipped hindu or tribal gods
991268 this distinction was meaningless on the one hand the aboriginal is always willing to worship a few more gods if by doing so he can gain some material or social benefit on the other the hindu has no objection to including tribal gods in a pantheon of thirty three crores of deities among the gonds bhera pen is easily translated into bara deo and then to maha deo it is hard to understand why the census of india continues to record statistics of religion which everyone knows are scientifically valueless and are used or misused only for political purposes
991269 are there or have there been human tribes so low in culture as to have no religious conception whatever
991270 the savages poor shy gods hide in holes and corners before the white mans mightier deity now it is not denied in abstract that prereligious tribes may have existed or still exist but i am bound to say that if they exist they must be found among extinct ancient tribes or imperfectly described modern ones
991271 they have some curious customs the mikirs sacrifice chickens goats and pigs to the demons to gain their favor and to keep them from harm they believe in both good and evil spirits but sacrifice more to the evil spirits as they think they can cause them sickness failure of crops and all sorts of trouble
991272 the mikirs our nearest hill tribe are demon worshippers and sacrifice chickens goats and pigs to the demons to gain their favor
991273 the manly spirit of the mikir is not easily persuaded to yield servile homage to either priest or idol idols are an abomination to them they worship only the unseen
991274 the most interesting tribes in assam they have no respect for the hindu religion and are a mild quiet industrious race they very much resemble the karens
991275 the mikirs living in the mikir hills in the areas in the north and east of khasi and jaintia hill tracts and in the sibsagar district number 154 893 1961 census and they do not have any special or distinctive culture of their own except participating in a common tibeto burman way of living
991276 he should extend to tribal religion that attitude of sincere respect which we are trying to give to tribal life and institutions generally he should never on any account criticize or laugh at any tribal ceremony or belief sometimes the work of a well trained higher officer may be completely undone by the ignorant folly of a clerk or a jawan should he be present at any tribal ceremony he should show the same reverence that he would show in a christian church or a hindu temple he should be careful how he talks and about the words he uses let us banish such expressions as superstition heathen devil dance in relation to religion just as we are trying to avoid generally such words as backward uplift and other patronizing expressions we should not speak of animism but of the wancho religion or the adi religion which will suggest that the tribal faith has for its adherents just as much authority and dignity as the faith of the outside world
991277 be defeatist of the tribal religion it is worthy of preservation that contains the seeds of growth
991278 but a careful study of tribal religion both in nefa and elsewhere does not suggest that it is noticeably inferior to its competitors it has its drawbacks it is not fully thought out there are many problems to which it has no answer but as a working way of life it brings consolation to its adherents and gives them hope and courage
991279 saitan or satan are the same but there is hardly any possible explanation to draw a parallel between the karbi
991280 unity in duality among the greeks and the samkhya branch of indian philosophy the
991281 ancestral cults are significantly more likely to be found in societies organized on the basis of clans or lineages than in societies not so organized
991282 within the fold of the lamaist church the soul has to be conducted to its future abode a service which is also a characteristic function of the shaman
991283 is ascribed amongst many peoples of central and north asia to the theft or the straying of the soul from the body of the patient in such a case the efforts of the shaman are devoted to locating and capturing the soul and then reintegrating it within the body which it belongs alternatively sickness may be ascribed to the intrusion of a magical object into the body or as appears clearly in several mongolian texts from the possession of the patient by evil spirit
991284 when a mikir man dies the family keeps his remains in the house and until they can get friends and relatives together and the necessary food for a feast they thus sometimes keep the body for weeks while preparing for the feast after the feast they cremate the body the same as the hindus
991285 sex and its folklore are far more interesting more valuable and more important in every social and historical sense than for instance the balladry of murder cruelty torture treachery baby killing and so forth
991286 its a tumor or its a deerfly bite on my jawbone
991287 the egyptian suspect muhammad mukhlis shamsuddin has claimed that mr havering was trying to sexually harass him
991288 he says he stabbed mr havering in an attempt to defend himself
991289 we are doing medical reports to see if the claims are true
991290 i didnt know him very long maybe others knew him better but he was a typical englishman with a good sense of humour very gentle and a good father i think everyone working with him had respect for his professionalism and politeness
991291 it is an affront for the radio hall of fame to honour james dobson a right wing demagogue
991292 our only criterion is the number of years in the business
991293 hes dobson been broadcasting more than 15 years on more than 3 000 stations hes qualified
991294 im joining the gay pride canal parade on behalf of the entire coalition
991295 the gay pride is a public event where people show they are gay or lesbian and are proud of being so
991296 it is important for the government to show it shares that pride
991297 we encourage people to dare to be themselves and live the way they want
991298 we are keen to support them with that and the ministrys boat at the parade aims to make that support visible
991299 in some urban neighbourhoods its to do with youths from an islamic background who are encouraged by the notion that homosexuality is morally repugnant
991300 this is extremely worrying when i talk about this at schools it is shocking to hear how some young people think and talk about this
991301 so a lot remains to be done and not only at urban schools queer bashing is something all kinds of youths do after drinking all around the country
991302 the artisan radar is a sophisticated world class system which will significantly improve the flow and quality of information to commanders compared with existing technology
991303 it will allow our ships to detect track and aid the identification of a range of threats from the air and surface in difficult conditions
991304 the new radar will replace existing systems on our type 23 frigates landing ships hms albion and hms bulwark and the assault helicopter carrier hms ocean as well as on our two new aircraft carriers hms queen elizabeth and hms prince of wales
991305 this is a prime example of the type of hi tech equipment that we are investing in to improve the ability of our commanders to operate in the 21st century
991306 although it mimics a bumblebee this is a true robber fly within the order diptera they feed on bees wasps grasshoppers other flies and even some spiders

991337 but the support that i have received is fantastic so i am just really looking forward to the time that i have got in tralee now
991338 i never actually read the comments i wouldnt go out of my way to go and read it the views that they have are not indicative and i wouldnt waste my time reading what they have to say

991342 i suppose thats why it was a bit of a shock that i have reached 27 years of age without experiencing any racisit abuse
991343 i find it horrifying that anybody can be threatened purely for entering the rose of tralee contest because of her family background

991440 only celebrities like barack obama go to the gym three times a day demand met rx chocolate roasted peanut protein bars and bottles of a hard to find organic brew black forest berry honest tea and worry about the price of arugula

991442 typically the candidates cabin is like business class roomier and less chaotic than the staff and press areas but still short of the accoutrements of a pro teams charter

991452 the most important thing we have in this life is our self respect and im not going to trade mine for anyones vote or for any office im going to tell you what i believe and let the chips fall where they will
991453 the contempt that many mccain aides hold for barack obama rivals the contempt that mccain held for mitt romney a year ago
991454 john needs to be the deliberate experienced veteran and not the grumpy old man
991455 if hes the grumpy old man angry that the media is not in love with him anymore because theyre in love with barack obama thats not going to play well with the public
991456 why do i even have to run against this guy
991457 although i seem to tolerate introspection better the older i am there are still too many claims on my attention to permit more than the briefest excursions down the path of self awareness when i am no longer busy with politics and with my own ambitions i hope to have more time to examine what i have done and failed to do with my career and why
991458 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
991459 is this going to result in a kind of blessed censorship of a whole host of areas of medical care and research

991464 not only did we play the race card we dealt it from the bottom of the deck
991465 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
991466 you know both candidates gave major policy speeches today and we should be talking about those not this snitty back and forth over race
991467 i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest
991468 some in washington are still saying no to drilling in america
991469 so the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question
991470 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago and if you dont think youre better off do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
991471 he has certainly im sure said things in town halls
991472 since they dont have any new ideas the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me theyre going to try to say that im a risky guy theyre going to try to say well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills and and theyre going to send out nasty emails
991473 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
991474 we hit another low note every day from this campaign
991475 observers from across the country including some prominent republicans are questioning the tone of senator mccains campaign this is not the john mccain americans thought they were seeing
991476 all it take is a little dip in the polls for john mccain to cast aside his values
991477 how bad does john mccain want to avoid talking about real issues

991694 i dont really get why bitchy jones is the de facto standard of what a dominant woman is she is just one person writing about fucking her stable why not just live and let live
991695 her ranting style detracts from any serious points that she may be trying to make it all sounds like sour grapes to me
991696 it is rather frustrating when she is being discussed on tv as having such an influential and well read blog and yet has such narrow minded opinions
991697 i do not think that bj is a dominant i do not think that bj is a woman and it really does not matter to me whatever bjs blog might have been worth has disappeared over the term of the blog it has devolved the same way that the news media has it is all about attention and shock bj is just another sanctimonious attention whore
991698 im not particularly impressed by anything shes written but to each their own im sure there are guys wanking to it at this moment
991699 personally i find bitchy jones more annoying than elise sutton
991700 i could have agreed with and even sympathized with bitchy jones had she just refrained from the cheap shots and the insinuations that attractive pro dommes are fake undominant money grubbing bimbos
991701 her rants about the word domme strap ons and feminization are just annoying
991702 the profanity while plenty gratuitous lacks any sense of appreciation for the art
991703 im not up in her business telling her shes not a real dominant because shes not hot so why is she trying to say that people like me who are attractive pro dommes are just a male manufactured joke
991704 ill shut this damn thread down if this stupid bitchy jones shit gets started again lol the name alone screams koo koo

991713 more than 80 percent of the dive injuries occurred from a dive height of less than or equal to one meter so that is not the highest dive this is usually from the lowest order or the edge of the pool
991714 this really suggests the need for increased prevention efforts to lower the risk of diving related injuries
991715 theres a lot that can be done to make diving a safer recreational activity or sport
991716 having a lifeguard or other supervision present is really important
991717 what is most interesting to me as a pediatrician with a mind for prevention is what may also be among the most predictable findings of the study that diving injury peaks substantially during the summer months and that boys are far more likely to be injured than girls
991718 the summer month exposure will surprise no one males are more affected by nearly all types of injury particularly unintentional injury
991719 we tend to teach children well to stay in the shallow end when they are small
991720 we do less of a good job teaching about the risks of diving or marking dive safe zones as they grow
991721 this study shows that immunotherapy is safe and well tolerated and could ultimately be beneficial for this high risk population
991722 we now know that the immune system of patients recovering from chemotherapy is malleable so we just need to find the best immunological approach to exploit this window of opportunity

992003 a lapse in terms of the quality control of yahoos keyword list
992004 no matter how sophisticated you make these automated systems youre not going to make them perfect and all you can really strive for is to tune them as you go along
992005 its pretty clear there was a lapse in terms of the quality control of yahoos keyword list
992006 leverages a combination of algorithmic and editorial processes to identify current relevant and popular terms
992007 we are really only in the infancy of this kind of automated analysis
992008 im sure its going to be expanding greatly not just in volume but in sophistication
992009 the quality of the content and the information is paramount
992010 you want to make sure youre striking the right balance between giving your readers everything the web has to offer with making sure theyre getting the right information and the relevant information
992011 if it does succeed its going to be done in a way thats subtle enough that its there for people who want it
992012 but its not going to be intrusive for people who dont

992015 these are neuro transmitters that promote a feeling of well being their levels are raised by regular exercise
992016 when they are released they make you feel relaxed free the mind and reduce anxiety and stress

992018 exercise also pumps more blood and oxygen and clears out metabolytes waste products in the brain
992019 getting fitter will help mr brown think faster on his feet
992020 there is a lot more pressure these days for politicians to look better turned out
992021 you only have to look at how barak obama has raised the game he looks so calm and well put together
992022 then theres frances president nicolas sarkozy out jogging and vladimir putins bare chest
992023 in comparison gordon brown is a big guy and he could look fitter
992024 at the moment mr brown looks stiff and flustered and as though he might come apart under pressure compare this with how david cameron looked on his beach photo opportunity
992025 i know it had been set up but cameron looked relaxed and comfortable brown in contrast looks stressed and that comes across as surly
992026 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things unseen
992027 well these ideas were part of a larger notion a vision if you will of america herself an america not only rich in opportunity for the individual but an america too of strong families and vibrant neighborhoods an america whose divergent but harmonizing communities were a reflection of a deeper community of values the value of work of family of religion and of the love of freedom that god places in each of us and whose defense he has entrusted in a special way to this nation
992028 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
992029 i made a general point about the fact that we need to provide the american people some relief and that there has been constructive conversations between republicans and democrats in the senate on this issue
992030 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
992031 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and offshore drilling
992032 its another example of short term political posturing from washington not the long term leadership we need to solve our dependence on oil
992033 it was a surprise to say the least that posh is into hiking
992034 shes rarely seen out of tight fitting designer dresses let alone hiking gear
992035 it would be interesting to see whether she wears hiking boots but then she once wore high heels for playing baseball so perhaps she goes on long walks in the california wilderness in her louboutin heels
992036 good for them if they are getting out in the fresh air
992037 she has just been having two small pots a day sometimes with rice
992038 she has been able to relax her super strict diet and eat and drink more of what she likes such as green tea ice cream and her all time favourite champagne victoria has already noticed a difference even though she has only eaten it for a couple of weeks
992039 she feels much more chilled out now and the extra pounds make her look so healthy
992040 some people cant help being thin some people cant help being fat
992041 shes trying not to get too nervous as she knows this wont help but its becoming more and more of a concern
992042 theyd definitely try clomid if they really had to but theyre hoping not to resort to that victorias main worry with having twins is can she pull it off looking as glamorous in a maxi dress as the likes of victoria 34 is reported to be 5 4 and weight 110lbs 7 stone 12lbs

992044 with games like ours you get much more controversy when you add motion controls like you saw with manhunt 2
992045 we have weapons like chainsaws satchel charges stuff like that
992046 i can definitely see people having a problem and outcry towards that because it does actually feel like youre using weapons that way
992047 in manhunt it feels like youre hacking at somebody though i suppose that was a bit more over the top than our game was but yeah i definitely think youd get criticism for that in our game gta and crackdown

992050 what is fascinating about thomas pag s is the fact that he ventured onto the freestyle ramps just three years ago and is now competing against the best international stars in this class
992051 the silver medal he won in the best trick contest at the motox world championship in san diego is a fine example of the progress he has shown lately all observers say he is very spectacular i think the fans will appreciate his duels against other competitors especially against the more experienced beno t milot who is certainly quite at ease competing at the olympic stadium

992060 the colleges we chose this year had to meet two criteria
992061 first they had to meet our standards for academic excellence within their region second we had to be able to survey their students anonymously either through our online survey or through our paper survey which we distribute and collect on campus
992062 we avoided using any sort of mathematical calculations or formulas to determine which colleges and universities to include in this feature for each region we aim to provide an inclusive mix of colleges large and small public and private all male and all female historically black colleges and universities science and technology focused institutions nontraditional colleges highly selective colleges and those with virtually open door admissions great buys and the wildly expensive
992063 we commend these institutions for their excellent academics and we believe our choices offer applicants and their parents a wide range of fine schools to consider applying to
992064 all of us at taylor university are grateful for inclusion in the princeton reviews latest college survey

992068 the bear would stand up ask us if we have any peanut butter wed say yes give it a jar of peanut butter and it would say thanks and then leave

992076 encourage the thousands of iraqis who fled the spiraling violence in their country in recent years to return home
992077 at an international conference on iraq in stockholm prime minister maliki stated
992078 safe repatriation cannot be undertaken now or in the foreseeable future
992079 this government in baghdad in a way is not entirely unhappy about having so many refuges outside who are potential opponents or who include people who were part of the former regime and they would rather be rid of them and they dont want to help them they dont want them to get training and education during their years of exile so they can come back in the end and be functioning citizens
992080 we dont believe maliki militias are still killing people every day we hear news about new bombs in iraq we have no choice but to stay here
992081 we believe it is both dangerous and irresponsible to lure desperate refugees home with misleading statements about improved safety and security refugees should be discouraged from returning home to communities where they will not be safe

992210 compared to larger cities such as new york boston chicago and los angeles and their costs of hotels restaurants and attractions milwaukee offers more bang for the buck
992211 a number of the choreographers had pieces that were more like performance installations
992212 we had this combination of regular work that needed to be performed on a stage and work that could have been performed anywhere we thought that was fun and decided to make these evenings combinations of environmental work and tra ditional theater work the range of the work that our choreographers were bringing to the process demand ed that we present the performances in this way
992213 we try to produce as many interesting choreog raphers as possible and these are people that are coming here from all over the place to study but also to share their talents with the community
992214 the diversity of backgrounds and varied artis tic interests of this group is really amazing in that it gives people a chance to see works from all over the rest of the nation
992215 i would characterize this as a really vital growing dance community and im really happy to say that the university of milwaukee has been a large player in the growth of this community
992216 the point is that 401 k and similar contribution plans were created to ensure that people would have adequate savings for retirement not as a source of credit to use casually
992217 these debit cards allow a participant to use his or her retirement savings to make everyday purchases like buying a cup of coffee clearly thats not what the 401 k is for
992218 most people dont realize it but youre paying back the loan with after tax income
992219 we could have been out of there a long time ago
992220 and in a much better position as a nation both in terms of our economy and national security if we had done this earlier
992221 now just about everyones on board except for basically george bush dick cheney and john mccain
992222 even maliki who has resisted this even though the iraqi parliament and people of iraq have wanted it for a long time is now saying this is the best choice
992223 the vehicles would stretch from denver watching them drive by at 30 miles per hour would take 75 days experts estimate the removal of all personnel and equipment could take as long as 20 months
992224 many people lost many of their beloveds they cannot take it anymore
992225 but its not the turning point that people think were at
992226 i think were either past or right at the point where if we dont make a transition to iraq function ing on its own its going to lose its ability to do so
992227 a lot of times getting people to work together is much easier to do at that local level than it is at the national level
992228 trying to drive this thing by trying to get a national reconciliation that would then feed down to the local level is pretty much counter to how most processes work
992229 that would rekindle the violence in a very short time
992230 now i will have sunni militias integrated into the security forces and then they will come to revenge the shias who killed them
992231 thats what it is and no matter what country welcomes help at some point to deal with a problem nobody wants that occupying power to stay forever or for a very long period of time so the resentment has always been there and the danger is that if we dont indicate a clear intention of when were going to leave so the people can look at that that resentment will grow again and cause serious problems
992232 if you stay longer were going to have more violence more battles
992233 people will adjust to the political reality of how you gain power and use power in an occupation instead of adjusting to a new status quo that will be created when the transition is completed
992234 we want people to work for iraq not work ing for their sects
992235 so its like this is it like this all the time arent you you know going crazy
992236 ce il vitello coi piedi tonnati che parla molto male di te sostiene che i tuoi piedi non sono di vero cobalto ma sono soltanto quattro piedi di pane ricoperti da un sottile strato di cobalto

992238 i dont think it would be fair to you if you did have an abundance of love to give right now there are wells in our hearts and if we have used everything to water a garden then we have to wait for the rain to re fill it part of this is an evolution of your own heart changing and part of it is well you know what it is and what is isnt dont you dear

992292 further declines if any are likely to be modest given the accumulating pent up demand
992293 theres a lot to that simple statement that bottom line dollar figure can make people act in strange ways a dollar figure is hard and concrete you can get your head around it but often the price is just the catalyst for conflict and
992294 is this target a good result does the potential reward justify the risks
992295 its clear mccains handlers are determined now to keep him on message and not allow much spontaneity to creep into his performances they cant persuade him to give up town halls but last week he was noticeably kept away from the national press corps whom he once called his base although mccain requested that a couch be put on his campaign plane so he could sit around with reporters as he did on his straight talk express bus during the primaries the couch has lately been occupied only by overflow staff mccain looked cranky most of last week as if he could sense the potential harm he was doing to his reputation as a high road politician
992296 modern political campaigns aided and abetted by the press exert a powerful downward force
992297 obamas advantage is attributable largely to overwhelming support from two traditional democratic constituencies african americans and hispanics but even among white workers a group of voters that has been targeted by both parties as a key to victory in november obama leads mccain by 10 percentage points 47 percent to 37 percent and has the advantage as the more empathetic candidate
992298 the new poll included interviews with 1 350 randomly selected workers 18 to 64 years old who put in at least 30 hours a week but earned 27 000 or less last year
992299 the group which accounts for nearly a quarter of u s adults gives the democrat the nod both as the more empathetic candidate and as the one who more closely shares their values and while many express no opinion about who would do more to improve the economy or health care or the voters finances obama has the clear edge among those who picked a favorite on these core issues
992300 campaigning at town halls across america i am often asked about my plans to reform our public schools and the answer begins with two points on which most everyone agrees every public school child deserves a first rate education and too many of our schools are producing second rate results beyond that the education debate divides quickly into two camps some say all thats needed is more taxpayer money along with more prekindergarten and after school programs others believe that the basic structure of the education system is flawed and that fundamental reform is needed you can put me squarely on the side of major reform
992301 these days the cause of education reform crosses all boundaries of party race and financial means in new york mayor bloomberg and schools chancellor joel klein have taken up the cause of reform as have many others including the rev al sharpton these men are strong supporters of the education equality project a group dedicated to finally changing the status quo in our education system this group of leaders is no longer willing to accept a public school system in which many students never even graduate or learn the basics of math science and english as chancellor klein puts it in large urban areas the culture of public education is broken if you dont fix this culture then you are not going to be able to make the kind of changes that are needed
992302 in the latest sign of a shift on a key issue democratic presidential contender barack obama said on saturday he would support an expansion of offshore drilling as part of a broader bipartisan energy bill critics are branding this a flip flop but sen obama is citing it as an example of a central tenet of his candidacy a willingness to bridge divisions to address long festering problems
992303 in the latest sign of a shift on a key issue democratic presidential contender barack obama said on saturday he would support an expansion of offshore drilling as part of a broader bipartisan energy bill critics are branding this a flip flop but sen obama is citing it as an example of a central tenet of his candidacy a willingness to bridge divisions to address long festering problems
992304 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets now big oils filling john mccains campaign with 2 million dollars in contributions
992305 we are god fearing republicans and we approve this message
992306 can this break through in the way mccain broke through last week probably not but if he can control the message debate for a few days it will be seen as a good week for obama
992307 not going to run a negative campaign because that happened to me in 2000
992308 i think the united states of america has reached a point where we should provide equal economic opportunities for all americans and i do not and americans have rejected a quota system
992309 i would think john would never make it a litmus test but when it comes down to a nominee selecting a vice presidential running mate its their decision exclusively
992310 and i would respect that decision one way or another
992311 i think the whole vp thing is a little bit overrated
992312 its important but maybe the media is giving it a little bit more importance than it deserves
992313 details appear to be different than a normal presidential candidate visit
992314 joe is the right person to revive the harry truman wing of the democratic party which has traditionally been strong for national defense strong for the economy and strong for equal opportunity
992315 in the old days reporters would have had hours to chew over the latest controversy and plenty of other subjects with mccain but for a campaign struggling to regain control of its message the old days are definitely gone
992316 is having a bumpier ride with journalists than when he ran for president eight years ago the popular image of the campaign mccain bantering with national journalists in the back of his bus has in reality all but vanished the traveling press is now routinely stiffed in favor of five minute sit downs with local reporters
992317 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
992318 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
992319 if barack obama gave new meaning to the term political celebrity then john mccain helped define it
992320 he emerged as the most popular republican in hollywood following his 2000 presidential primary defeat winning more screen time than the rest of congress combined mccain made cameos in wedding crashers and 24 saw his memoir turned into a popular biopic on a amp e and appeared more than 30 times on late night comedy shows
992321 asked about the ad which was e mailed to supporters mccain told reporters in florida we were having some fun with supporters
992322 a new spanish language web ad from republican john mccain needles democratic rival barack obama for ignoring latin america on his foreign tour
992323 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
992324 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
992325 is having a bumpier ride with journalists than when he ran for president eight years ago the popular image of the campaign mccain bantering with national journalists in the back of his bus has in reality all but vanished the traveling press is now routinely stiffed in favor of five minute sit downs with local reporters
992326 asked about the ad which was e mailed to supporters mccain told reporters in florida we were having some fun with supporters
992327 waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
992328 barack obamas latest negative attack ad shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy after all it was senator obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
992329 not surprisingly obama is asking that florida and michigan get their full votes at the dem convention
992330 attacks the same way that lilbushie attacked him and now his camp has sold out to good old karl rove
992331 the election and obamas candidacy have focused these anxieties like a lens i found whites frustrated and indecisive about the campaign families at odds generations divided many who thought themselves beyond prejudice were surprised by their suspicions of the young black man from up north meanwhile many slave descended blacks hugely supportive of the half kenyan half kansan hawaii reared obama seemed afraid to hope too much inoculating themselves with pessimism about the chances that any man of color could win the presidency even this man even today or that if he does he will survive as i say emotions are raw
992332 people remember what they want to the way they want to and call it history
992333 for the past month much of the obama campaigns focus has been on registering voters virginia has recorded 147 000 new registrations this year it does not register by party and the campaigns goal is 150 000 more it estimates that if 80 percent of those new registrants are for obama and that if 75 percent show up at the polls that will mean a gain of more than 60 000 votes or an extra 1 75 percent assuming turnout is around 3 5 million
992334 to further close the gap the campaign is targeting what it calls
992335 for a race thats going to be as close as this is it will take a lot of pieces of the puzzle for us to add to be successful said virginia campaign director mitch stewart a south dakota native who helped run obamas primary campaigns in states including iowa and indiana for the mccain campaign the challenge is holding on to as much of bushs 2004 advantage as possible particularly by trying to win back voters who favored the president but also voted for warner kaine or webb it is being undertaken with a ground operation more limited in scope and more hierarchical than obamas the campaign which as elsewhere is working in close concert with the republican national committee has opened six offices statewide with three more on the way on the theory that obamas greater visibility is mostly for show and not worth the cost to match
992336 is being undertaken with a ground operation more limited in scope and more hierarchical than obamas
992337 the most sophisticated humor the obama fanatics can handle is knock knock jokes even those confuse the heck out of them most of the time especially if you tell them to go first
992338 ni er in his comments is that not a racial comment why is the media not talking about that is john mccain okay with that this on the same day that the president of the united states his dad also a former president and his brother called in to congratulate rush limbaugh on his show
992339 why doesnt senator obama give all the credit to the surge
992340 the possibility of closing the strait of hormuz easily and on an unlimited basis
992341 in view of the proximity of the strait of hormuz to our shores this distance is within the range of an assortment of weapons and its closure for us is very feasible and we face no limitations from the point of view of time
992342 i think it has the ability to cause severe disruption in the gulf
992343 but the west led by the u s would respond so forcefully that iran would find that its ports and ships were hit in such a fashion that the disruption would not continue
992344 no vessel would be safe and would be sent to the depths
992345 now i recognize my opponent came before you yesterday he attacked my record on education reform
992346 this is someone whos been in washington nearly 30 years hes got a pretty slim record on education and when he has taken a stand hes been on the wrong side of the line
992347 his only proposal seems to be recycling tired rhetoric about vouchers
992348 now ive been a proponent of public school choice throughout my career what i wont do what i do oppose is using public money for private school vouchers we need to focus on fixing and improving our public schools not throwing our hands up and walking away from them we need to stop the partisan attacks and start getting results for our children
992349 they are americas problems and have to be solved with effort and resolve by all americans
992350 story and so many other improbable stories would not be possible without all that the urban league has done to put opportunity within the reach of every american
992351 ill never forget that i got my start as a foot soldier in the movement that the urban league helped build the movement to bring opportunity to every corner of our cities
992352 you know that you cant take that seat at the front of the bus if you cant afford the bus fare
992353 you cant live in an integrated neighborhood if you cant afford the house and it doesnt mean a whole lot to sit down at that lunch counter if you cant afford the lunch
992354 in my administration i expect that the white house will be the peoples house
992355 they are americas problems and have to be solved with effort and resolve by all americans
992356 you know that you cant take that seat at the front of the bus if you cant afford the bus fare
992357 you cant live in an integrated neighborhood if you cant afford the house and it doesnt mean a whole lot to sit down at that lunch counter if you cant afford the lunch
992358 you know that you cant take that seat at the front of the bus if you cant afford the bus fare
992359 you cant live in an integrated neighborhood if you cant afford the house and it doesnt mean a whole lot to sit down at that lunch counter if you cant afford the lunch
992360 which is far from dealing with common sense that all can understand talking over the heads of the common and less educated is fast bring a loathing the general public is now putting the whole hoax together
992361 be as careful getting out of iraq as we were careless getting in
992362 people of good will disagree about whether america should have gone to war in iraq
992363 iraq was a diversion from the fight against the terrorists who struck us on 9 11
992364 people of good will could disagree with the facts but as clear as they are now the facts are manifest that it was a blunder
992365 should have the option of keeping the coverage they have
992366 the democratic party is absolutely unified in a commitment to covering every single american
992367 i hear every day about the struggles that are being faced
992368 this is a phenomenal start in terms of presenting our partys values as we hope to engage in this epic challenge in our next session with our new president
992369 i havent seen that yet but obviously were not done with deliberations
992370 the party also included language on iraq withdrawal echoed by its presumptive nomine barack obama as it expressed a desire to be as careful getting out of iraq as we were careless getting in
992371 it was worse than a blunder it was a crime
992372 straight to depression we seen how 9 11 completely broke our security common market social life and our military power all the great military power and nine radical scum bags brought this nation to its knees
992373 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
992374 anytime race is the topic du jour in the campaign its a bad day for obama period
992375 it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
992376 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
992377 ninety four militants and 14 security officials including three staffers of the isi inter services intelligence have been killed in the fighting
992378 people are always saying things that make you wonder if theyve ever had a successful conversation in their entire lives
992379 go find me a nice 3 bed 2 bath with room for my quilt collection on a corner lot
992380 a unit of cultural information such as a cultural practice or idea that is transmitted verbally or by repeated action from one mind to another
992381 its a good opportunity for some issues to be thrashed out
992382 i think it was all teed up as a bone on the eve of arroyos state of the nation address i think it was strictly done for that purpose
992383 the government loses its face in the eyes of the international community
992384 unlike the often impulsive incumbent buyukanit basbug is known for his cool and calculating nature
992385 the result will be less likelihood of abrupt escalations in civil military tension but at the same time more effective political pressure from the military
992386 basbug is regarded as one of the most outstanding officers of his generation combining a strong intellect with a deep commitment to turkish secularism basbug who will occupy the post for the next two years is likely to prove a formidable opponent for the akp
992387 they are phenomenal they are doing extremely hard skill levels and they are very well prepared
992388 i dont want to jinx them but they are stronger than ever
992389 the chinese showed us they are going out there to win and they like a good fight
992390 we want to keep the title of being top of the world weve been working really hard and were going to give the chinese a run for their money

992452 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think that their child is a healthy weight
992453 this move isnt about pointing the finger and telling parents that their children are overweight instead it is about equipping parents with the information they need to help their children live healthier lives
992454 i find this whole approach from the department of health a bit prissy and namby pamby
992455 the americans have gone back to using the term because its the kind of shock word that makes parents sit up and take notice
992456 the department of health admits in its guidance that bmi is the best and most practical way to assess whether a child is overweight or obese but then denies parents the actual figures for their children because they say it could be confusing for some
992457 some parents may find the bmi growth charts confusing and may need someone to explain what they show
992458 we want parents to easily understand the results without the need for further explanation and that is why the sliding scale bar will be used

992468 i am a local leader of fatah in gaza city however my institution has neither been linked with any political faction nor has it received any funds from any party the society has been working on development of the local youth who are the future builders of the palestinian homeland
992469 the hamas police forces broke into the society after midnight last saturday and confiscated 18 computers and the societys files
992470 this is an illegal action as those who stormed the institutions did not show any legal warrants upon breaking into the offices and seizing their contents we believe that such a measure was politically motivated and would only fuel the political division underway between the rival hamas and fatah parties
992471 civil society organizations have been serving the society at many levels therefore they should be avoided when it comes to political controversy
992472 we have been following up and monitoring these institutions before the recent car blast right after the incident we had to move swiftly in order to foil further sabotaging attempts by many of those societies
992473 for more than a year now ramallahs palestinian authority has been cracking down on hamas supporters or closing hamas linked societies but we have not responded with the same actions the gaza closures are meant to prevent potential instability in the coastal strip

992484 estaba y est sometido al choque de trenes de nacionalismos enfrentados que dividen a la comunidad m s por razones identitarias que por las propuestas de ideas incluyentes de la diversidad
992485 no tengo la menor idea de c mo se produjeron las conversaciones entre la direcci n federal de los socialistas y los compa eros de navarra a partir del d a electoral pero comprendo la posici n de la ejecutiva m s all de razones estatutarias si me hubiera tocado decidir hubiera hecho algo semejante con la salvedad de que no conozco las razones de la direcci n m s all de lo hecho p blico en medio del ruido de las interpretaciones
992486 ni un voto por el centro a upn ni hemos obtenido nada de los nuevos votantes j venes progresistas que nabai s ha sabido seducir desde luego no hemos liderado desde la centralidad pol tica el importante abanico de progreso social mayoritario y que excede con mucho de los setenta mil votos recibidos decenas de miles de votos progresistas han recalado en nabai sin ser nacionalistas y en upn sin ser de derechas porque no les hemos convencido
992487 si tenemos un techo electoral de cristal es producto de nuestra actitud y actuaciones y no de ninguna fuerza maligna la excesiva ambig edad del mensaje de cambio en la campa a la ausencia de claridad en las intenciones la nefasta organizaci n de la misma los cuestionables y en muchos casos caprichosos relevos en las candidaturas etc tera no son las mejores recetas para aumentar el n mero de votos
992488 lejos de abrirnos a la sociedad en los ltimos tiempos nuestro partido se ha cerrado m s en s mismo lleg ndose incluso a confundir la sana discrepancia interna con la disidencia negando y reprimiendo aqu lla e identific ndola con sta en lugar de emular al psoe hemos desatendido a muchos movimientos sociales haciendo caso omiso de novedosas propuestas sociales y la pretendida sinton a con los agentes econ micos y sociales es pura desinton a en cantidad de asuntos el desprop sito no libra la consideraci n equivocada sobre la responsabilidad de los medios de comunicaci n siempre la culpa en el ojo ajeno sin capacidad de autocr tica probablemente todo lo anterior ha contribuido a quedarnos en tercera fuerza pol tica

992492 en principio la resoluci n de la crisis navarra de ingobernabilidad abierta por unos resultados electorales imposibles de conciliar parec a satisfacer con xito el habitual dise o de la marca zapatero refinadamente maquiav lico un dise o que en otras ocasiones he calificado de equilibrista o funambulesco en efecto como es sabido la estrategia radical del partido popular es que quiere provocar la polarizaci n de espa a para empujar a zapatero al otro extremo del espectro donde se quedar a encerrado y enredado con las minor as antisistema nacionalistas izquierdistas independentistas etc tera y para escapar de esa trampa zapatero tiene que lograr la cuadratura del c rculo quedando en tierra de nadie y caminando por la cuerda floja entre los fuegos cruzados del pp y los secesionistas algo que hasta ahora ha sabido conseguir con xito as ocurri con la crisis del estatuto catal n en la que zapatero logr pactar con artur mas una posici n intermedia que era rechazada tanto por el espa olismo del pp como por el independentismo de erc tambi n ha pasado algo parecido en el pa s vasco donde zapatero ha logrado entenderse con el transversalismo de imaz pactando una posici n equidistante entre el espa olismo del pp y el independentismo de ibarretxe ea y batasuna y aplicando el mismo dise o el fun mbulo zapatero ha querido hacer lo mismo en navarra pactando con upn un arreglo equilibrado que le permitiera escapar tanto del espa olismo del pp como del vasquismo de nafarroa bai de ah las contrapartidas que ha venido ofreciendo miguel sanz separaci n parlamentaria del pp retirada del recurso contra la ley de dependencia tolerancia del aborto quiz pero con lo que no contaba zapatero era con que se le rebelasen las bases navarras del partido socialista que como antes les pas a los socialistas catalanes se hab an tomado al pie de la letra la oferta de zapatero de respetar y hacer cumplir la voluntad de los navarros aqu es donde est el problema en la deriva hacia el confederalismo a la que ha conducido la peligrosa oferta de zapatero de multiplicar el autogobierno de la espa a plural dej ndose llevar por esa idea los socialistas navarros como antes los catalanes reclaman hoy poder cumplir su propia voluntad territorial con independencia de las consecuencias que ello pueda tener en el resto de espa a un sentimiento ste que tambi n est detr s del malestar de los catalanes ante sus fallos infraestructurales de los que s lo saben culpar a espa a y a los espa oles de ah que ahora el aprendiz de brujo zapatero pretenda recuperar la identidad unitaria vendiendo la marca gobierno de espa a aunque quiz sea ya demasiado tarde
992493 la raz n fundamental de la direcci n del psoe para no avalar una coalici n con nabai para gobernar navarra fue el insuficiente resultado electoral del psn as lo aclaraba el presidente zapatero en la entrevista publicada el domingo en este peri dico y as lo explic el s bado en pamplona el secretario de organizaci n jos blanco zapatero considera relevante el hecho de que los socialistas fueran la tercera fuerza y tambi n que la coalici n que ven a gobernando con sanz de presidente alcanzara el 46 de los votos tanto zapatero como blanco dijeron que la posici n finalmente acordada hab a sido la de la direcci n socialista desde el primer momento si esto es as hubo un problema de comunicaci n lo ministros y portavoces dijeron al hacer balance de los resultados del 27 m que la derecha hab a perdido el gobierno de navarra al igual que los de canarias y baleares y que la pol tica de alianzas en la comunidad foral la decidir an los socialistas navarros y como estos se inclinaban por intentar gobernar con nabai e iu se dio por supuesto que eso era lo que quer a ferraz y la moncloa al no dejarlo claro las conversaciones con la coalici n nacionalista llegaron hasta el acuerdo program tico lo que no es poca cosa encallaron en la discusi n del reparto de carteras en la que el psn plante unas pretensiones impropias de un partido que hab a sido tercera fuerza los argumentos que ha dado blanco son razonables la debilidad socialista 12 esca os sobre 50 frente a los 22 de upn unida a la heterogeneidad de nabai coalici n de cuatro partidos har a muy vulnerable al gobierno alternativo y ofrecer a flancos a la cr tica de la derecha en temas como la relaci n con anv la pantalla de la ilegal batasuna o la propuesta de refer ndum soberanista de ibarretxe que sin duda apoyar a una parte de la coalici n un fracaso del experimento por escasa cohesi n interna m s el riesgo de un efecto electoral negativo en el conjunto de espa a eran razones para que ferraz optase por descartar la alternativa pero al permitir que las cosas llegaran demasiado lejos esa direcci n cre expectativas que se vieron defraudadas y tuvo que recurrir al criterio de autoridad para hacer frente a quienes la desafiaron votando una resoluci n cuando ferraz ya hab a zanjado algo as habr a sido conflictivo en cualquier momento pero hasta hace unos a os a nadie se le habr a ocurrido cuestionar que la ltima palabra en materia de pactos la tiene la direcci n central del partido ahora eso no puede darse por establecido
992494 p me gustar a saber en qu momento hizo usted la reflexi n de que resultaba m s conveniente dejar gobernar a upn en navarra que aliarse con nafarroa bai r es una decisi n que he tenido siempre cuando plante bamos la hip tesis de cu l iba a ser el resultado electoral en navarra siempre entend que una etapa de colaboraci n razonable entre upn y psn ser a muy positiva para la comunidad navarra si nos retrotraemos a la propia precampa a nunca hubo por mi parte ning n gui o a lo que pudiera ser un gobierno de cambio p eso es verdad pero el partido socialista de navarra s lanz luego mensajes en ese sentido r no no no en la campa a vamos a ver yo creo que es que hay que entender p en la campa a no pero luego s r no bueno posteriormente yo creo que hay que entender algunos aspectos de la situaci n de navarra primero el partido socialista de navarra fue tercera fuerza pol tica upn perdi la mayor a absoluta pero obtuvo un resultado del 46 un resultado importante es decir yo creo que siendo tercera fuerza pol tica tiene que haber una raz n muy muy poderosa y un entendimiento indudable con la segunda fuerza pol tica en este caso con nafarroa bai para hacer una alternativa en toda regla al gobierno de upn siempre que upn en este caso miguel sanz hiciera una oferta razonable de colaboraci n en mi opini n va a ser bueno para la convivencia es decir este pa s tiene que acostumbrarse a que puede ser que en galicia el psoe gobierne con el bng y que en navarra colaboremos con upn o que ma ana podamos gobernar con por cierto quiero decir que tengo el m ximo respeto democr tico a nafarroa bai p pero si el razonamiento fue as desde el principio no hubiera sido conveniente dejar clara su opini n p blicamente o hab rsela hecho llegar con m s claridad al partido socialista de navarra para evitar las tensiones internas que se han producido al final r ha habido un debate un debate democr tico y todav a seguimos debatiendo ma ana por ayer hay un comit regional en navarra yo entiendo a los compa eros de navarra han sufrido ataques muy duros de upn del partido popular y tienen l gicamente el amor propio afectado pero a veces en pol tica por el bien com n hay que saber aguantar esos ataques p no digo que no y no cuestiono la decisi n final le pregunto como otro ejemplo de lo que dec amos al principio de la entrevista si el proceso de ir de un punto a otro se ha efectuado de manera ptima o se han cometido errores en la gesti n r pero seamos objetivos no era una situaci n f cil p no digo que sea f cil r es decir lo que no podemos es decir que las situaciones dif ciles tienen respuestas f ciles eso pasa en pocas ocasiones no era una situaci n f cil porque upn se hab a quedado a uno de la mayor a porque nosotros est bamos detr s de nafarroa bai porque hab a ganas de cambio porque el psn hab a recibido y el psoe muchas agresiones de upn y del pp no era una situaci n f cil la gesti n no era f cil y era una gesti n con problemas todo el mundo lo ha visto y es reconocible p si tuviera que volver a gestionar el proceso sabiendo el resultado final lo volver a a hacer igual r en lo que depende de la direcci n federal b sicamente s es decir aqu se hab a cruzado el impulso pol tico la pasi n pol tica con una perspectiva de m s largo plazo m s de fondo de m s d a a d a que nosotros quer amos trasladar al psn y que lo hemos hecho con la mayor prudencia con el mayor tiempo por delante para que la reflexi n fuera compartida integrada y no fuera como p no ha sido muy compartida ni muy integrada al final r bueno vamos a verlo p c mo se van a curar esas heridas r vamos a verlo yo creo que est evolucionando positivamente p navarra es una excepci n o por qu es una excepci n navarra a la t ctica general que hab a seguido el partido socialista hasta ahora en catalu a desde luego o en galicia de aliarse con los nacionalistas para desalojar al pp del poder r hay tres razones primera porque somos tercera fuerza pol tica y para m sa es muy poderosa si hubi ramos sido segunda fuerza pol tica a poca distancia de upn la situaci n ser a distinta segundo porque el discurso de miguel sanz no ha sido igual que el del pp ni su oferta de colaboraci n ofrecerse para colaborar es in dito el pp nunca lo ha hecho p se jugaba el cargo en ello r no pero p quiero decir cree usted de verdad que miguel sanz ha hecho una reflexi n que le ha llevado a buscar otras posiciones o ha hecho de la necesidad virtud r yo creo que hay algo de todo p no es s lo c lculo pol tico r yo creo que hay una parte de reflexi n y una parte de hacer de la necesidad virtud pero hay una cierta singularidad de lo que representa upn en relaci n con el pp la hay p la habr a partir de ahora desde luego en los ltimos cuatro a os r la hab a quiz no hab a aflorado pero a m me consta que la hay me constaba y me consta
992495 la pluralidad pol tica es uno de los signos de nuestros tiempos y sobre todo de la sociedad del porvenir y la transversalidad pol tica entre nacionalistas y no nacionalistas constituye hoy d a la m s acertada expresi n y respuesta a una valoraci n positiva de ese fen meno social
992496 convivimos en la misma sociedad nacionalistas y no nacionalistas y tambi n algunos que se definen como anti nacionalistas a quienes ernest lluch denomin con acierto nacionalistas de reacci n tal hecho social es adem s de real e irreversible progresivamente acelerado la pluralidad no es en s mismo un hecho social negativo sino complejo cuya primera afecci n constatable es el impacto ante la identidad colectiva pol tica es decir ante la identidad nacional
992497 sin duda todos habremos de revisar cara al futuro muchas concepciones y actitudes pero en todo caso la transversalidad pol tica es sin duda un camino acertado
992498 el com n denominador ten a que ser el de un programa de progreso cuyo acuerdo se demostr posible la funcionalidad de ese gobierno de progreso exig a tambi n pactar no solo los acuerdos sino tambi n las diferencias y aparcar o relegar las cuestiones de confrontaci n es decir trasladar a la pol tica lo que en la vida real es normal y corriente en mbitos mercantiles sociales culturales etc
992499 se hab a tornado de urgente gravedad no solo por el hecho de que la derecha lleva gobernando 16 a os sino adem s porque lo hace con caracteres ultras y provocando crispaci n social upn ha actuado como punta de lanza de la pol tica de confrontaci n del pp y ha dado numerosos ejemplos de sectarismo en pol ticas sociales ling sticas culturales y hasta de derechos civiles
992500 esa necesidad de cambio pol tico tan profundamente sentida por la sociedad navarra
992501 las cesiones necesarias para hacer posible el cambio pol tico anhelado
992502 c mo no habr a de impulsar nafarroa bai un gobierno transversal si la propia coalici n es en s misma transversal entre nacionalistas y no nacionalistas
992503 por estas convicciones nafarroa bai sigui negociando a n despu s de la profunda insatisfacci n que le origin el que upn mantuviese en minor a la alcald a de pamplona y otros municipios a pesar de no compartir la argumentaci n del psn de no querer coincidir en votos con concejales de anv legalmente elegidos nafarroa bai volvi incluso a la mesa de negociaci n a n despu s de haberse coaligado upn y psn en la elecci n de la mesa del parlamento tras la reuni n secreta entre el sr blanco y el tandem del burgo sanz que estos ltimos se encargaron de publicitar de inmediato por las mismas convicciones nafarroa bai renunci a la presidencia a la vicepresidencia y se conform con compartir la portavoc a habitual del posible gobierno
992504 el primero el de la falta de respeto a la ciudadan a navarra y a sus propios militantes y votantes rompiendo as la palabra empe ada el segundo grave error del psoe es el de haber sucumbido a la presi n de la derecha que desde el propio 27 de mayo atac con todos sus medios la posibilidad de un gobierno plural y de progreso para navarra
992505 en medio de un frentismo identitario personificado en el navarrismo conservador de upn y el vasquismo semicamuflado de nabai
992506 un gobierno alternativo que hiciera visible el cambio garantizara la identidad de navarra y profundizara en las pol ticas sociales defendidas por la izquierda y el nacionalismo
992507 f rmula in dita que entra aba riesgos evidentes y que necesitaba legitimarse por su eficacia su estabilidad y su adecuaci n a la realidad actual de la comunidad
992508 un programa de gobierno com n impecablemente democr tico y escrupulosamente democr tico respetuoso del estatus actual de navarra
992509 los procesos de constituci n de los ayuntamientos y del parlamento
992510 los debates internos de la coalici n de partidos que conforman nabai
992511 la dificultad de transmisi n de las propuestas a la opini n p blica
992512 la ruptura de la tregua por parte de eta las conversaciones mantenidas por jos blanco y miguel sanz al margen de las anteriores y el veto de la comisi n ejecutiva federal
992513 la ruptura de la tregua ha generado un cambio de rumbo
992514 contra toda la sociedad navarra a la que prometimos cambio
992515 conformar un gobierno de convivencia progreso y de izquierdas con nabai e iun
992516 para evitar estas disfunciones y aberraciones planteamos que se modifiquen los estatutos del psoe para que entre el psoe y el psn se puedan establecer unas relaciones de igualdad y poder as tener capacidad de decisi n y autonom a suficiente para dejar de aparecer ante la sociedad navarra como una mera sucursal de madrid
992517 carece de credibilidad porque denota que no tiene principios ni valores ni c digo tico ni dignidad s lo puro y duro c lculo electoral
992518 quiz de lo m s grave que le pueda ocurrir a un partido porque no se justifica en absoluto la manera de proceder ni en el fondo ni en las formas de los compa eros de madrid desautorizando doblegando y humillando la voluntad y el sentir general casi un nime del partido socialista de navarra
992519 atraviesa la raya divisoria entre lo que es democracia y las actitudes autoritarias
992520 ante la sociedad nos sentimos humillados y estamos tan desacreditados que no podemos levantar cabeza
992521 an logas consideraciones pueden aplicarse a una asociaci n psn nabai acordada a ciegas es por supuesto muy importante que la formaci n dirigida por patxi zabaleta haya renunciado a la lucha armada y condene en consecuencia la pr ctica del terror pero eso en modo alguno agota el tema de su posible consideraci n como partido de gobierno en navarra detr s de la cortina de nabai conviene tener en cuenta lo que piensa el verdadero protagonista aralar hubiera sido m s tranquilizante que desde su posici n como segundo grupo votado nabai planteara algo tan l gico como encabezar la alianza con el psn si de lo nico que se trataba era de hacer una gesti n de progreso y de cambio objetivo perfectamente alcanzable a la vista del balance de upn pero si de entrada la coalici n daba por buena la primac a del tercero en discordia ello confirmaba de modo indirecto que sus metas eran otras en la l nea de la concepci n mitol gica expuesta por la militante an nima en bayona se tratar a ante todo de avanzar hacia lo que su nombre indica navarratik nafarroara de la navarra actual a la nafarroa abertzale con el euskera por emblema y el horizonte abierto a la materializaci n de la imaginaria euskal herria independiente de rasgos id nticos a la que busca el nacionalismo radical con eta a la cabeza con toda la cautela del mundo pues patxi zabaleta y los suyos son conscientes de que parten de una posici n minoritaria y hay que caminar a peque os pasos ante todo hacia esa primera vinculaci n entre la cav y el ex reino contando con el favor de un psn que siguiendo el ejemplo de los mayores ve con buenos ojos la colaboraci n con un grupo independentista m s all de los n meros con el cocktail de independientes y sta o aquella vicepresidencia esto es lo que estaba en juego y lo que ha quedado en la sombra
992522 la demanda y la realidad socioling stica de la ciudadan a
992523 deber garantizar y mejorar la estabilidad y fortalecimiento institucional de navarra la mejora de los servicios a los ciudadanos el incremento del bienestar social y el impulso de la justicia la igualdad la libertad y el progreso

992526 nos comprometemos a defender que las decisiones que sobre el futuro pol tico adopte libre y democr ticamente la ciudadan a vasca sean respetadas por las instituciones del estado el acuerdo resultante garantizar que todos los proyectos pol ticos pueden ser no s lo defendidos en condiciones de igualdad de oportunidades y ausencia de toda forma de coacci n o injerencia sino que adem s puedan ser materializados si ese es el deseo mayoritario de la ciudadan a expresado a trav s de los procedimientos legales dichos procedimientos legales podr n ser modificados en el futuro para que no sea una limitaci n a la voluntad popular sino garant a de su ejercicio
992527 partiendo de la actual realidad jur dico pol tica nos comprometemos a promover la creaci n de un rgano institucional com n para los cuatro territorios este rgano tendr las atribuciones ejecutivas y de propuesta legislativa en el marco competencial que se acuerde de conformidad con el ordenamiento jur dico dichas atribuciones ser n objeto de negociaci n durante el transcurso del di logo multipartito

992531 la creaci n de un rgano institucional com n para los cuatro territorios
992532 atribuciones ejecutivas y de propuesta legislativa en el marco competencial que se acuerde de conformidad con el ordenamiento jur dico
992533 la p rdida de la ltima esperanza de normalizaci n pol tica en navarra
992534 yo acuso de discriminaci n planificada contra los navarros que se sienten vascos contraviniendo gravemente el principio de no discriminaci n que garantiza la constituci n arts
992535 yo acuso de violar sistem ticamente el art culo 44 de la constituci n negando el derecho a la cultura vasca a la mayor a de los navarros
992536 yo acuso de tratar institucionalmente a los navarrovascos como subciudadanos esto es privados de algunos derechos fundamentales creando una suerte de guetos administrativos a trav s del mecanismo malicioso de convertir en sin nimas las palabras vasco y etarra
992537 yo acuso de que para promocionar en la administraci n e indirectamente en muchas empresas hay que despojarse de los aditamentos vascos relegando su disfrute a la intimidad
992538 yo acuso de discriminar al asociacionismo navarro que incorpora se as de identidad o proyectos filovasquistas
992539 yo acuso de que en la mayor parte de las oposiciones en navarra se da a la lingua navarrorum como la llamaron los romanos igual valor que al conocimiento de lenguas extranjeras
992540 yo acuso de discriminar brutalmente en el plano econ mico a los ayuntamientos desafectos esto es vasquistas
992541 yo acuso de hacer pol tica antivasca hasta con las se ales de tr fico
992542 yo acuso de que lo que es normal en materia cultural en todas las dem s comunidades aut nomas con lengua propia en navarra sea sacrilegio
992543 yo acuso de que los estudiantes euskaldunes no tienen los mismos derechos en su educaci n que los castellanohablantes
992544 los socialistas se disponen a pagar un alto precio por una crisis que como la de navarra no deriva de ninguna quiebra institucional sino de una mala gesti n pol tica de los resultados electorales del 27 de mayo el psn fue la tercera fuerza m s votada por detr s de upn y nafarroa bai y su primer error consisti en creer que conven a a sus intereses y a los de las instituciones forales negociar por separado los principales puestos en disputa la alcald a de pamplona la mesa del parlamento regional y el gobierno aut nomo
992545 no plantear o apoyar una moci n de censura y garantizar la estabilidad pol tica social y econ mica
992546 los partidos firmantes se comprometen a no modificar o impulsar sin consenso entre ellos leyes que exijan mayor a absoluta
992547 impulsar con el estado las infraestructuras de inter s general para navarra y en clara cooperaci n con la administraci n central
992548 un camino de otra naturaleza pensando en la reversibilidad del escenario
992549 esa explicaci n tiene poco recorrido porque acebes ya ha dicho que no somos de fiar ni en navarra lo que es evidente es que la posici n del pp no va a cambiar por lo que haga el psn
992550 avalado el cambio de gobierno decidido por los ciudadanos porque upn y pp han jugado con navarra de manera absolutamente desleal upn se present a las elecciones como a un plebiscito para mantener su mayor a absoluta y no lo consigui por lo tanto los navarros rechazan esa utilizaci n pol tica de navarra desde la propia navarra por eso se pod a haber avalado y avanzado en ese cambio de gobierno yo hubiera sido partidario de un acuerdo con nafarroabai
992551 superaci n de la dial ctica de radical confrontaci n identitaria que se ha venido a instalar en los ltimos a os y especialmente en los ltimos meses en nuestra comunidad as como de los bloques que la alientan
992552 cualquier propuesta para la formaci n del pr ximo gobierno
992553 tanto las iniciativas como las gestiones formuladas y realizadas a lo largo de todo este proceso se han desenvuelto en ese marco y en el de los acuerdos adoptados por el comit regional que iban dirigidos a la formaci n de un gobierno plural para el progreso desde la convivencia
992554 la actitud del psn psoe en la negociaci n ha sido constantemente la de dotarle de impulso formulando diversas propuestas e incluso tomando siempre la iniciativa para reanudar las conversaciones en cuantas ocasiones stas quedaban bloqueadas por la existencia de discrepancias
992555 queda a la espera y abierta a atender y mantener los contactos y conversaciones con las distintas fuerzas pol ticas al objeto de conseguir que la comunidad tenga el mejor gobierno posible antes del d a 18 de agosto fecha en la que culmina el plazo dispuesto a ese efecto por el parlamento de navarra
992556 cuando por otro lado los socialistas navarros plantean la posibilidad de una negociaci n con los nacionalistas vascos en navarra a cambio de suspender sine die el proceso de incorporaci n de la comunidad foral a euskadi est n planteando un imposible porque solamente el proceso de integraci n justifica la existencia de unas fuerzas pol ticas nacionalistas que en otro caso perder an su raz n de existencia
992557 el nacionalismo vasco estar a dispuesto a muchas cesiones provisionales por conseguir una integraci n que har a viable la hoja de ruta de su proyecto pol tico pero se tratar a de una integraci n que a la vuelta de muy poco tiempo nos enfrentar a con un proyecto nacionalista vasco que habr a alcanzado su objetivo t ctico m s importante esta es la raz n por la que la gran mayor a de los navarros y el resto de los espa oles no podemos ceder en la apertura de un camino que puede resultar a corto plazo bien o mal para el proyecto espa ol pero que es la posibilidad para que pueda prosperar una opci n secesionista para que pueda hacerse realidad el colapso de espa a
992558 los socialistas navarros deben juzgar la actual coyuntura pol tica con realismo y responsabilidad no pueden pedir a nafarroa bai lo que esta coalici n no puede darles sinceramente sin pagar por ello el precio de su disoluci n pol tica si el socialismo navarro no puede llegar a un entendimiento con upn el camino m s sensato y democr tico parece una nueva consulta al electorado este entendimiento bien en la forma de un gobierno de coalici n bien en la forma de un gobierno en minor a integrado por el partido m s votado parece probablemente la soluci n m s f cil razonable y comprensible para el electorado
992559 en todo caso conviene tener presente que el sustancial componente vasco de navarra no necesita del proyecto del nacionalismo sabiniano para afirmarse y sobrevivir y que ese componente tiene en los instrumentos de cooperaci n entre comunidades aut nomas previstos en nuestra vida pol tica adem s de en el amparo general de nuestra constituci n una firme y suficiente garant a en definitiva que no se trata de una cuesti n cultural la que est en juego sino de la viabilidad de un proyecto pol tico de inspiraci n secesionista en el que no cree la mayor a del pueblo navarro un proyecto que no puede contar con el apoyo de las fuerzas pol ticas espa olas sin asumir con ello el m s evidente de los contransentidos
992560 est en una actitud favorable para alcanzar un acuerdo con upn
992561 de tres d as le sobrar an dos para conseguir un acuerdo
992562 que no dispongan ni puedan alcanzar car cter pol tico
992563 navarra constituye una comunidad foral con estatus jur dico pol tico propio y diferenciado basado en lo pol tico en la constituci n y el amejoramiento y en lo econ mico en el convenio econ mico con el estado
992564 las negociaciones para la formaci n de un gobierno de coalici n alternativo al de upn y cdn siguen bloqueadas a tan s lo tres d as de la ronda de consultas que la presidenta del parlamento elena torres realizar el martes con todos los grupos parlamentarios un bloqueo del que nafarroa bai e izquierda unida culpan al psn que no se ha dirigido a ninguna de las dos formaciones desde que el pasado 5 de julio propusiera un reparto de consejer as que los otros dos partidos consideraron inasumible
992565 desde entonces no ha vuelvo a haber nuevas conversaciones ni siquiera contacto telef nico al menos hasta ltima hora de ayer esto ha empezado a generar desconfianza entre los posibles socios de gobierno de hecho tanto nabai como iu sospechan que el psn puede estar dilatando las negociaciones intencionadamente con el objetivo de apurar los plazos y reducir el margen de negociaci n en principio y salvo que la mesa del parlamento haga una nueva lectura del reglamento fernando puras deber a comunicar el martes a la presidenta de la c mara si se presenta a la investidura lo que deja el margen para el acuerdo en el lunes
992566 pero esta situaci n no es del agrado ni de nafarroa bai ni de izquierda unida que ayer coincidieron en se alar que as s lo se deteriora la confianza lt lt el gt gt lamentaba ayer el candidato de nabai a la presidencia patxi zabaleta
992567 en ese sentido consider que lt lt responsabilidad gt gt al psn y record que la oferta de nabai lt lt est gt gt
992568 con el an lisis de zabaleta coincidi tambi n el coordinador general de izquierda unida ion erro que constat la necesidad de que haya
992569 ferraz le ha puesto una vela a san ferm n y el patr n navarro no le ha defraudado el acuerdo entre el partido socialista de navarra psn y nafarroa bai nabai se aleja a pasos agigantados despu s de que la coalici n nacionalista haya constatado como el candidato socialista fernando puras rehuye desde hace d as una nueva reuni n con patxi zabaleta para concretar el reparto de consejer as que permita la formaci n de un nuevo gobierno en la comunidad foral seg n fuentes de la nabai el ltimo encuentro entre ambas partes al que tambi n asisti la tercera pata de un hipot tico tripartito iu tuvo lugar el pasado 5 de junio desde entonces todas las llamadas para concertar una nueva cita se han encontrado con una sorprende respuesta por parte del psn lt lt puras gt gt esto se produce a menos de una semana de que la presidenta del parlamento navarro la socialista elena torres haga la definitiva ronda para proponer un candidato a la presidencia por lo que los dirigentes de la coalici n se han terminado por convencer de que finalmente el psoe ha impuesto a sus compa eros navarros su posici n contraria al pacto de hecho est n seguros de que la ltima propuesta que les hizo puras de formar un ejecutivo con mayor a de consejeros independientes y s lo dos carteras para nabai en concreto la de bienestar social y agricultura no era m s que un intento del candidato socialista de que fuera la formaci n de zabaleta la que rompiera las conversaciones para justificar ante su militancia una futura abstenci n que permitiera la reelecci n del actual presidente de upn miguel sanz
992570 this is a great news source which i look forward to reading every day
992571 with digital cameras becoming nearly as commonplace as microwave ovens the sheer number of photos taken every year is mindboggling take into account the fact that the vast majority of snapshots many of them great pictures never make it to the printer and end up living
992572 this is a great news source which i look forward to reading every day
992573 the lab is available to all developers academics partners start up companies and customers to test their solutions they can also use it as a resource center to run small labs training etc the lab is available free of charge and will be open to general public looking to get basic digital literacy etc depending on availability
992574 if you are a poorer driver you get clobbered all ways rich ministers havent got a clue
992575 as a vicar i do quite a lot of visiting people which saves the government a lot of money
992576 i cant afford to replace my car which is 10 years old next year and the road tax will go up to 200
992577 if you are a poorer driver you get clobbered all ways i get taxed three times the tax on the fuel thats going up the increased road tax and when i use the car for business i get taxed again
992578 i do the usual cups of tea thing that vicars do but more importantly i visit people in hospices in hospitals people with mental health problems who have no one to talk to people who are sick with marriage problems and so on
992579 i am on the edge of bristol so i mostly make quite short journeys but it can take more than an hour each way to get to southmead hospital
992580 it just comes straight off the income to support my family
992581 more and more i am paying to visit people the government has us over a barrel really
992582 i understand that they want to keep things like allowances down for the reps who do a lot more mileage but they replace their cars every three years or so for new ones
992583 government ministers get new cars on a regular basis and dont know what it is like to struggle to replace their cars
992584 i have bought a second hand motorbike to cut some of the emissions down but you cant take people to hospital on the back of a motorbike
992585 we try to do our bit and reduce our mileage i could cycle but it would vastly reduce the number of visits i do
992586 we set out the position very clearly in the budget
992587 rates for pre 2001 cars will continue to be based on engine size
992588 nfc will achieve traction initially in developed countries and regions with japan already leading the way with felica enabled phones north america western europe and countries such as korea singapore and australia are likely to see service take up

992590 these 11 new members will join the development of a consistent and competitive global handset os operating system within which the collaborative benefits of shared cost and innovation are realized and upon which diverse commercially driven differentiation freely thrives
992591 for fall 2008 the chicest bevvy on the block will undoubtedly be coke light in bottles designed by cavalli
992592 we werent totally dominant but did enough to show we are getting better coach brian smith said
992593 everything was going well to camp four and on summit attempt everything went wrong
992594 we were astonished we had to move it that took of course many many hours some turned back because they did not trust it anymore
992595 there was a korean guy hanging upside down there was a second korean guy who held him with a rope but he was also in shock and then a third guy was there also and they were trying to survive but i had also to survive
992596 you can see how for people who were exhausted it would have been nearly impossible for them to descend without the ropes
992597 once their hands and feet are frozen they really are unable to move on their own power and it takes other people to carry them down
992598 che ci vuoi fare fausto il precario e il disoccupato non dedicano molto tempo alle dotte letture e magari avrebbero gradito di pi una assunzione di responsabilit netta senza appello degna di un leader che sa pagare il prezzo della propria sconfitta
992599 and its alright yeah ill be fine dont worry bout this heart of mine
992600 a short time after he was and we were together and then we went separate ways and i called him straight away because obviously i didnt really know what to do
992601 our data reveal a disturbingly high rate of exposure among 10 14 year olds nationally to extremely violent movies
992602 in britain no adolescent would be admitted to these movies unless they were 18 the r rating in this country is clearly not preventing our young people from seeing them
992603 we know so much about the harmful effects of exposure to violent media content but how much exposure children actually get has been largely ignored now were learning more about the large numbers of kids seeing this material and who they are
992604 this is the first study to demonstrate an independent association between all cause mortality and sleep apnea in a community based study
992605 the size of the increased mortality risk was surprisingly large in our particular study a six fold increase means that having significant sleep apnea at age 40 gives you about the same mortality risk as somebody aged 57 who doesnt have sleep apnea
992606 while adverse reactions to iodinated contrast media are rare they are encountered regularly by all physicians who administer contrast material to patients and some of these reactions will require treatment
992607 we reviewed our experience to determine how often we encountered these reactions in our practice and how often the reactions required treatment we also wanted to know what happened to those patients who required treatment particularly when they had reactions that were moderate or severe
992608 commonly used medications can be administered safely however treatment errors are not uncommon and in a few instances can lead to patient morbidity
992609 in our study we found a number of instances in which non recommended treatment was provided these cases included the administration of oxygen by nasal cannula rather than mask and at lower than recommended doses over utilization of diphenhydramine including to a few patients who were hypotensive and the administration of higher than recommended doses of epinephrine as well as occasional confusion about which concentrations of epinephrine should be injected in which manner subcutaneously or intravenously in our study the most striking example of patient morbidity from non recommended treatment occurred in the two patients who received doses of 1 mg of epinephrine in the absence of cardiopulmonary arrest who both had cardiac complications fortunately these complications were mild and transient and caused no serious morbidity

992611 circumcision with this technique promises to be faster safer and more acceptable to patients than conventional surgical circumcision methods
992612 circumcision is the only new hiv prevention method to demonstrate consistent efficacy in randomized controlled trials
992613 the beauty of this device is its simple innovative design
992614 although many male circumcision devices are available they have not gained widespread acceptance due to high complication rates or difficulties with surgical technique
992615 even non physician health care providers will be able to learn this procedure to safely perform circumcisions in resource poor regions
992616 our study found that several cm types are used by nearly half of cancer survivors
992617 surprisingly other methods such as acupuncture and hypnosis were used by fewer than 2 of cancer survivors even though recent studies found them to be useful in relieving some cancer related symptoms such as pain we also found that the use of various cm types is significantly influenced by gender race age education cancer type and how far the cancer had spread
992618 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
992619 using il 8 as a biomarker to screen low risk septic shock patients from clinical trials of experimental or potentially high risk therapies is an effective strategy to improve the risk to benefit ratio of a given intervention
992620 excluding patients who respond to standard care would enable investigators to focus clinical trial enrollment on patients least likely to respond well to conventional methods and find the most effective new therapies
992621 its clear from research weve done that parents want to know their childs results and whether there is a concern about their health but they want clear information which is helpful and non stigmatising
992622 today weve published guidance which will help pcts deliver this programme and help to make sure parents get the information they need about their childs results in ways that they have said will be most helpful
992623 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think that their child is a healthy weight this important move isnt about pointing the finger and telling parents that their children are overweight instead its about equipping parents with the information they need to help their children live healthier lives
992624 schools are well placed to make a real difference in tackling obesity with record investment in sport and exercise encouraging active travel to and from home making cooking compulsory in secondary schools scrapping junk food and transforming the quality of school lunches
992625 but at the end of the day parents bring up children not the government schools or health services every parent wants their child to be fit and healthy so its only right to help them make informed decisions about their lives
992626 i never call my wife wife but home for she indeed makes my home
992627 men should be careful lest they cause women to weep for g d counts their tears
992628 we were able to complete the entire 700 square kilometer survey because weather and sea conditions were favorable for seismic data gathering
992629 we will not publish this data it will be used in connection with a revision of the management plans for the barents sea and the areas near the lofoten islands
992630 a n no hay una definici n pero la idea es tratarlo

992636 for weeks now the american people including my constituents in texas have been looking to congress and demanding answers on rising gas prices
992637 senate republicans have consistently presented real initiatives that would boost domestic energy production bring down gas prices and help to free our country from its dangerous dependence on foreign oil
992638 the contrast from thursday night could not be clearer every republican senator except one present voted to stay at work and pass a bipartisan bill while every democratic senator present voted to go home for a month with the job left undone senator reid and speaker pelosi are playing politics with the pocketbooks of my constituents in texas and americans across the country who deserve better from their congress

992687 averaged combined incentives in july were the highest this year for both domestic and japanese automakers
992688 however we anticipate that the fall introduction of 2009 model year vehicles will cause overall industry level incentives to decline in the coming months

992707 i was hoping to have added to the squad by now and brought a few in to give the players a lift
992708 its not just a new face we need its new faces my big concern is that anybody we bring in now probably wont be ready to start the premier league season its now getting to the stage where you are wondering how long it takes for new players to settle etc
992709 im hoping we will have some in before the start of the season but im not going to turn around and say i am totally confident because you never know what happens but yes i am hoping that we will end up getting a few in

992736 mccains message adding domestic oil production to a policy of alternative energy investment and conservation is favored over obamas message that blames oil companies calls for investments in alternative energy and rejects limited offshore drilling
992737 the iraqi government on monday left little doubt that it favors a withdrawal plan for american combat troops similar to what senator barack obama has proposed providing mr obama with a potentially powerful political boost mr obama seemed to have navigated one of the riskiest portions of a weeklong international trip without a noticeable hitch and to have gained a new opportunity to blunt attacks on his national security credentials
992738 obama seems to have been meticulous about constructing a political identity for himself he has always had a healthy understanding of the reaction he elicits in others
992739 even then 1990 the essential elements of obama mania were present the fascination with his early life the adulatory quotes from friends who thought that he would be president one day and obamas frank though sometimes ostentatious capacity for self reflection
992740 yet he has always played politics by the rules as they exist not as he would like them to exist he runs as an outsider but he has succeeded by mastering the inside game
992741 as i see it the two things that youre going to need to address are your executive leadership skills because your resume doesnt have that in it and the second would be your credentials in national security

992745 interestingly oranges have nothing to do with picture framing and he admits himself that it is the quirky unusual stories rather than the worthy big stories that excites journalists attention and leads to coverage
992746 once the darling of the functional food sector omega 3 enrichment is no longer the irresistible business proposition that to some it appeared to be
992747 beyond a small number of leading brands in each country all others will be niche kept on as marginal brands and representing only a tiny percentage of their owners sales and maintained as part of a range largely because competitors are also offering such products
992748 people simply werent interested in having omega 3 in a yogurt product particularly one that is aimed at adults
992749 the category has moved on considerably consumers are now more aware of other foods where they can obtain their intake of omega 3 and having omega 3 as an ingredient in vitality is not a key requirement for the vast majority of yoghurt yoghurt drink consumers
992750 people have started to opt out of the functional sector
992751 the thing to remember with omega 3 foods is that the sector has just begun
992752 in these teething stages products will always come and go but the market remains attractive for omega 3 foods and beverages

992781 okay barack look to the left you want a judicious look right here not too giddy in a military environment definitely not angry at the enemy or your bloggers will freak not bewildered by the complexity of it all or the inexperience charge will stick just that sort of pondering yet confident proud yet wistful adamant yet flexible judiciousness that this years voter wants to see
992782 hey barack we definitely want something pithy here something that shows sober reflectiveness but doesnt make you sound like an egghead from harvard you need to show on one hand that you appreciate the contribution made by our dedicated military personnel who are the best and brightest of our children while at the same time casting a shadow over the unwarranted lah de dah optimism of the bushie neocons you have to explain why we shouldnt have gone in why we now need to get out and why the military did a heck of a job all in ten words or less

992801 a rare amount of freedom during her twenties to find someone of her own choosing
992802 it would not be a stretch to say that shaadi the word for marriage in many indian languages is the first word a child in an indian family understands after mummy and papa to an indian marriage is a matter of karmic destiny
992803 after a decade of juan carloses and affairs with married men and craigslist flirtations and emotionally bankrupt boyfriends and oddly the most painful of all the guys who just never call arranged marriage no longer seemed like the most outlandish possibility
992804 i could go in for a strict arranged marriage an assisted marriage or i could merely date in a pool far more oriented toward marriage than the one i was dealing with in new york city
992805 i t was my fathers own self taught views on women
992806 that had given me hope that i would be able to find a husband in india liberal enough in mind set and outlook to handle me

992812 when the markets turn bullish you always have this situation where they get out of defensive sectors in pharma ranbaxy has been taken out dr reddys labs is actually getting dropped out of the sensex so that is going to affect the trading pattern of it though pharma is a nice place to be in by the time the ranbaxy offer goes through and the money comes back into the market and it gets reinvested in pharma it is going to take a little bit of time therefore pharma has been a little bit out
992813 in it i personally think the rupee is heading back towards 40 and as a result of which the it sector would probably not do well it has had a good run when the rupee went from 39 to 42 but i think we are headed back to 40
992814 i would buy in infrastructure because infrastructure will probably get pe money now the guys whove been in infrastructure have kind of said no we dont want private equity because we are able to get interest money cheap but now they are going to have to take private equity money and the ratios will get back so they will continue their projects and we definitely need to have that infrastructure being spent and thats going to push our economy the whole world is actually looking at india and chinas infrastructure spend to sort of lead them out of the mess

992822 the lasting memory of that day was the violence and explosion of energy of the impact between the two cars
992823 i can remember seeing a white car sliding sideways into my lane at horrendous speed i cant even recall breaking because it happened so fast
992824 i could feel the car spinning around in the road until it came to a sudden stop in the barriers
992825 there was heat and lots of fine dust which came from air bags
992826 i tried to open the door but i knew i would never have been able to get out of the car because of the searing pain in my back
992827 when i was in the car the morphine the paramedics gave me didnt even touch the pain
992828 there was such an unbearable feeling in my back it was dreadful
992829 i was feeling awful with a temperature the shivers fever and sickness
992830 at one point i had four drips saline morphine anti biotics and the blood transfusion
992831 i have had all my stitches out of my leg and the staples have come out of my back but im not under any illusions about how long its going to take
992832 the pain killers are effective and i can walk to a certain extent sitting up is more painful than anything else
992833 if i stay in one position for too long it gets painful and i have to lie down when i wake up in the morning in bed i just ache all over
992834 both of my legs are numb from the knees down which was caused by the pressure on the nerves in my back
992835 it may be a result of the surgery but they cant say for sure that the feeling is going to go it could be a long term thing
992836 i am taking things day by day every day i feel my legs getting a little bit stronger
992837 a few miles an hour more or a few degrees at a different angle and it could have been totally different
992838 i could have come out of it ten different ways and they are all worse than how i ended up
992839 i cant get past the accident itself whatever happened before that has not entered my head
992840 i feel i have been so lucky that i cant think of anything negative to say about anyone
992841 its only when something like this happens that you realise how many people are involved in your treatment and recovery
992842 i would like to thank so many special people that carry out their work day in day out without even knowing the profound effect they have on peoples lives
992843 i would like to thank the police who were first on the scene and for their visits to me and the support they gave to my family throughout my stay in hospital
992844 the paramedics for trying to keep me relaxed while treating my injuries when i was still inside the car
992845 both firefighting crews that attended the crash and who cut me out of the car as quickly and gently as my injuries would allow
992846 to all the a and e staff for my initial assessment and treatment and also that day the mri cat scans and x ray teams
992847 both surgical teams that carried out work to my legs and back it must be second nature to them but to me its a miracle what they do every day
992848 the biggest heartfelt thanks needs to go to all the staff on the saxmundham ward at ipswich hospital
992849 finally to my partner in crime oliver in the next bed who was admitted the same day with a broken back who over the next two weeks without being able to move kept me sane and positive
992850 i treasure our friendship and look forward to seeing us both up and about
992851 the response from family friends work colleges and unknown well wishers via the evening star e mail address has been a great boost to my family and i would also like to thank the evening star for the sensitive way they have gone about reporting the accident and the subsequent follow ups
992852 i feel honoured and extremely humbled by the people ive met over last three weeks and not to mention a little ashamed that its taken this accident to release how many special people are carrying out their extraordinary jobs from day to day
992853 i got to the lights at the end of the road and could see part of woodbridge road had been closed
992854 i couldnt take it in i thought this cant be robs accident
992855 i couldnt understand how the crash could be so big because i knew rob couldnt have been travelling very fast
992856 he knew daddy had a poorly back and they spoke on the phone but he couldnt really work out where he was
992857 we have always done things together so charlie found it really hard because he didnt have daddy around
992858 his behaviour changed so much that it meant i couldnt leave him to go and visit rob
992859 since robs been back charlies been so good its amazing how a two year old can take it all in

992864 hes had some medical issues but youre never ready for something like this
992865 were all very shocked by the timing its a very sad day for family and for braves fans i think the braves fans feel theyre part of skips family
992866 he had a huge impact on a lot of peoples lives and he had a huge impact on my life
992867 during the season we spent more time together than we did with our families and our lives
992868 i was really nervous that we made the wrong call there

992883 erm nothing too smart cant stand that just a short sleeved shirt and definitely some surf shorts to show his legs and then some trainers and i like it when men wear leather jewellery
992884 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
992885 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
992886 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
992887 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
992888 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
992889 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
992890 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
992891 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
992892 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
992893 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
992894 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
992895 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
992896 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
992897 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
992898 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
992899 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
992900 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
992901 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
992902 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
992903 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
992904 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
992905 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
992906 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
992907 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
992908 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
992909 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
992910 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
992911 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
992912 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
992913 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
992914 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
992915 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
992916 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
992917 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
992918 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
992919 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
992920 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
992921 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
992922 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
992923 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
992924 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
992925 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
992926 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
992927 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
992928 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
992929 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
992930 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
992931 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
992932 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
992933 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
992934 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
992935 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
992936 comparisons of infant mortality rates by place and time should be adjusted for the proportion of such live births especially if the comparisons involve recent years
992937 we do expect water use to go up because of the heat and we encourage people to watch their water use
992938 what rain we have had has kept irrigation use down
992939 if it keeps one of them away thats fine with me
992940 an attack on iran which israeli and bush administration officials appear set to carry out if iranian uranium enrichment is not halted would ignite a regional war in the middle east

992946 we are very excited to work with an affiliation network like brightshare
992947 wild jack mobile casinos game play is world class and will definitely be something that our end users will love as always with texomobile we have listened to our wapmasters and given them something they know their communities want
992948 17 year old yousif amira who was shot in the nearby nilin village on wednesday evening has been pronounced dead

992950 it is from the first amendment that all our other liberties flow
992951 before it was taboo to even talk openly about condoms
992952 groups still oppose condom use but at least we can mention the word
992953 we are not giving needles to people who are not drug users
992954 were giving needles to people who are already using those drugs this is a way to avoid hiv infections
992955 could be more effectively deployed elsewhere especially through alternative approaches to increasing insurance coverage
992956 many employers currently only offer health insurance because of this tax bribe and ending the exclusion would lead to a large erosion of employer sponsored insurance
992957 a large new set of uninsured who cannot afford or cannot obtain at any price non group insurance
992958 we cannot continue on our current path but we must strike a balance we need to fix whats broken without breaking whats working
992959 the raf search and rescue teams are the most dedicated and professional in the world
992960 they provide at least one committed standby helicopter at six bases throughout the united kingdom able to respond within 15 minutes
992961 changes have been made to crew structures at these bases in order to provide additional support to our top priority operations in iraq and afghanistan
992962 this will not affect normal search and rescue capability and our support to civil authorities during recent flooding shows our ability to respond flexibly to extraordinary requirements
992963 operations are always our priority we have to focus our resources on the front line

992975 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
992976 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
992977 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
992978 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
992979 dont think about final fantasy xiii xbox 360 right now
992980 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
992981 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
992982 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
992983 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

992989 cuil does a good job of guessing what well want next
992990 its about time people starting experiencing different ways of seeing search results even google presents them in a fairly limited way
992991 the big factors will be how quickly they can get fresh content such as breaking news into the search results and how they deal with spam where websites try to trick search engines into thinking they are more relevant than they are
992992 well be back soon due to overwhelming interest our cuil servers are running a bit hot right now the search engine is momentarily unavailable as we add more capacity thanks for your patience

992997 were not caused primarily by an economic downturn the subprime crisis or other general market forces
992998 the astonishing meltdown of the funds was caused by their extreme overconcentration in securities that were very high risk and illiquid by the funds failure to value their assets at reasonable fair value prior to the third quarter of 2007 and by the failure of the funds to disclose properly all material risks and the true facts
992999 new and complex structured investments that had never been tested in a down market cycle
993000 its an open question as to whether the funds are ultimately salvageable
993001 when i speak to all these people ill ask them to support the fight against this illness to give us medicine because its expensive and to campaign more so children dont get infected
993002 stigma and discrimination is going to be a very important theme of this years conference and which is going to come up again and again over the next few days
993003 stigma discrimination and human rights would indeed be the focus of the conference
993004 when i started work on hiv and aids back in 1984 i assumed it would be over in ten years twenty seven years later it is still growing
993005 not a single country that has been declared aids free
993006 setting this precedence is very important indeed to stomp off stigma and discrimination and while we see this openness at international conferences we do not find the same replicated at national ones
993007 the growing hiv epidemic among the msm in asia reminds me of the times when it was found only in the west and australia the history of aids is one of surprises it pops up where and when you least expect and thus its far too early to declare victory
993008 stigma is a state of mind expressed sometimes in very violent ways specially when it comes to msms
993009 whosoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man woman or animal shall be punished with imprisonment for life or 10 years
993010 they took me through underground passages and made me sit in another waiting room for almost 45 minutes a man approached me and called me to another room for interrogation he asked me to sit down and presented himself as moshe
993011 after all my responses he said to me i want to talk to you openly when you return from israel so that you will have an acceptable reputation on the israeli side
993012 i might divorce because i cant stand in front of my wife as a disabled person

993016 meltdown the inside story of the north korean nuclear crisis
993017 its interesting that the transcript remains classified but it appears that a north korean offical used much more ambiguous language and also tabled an offer to negotiate which kelly rejected
993018 there are parallels and differences obviously with the way the intelligence became a source of controversy in iraq but unlike iraq the actual intelligence that the americans had in north korea in the spring and summer of 2002 was pretty solid
993019 but the combination of internal politics and media generalization created an impression that it was somewhat different from the reality
993020 they wanted to use this as a flaming red star cluster into the sky that the north koreans cheated abrogated the agreed framework we always told you this was a bad idea
993021 there is an irony here that the hardliners attempt to pressure the north koreans to give up the bomb in fact created circumstances where the north became a nuclear power and made the whole process of undoing their nuclear program much much harder than had they adopted a similar approach at the beginning

993034 i am a democrat and here is my energy plan
993035 with upwards of 70 of americans convinced increased domestic oil production may at least help bring down gasoline prices the congress became a calamity today as ham fisted democrats led by house speaker nancy pelosi squashed debate to cut and run on five week paid vacations at home and even abroad in some cases with all travel and gasoline expenses footed by american taxpayers many of whom might just be staying home themselves this summer as a result of rising fuel prices with a party beholden to extreme environmentalist who have stifled nuclear generation and increases in domestic oil production and refining for decades the democrats are in denial if they think the republicans will not pull out all the stops to place the current gasoline situation squarely in their laps where it belongs meanwhile over in the senate democrats refused to support emergency measures for relief even if gasoline rose to the ridiculous price of 10 a gallon house speaker pelosi has as much as admitted that they fear debate as it will allow republicans to place blame for the energy situation on democrats

993038 the majority of more than 180 fatah supporters who fled into israel from the gaza strip were in israeli custody yesterday after a dramatic escape from a hamas crackdown that left nine people dead in fierce fighting in gaza wary israeli troops allowed the gazans to cross the heavily guarded border on saturday stripping them first to make sure none was wearing explosives mortar shells hit near the crossing as the palestinians fled their homes for the territory of their long time enemy the israeli soldiers prepared stretchers and ambulances rushed the badly wounded to nearby hospitals the incident punctuated one of the new realities of the conflict palestinian infighting has become so bitter that some fear israel less than they do each other the violence began on saturday when hamas forces launched a raid on a crowded gaza city neighbourhood dominated by the hilles clan linked to fatah the sides battled each other with mortars and machine guns
993039 why should the german be interested in the liberation of the jew if the jew is not interested in the liberation of the german we recognize in judaism therefore a general anti social element of the present time in the final analysis the emancipation of the jews is the emancipation of mankind from judaism indeed in north america the practical domination of judaism over the christian world has achieved as its unambiguous and normal expression that the preaching of the gospel itself and the christian ministry have become articles of trade money is the jealous god of israel in face of which no other god may exist

993051 reduce d spending on private health insurers serving about nine million elderly and disabled patients through medicare advantage
993052 taking choices away from seniors in order to pay for the reimbursements for physicians is the wrong way to pass this bill and to extend the reimbursements that we want to see physicians get

993090 aspiritus were paying all fees due up until may of this year
993091 after that date when no settlement was received by the due dates inside gaming queried this with greg young who had no idea as to why settlement had not been made he referred the matter to greg kennedy who had been responsible for authorising all the past payments
993092 when only part payment was later made we requested further details as to why it was not until some time later that we received a notification from their aspiritus legal counsel that some monies were in dispute we responded on advice from our legal counsel to all the issues raised
993093 some time later we were informed by greg young that greg kennedy had told him that he was to take instruction only from clare isaac their legal counsel and that in short he wished to pay inside gaming the money owed and close the operation down
993094 inside gaming took the decision to leave the product up for its players to use until this decision was formalised and monies were paid
993095 in order to protect their business and to assist aspiritus in managing the expectations of their players inside gaming made a respectable offer to resolve the matter with aspiritus and to change the terms of the contract further in their favour but this was rejected point blank by aspiritus
993096 inside gaming then responded to that letter requesting payment of all outstanding monies forthwith along with payment in lieu of the notice period defined in the contract
993097 to date we have had no further response or correspondence from the company
993098 aspiritus are in material breach of the contract with inside gaming but despite that inside gaming has endeavoured to honour commitments which meant that aspiritus players could continue to play at the casino and poker games up until the gaming servers were stopped on 30 july
993099 in addition they have damaged inside gaming s business by refusing to pay the monies their players have lost to other players in the ipoker poker network along with the other fees payable as per the agreement inside gaming did attempt to reduce the risk so that players were not able to dump their funds to other players in the network as this would be a breach of the poker network terms

993145 its wrong of the islamic council to wait for the
993146 im 100 percent certain that the fatwa council will not come out in favour something which conflicts with european law the council wasnt able to deal with the question of homosexuality this time but it thinks that subject is quite relevant and wants to look at the matter more
993147 its very important to have the european fatwa council with us in difficult matters like this i am not in favour of the death penalty but there are islamic texts that various people understand differently this is why we need to know the attitude of the authority before we make a decision
993148 to present to the muslim world and the muslim minorities in the west particularly
993149 the shariah cannot be amended to conform to changing human values and standards rather it is the absolute norm to which all human values and conduct must conform it is the frame to which they must be referred it is the scale on which they must be weighed
993150 he is telling me that he will prove his innocence by truth and that he is proud of what he did and that he had been saving the serb people from slaughter by muslims and croats
993151 muslim media witch hunt which began even before the beginning of the armed conflict and which proclaimed me a war criminal at a time when the only victims were serbs it is now unimaginable to many people that this court could acquit me i believe that this fact seriously jeopardizes the trial itself
993152 i must say that this is a matter of life and death if mr holbrooke still wants my death and regrets that there is no death sentence here i wonder if his arm is long enough to reach me here
993153 i am sure that he is going to put all the charges against him aside he learned from milosevics and seseljs trials that using the indictee chair for sending political messages and defending yourself through accusing someone else is the best defense
993154 i knew that since ive always been a writer of one sort or another
993155 and have always been a beatles fan it was somehow in the cards for me to someday write a beatles book but knowing how many hundreds and even thousands of books have been written about them i wasnt sure if id be able to contribute a new perspective on their career
993156 several years ago i finally hit on the idea to compile an oral history of the entire beatlemania era as told by the original fans who got swept up in the hysteria as teenagers
993157 after all there have been oral histories of the great depression and world war ii so why not complie one about the beatlemania era i presented it to my agent but he wasnt especially keen on it so i put it on the back burner
993158 in 2005 i put together a piece for beatlefan magazine commemorating the 40th anniversary of their legendary shea stadium concert i managed to find people who attended the concert and interviewing them was so enjoyable i decided to revive my original idea
993159 i discovered that the articles for which fans were interviewed before or after beatles concerts included the teenagers full names and street addresses in several cases i was able to find family members still at the same addresses over 40 years later who in turn had the beatles fanatics i was looking for contact me
993160 i very carefully arranged their stories in chronological order the final result being a true history of the beatles career from the earliest rumblings about them in america in late 63 through the break up and their solo years right to the present
993161 id have to say that although i enjoy each chapter of the book immensely from the genuinely funny accounts of how the contributors reacted to seeing the beatles first ed sullivan show appearance to the almost surreal nature of the shea stadium concert my favorite sections are the last two the original fans today and reflecting here the contributors call upon their hindsight and life experiences in the years since their teenage craziness over the beatles to give it all an intelligent and warm perspective
993162 garry berman does a great job of presenting the story of the beatles from the invasion to the breakup and beyond through the eyes of dozens and dozens of fans who were witnesses to it all
993163 there is a place i want to go to but i dont know where there is someone i want to meet but i dont know who
993164 its better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
993165 it is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves
993166 the greatest and most powerful single indictment of a political regime ever to be leveled in modern times
993167 the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of russian literature
993168 in the midst of exhausting prison camp relocations marching in a column of prisoners in the gloom of bitterly cold evenings with strings of camp lights glimmering through the darkness we would often feel rising in our breast what we would have wanted to shout out to the whole world if only the whole world could have heard us
993169 it is within the power of writers and artists to do much more to defeat the lie
993170 in terms of the effect he has had on history solzhenitsyn is the dominant writer of the 20th century who else compares orwell koestler and yet when his name comes up now it is more often than not as a freak a monarchist an anti semite a crank a has been
993171 solzhenitsyn is a notable writer but his political views are an embarrassment even to his fellow dissidents
993172 not only would a meeting with the president offend the soviets but it would raise some controversy about solzhenitsyns views of the united states and its allies
993173 we were laughing and agreeing about how we thought solzhenitsyns views on the united states his criticism of the press and all the rest were deeply wrong and on and on
993174 and then joseph said but you know susan everything solzhenitsyn says about the soviet union is true
993175 shukov felt pleased with his life as he went to sleep
993176 the end of an unclouded day almost a happy one
993177 just one of the 3 653 days of his sentence from bell to bell the extra three days were for leap years
993178 you have described only one day and yet everything there is to say about prison has been said
993179 theres a stalinist in each of you theres even a stalinist in me we must root out this evil
993180 it is impossible to go on writing as one did before
993181 probably i would not have survived eight years of the camps if as a mathematician i had not been assigned for three years to a sharashka
993182 i was like the sick people all around me and yet i was different
993183 i had fewer rights than they had and was forced to be more silent people came to visit them and their one concern their one aim in life was to get well again but if i recovered it would be almost pointless i was 35 years of age and yet in that spring i had no one i could call my own in the whole world i did not even own a passport and if i were to recover i should have to leave this green abundant land and go back to my desert where i had been exiled in perpetuity there i was under open surveillance reported on every fortnight and for a long time the local police had not even allowed me a dying man to go away for treatment
993184 demand and ensure the abolition of all censorship open or hidden
993185 no one can bar the road to truth and to advance its cause i am prepared to accept even death
993186 courageous creative work upholding the sense of human dignity and exposing the trampling of the human soul and the destruction of human values
993187 she simply joined me in my struggle and we went side by side
993188 in a strange way i not only hope i am inwardly convinced that i shall go back
993189 i live with that conviction i mean my physical return not just my books and that contradicts all rationality
993190 he wrote ate and slept and that was about all
993191 for him to accept a telephone call was an event he rarely left his 50 acres
993192 instead of secluding myself here and writing the red wheel i suppose i could have spent time making myself likable to the west
993193 the only problem is that i would have had to drop my way of life and my work
993194 his own convictions are deeply rooted in the russian spirit which is untempered by the civilizing influences of a democratic tradition
993195 like the russian masses he we may assume has strong authoritarian tendencies
993196 leading intellectuals here consider his oratory hollow his time past and his mission unclear
993197 in fact is not anti semitic his books are not anti semitic and he is not in his personal relations anti jewish natalias mother is jewish and not a few of his friends are too
993198 is not worth a brass farthing if it is installed by bayonet
993199 inherited a ransacked and bewildered country with a poor and demoralized people and he started to do what was possible a slow and gradual restoration

993214 i am so nervous yet ecstatic at the same time about a month ago samantha lewis showed me my scene wow it was totally insane to sit back and watch myself kind of like an out of body experience
993215 one of the interesting parts of adult entertainment is taking an extremely personal action like sex and making it public to everyone yet every time i shoot a scene the sex continues to feel personal and sensual even with the cameras rolling and the more practice i get the hotter the result
993216 when we first met i knew gabriella fox had all the makings of a star she has a sultry beauty that reminds me of a young sophia loren gabriella isnt a big talker but she speaks volumes with her eyes control 9 is just a small taste of what this new superstar can do

993218 full of fuck for the buck strokability and replay value that will serve fans a very long time as inspirational material i could see why gabriella fox was picked up for a contract her sleek form and winning smile proving irresistible while showing all the potential of a newcomer yet to fully blossom i look forward to seeing her perform again given the skill she showed during her oral antics this might be the latest winner contracted by the company

993223 besides vegas is my home strippers are my sisters and these guys produce hot shows labor day weekend my favorite place what could be better
993224 this sounded like such a great gig the moment i heard about it no way i was turning this down
993225 im doing this a long time but between music burlesque celebrities and strippers this might be the greatest talent lineup weve ever assembled
993226 then again we wanted to go over the top because its vegas baby

993234 industry veteran jon islas the president of dynasty group distribution has always impressed me with his knowledge of the classic genre and his relationships with the real players in adult distribution
993235 when he first told me of his intent to start a distribution company that specialized in the classics i told him that i wanted to be his first company ive known jon for six years and count him as one of the best salesman in the business as well as a trusted friend

993246 six goals is good but it doesnt matter i am just happy to score goals but more important will be the first game against portsmouth and i hope i can do the same then
993247 i know how florent plays because i play with him in the national team and i knew what he was going to do they were very good crosses for me and easy to finish
993248 it is great for the strikers and he has had a fantastic pre season scoring in almost every game
993249 see the caribbean as a low priority for each obama and mccain and express little optimism that either will produce radical change

993280 i want to be totally up front and honest with everyone that the original lineup will not be touring my band after death will be doing the tour as nocturnus we will be playing at least 7 of the 10 songs on the key nocturnus classic the key album as well as a couple of old morbid angel songs done the way they were originally written on abominations of desolation mike davis was asked and he didnt want to do the tour as he and i were the ones who wrote pretty much everything on the key lou louis panzer keyboards and sean mcnenney guitar were not asked to do this what people will see will be a show that no one else can faithfully perform containing old nocturnus and morbid angel material that i either wrote or co wrote and it will be done the way it was meant to be written and performed not some contrived rock star version the tour will be from october 13 27 13 shows only to be done in europe because of these u s trademark restrictions from the former members who did indeed steal the name and band i created back in 1988
993281 thats the beauty i think of writing vague but powerful lyrics that someone like a movie director can interpret it in his own way and obviously someone creative is able to take the metaphors and apply them to whatever he needs in his own life
993282 naiinis ako na inaksaya ng pangulo ang pagkakataong ito im very disappointed and a bit confused the president wanted to project herself as a caring leader but clearly what she deeply cares about the most is keeping the oil vat
993283 wala pa ring malinaw na plano kung papaano tayo makakatawid sa panahon ng krisis obviously patuloy pa rin ang mantra ng palasyo squeeze the people then spend the vat walang debate walang konsultasyon an early information source for mar roxas bid for presidency in 2010
993284 there has been a migration of functions and authorities from u s civilian agencies to the department of defense
993285 removing the vat on oil will not spell the end of government social programs hindi sona ang nangyari kahapon kundi isandaang dahilan kung bakit dapat ipagpatuloy ang vat sa langis what happened yesterday was not a sona but a hundred reasons why vat on oil should continue
993286 bakit naman na ang sentro ng buong programa ng pangulo at ng gobyerno ay itong vat sa langis na decimal point lang sa buong budget ng gobyerno why was vat on oil the center of the presidents and the governments whole program while its only a decimal point of the whole budget
993287 kung tayo ang namumuno ang gobyerno ang magsasakripisyo at hindi ang mamamayan gobyerno ang magsisikap na ayusin ang koleksyon at alisin ang mga gastusing hindi kailangan hindi sasakalin lalo ang naghihingalong mamamayan if were in charge the government would be the one to sacrifice and not the people the government should be striving to make collections and spending efficiently and not further choking our people
993288 the government must make a sacrifice by removing vat on oil improving collections of taxes and duties and plugging the leaks in government spending thats the tough decision that the government has yet to make
993289 now the situation is different we should not close our eyes or refuse to listen to other opinions and continue taking a medicine thats not appropriate anymore
993290 vero non ti sento non riesco a sentirti ma tu lo sai che ho capito che non puoi stare con me dammi solo un bacio prima di uscire ed esci in fretta non restare con me che rendo infelice me stessa e te ed ogni uomo che incontro
993291 lamore non esiste e comunque se c non l fuori
993292 non mi mandare via se non mi senti non importa ma non mandarmi via
993293 anche se non mi senti non importa ma non mandarmi via
993294 more than a litany of dole outs the president should focus on increasing the productivity and incomes of the poor especially our farmers and others in the agriculture sector who are now harvesting less and earning less due to the high cost of farm inputs like fertilizer
993295 we recognize that dole outs are needed to alleviate the pain of those who are already at the end of the road but this should not be the be all and end all of how we will approach the ongoing food and oil price crisis
993296 more filipinos now are saying that they have felt hunger this is bound to get worse if not addressed we in congress must urgently enact tools to fight hunger but we can only do so if this is considered as the top priority by the administration
993297 of the presidents past and present state of the nation addresses sonas
993298 sona this monday that is attuned to the realities being faced by filipinos today
993299 a recent survey shows most of our people consider the sonas since 2005 as far from the truth or irrelevant to their lives
993300 we need to empower the people to check the sonas against reality and to audit promises made against actual deliveries by giving them free access to information regarding government affairs except those related to national security and foreign policy
993301 to some the imposition may be minuscule and insignificant but to ofws and their families such imposition becomes another financial burden
993302 every peso saved can make a big difference for the average filipino family removing the dst from ofw remittances can enable the families of overseas workers buy additional food or save this amount for other purposes
993303 as if high prices of oil and rice were not enough even the currency that our ofws earn in has diminished in value we need to give these new heroes the support that they need and deserve understanding their great contribution to our economy
993304 an early information source for mar roxas bid for presidency in 2010
993305 we demand complete transparency the executive must disclose the details of the peace agreement what did we get what did we give up and why is the postponement of the armm elections related to these points
993306 without this any discussion on the proposal to postpone the polls will only be a futile exchange of vague statements an early information source for mar roxas bid for presidency in 2010
993307 for the sake of japan philippine relations i told them that its important for us to have a meeting of minds on this issue and put this in writing in an official exchange of letters
993308 we need to strengthen ties with our key economic partners at this time when world food and oil prices are going through the roof these adversely impact upon our peoples interest in terms of incomes jobs and livelihoods as well as our countrys competitiveness and geopolitical strategies
993309 our country will get left behind because the rest of asean already have epas with japan
993310 ang mga pagkakataon na nakapaloob dito sa jpepa ay hawak natin hamon sa gobyerno na itong mga potential gains ay maipatupad sang ayon sa ating pambansang interes
993311 if we want to improve our youths education outcomes and give them a better chance to progress we cant be in business as usual mode anymore
993312 we cant raise our education standards by doing just more of the same we cant drop a larger lump sum in the lap of deped and expect things to get better
993313 do you know how to row an open oar lock boat
993314 in the d a s office have a cow because he might be late or not show up at all hes seriously having a cow
993315 that the twin towers are gone because of white people
993316 americans have precious little reason to complain when others play by their rules and follow their example
993317 there was this wm that said he hardly thinks he has white priviledge when he is a struggling college student poor and that it has not made his life easier and helped him he doesnt deny that white priviledge exist are there whites that dont receive or benefit from white priviledge and others that do
993318 they do not understand that the ghettos are so screwed up because of them
993319 killing 3000 unarmed men women and children is an evil and cowardly act
993320 the 9 11 hijackers are not innocents but then neither are the americans
993321 if any black pilots dropped bombs on hanoi or dresden i would be very surprised and i would be very interested in knowing their names and knowing more about them
993322 the 9 11 hijackers are not innocents but then neither are the americans
993323 it isnt that the smucks will not own up to responsibility the smucks cant find dresden on a map
993324 the 9 11 hijackers are not innocents but then neither are the americans
993325 it is unwise i would not have made that appointment these are turbulent times for the country the stock market is volatile the peso is losing steam we are beset with global uncertainties
993326 it is not the time to appoint someone with minimal real life work experience in the marketplace to sit atop the sss which has nearly 30 million members besides this appointment will just drive unneeded political controversy
993327 and so much more which i cant be able to list down in this post
993328 this blog was also mentioned in mar roxas in 2010
993329 the next elections will most likely be an affirmation of the power of blogs
993330 it is my first time to see a blog site with political campaign motive behind
993331 i see this type of movement as informative and promising as long as the information in it are reliable and true
993332 level up is hosting the ragnarok world championships this year there are 32 participating countries and they will fly to manila to compete at the world trade center on october 18 19 2008 its a big thing not just for the online gaming industry but for the country as well this will go down in history as the grandest and biggest online gaming tournament ever to be hosted in the philippines
993333 if we want to improve our youths education outcomes and give them a better chance to progress we cant be in business as usual mode anymore
993334 we cant raise our education standards by doing just more of the same we cant drop a larger lump sum in the lap of deped and expect things to get better
993335 we need to have a focused approach in improving philippine education we have to get to the root of the problem of poor student performance insufficient aptitude of teachers and the overall resources provided to our youth
993336 kung sa aritmetik lang pinakamalaki na nga ang nakukuha ng edukasyon sa budget ang tanong bukod sa sapat ba ito ay tama ba ang paggamit dito arithmetically education gets the largest chunk of the budget but the question aside from is it sufficient is is it spent the right way
993337 he added the bill also seeks that ten years after reforms have been implemented improvements in key metrics must have already been achieved such as

993340 what ever happened to waterbeds does anyone still have a waterbed
993341 there was a skylight in the room and a man up on the roof fixing it he kept making scary faces at me it was very traumatic
993342 most of my earliest memories are of visiting my dad after the divorce i guess those memories stick out more than all the normal days i spent with my mom
993343 all i really remember are small traumas or separations like how after a night of good sleep you only recall details from the one nightmare
993344 doom is destined to become the master of this world but i have little interest in ruling a drug addled populace my only desire is to eradicate this will sapping mind stealing plague
993345 thriving is part art part science and part grace a thriving business must not only accommodate but support life in all its complexity a thriving business requires and provides resilience and continuity how do you go about building a thriving career or business here are some of the things ive learned and that i credit with supporting my own thriving business 1 recognize that life happens there will be ups and downs in your personal life and ups and downs in business when you can accept these ebbs and flows of attention energy and focus you will better be able to adjust to changing conditions both in your heart and in your environment 2 cultivate systems practices and networks that provide continuity for example this newsletter and my web site are ongoing and reliable means of staying in touch with a meaningful network in good times and in bad 3 pay attention to transitions when change is happening it can be easy to get caught up in reactionary thoughts and feelings that can muddy your thinking and make complex situations chaotic learning to detach and observe your reactions thoughts and fears will help you keep a steadier course without being rigid 4 learn to notice when things are expanding and when they are contracting and choose your strategies accordingly 5 learn to regard mistakes as stepping stones to mastery avoid wasting time in needless guilt and defensiveness seize the opportunity to correct your error and move on
993346 our first reaction to most of the statements which we hear from other people is an evaluation or judgement rather than an understanding of it
993347 ben your are impossible your opinions have a slap in them for everyone who differs with you they have become so offensive that nobody cares for them your friends find they enjoy themselves better when youre not around you know so much that no man can tell you anything
993348 why did you just do that this guy almost ruined your car and couldve sent us to the hospital
993349 many people are like garbage trucks they run around full of garbage full of frustration full of anger and full of disappointment as their garbage piles up they need a place to dump it and if you let them theyll dump it on you when someone wants to dump on you dont take it personally instead just smile wave wish them well and move on youll be happier because you did
993350 for as long as you are capable of anger there are lessons to learn thoughts become things make yours good ones
993351 in reality seeks to modify the social and cultural reality of spain transforming its identity
993352 this social and cultural project aims to construct a secular society without any moral or religious reference attempting to impose nihilist thought and deliberately eliminating everything catholic from public life
993353 powerful and sometimes dark forces present everywhere from the media to schools
993354 thus the church is presented as the enemy of democracy and modernization opposed to science and progress against freedom the enemy of happiness or the promoter of division confrontation and violence in an effort to isolate religion to private life
993355 the silencing of god is the fundamental event of our times
993356 there is nothing else that compares in terms of its radicalism and serious consequences
993357 they had just been in the basement in tiny interconnected cages sitting there not doing anything
993358 it really put a damper on them not being with any enrichment
993359 jamie one of the chimps is incredibly smart and fascinated by everything she used to sit there plucking the hair out of her belly because she was so bored
993360 they are finally in an environment where they can express themselves
993361 we talk in their language and understand their behavior we do a lot of bobbing our heads
993362 when theyre upset we make sure we give them space
993363 its like building a relationship with a human it has to all be mutual
993364 i was there to investigate how chimps trained for movies and tv shows you hear all these old stories about these brutal training methods
993365 i saw a lot of brutal treatment there it was really rough to see
993366 it was really hard to do the work but in the end it was all worth it they are so much better off now than they were
993367 theyre like humans its not surprising that she recognized me
993368 but we are pretty similar i view them as people who i take care of
993369 theyve been through so much theyve been poked and prodded they are so resilient and so forgiving its bittersweet because you know its never enough
993370 so much of the focus on this issue has been in africa but there the interface between humans and other primates is decreasing the intensity of bush meat hunting and infectious diseases have taken a huge toll on primate populations there individuals in africa who are interacting with other primates are often very isolated from other humans they live in small rural villages which limits the potential spread of pathogens
993371 some macaque species thrive in human altered environments given the tolerance of the local people
993372 this is a heterogeneous sample subjects reported contact with primates in a variety of contexts it seems that some of these contexts are going to be very important but they haven t been studied much zoo workers and bush meat hunters have been typically considered at the highest risk for viral transmission but none of the zoo workers or hunters in our sample tested positive for sfv
993373 the high prevalence of mental disorders we observed in these chimpanzees offers a new reason to support proposals to stop using great apes in laboratory experiments
993374 we now know that a chimpanzees mind and emotional well being are affected by experimentation in ways that parallel the psychological trauma experienced by victims of torture and other forms of abuse
993375 it is the failure to develop and validate modern non animal tests that perpetuates the reliance on out dated animal experimentation and when these procedures are carried out on our closest animal relatives people are rightly appalled
993376 there is huge political and public support for a european ban on the use of great apes and dr ferdowsians research makes an already strong case unanswerable
993377 the kipunji is hanging on by the thinnest of threads
993378 we must do all we can to safeguard this extremely rare and little understood species while there is still time

993393 the bjp knew that it cannot defeat the upa on the floor of the house as it did not have the numbers therefore they wanted to enact an episode to use it as an issue in the coming elections

993396 nobody in the country will believe the drama they enacted when they could not topple the government they resorted to this game they have now become demoralised and unable to show their faces to people
993397 if i do not talk to ahmad patel will i be talking to advani
993398 assuming that i or my wife had given the money then why the bjp leaders did not ask for conducting forensic test of the currency and examine the finger prints

993401 categorical opinion that if the child is born it would suffer from serious handicaps
993402 it is the job of the legislature to help you alter the provision we cannot legislate the provision
993403 that really is the objective of the sunday kutcheri in the park to be able to provide a platform for such young children to display their musical talent
993404 we chose to focus on young children as we believed it would help them shed their inhibitions and give them the confidence to move up to the next level children as young as 6 years have performed at the sunday kutcheri
993405 the big challenge for us is the ambient noise this is a debate that has gone on now for 2 years sometimes people have said to me personally that we were being very ostrich like in forcing these children to sing without mikes and speakers that they couldnt be heard and that they couldnt do justice to their art
993406 we have to be conscious and mindful of the fact that we operate in a public place
993407 the fact is there are people who come to the park to do yoga meditate and to do a variety of things it would be presumptuous on our part to assume that all of them are lovers of carnatic music therefore the first thing we decided was no mikes no speakers we decided to do it in a confined space whereby those who are interested can come seeking this but we will not impose this on someone who doesnt necessarily want to be bothered by carnatic music
993408 that is something we struggle with and is a compromise we have had to make
993409 what is not apparent when people come to the park on the first sunday of every month is the background work that goes into making the kutcheri happen our senior colleagues take time off to sit through the audition rank these children and actually pick them to perform it is fairly demanding in terms of peoples time effort and passion
993410 we have often found regular morning walkers at the park staying back after their walk to enjoy the kutcheri and to appreciate the young children over time the first sunday of every month has become a regular feature in the calendar of several of the morning walkers
993411 the mikeless kutcheri is an interesting and innovative concept the children were initially surprised and a little tense when they were told that there would be no mikes and speakers but they enjoyed their first ever experience of a mikeless open air kutcheri
993412 the sunday kutcheri in the park is a unique concept providing opportunities for talented young children from even the outskirts of chennai what surprised us was the big crowd early in the morning and that was a big boost to their confidence
993413 for us living in the us its always the sabhas that come to mind when we think of music in chennai it was the first time we were introduced to a mikeless kutcheri and in an open air environment the audience was so close and almost sitting around us it was quite unique something we had not experienced earlier
993414 i dont want to hype this more than what it is having said that it certainly is a platform for young children to showcase their musical talent children who first performed here have gone on to cut their own cd album one of the children who first sang at the sunday kutcheri was nominated for a prestigious young musician award that for us is very heartening those for whom we provided a platform blossoming and moving on that is the real return on investment for us
993415 my learning through our experiment at the sundaram finance mylapore festival and the sunday kutcheri in the park is that actually more and more youngsters seem to be getting interested in classical art forms and music certainly is a large part of that if you look at the enthusiasm with which these children are learning and performing i wouldnt subscribe to the view which sometimes is expressed that music is dying out or that there is no appreciation of our culture i think that fear is a little ill founded
993416 that is something we need to address but i wouldnt blame the children for lack of interest or lack of talent
993417 over the last couple of years several people have suggested that we take the kutcheri in the park to other locations in chennai given our infrastructure and our limitations we picked nageswara rao park and carnatic music we believe that this park model can be replicated in fact we have had people from other locations visiting us to understand our model so they could replicate this in their own local parks we were quite pleased to hear that recently a couple of other parks in chennai have adopted this kutcheri in the park model this is indeed very gratifying
993418 in the context of philanthropy it is said that the left hand ought not to know what the right hand has given i would apply more or less the same rule to csr our founder chairman sri t s santhanam believed that every company should give something back to the community the motivation therefore is anything but commercial if at all anyone talks about it it should be the beneficiaries
993419 while we may be very passionate about our cause we cannot expect that the rest of the world will share that passion in fact the no mikes no speakers obsession stems from that belief
993420 tata wants us to be autonomous ive got all the executive authority i need to make both the day to day and the long term executive decisions without having to consult with ratan tata and ravi kant tata automotives chief executive my fellow board members
993421 what we have seen of tata is that it is a very principled organisation with corporate social responsibility high on the agenda but which works differently from the us or european model
993422 in terms of governance we have set up a small strategy board ratan ravi and me and we will meet every couple of months and review progress on plans strategies and future products
993423 it is sad that of those who have lost their lives women and children numbered the most i can understand what would be going through their families
993424 on special occasions prior arrangement should be made at all places of pilgrimage for the safety of the pilgrims
993425 it is a matter of great sorrow that people go to religious places with faith and believe but lose their life due to carelessness
993426 it is vital that the state government conducts a probe and come out with correct facts

993442 the first neutrons met all of our technical performance predictions and creating them is a significant milestone in the life of the facility and in the completion of the project
993443 the isis second target station builds on the success and expertise we have developed over the past 20 years at isis and allows us to move further into the areas of soft matter advanced materials and bioscience we will be carrying out fundamental research that will shape the technological advances of tomorrow
993444 this is an incredible technical achievement by our staff and demonstrates how everyone can pull together and enable stfc to deliver massive science projects that underpin the long term future of science and innovation in the uk
993445 im very proud of every single person who has played a part in getting the isis second target station project through to this very important milestone
993446 this is tremendous news for the science community both in the uk and much further afield
993447 the isis second target station will open research into new types of materials that has not been previously possible at isis and we look forward to a world of new science flowing from the new instrument suite
993448 this is a remarkable achievement by the isis team and adds an exciting new dimension to the capabilities of the european neutron scattering toolkit
993449 isis is the worlds leading spallation neutron facility and has performed world class outstanding science
993450 adding the second target station is the next great step for isis to enhance the ability and extend the reputation of neutron sciences world wide
993451 together with the great scientific environment at isis the skilful design and the mature know how in neutron technology applied on the second target station will open up unexplored areas for pulsed cold neutron experiments isis can stay as the world leader even as more powerful spallation neutron sources such as j parc and the us spallation neutron source come online

993458 this is an issue of concern not only for sri lanka but also for india
993459 the indian navy and coast guard have stepped up surveillance along the tamil nadu coast to prevent infiltration by the tigers patrol craft and aerial surveillance has been increased to this end the government must rope in the fishing community as well as locals living along the coast in its efforts to prevent infiltration and trafficking of weapons selling medicine and petrol to the tigers and helping in transport of arms is a hugely profitable business but locals should be made aware that this is illegal and undermining the security of the country the ltte established a solid network in tamil nadu in the 1980s which helped it to secure supplies and sanctuary here this enabled it to wage war in sri lanka and carry out terrorist attacks on indian soil it cannot be allowed to set up shop here again its network should be nipped in the bud now

993475 this sister singing duo from a foreign country were performing a show in los angeles one time and as usual it was completely sold out not a huge place and as a result there were lots of people who were sent away without getting in well there was a group of about ten girls who were not going to go anywhere and they decided they would at least sit outside the place in the hopes they could hear a few notes at least well somehow that news made it to the two wingers and they decided to take the entire group of girls and brought them backstage and let them watch the entire show from the the side of the stage after the show they posed for photos signed autographs and gave away practically anything that was giveable
993476 this former a list television actor on a very huge super sized hit network comedy and now someone who is trying to find some other identity other than that character either in television or film makes sure that he gives blood every two months like clockwork he has been doing this now for almost ten years all with no fanfare or attention
993477 wow this actress is the epitome of a b c lister everyone knows her because she has had some great roles on some great television shows and some films every time she gets her own series it doesnt do so well but she is incredibly well liked right now she is filming a remake sequel to one of my favorite films of all time from the 70s im cheesy that way anyway when she is in la she volunteers at an after school program which helps kids with their homework and to give them adult guidance they may not get at home when she is filming in a different city she calls around and tries to do the same thing at other schools on a temporary basis
993478 is this actor a list interesting question he was an a list action film star and then kept giving it all away now he is probably still considered a list by definition but probably more a b well in the past several years this actor has without any publicity given away about 250 000 to various spca charities and other pet organizations turns out the guy everyone always thinks is a jerk is actually a pretty nice guy

993490 this is not pretty its the first ever loss of subscribers by a major satellite tv company
993491 given the increasingly competitive nature of our industry it may not be possible to reduce churn without significantly increasing our spending on customer retention incentives which would have a negative effect on our earnings and free cash flow

993702 when i planted the fern and the bamboo seeds i took very good care of them i gave them light i gave them water the fern quickly grew from the earth its brilliant green covered the floor yet nothing came from the bamboo seed but i did not quit on the bamboo in the second year the fern grew more vibrant and plentiful and again nothing came from the bamboo seed but i did not quit on the bamboo
993703 in the third and fourth years there was still nothing from the bamboo seed but i would not quit
993704 then in the fifth year a tiny sprout emerged from the earth compared to the fern it was seemingly small and insignificant but just six months later the bamboo rose to over 100 feet tall it had spent the five years growing roots those roots made it strong and gave it what it needed to survive i would not give any of my creations a challenge it could not handle
993705 did you know my child that all this time you have been struggling you have actually been growing roots i would not quit on the bamboo i will never quit on you dont compare yourself to others

994048 and i looked and lo a lamb stood on the mount sion
994049 i learnt of my removal when a journalist phoned the night before i left for an official visit in china three weeks ago i thought it was just media speculation and brushed it off
994050 i was shocked to read in south african newspapers quoting anonymous sources saying i was fired as premier and people in china started asking questions it was humiliating
994051 information was leaked to the press with no attempt to actually call and inform me i was not given any opportunity to state my case as the law permits
994052 i expected them to give me a service delivery audit report and show me where i have failed but they said abantu bathi people say you have failed
994053 honestly i dont think i have done that bad i have served the people of the eastern cape with great passion and they love me
994054 i felt very lonely and alone the opposition had a field day as they would stand up and say even your own people said so
994055 together with the local media they were campaigning to destroy me for all my four years as premier
994056 i am greatly relieved and at peace i have no regrets and have forgiven all those who vilified me
994057 without my salary i will have to learn to scale down and live off my farm i have been keeping a diary for 25 years and want to start writing a book about my life soon

994060 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate
994061 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
994062 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
994063 im excited its good to have him back in the house
994064 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
994065 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
994066 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
994067 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
994068 but like i said its not the first time and it wont be the last time
994069 if we played a game tomorrow aaron rodgers would be the starting quarterback
994070 im not going to change any direction that weve gone with this football team based on the information i have here today thats part of our conversation tomorrow and we have all the confidence in the world in aaron
994071 i know that fear is a powerful motivator but this drumbeat of catastrophe has made it harder to discuss the sensible concerns raised during public meetings
994072 my two men have had their first disagreement and i dont want to choose between them you decide
994073 you know what i dont really care about the cake because im going to get like one bite of it dad you want a traditional wedding cake and since you are paying for it then a wedding cake we shall have chocolate with butter cream because that is matts favorite and i think he should have something he likes and ill find a local baker compromised and done

994077 we took a daily newspaper so we read about the suffering in the larger cities and was sorry for those people who stood in the soup lines everyday to survive
994078 we lived on a farm and fared better than most we couldnt buy flour therefore we ate a lot of cornbread worked for 25 cents a day when work could be found
994079 when my father built a new house near the end of the war he purchased just enough rough cut lumber from a nearby sawmill to frame it and moved into the unfinished structure and added to it as cash became available
994080 i cant remember ever going to a real doctor or dentist but we were all born at home with a doctor present we did not have any kind of insurance or credit cards for these things and cash was the main means of payment for practically everything
994081 i cut pictures from the sears and montgomery ward catalogs of pretty girls
994082 i was a member of a family of 13 children so it meant wearing hand me down clothing
994083 come winter we would kill our hogs we made lots of sausage we would cook up the sausage place it into a quart jar seal it and turn it upside down when the sausage got cold the grease would put a seal on it we would also cook out the fat and make lard for biscuits
994084 try cooking meals at home eating out occasionally is fine but every day can cost a fortune
994085 no matter your income or age take the first 10 percent and pay yourself in the form of any type savings account or investment that will grow over time not under the mattress or in your pocket book learn to live completely on the other 90 percent and forget the first 10 percent in the short term
994086 happiness is not just the car you drive the clothes you wear the house you live in and the many gadgets and toys you own but rather the basic things like taking a quiet walk in the evening holding a new born baby to your chest watching a beautiful sunset taking silent pride in watching your children grow and the myriad little things that make life worth living
994087 take advantage of every saving plan their place of employment has to offer
994088 i had a patient on amitriptyline for migraines and they were denied life insurance because its also an antidepressant
994089 i had to explain it wasnt being used for depression
994090 i wrote an appeal letter and they still wouldnt give it to her
994091 weve got to stop these practices before the marketplace is fully developed and patients lose all control over their medical information

994306 corruption engenders perverse political dependencies lost political opportunities to improve the general well being of the citizenry and fosters a climate of mistrust particularly of public officials
994307 the losses that accrue from a culture of permissiveness with respect to corruption include a loss of revenue loss of trust loss of values loss of credibility and legitimacy and a loss of the democratic ethos and impulse within institutions and organisations
994308 the concept of a national integrity system is fundamental to the development of an anti corruption discourse
994309 it comprises the building blocks necessary for the long term fight against corruption and other forms of unethical and anti social behaviour its core elements are constituted by a societys value system
994310 these are the essential preconditions for the elimination of corruption conflicts of interest and malpractice in the public sector
994311 the public interest and public trust must be constantly reaffirmed in the process of good governance
994312 sound administrative values of probity trust justice and fairness must be integrated in the daily work ethic of public servants
994313 this government can create such a national integrity framework through laws systems and structures but ultimately there needs to be on the part of leadership a voluntary submission to a higher code of probity which goes beyond strictly legal prescriptions
994314 this submission to a moral code ensures that institutions do not become vacuous without direction or purpose
994315 ethical behaviour while highly desirable respected and valued cannot be assumed this is why specific measures and institutions to safeguard integrity and to promote ethics are necessary
994316 the lack of these measures and institutions or their ineffective implementation and functioning opens the way for all manner of unethical behaviour including corruption
994317 a national integrity framework therefore provides both the institutional and philosophical basis for both enforcement and preventive action against corruption

994326 whatever were doing is working because last year we grew our economy and the gross amount of greenhouse gases we put in the environment actually went down
994327 the presidents global climate change policy focuses on reducing emissions through technology improvements and dissemination demand side efficiency gains voluntary programs with industry and shifts to cleaner fuels
994328 over the same period from 2002 to 2012 while ghg intensity is declining total gross ghg emissions are expected to rise by 11 percent
994329 will prevent about 87 million tonnes of climate changing carbon a year from entering the atmosphere by 2010 thats a massive reduction
994330 where are we going and why are we in this hand cart
994331 americans should not fear our economic future because we intend to shape it
994332 this administration today here and now declares unconditional war on poverty in america
994333 each august we americans tell ourselves a lie the entire episode is profoundly dishonest
994334 set a target level of income for a family of four at 3100 in 1963 based on evidence that she put together that basically was using 1955 data that exact same number augmented only by cost of living is the official measurement of poverty today if theyd done that at the time of abraham lincoln you know set a rate something like 100 years before then wed have a really low level of poverty today
994335 it might have been an ebony or it might have been who knows what it was

994339 barack was also worried about what his father would think because i was so young but he gave us his approval obamas father often described as poor sent my mother and father 14 cows for my dowry
994340 i can unequivocally say i will not be running for national office in four years and my entire focus is making sure that im the best possible senator on behalf of the people of illinois
994341 it would dishonor the 900 plus men and women who have already died
994342 when we talked back in november of 04 after your election i said theres been enormous speculation about your political future
994343 so you will not run for president or vice president in 2008
994344 there was something stirring across the country because of what happened in selma alabama

994353 while our fuel standards havent moved from 27 5 miles per gallon in two decades both china and japan have surpassed us with japanese cars now getting an average of 45 miles to the gallon
994354 no carmaker gets 45 mpg ours is closer to 30 mpg
994355 between 50 000 and 60 000 during obamas political career
994356 my grandfather taught me how to say the pledge of allegiance when i was 2
994357 and these private blackwater usa contractors they go out and theyre spraying bullets and hitting civilians and that makes it more dangerous for our troops
994358 but im not somebody who believes in legalization of marijuana
994359 im not running because im trying to fulfill some long held plan
994360 he wrote an essay titled i want to become president
994361 there was always a joke between my mom and barack that he would be the first black president
994362 he said i think id like to teach at some point in time and maybe run for public office
994363 he said no at some point hed like to run for the u s senate and then he said possibly even run for president at some point and i was like okay but dont say that to my aunt gracie i was protecting him from saying something that might embarrass him
994364 he obama was often in the prayer room wearing a sarong
994365 barack has never been a muslim or practiced any other faith besides christianity
994366 i happen to be a proponent of single payer universal healthcare coverage
994367 i never said that we should try to go ahead and get single payer healthcare
994368 she didnt read the national intelligence estimates jay rockefeller read it but she didnt read it i dont know what all that experience got her because i have enough experience to know that if you have a national intelligence estimate and the chairman of the national um senate intelligence committee says you should read this this is why im voting against the war that you should probably read it i dont know how much experience you need for that
994369 he gets an asterisk that says he is trying to be different

994371 two thirds of women and half of the men said they were very or extremely willing to marry for money

994376 its up to iran to prove to the world that theyre a stabilizing force as opposed to a destabilizing force after all this is a government that has proclaimed its desire to build a nuclear weapon
994377 the same folks that are bombing innocent people in iraq
994378 were the ones who attacked us in america on september the 11th and thats why what happens in iraq matters to the security here at home
994379 finding some progress on political and security goals in iraq
994380 others have been achieved on the surface but fail to accomplish the overall purpose of the specific measurement
994381 those email accounts were set up on a model based on the prior administration which had done it the same way in order to try to avoid hatch act violations
994382 e mail document that is a presidential record should be deleted

994385 if you dont request it youre not going to get it as far as we know the only thing the governor has requested are fm radios there have been no requests to the national guard for heavy equipment we are eager to provide what kansas needs but again there are also you also have to go through the process of making the request first
994386 i dont need to remind you who al qaeda is
994387 al qaeda is the group that plot and planned and trained killers to come and kill people on our soil the same bunch that is causing havoc in iraq were the ones who came and murdered our citizens
994388 never a serious debate that i know of within the administration about the imminence of the iraq threat
994389 the u n weapons inspectors thought saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction
994390 this has been something that was in place long before that

994399 we are surprised to see our work on reprogramming adult stem cells used to support arguments that research involving human embryonic stem cells is unnecessary
994400 the work that we performed and that was cited in the white house policy report is precisely the type of research that is currently being harmed by the presidents arbitrary limitation on federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research
994401 it is also a fact that our tax cuts have fueled robust economic growth and record revenues
994402 the white house intervened in the cias pre publication review process and has threatened me with criminal prosecution if i publish this op ed because in the white houses view that op ed contains classified information
994403 that claim is false indeed i would say that claim is fraudulent the people making that claim know it is not true
994404 the white house is using the rubric of protecting classified information not to protect classified information but to limit the dissemination of the views of someone who is very critical of their approact to iran policy
994405 the reason why is i didnt want to inject a major decision about this war in the final days of a campaign

994413 the strategic reserve is an insurance policy meant for a sudden disruption of our energy supply or for war strategic reserve should not be used as an attempt to drive down oil prices right before an election it should not be used for short term political gain at the cost of long term national security

994458 abuse torture human rights violations and other misconduct including wrongdoing related to the sept 11 2001 attacks
994459 what bothers me the most is how clever the enemy is
994460 i hereby designate the administrator of the environmental protection agency to classify information originally as secret
994461 i did not i said i knew where suspect sites were
994462 the area in the south and the west and the north that coalition forces control is substantial it happens not to be the area where weapons of mass destruction were dispersed we know where they are theyre in the area around tikrit and baghdad and east west south and north somewhat
994463 the strategic reserve is an insurance policy meant for a sudden disruption of our energy supply or for war strategic reserve should not be used as an attempt to drive down oil prices right before an election it should not be used for short term political gain at the cost of long term national security
994464 even if international arms inspectors failed to find unconventional weapons
994465 its such a phenomenal hole in the national debate that you can have arguments with nonexistent people all politicians try to get away with this to a certain extent whats striking here is how much this administration rests on a foundation of this kind of stuff
994466 no matter where you look at iraqs military their police their society things are much better this year than they were last
994467 i dont know anyone who wasnt caught off guard by hamas strong showing
994468 when the parties hamas and fatah are directly compared likely voters tend to see hamas as more qualified to clean up corruption resist occupation and uphold societal values
994469 there was no real investigation conducted during the 30 day period
994470 theres certainly enough in this account for a charge of careless driving anyone else would have been warned for dangerous driving
994471 i have had clients who have been charged with assaulting a police officer for less than this the issue of how long the police officer was out of action for is also important he was away from work for 14 weeks and that would normally be very significant in a case like this
994472 the area does see movement of people from across the border but we have not found one body or one shred of evidence that these people were there
994473 its total hubris its arrogance by the people doing this
994474 this is a 24 hour thing and you can get these kinds of warrants immediately i think they are just being lazy
994475 a military person lost through death wounds injury sickness internment or capture or through being missing in action
994476 quite a few people think that smoking pot is less likely to cause cancer than a regular cigarette you may even have heard some parents say theyd rather their kid smoked a little pot than get hooked on cigarettes wrong and wrong again one joint can deliver four times as much cancer causing tar as one cigarette
994477 as a parent im appalled that the white house is actually telling parents not to worry about a drug thats proven to be both deadly and highly addictive
994478 id much rather my kids not smoke anything but the data is crystal clear that of the two drugs tobacco is far more carcinogenic and far more addictive and the message to kids is even worse the ad says in effect if youve already tried marijuana cigarettes are no big deal because they have one quarter the tar thats a message that could literally kill
994479 assisted in the escape of osama bin laden from tora bora
994480 we dont know to this day whether mr bin laden was at tora bora in december 2001
994481 leaderships intention to attack the united states is not in question
994482 however their capability to do so is unclear particularly in regard to spectacular operations we believe capability to launch attacks within the united states is dependent on its ability to infiltrate and maintain operatives in the united states
994483 to date we have not identified any true sleeper agents in the us
994484 now in my capacity as vice president i am the president of senate the presiding officer im up in the senate most tuesdays when theyre in session the first time i ever met you was when you walked on the stage tonight
994485 man who provided safe harbour and sanctuary to terrorists for years
994486 provided safe harbour and sanctuary as well for al qaeda
994487 my colleagues every statement i make today is backed up by sources solid sources these are not assertions what were giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence
994488 as vice president i have absolutely no influence of involvement of knowledge of in any way shape or form of contracts led by the corps of engineers or anybody else in the federal government
994489 if you tilt entirely toward saying that a study with a zillion caveats has made definitive proof of a conclusion which cant be found in the study then it looks like you made up your mind beforehand
994490 no one predicted that they would try to use an airplane as a missile a hijacked airplane
994491 working with a fine coalition our military went to afghanistan destroyed the training camps of al qaeda and put the taliban out of business forever
994492 i came to this office to solve problems and not pass them on to future presidents and future generations
994493 were fighting the terrorists on the streets of afghanistan and iraq so we do not have to fight them on the streets of our own cities
994494 freedom is not americas gift to the world freedom is the almighty gods gift to every person who lives in the world
994495 in iraq a ruthless dictator cultivated weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them he gave support to terrorists and had a relationship with al qaeda and his regime is no more
994496 iraq has now become the central front in the war on terror
994497 we are aggressively striking the terrorists in iraq defeating them there so we do not have to face them on the streets of our own cities
994498 the evidence indicates that iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program satellite photos reveal that iraq is rebuilding facilities at sites that have been part of its nuclear program in the past
994499 six months away from developing a weapon i dont know what more evidence we need
994500 american officials including gen colin l powell acknowledged that iraqs nuclear threat is not any real threat in the short term or even medium term
994501 the longer we wait the stronger and bolder saddam hussein will become
994502 each day that passes means another day that saddam hussein can work toward perfecting his chemical and biological weapons capability another day of atrocities for amnesty international to document
994503 the halabja massacre was caused by repeated chemical bombardments from both iraqi and iranian armies
994504 on saddam husseins orders opponents have been decapitated wives and mothers of political opponents have been systematically raped as a method of intimidation and political prisoners have been forced to watch their own children being tortured
994505 is clearly not about human rights because if saddam was replaced tomorrow by an equally repressive dictator who would co operate with the inspectors there would be no invasion
994506 records and interviews show how the bush administration has used its control over access and information in an effort to transform the analysts into a kind of media trojan horse an instrument intended to shape terrorism coverage from inside the major tv and radio networks
994507 one hopes the leader of the free world hasnt really truly lost touch with objective reality but one does have to wonder
994508 bush whose foreign policies are dictated by the christian right and the israeli lobby
994509 cbs news found that 53 percent believed saddam had been
994510 thats something i said every day in the course of the campaign
994511 it should be no surprise that one of the first programs targeted for post katrina cuts by fiscal conservatives in the house was the medicare prescription drug plan set to go into effect later this year
994512 every public opinion poll in iraq supports the nationalist character of what is happening
994513 we went to war not on the statements of mr ahmad chalabi but on hans blix
994514 who talked about the 8 500 liters of anthrax that saddam hussein put together all of which would fit tim in one pickup truck with good sideboards
994515 one must not jump to the conclusion that they exist however this possibility is also not excluded
994516 colin powell made 29 claims about iraqi weapons programs behaviors events and munitions
994517 did saddam have a weapons program and the answer is absolutely and we gave him a chance to allow the inspector in and he wouldnt let them in
994518 theres no doubt in my mind but that they currently have chemical and biological weapons
994519 a poll last week found that fewer than one person in seven trusts president bush to tell the truth
994520 powell referred to iraqs obligations under un security council resolution 687
994521 the goal of establishing in the middle east a zone free from weapons of mass destruction and all missiles for their delivery and the objective of a global ban on chemical weapons
994522 for 12 years saddam has violated that agreement with the un to disarm
994523 you know daniel webster actually wrote a very famous defense of anticipatory self defense
994524 the bush administration campaign for war against iraq has been an extravaganza of disingenuousness
994525 the presidents cynical and irresponsible manipulation of the issue risks devaluing his credibility as he seeks to convince the united nations and u s allies that action to disarm iraq is essential we believe mr bush is right in arguing that saddam hussein poses an unacceptable threat and right in choosing to confront that menace but he undermines his own case by taking it on the campaign trail and thereby feeding suspicions both at home and abroad that he timed his initiative for maximum electoral advantage rather than in response to serious calculation about how and when iraq could best be dealt with
994526 the danger is is that al qaeda becomes an extension of saddams madness and his hatred and his capacity to extend weapons of mass destruction around the world
994527 weve got more black men in prison than there are in college
994528 racism is alive and well racism is how this country was founded and how this country is still run no black man will ever be considered for president no matter how hard you run jesse jackson and no black woman can ever be considered for anything outside what she can give with her body
994529 america is still the no 1 killer in the world we are deeply involved in the importing of drugs the exporting of guns and the training of professional killers we bombed cambodia iraq and nicaragua killing women and children while trying to get public opinion turned against castro and ghadhafi we put nelson mandela in prison and supported apartheid the whole 27 years he was there we believe in white supremacy and black inferiority and believe it more than we believe in god
994530 we supported zionism shamelessly while ignoring the palestinians and branding anybody who spoke out against it as being anti semitic we care nothing about human life if the end justifies the means
994531 we started the aids virus we are only able to maintain our level of living by making sure that third world people live in grinding poverty
994532 reverend wright and other african americans of his generation came of age in the late fifties and early sixties a time when segregation was still the law of the land
994533 for the men and women of reverend wrights generation the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years that anger occasionally finds voice in the church on sunday morning in the pulpit and in the pews
994534 politicians routinely exploited fears of crime for their own electoral ends
994535 but it also means binding our particular grievances to the larger aspirations of all americans the white woman struggling to break the glass ceiling the white man whose been laid off the immigrant trying to feed his family
994536 this time we want to talk about how the lines in the emergency room are filled with whites and blacks and hispanics who do not have health care
994537 segregated schools were and are inferior schools we still havent fixed them fifty years after brown v board of education and the inferior education they provided then and now helps explain the pervasive achievement gap between todays black and white students
994538 it might have been an ebony or it might have been who knows what it was
994539 my father was a foreign student born and raised in a small village in kenya he grew up herding goats went to school in a tin roof shack his father my grandfather was a cook a domestic servant to the british
994540 he did not like obama my father and brothers came to nairobi to bring me back they said i had to go back to school
994541 when i wouldnt they said they would never speak to me again
994542 barack was also worried about what his father would think because i was so young but he gave us his approval obamas father often described as poor sent my mother and father 14 cows for my dowry
994543 i can unequivocally say i will not be running for national office in four years and my entire focus is making sure that im the best possible senator on behalf of the people of illinois
994544 it would dishonor the 900 plus men and women who have already died
994545 when we talked back in november of 04 after your election i said theres been enormous speculation about your political future
994546 so you will not run for president or vice president in 2008
994547 there was something stirring across the country because of what happened in selma alabama
994548 because some folks are willing to march across a bridge
994549 it might have been an ebony or it might have been who knows what it was
994550 my father was a foreign student born and raised in a small village in kenya he grew up herding goats went to school in a tin roof shack his father my grandfather was a cook a domestic servant to the british
994551 he did not like obama my father and brothers came to nairobi to bring me back they said i had to go back to school

994553 barack was also worried about what his father would think because i was so young but he gave us his approval obamas father often described as poor sent my mother and father 14 cows for my dowry
994554 i can unequivocally say i will not be running for national office in four years and my entire focus is making sure that im the best possible senator on behalf of the people of illinois
994555 it would dishonor the 900 plus men and women who have already died
994556 when we talked back in november of 04 after your election i said theres been enormous speculation about your political future
994557 so you will not run for president or vice president in 2008
994558 there was something stirring across the country because of what happened in selma alabama
994559 because some folks are willing to march across a bridge
994560 to be clear senator obama has never been a muslim was not raised a muslim and is a committed christian who attends the united church of christ in chicago
994561 black man who had tried to peel off his skin
994562 seeing that article was violent for me an ambush attack
994563 yet no such life issue exists according to historians at the magazine
994564 it might have been an ebony or it might have been who knows what it was
994565 i was a constitutional law professor which means unlike the current president i actually respect the constitution
994566 investing in bigger and faster cars while foreign competitors invested in more fuel efficient technology
994567 while our fuel standards havent moved from 27 5 miles per gallon in two decades both china and japan have surpassed us with japanese cars now getting an average of 45 miles to the gallon
994568 no carmaker gets 45 mpg ours is closer to 30 mpg
994569 between 50 000 and 60 000 during obamas political career
994570 my grandfather taught me how to say the pledge of allegiance when i was 2
994571 and these private blackwater usa contractors they go out and theyre spraying bullets and hitting civilians and that makes it more dangerous for our troops
994572 but im not somebody who believes in legalization of marijuana
994573 im not running because im trying to fulfill some long held plan
994574 he wrote an essay titled i want to become president
994575 there was always a joke between my mom and barack that he would be the first black president
994576 he said i think id like to teach at some point in time and maybe run for public office
994577 he said no at some point hed like to run for the u s senate and then he said possibly even run for president at some point and i was like okay but dont say that to my aunt gracie i was protecting him from saying something that might embarrass him
994578 he obama was often in the prayer room wearing a sarong
994579 barack has never been a muslim or practiced any other faith besides christianity
994580 i happen to be a proponent of single payer universal healthcare coverage
994581 i never said that we should try to go ahead and get single payer healthcare
994582 she didnt read the national intelligence estimates jay rockefeller read it but she didnt read it i dont know what all that experience got her because i have enough experience to know that if you have a national intelligence estimate and the chairman of the national um senate intelligence committee says you should read this this is why im voting against the war that you should probably read it i dont know how much experience you need for that
994583 he gets an asterisk that says he is trying to be different
994584 a ccording to the center for responsive politics 14 of obamas top 20 contributors employed lobbyists this year spending a total of 16
994585 reverend wright and other african americans of his generation came of age in the late fifties and early sixties a time when segregation was still the law of the land
994586 for the men and women of reverend wrights generation the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years that anger occasionally finds voice in the church on sunday morning in the pulpit and in the pews
994587 politicians routinely exploited fears of crime for their own electoral ends

994589 this time we want to talk about how the lines in the emergency room are filled with whites and blacks and hispanics who do not have health care
994590 segregated schools were and are inferior schools we still havent fixed them fifty years after brown v board of education and the inferior education they provided then and now helps explain the pervasive achievement gap between todays black and white students
994591 i just lucked into things i used to think that if i made 50 000 id be the happiest guy in the world
994592 winfrey has remained the only black person wealthy enough to rank among americas 400 richest people nearly every year since 1995
994593 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
994594 replaced at a later date so that we can get oil into the market
994595 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency
994596 i made a general point about the fact that we need to provide the american people some relief and that there has been constructive conversations between republicans and democrats in the senate on this issue
994597 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
994598 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and offshore drilling
994599 its another example of short term political posturing from washington not the long term leadership we need to solve our dependence on oil
994600 con paciencia y salivita el elefante pre a la hormiguita

994606 no tiene cabida en el siglo xxi el presente pertenece a la democracia y a la libertad y quien las ha aprobado no puede dejarlas

994630 patients seek out breast reduction surgery for many reasons not the least of which is to ease pain and discomfort associated with having larger breasts
994631 however there is also an emotional discomfort as well including low self esteem social and sexual embarrassment and frustration with difficulties in performing daily routines it was our goal to determine quantitatively whether these emotional issues improved as well as the physical
994632 this study further demonstrates that the connection between the aesthetic results of plastic surgery and the emotional social and physical quality of life of our patients cannot be underestimated
994633 these findings will go a long way towards helping us to evaluate and better understand the implications of the impact of plastic surgery on patients lives and serve as an example of our commitment to evidence based medicine and outcome studies in aesthetic surgery

994643 hij wou er naar eigen zeggen achter komen of het in werkelijkheid net zo makkelijk was om een taxi te beroven als in de game
994644 het is een tijdbom die is gebarsten en de situatie kan nog erger worden

994736 the other painters whatever they think instinctively keep themselves at a distance from discussions about the actual trade well the truth is we can only make our pictures speak but yet my dear brother there is this that i have always told you and i repeat it once more with all the earnestness that can be expressed by the effort of a mind diligently fixed on trying to do as well as possible i tell you again that i shall always consider you to be something more than a simple dealer in corots that through my mediation you have your part in the actual production of some canvases which will retain their calm even in the catastrophe

994738 we are very pleased with the sequential improvement in sales and earnings over the first quarter of this year as we continue to realize the benefits of the operational changes we made last year evidenced by higher margins lower expenses and most importantly increased operating income while inventories are higher than normal with presently anticipated sales inventories should be back at traditional levels by year end we are seeing the effects of the economic slow down on our markets but we believe the investments we have made in our business model over the last year and the continued successful execution of our strategy will enable us to continue to realize improved financial results

994750 editors of daily weekly or monthly newspapers magazines published in nigeria and of radio and television and news agencies
994751 because one day we shall all die as alhaji jose has died and render our accounts of stewardship before god
994752 in the last two years that papa has been ill the sickness has been on and off
994753 alhaji jose was a doyen of no mean standing he was an erudite journalist an upright man who ensured that journalism was practised as a tool for social reformation and development he gave his all to the profession and was instrumental to the robust role journalism is now playing in our national life it is noteworthy that even after his retirement alhaji jose maintained his love and dedication to journalism by mentoring others and chairing the nigeria media merit award initiative
994754 a thorough bred journalist who contributed to national development before and after independence through his profession the history of journalism in nigeria will give him a prominent chapter
994755 the death has robbed nigeria of a media icon a statesman and a nationalist par excellence alhaji jose came saw and conquered the nigerian world of journalism my allah grant his soul eternal rest and the family the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss
994756 the departure of such a great man diminishes us all
994757 in my reflections of the life and times of this great educator and mass communicator i have singled out three outstanding values that those of us who wish to follow his footsteps must imbibe these are the values of enterprise dedication to work and faith in the almighty
994758 the prodigious enterprise of pa ismail jose has already been acknowledged by many researchers what is often left unsaid is that his life in this regard is rare among journalists of his days and even now the impression is given that journalism is an endangered profession and journalists are unable to meet up with the middle class expectations the life of pa jose teaches us that this should not be so it teaches that enterprise is a reliable handmaiden of professionalism secondly his life teaches that there is no alternative to meticulous hard work in achieving personal goals and corporate aspirations we thank god that many years after he left the board room pa joses legacy of hard work and professionalism continues to dominate discourse on journalism
994759 from being a tower that was defiled by military imperialists he emerged a living monument
994760 we almost forgot that this morning would come when he would no longer be around we will remember and our successors will always remember him
994761 that is the death of the father of modern day journalism he produced the best array of journalists in this country including your publisher sam amuka tony momoh myself henry odukomaya and many others
994762 there is no newspaper founded in this country in the last thirty to forty years that does not alhaji joses men in charge
994763 he stood for what is best for journalism and he was a colossus and there can never be a second alhaji babatunde jose
994764 he expanded daily times beyond the level he took over as managing director and chairman of the paper and he produced great journalists who went ahead to take charge of most of the newspapers in this country today you will find his imprint and input in all the media houses in this country until his death i was like the first son of the old man in both professional term and in real term
994765 alhaji jose was a great nigerian a very fine fellow
994766 we are all part of the footprint i passed through daily times me and my peers i am glad that he is being properly mourned
994767 i remember him as a professional journalist who took to a very high level the establishment of newspapers the operations of newspapers and massive diversification in the newspaper business in the establishment of newspapers he increased the titles in the daily times group from about three to 14 then in the operation of newspapers he concentrated on the training of manpower not only for the editorial department but also in other areas and in diversification of the newspaper business he moved into related areas like marketing of publication establishment of printing wing packaging wing and leisure services most important was the training of journalists when he established a school that trained journalists not only for the daily times group but also for the industry personally he made me what im in the profession today and i owe everything to him
994768 with whom i maintained a very close relationship until his death
994769 he was the greatest newspaper administrator in the country who turned around the fortunes of the daily times and prepared it to be quoted on the stock exchange he was a man of great foresight who planned 200 years ahead of time for a simultaneous printing of the daily times
994770 beyond the daily times alhaji jose played major roles in other media organizations in the country as he was charged with the responsibility of reorganizing federal government media organizations such as the new nigerian newspapers the frcn and the nta in 1984 his national relevance went beyond the media as he played very important roles in other national assignments for instance he was the chairman of the committee that moved nigeria driving from right hand drive to the left he did it so well that they were very few accidents even when most people were afraid that there would be so much accidents as a result of the change to me he was my mentor father and friend and indeed was at some point everyone in the nigerian media worked under him mention them uncle sam who started the punch and later started vanguard worked under him at the daily times tony momoh also worked under him those who started concord left the daily times to start that paper those who started the guardian also left the daily times to start it
994771 his death is a great loss to the country and a great loss to journalism he was a titan and an icon he was an accomplished journalist and newspaper publisher his contributions to nigeria will ever be remembered he trained many journalists who are today in high positions
994772 obviously the death of the first indigenous managing director of the daily times of nigeria alhaji babatunde jose is a big shock to me even though i am aware hes been ill for some time now it is indeed a major loss to the profession of journalism in the country
994773 though the grand old man had retired from active practice he was constantly in touch with the practitioners and was ever willing to contribute his wealth of experience for the development of the industry it is indeed the end of an era because alhaji jose represented the old order of committed practitioners of the pen profession as a managing director i had the privilege of going through some of the files left behind by baba and i was able to see first hand what he did while in the daily times as the chief executive of the group and it is amazing to acknowledge his level of commitment to the profession it is even more amazing to pint out that even though he had no university degree he did not just set up the daily times training school he also went further to insist that reporters in the group must hold at least a university degree that was remarkable for a man who did not have a university degree himself it is a pity i am not in lagos at the moment i would have given the media a copy of the lecture i delivered on him when he was honoured with a chair at the university of lagos recently
994774 we pay tribute to the greatest media doyen of our time the death of alhaji babatunde jose can only be only be described as the end of a generation of a media guru who was an astute disciplinarian and a sticker for excellence of his calibre who had lived all his life for the development of the media in nigeria as the first indigenous managing director of the daily times group alhaji jose represented the second generation of media practitioners in nigeria to take the industry beyond the pedestal and took it to a new height of respectability whatever measures the nations newspapers can take to honour or immortalise this exceptional and rare breed of human being is desirable i will also call on the federal government to consider honouring alhaji jose the pioneer managing director of dtn for his towering contribution to the group the nation and humanity in general
994775 the passage of the doyen of nigerian journalism alhaji babatunde jose signifies the end of and era
994776 we will miss him greatly but the virtues he represented remain forever the nigerian guild of editors nge will participate fully in the burial and celebration of the life of a great leader of the profession he was a colossus in the media industry we will miss him
994777 we have lost a great national figure in alhaji babatunde jose he represented all that is virtuous he was a great muslim that will be remembered for a very long while to come alhaji jose was a towering figure in his chosen career of journalism he mentored a great number of nigerian journalists many of whom are today occupying enviable positions in national life jose was a great patriot who contributed immensely to the development of the nation and i am convinced that history will judge him kindly i am aware that he was honoured with an award but i will not hesitate to recommend him for a higher post humous award for a man who made such a tremendous contributions to the nations life
994778 jose lived a purposeful and fulfilled life he left a mark in the practice of journalism his journalism had a positive purpose advancement of society he will be missed
994779 it is devastating a great loss to nigeria and the journalism profession we will miss him we wish his family well and pray god to grant his soul repose
994780 his name was unanimous with daily times and since he left daily times has never been the same again it is unfortunate we are gradually losing some of the best of our founding fathers in journalism

994820 so why do so many big games seem to have development troubles
994821 a game that tries to do too much often fails at most of them
994822 we all have the same enemy more everyone wants more stuff more features more everything we want our games to be cool and more stuff adds value
994823 this is not an argument for simplicity depth is best targeted at carefully chosen places
994824 they assure that each feature is worth the cost of entry and they demand that the gamer will notice your efforts

994828 beyond verbs what abstract concepts make your game memorable where should your extra love go
994829 make sure your game screams your pillar values make them plain and easy to understand ask yourself what are people going to remember most about this game
994830 at what level of organization does the bulk of gameplay occur
994831 this required the player to think on a per room basis and a per person basis
994832 gameplay was deeply rooted in two places ultimately we had to pick one
994833 because in the end its about deciding how to deliver the greatest game experience
994834 rewarding compelling and socially responsible interactions with a focus on inventive game design for social change
994835 the idea is to embed human values or human principles into design processes
994836 convey these principles yet also satisfy competitive urges and are fun to play
994837 can potentially have social moral and political implications and that each design feature can potentially convey social moral and political content
994838 you would be amazed at how quickly these things can disappear if you dont keep a close eye on them

994924 we are surprised that the treasury has risked provoking such political opposition for an environmental measure which according to its projections is of limited benefit
994925 when this was one of the main objectives of the changes
994926 even the projected differentials between ved bands remain too small to be effective
994927 we also believe that both the proposed changes in ved rates and the objectives of ved as an environmental tax have been poorly explained and communicated
994928 the changes to car tax announced in the budget are a step in the right direction
994929 raising the rates on high emissions cars that are already on the road could encourage sales of more efficient models in the second hand market
994930 meanwhile the first year rates being introduced for new cars will create a kind of showroom tax that could be used to influence buyers of new cars to choose the most efficient model in each class
994931 however the differentials between high and low carbon cars are still nothing like wide enough to make a big impact in practice
994932 according to the governments own figures these changes will only have a very limited impact on the environment
994933 the treasury must be more ambitious matching increased charges on high carbon cars with discounts or rebates on low emissions vehicles
994934 the treasury must also urgently work to ensure these changes are not unfair to vulnerable groups
994935 in all the treasury must do far better in communicating the details and benefits of its green tax policies
994936 making revenue neutral tax changes or explicitly hypothecating some of the revenue raised from green taxes towards spending on the environment would be more effective environmentally and more acceptable to the public
994937 a failure to advertise green tax details to the public or explain them in a timely manner to parliament breeds suspicion about their objectives increasing the perception of them as revenue raising measures with no environmental purpose
994938 until the financial and environmental impacts are properly assessed and a car scrappage scheme has been introduced

994950 men of good will are working very hard to ensure that the issue of monetisation is put behind us all the relevant agencies of government like the president national assembly with the chief executive and even the unions are working hard to avert the strike by making sure that there is a clear road map on the actual date the workers benefits would be paid
994951 the last meeting that was all inclusive at the national assembly was able to hit the nail on the head by making sure that there would be clear provision in the 2009 budget if possible in the 2008 budget amendment
994952 but the figures are being worked out in a very transparent manner and every party involved is actively captured
994953 algu m que fica ser que eu tenho fibromialgia a primeira coisa que deve fazer uma boa avalia o n s fazemos uma avalia o da intensidade desses pontos dolorosos que se espalham pelo corpo inteiro
994954 i cannot say for sure if he was the first european to have come to zaria but i am certain he was a christian missionary if i remember correctly some people say his name was miller he had come to zaria to destabilize the religious institution the people had founded as a foreigner he was given the utmost attention and a royal treatment he was even given a house to stay not too far from the palace and a place he could use as an office to attend to his patients this office is what people call asibitin babban dodo today if he had revealed his actual intentions he wouldnt have been accepted
994955 so he used his position as a health worker to win his way into the hearts of the people it was a good thing having a health worker in their midst because not everyone was as learned as he was he could heal what seemed like the worst diseases by the time his actual intentions began to manifest he had lured several people in this settlement into christianity including some children from the royal families that was unheard of how could a potential ruler of the zazzau emirate be a christian when the emir found out he had done more harm than good
994956 despite the fact that he had left the city the people of zaria still called the hospital asibitin babban dodo and they used it as a means of description gradually people began to refer to the settlement itself as babban dodo somehow it lost its original name this new name had come to stay and no one really gave it so much thought
994957 people have given different accounts about the origin of babban dodo one cannot really say which one of them is the most authentic but everyone wants to believe that his is the real one when i was growing up we were made to believe that babban dodo was a kind of monster at least that was what most of our grand mothers told us after a while though we were told on a more serious note that the man called babban dodo was a european missionary who was also a teacher but they didnt know his name they told us that he had come to teach people how to read and write and in exchange for the services he rendered they would convert from islam to christianity
994958 although some people say that the people of zaria were pagans at that time many argue that this wasnt true to the people of zaria this missionary was different he was scary it was said that he was given a house not too far from the palace where an eye could be kept on him but they couldnt control what he did who he spoke with and who he converted to this new found religion when the emir realized nothing could be done about this man he was asked to move to another settlement where he wouldnt come in constant contact with the people of zaria they said it was an abomination for the people of zaria to convert to christianity
994959 people say he relocated to wusasa others say he died it was said that after he left this settlement which used to be called fadamar bono the people still called the place babban dodo because according to them it would tell many generations to come the history of what happened there
994960 it would be extremely hard to find people who would give you an eye witness account most of us just narrate what our parents told us while we were growing up some 59 years ago the house he lived was still as intact as when he lived there out of curiosity we often asked what that house was meant for it looked deserted like there was never a person in the house we were told that the house had been occupied several years before by a british soldier who had been assigned to come to zaria as head of the local authorities when he came to zaria the people already had an emir and several traditional office holders who were responsible to make decisions for the people and who the people in return were answerable to there was no way he could take over leadership from this people so he only contributed when necessary somehow he was like a supervisor some people say it was more like an indirect rule when he came to zaria the people hadnt ever seen a white man before they were scared of him thus they began to call him zaki babban dodo which means lion the mighty masquerade
994961 he was given a place to stay not too far from the palace and when food was given to errand boys it was often said to them ku kai gidan babban dodo which means take it to the house of babban dodo the name zaki was faded away leaving the babban dodo on the daily basis more people referred to him as babban dodo and his house as gidan babban dodo today this house he lived in has been renovated into the babban dodo healthcare centre although some people argue that the other one called asibitin babban dodo used to be the house he lived in i can assure you it isnt most people of my age must have seen his house as it was before it was renovated and they would tell you that asibitin babban dodo was established by the wusasa missionary specifically for women no one really knows what happened to him at the end some say he died and others say he left that is one part i cannot say anything about because he came and left several years before we were born
994962 during the reign of sarkin zazzau kwasau in 1900 two batches of military troops arrived zaria
994963 after sarki kwasau was deposed babban dodo still had its old name fadamar bono until the reign of sarki aliyu not long after he became emir however another european came visiting this european was said to be the overall head of the army garrison that had been in zaria since the era of sarki kwasau the emir had organized a welcome gathering in honour of this newcomer typical of the people in this city the news travelled very fast within a very short time everyone had heard that the overall boss had arrived and there was going to be gathering at the emirs palace as usual they went round telling those who hadnt heard za ayi taro a fadar sarki an hada ma babban cikin doddanin liyafa it meant that there would be a gathering at the emirs palace and a reception in honor of the head of the masquerades had been organized the people around began to refer to him as babban dodo which means the mighty masquerade or the overall masquerade as far as these people were concerned they had given him a title which was due to him they recognized him as the overall boss of the troops and had no better way they could have called him
994964 after all there is nothing magic in reading and parsing xml to convert to something else

994967 the first which probably accounts for most of the association is through weight gain a systematic review of the literature indicates a positive association between greater intakes of sugar sweetened beverages and weight gain and obesity in both children and adults these beverages are dense in calories and are typically consumed as an addition to usual food intake several studies have shown that liquid foods have a low satiety and that when individuals increase consumption of liquid carbohydrates they may not reduce consumption of solid food in response high fructose corn syrup which is now the sweetener used in all sugar sweetened soft drinks consumed in the united states appears to be particularly effective at promoting weight gain because of its adverse effects on insulin secretion and leptin release leading to a reduction in the normal inhibitory effect on food intake a second possible mechanism is through the glycemic effects of the beverages both sugar sweetened soft drinks and fruit drinks contain large amounts of rapidly resorbed carbohydrates the consumption of which leads to rapid increases in glucose and insulin concentrations although the literature is not consistent several large studies have found a positive association between glycemic load of the diet and risk of type 2 diabetes

994972 the consumption of ssbs sugar sweetened beverages and fjs fruit juices continues to rise among children and adolescents mounting epidemiologic and experimental evidence suggests that reducing intake of empty calories by limiting ssb consumption may be a key strategy for promoting healthy eating and preventing excess weight gain in youth awareness of these trends among pediatricians will be critical in assisting children and parents to identify concrete targets of suboptimal dietary patterns that may contribute to excess caloric intake and obesity the various types of ssbs are an attractive focus for environmental policy and behavioral interventions aimed at curbing the energy imbalance in children and youth
994973 fun food products are no longer contained within the cereal aisle they pervade the entire supermarket and are available for every eating experience breakfasts snacks lunches dinners

994976 aromatic herbs represent a reservoir of phenolic compounds concentrated in just a few grams of material and can represent one of the simplest ways to increase the phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of the daily diet with possible health benefits our data show that the introduction of aromatic herbs into the salads markedly increases the phenolic and orac values of the whole salad
994977 perhaps prehabilitation would be more successful in decreasing obesity in populations this is primarily because there are two components to the obesity epidemic individual participation and population factors that cannot be controlled by individuals these population issues need to be addressed before an individual becomes obese and this prevention can be viewed as prehab citizens live in an obesogenic environment this is a toxic environment in which there are multiple factors promoting obesity at the same time not unless and until all of these factors are simultaneously addressed and reduced will the obesity epidemic decrease the majority but not all of these obesogenic factors are out of the individuals control an example would be the convenience and availability of fast foods individuals may try to eliminate or decrease the consumption of fast food in their diet however they are bombarded with fast food commercials in the media additionally the convenience taste and cost of fast food often make these items irresistible particularly to people who have limited financial resources the prevalence of fast food restaurants in lower socioeconomic environments adds to the problem it is very difficult in these environments to find affordable and presentable fresh fruit on the other hand it is extremely easy to find affordable convenient and tasty fast foods there are few supermarkets and healthy restaurants in these neighborhoods these are examples of population issues and individual issues acting together to prevent the decrease of obesity
994978 every year approximately 40 000 cases of salmonellosis are reported in the united states because many milder cases are not diagnosed or reported the actual number of infections may be thirty or more times greater
994979 an estimated 76 million cases of foodborne disease occur each year in the united states
994980 raw foods of animal origin are the most likely to be contaminated that is raw meat and poultry raw eggs unpasteurized milk and raw shellfish because filter feeding shellfish strain microbes from the sea over many months they are particularly likely to be contaminated if there are any pathogens in the seawater foods that mingle the products of many individual animals such as bulk raw milk pooled raw eggs or ground beef are particularly hazardous because a pathogen present in any one of the animals may contaminate the whole batch a single hamburger may contain meat from hundreds of animals a single restaurant omelet may contain eggs from hundreds of chickens a glass of raw milk may contain milk from hundreds of cows a broiler chicken carcass can be exposed to the drippings and juices of many thousands of other birds that went through the same cold water tank after slaughter
994981 fortunately there are several steps one can take to avoid getting sick from tainted produce the single best piece of advice is still to wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly before eating them a practice that can result in a ten fold reduction in surface contamination wash hands with soap before beginning but just use lukewarm tapwater and a clean cloth or scrub brush on the food consumers have much more control over their exposure to foodborne pathogens when cooking at home in preparing fruits or vegetables that will be eaten raw cut away any damage and the area around the stem scar these are often sites of microbial colonization also remember that many instances of foodborne illness caused by fresh produce actually begin with cross contamination from raw meat foodborne pathogens are much more likely to survive and thrive in uncooked meat than in fruits or vegetables which explains why it is much safer to eat raw produce than to eat raw meat hands surfaces and kitchen tools should be washed thoroughly with soap before and after preparing food and it is prudent to wash hands frequently while cooking most especially after handling meats or using the toilet
994982 overall its important to put the risk of eating produce in a larger context fresh fruits and vegetables are no riskier than other fresh foods as sources of foodborne pathogens and eating a salad is certainly safer than driving to work furthermore many forms of produce confer remarkable health benefits on people who eat them given these benefits avoiding fresh fruits and vegetables is probably riskier than enjoying them even if you still eat unwashed fruit with grubby fingers
994983 in contrast to the healthy effects of diets that are rich in omega 3 fatty acids epidemiological studies indicate that diets with high contents of trans and saturated fats adversely affect cognition
994984 owing to the encouraging results of clinical and preclinical studies that showed the beneficial effects of foods on the brain the topic has attracted substantial media attention some of the information that has been conveyed has been hazy or exaggerated and has contributed to peoples apprehension of taking advantage of scientific advances as discussed several dietary components have been found to have positive effects on cognition however caution is required as a balanced diet is still the stepping stone for any dietary supplementatio n by the same token popular dietary prescriptions that might help to reduce weight do not necessarily benefit the physiology of the body or the mind the fact that dietary factors and other aspects of lifestyle have an effect on a long term timescale contributes to an underestimation of their importance for public health accordingly the slow and imperceptible cognitive decay that characterizes normal aging is within the range of action of brain foods such that successful aging is an achievable goal for dietary therapies the capacity of diet to modulate cognitive abilities might have even longer term implications in light of recent studies that imply that nutritional effects might be transmitted over generations by influencing epigenetic events research indicating that an excessive intake of calories might negate the positive effects of certain diets suggests that there is an undefined line between abundance of foods and neural health
994985 a balanced diet is still the stepping stone for any dietary supplementation

994988 i want to raise my family in the traditional ways but its hard when you cant even speak your own language
994989 but they were once a week for adults or a half hour after school for kids you just cant learn a language one day a week
994990 to learn a language you have to hear it use it constantly
994991 there is a tremendous vitality and hunger for culture and language expression there is no longer shame in speaking your native language
994992 some programs are merely for show to teach a few words
994993 it is the ones that strive for normal conversational functional language that hold the best hope
994994 there are many communities that havent had first language speakers for generations
994995 its an ongoing process im not sure i will ever be fluent
994996 i didnt know my grandmother but she was a fluent speaker my parents spoke only a few words
994997 thats how fast a language can be lost from one generation to the next
994998 but when somebody says do you know any words in your native tongue well if you cant speak it you have pretty much lost your identity as a native person

995018 efficiency related investments such as smart meters and led technologies have seen relatively steady levels of deals and investment over the past few quarters because they can be ready for an exit more quickly than other renewable energy technologies

995086 there has been no clear communication from government as to how it intends to reintegrate those remaining in the temporary safe sites across the province
995087 last week with the july 31 deadline looming site managers had still not been informed whether the camps would remain open into august and contracts for security and catering had not yet been renewed

995149 i think that whenever theres a boom tourism can be detrimental
995150 ive seen it in so many places like thailand and nepal
995151 tourism market is catering to the tourists rather than treating this as an educational opportunity
995152 i dont work as hard and dont think i solve problems as well as they their day to day existence resembled camping out except you never get to go home to a warm shower or go to the fridge for food

995173 it is very clear that the bush administration wants to work with the democratic government and congress is very welcoming
995174 at the same time not everyone in washington fully understands that there has been a major change in pakistan and the new government has inherited several issues from the previous regime
995175 the military is just waiting around giving the civilian government enough rope to hang itself
995176 the u s wants to strengthen the government but knows full well that its going to be the military that will have to confront the militants
995177 its one thing to bomb a country that we dont need
995178 but if were going to keep bombing pakistan we need a wider strategy

995243 by the same token its probably no coincidence that the orchestra lays low on the albums most earnest songs losing you and feels like home conveying heartache and gratitude respectively capture mr newmans sweeter side those arent the funniest or most clever songs on the album and maybe not the truest to his basic temperament but they are the ones well still be hearing years from now
995244 for balance he includes a couple of would be standards a heart worn losing you and a reprise of his lovely 1994 ballad feels like home newman couldve easily fashioned a career out of such transparently emotional songs but what fun would thatve been
995245 its hugely likable none the less laugh and be happy sounds like something written for toy story while being about us immigration by contrast losing you inspired by war survivors grieving over a dead child and feels like home a song revived from several years back capture the pathos of newmans best work like updike hes still one of his countrys best chroniclers a shrewd patriot indeed
995246 the gorgeously bummed out love song losing you is bound to be covered many times over by singers with prettier voices than newmans to less emotionally wrenching effect than it has here the rest of harps amp angels is all gloriously grumpily and singularly newmans own

995258 todays landmark ruling is a ringing reaffirmation of the fundamental principle of checks and balances and the basic american idea that no person is above the law judge bates decision makes clear that the congress had the right to subpoena harriet miers to learn of her role in the us attorney firings that her claim to be immune from subpoena was invalid and that the committee was entitled to challenge that claim in court the judge also ruled that the white house may not claim executive privilege over documents without describing them in reasonable detail so that these claims of privilege can be evaluated by congress we look forward to the white house complying with this ruling and to scheduling future hearings with ms miers and other witnesses who have relied on such claims we hope that the defendants will accept this decision and expect that we will receive relevant documents and call ms miers as well as ex white house official karl rove to testify in september

995266 i have been saying for the past three years that he is our best bet for a top 100 player
995267 i think his success is showing that he is turning the tide of that trend but he needs to keep going ahead to achieve greater heights he is very mature and has a very good head on his shoulders
995268 he has had an excellent start to his professional career he needs to keep working hard on his game and fitness to sustain his level and take it up by a couple of notches he has a lot hunger to succeed on the professional tour after his remarkable career in ncaa college tennis
995269 pro tennis and college tennis are very different ball games
995270 in college tennis there is a whole team that is supporting you and you can get coaching on court but on the pro tour you cant get any coaching on court
995271 also the pro tour is a much higher brand of tennis and more challenging than the college circuit
995272 i think he is a very strong boy and has a very solid baseline game
995273 most importantly i think he can physically compete with a lot of the top 100 players as his results have already shown the one area of his game that he needs to get better at is his offence he definitely is the fittest and strongest indian player and perhaps one of the fittest if not the fittest athlete in any sport in india
995274 i think he is our trump card going into the tie against romania
995275 we now have a player who can play and compete hard on clay i think his current form gives us a realistic chance of winning the tie against romania also the romanians dont know much about his game and he will go into the tie as surprise package
995276 i think he has come on to the pro stage at the perfect time he is physically and mentally strong and ready for the rigours of the pro tour he is also blooming at a time when the leander mahesh era is in its sunset and i think he is ready to take on the mantle of indian tennis
995277 i came to know the pleiades the little wagon the great wagon also i saw the trail of a falling star and another and another when i asked what they were my father answered that this was something the creator alone knew thus arose a secret and confused feeling of immense and awesome things already then as later my imagination was strongly stirred by thoughts of the vastness of space and time

995280 olympic medals won in beijing will count in history like any others
995281 ill have to settle down at some point because i cant shark forever
995282 well thats really sad i didnt know that barack obama had stooped to dishonesty you know pointing out weaknesses in other peoples campaigns or positions is also fair game but thats dishonest as you know first of all corporations are not allowed to give contributions to candidates and employees of oil companies give to barack obama as well as to john mccain so thats part number one thats dishonest and number two john mccain doesnt ask for any tax reduction for oil companies theres no special deal going to oil companies hes asking to reduce taxes on all corporations to help build our economy and strengthen jobs as well as reducing taxes on individuals so its simply dishonest as well as below the belt
995283 just to clarify according to the washington post oil and gas industry executives and employees donated 1 1 million to john mccains campaign last month so i think that is what hes referring to in that ad
995284 but what you dont point out is the employees and executives of the oil companies also gave money to barack obama and to suggest that they only gave to john mccain is dishonest theres no indication that thats the case in fact individuals can give to candidates of both parties and they regularly do
995285 right well let me just ask you about this because if john mccain became president he wants to lower the corporate tax rate by 10 so 35 down to 25 and that would include companies like big oil and exxon mobil who took in 12 billion last quarter alone how do you explain that to the everyday joe whos seeing a larger chunk of their paycheck taken up by high gases prices and these oil companies are going to see more money in their pockets while the average guy is seeing less
995286 well first of all hes lowering taxes for all corporations in america to help make us more competitive with other nations of the world where corporations are going because we have the highest corporate tax rate in the world next to japan so hes trying to build our economy and create more jobs and hes not singling out any one company or another
995287 just to clarify according to the washington post oil and gas industry executives and employees donated 1 1 million to john mccains campaign last month so i think that is what hes referring to in that ad

995297 the rebranding to zain underlines our ambition to become a top ten global mobile telecommunications company by 2011 building on our heritage and successes in africa and the middle east a strong distinctive brand name has always been the prerequisite for any company with global aspiration
995298 the company aspires to make the zain brand a top 100 global brand
995299 the brand is part of a process that began when the zain group bought celtel in 2005
995300 since then we have been developing a new brand and company identity which could apply to all our group markets and which would be relevant and exciting to all our customers regardless of where they live

995303 okay go and amend the constitution for me to achieve third term
995304 it is not a matter for the senate committee it is for the ministry of justice and the ministry of foreign affairs to take a decision on
995305 the government should through the office of the honourable attorney general of the federation and minister of justice take steps to discharge the domestic court order to enable the nigeria government comply with its international obligation
995306 the statutes of the icj imply that by nigerias position compliance is our only option the senate has to ratify it as our constitution places the cart before the horse
995307 i think that at a time when nigerias battered image is being restored at a time when the g8 and the international community have just written off loans to nigeria i think that at a time when we are still looking forward to being a member of the security council of the united nations this kind of judgment in violation of international treaties is a great threat to the integrity of nigeria and credibility and the nation needs to rise up against this ill fated decision by the high court
995308 it is my considered opinion that we reconvene because only a direction from the national assembly can save this situation and restore nigerias image
995309 it is a very serious situation that requires to be handled at the highest level of authority of this country i am in full support and we are obliged to hand over we should respect international agreements
995310 since we are reconvening for the budget then this issue should take the front burner as a matter of urgent national importance because only the national assembly can give nigeria a direction on this
995311 it is wrong for the court to give judgment over a matter in which it has no jurisdiction
995312 i am very pleased about it and it gives us a time to re examine those contentious issues in the green trees agreement
995313 it gives the government the opportunity of re examining the issues concerning our security and the preparedness to receive the stream of refugees that are likely to stream out if the handover goes ahead i think it is a decision for justice and for democracy

995344 i must make it clear that a big percentage of the money raised came from people that were not able to attend and i thank them for their generosity

995449 we have to overcome our problems with reliability and with our tyres performance
995450 but for sure reliability is the biggest thing because we cannot accept to have these kind of problems even if it was only 10 kilometres from the end
995451 we cannot have this problem of reliability because we are paying too much of a price for it on the other hand qualifying is crucial and the difference today was really the fact that on one side we were able to jump in front and do our race as we were able to do and on the other hand in the first part in the middle of the field knowing that it was really impossible to do something in spite of having the right pace
995452 what we need to improve is looking ahead above all at the next grand prix where maybe there will be tricky conditions in terms of temperature in terms of the situation weather something like that
995453 for sure we need to prepare our cars and tyre set up maybe in a different way because we saw what we suffered for example in germany
995454 we obviously cannot say that everything is one hundred percent
995455 we will have to push very hard these next three weeks in the factory in terms of the cars development and reliability but we showed the cars whole potential during the second qualifying session and then in the race what happened at the end is part of the sport but we have to think forward enjoy a bit of a break and prepare our energy for the last seven races
995456 if we had been out in front then it perhaps would have been a little different but they showed some really strong pace
995457 we already knew they were fast im going to make sure i work very hard during the break and that physically i am well prepared for the rest of the season

995493 with limited budgets cities look at things like economic development roads police and fire protection as their priorities
995494 the siren program is still there but there is minimal money for it

995686 the alliance party will not be taking the policing and justice ministry
995687 he loyally and steadfastly preaches the gospel but he doesnt shove it down our throats we get on well with david
995688 i have never felt self congratulatory in any way about my involvement because it did precipitate a conflict which eventually claimed 3 500 lives and that is inescapable
995689 it would be very cruel to say that what we have ended up with is a twilight home in east belfast for retired gunmen but are relations today between the communities really that different
995690 im just not convinced that the outcome we do have is any better than what we wouldve had had the march not went ahead
995691 the thought that this would lead to a re emergence of militant irish nationalism which would in turn bring about the resurgence of militant loyalism would simply never even have occurred to us
995692 what this was about and what it has returned to was equality of citizenship history will record the provisional iras campaign as a continuation of the civil rights movement by inappropriate means
995693 between the pomposity of bew and the extravagance of mccann i might look like the sane one
995694 there can be no viler act apart from homosexuality and sodomy than sexually abusing children
995695 a new duty will be placed on local authorities to promote democracy local leaders will be expected to do more to help residents understand how the democratic process works and how they can get involved residents can expect to see information campaigns and town halls being opened up to councillors to hold surgeries new civic champions council staff or former councillors who will go out into the community and work with residents and community groups to increase understanding about how they can raise awareness about civic roles they can take up whether thats volunteering standing as a governor a councillor or becoming a magistrate
995696 in our own informal way weve acted more as a critical friend than fawning acolyte or jaded oppositionalist
995697 wed like to highlight the good things that are happening right now in northern ireland and the awards will aim to reward effort and interactivity with a pat on the back from the blogosphere
995698 i have left the party and the press office as i feel that the current programme for government of the stormont administration will put working class communities under increased pressure at a time when the current global credit crunch is already hurting this vulnerable group in society i also feel that the partys left wing credentials have been damaged by the above and by a continued courtship with the american administration
995699 one of the bad things about the internet is that you pay attention to your commenters
995700 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
995701 yes its a rap about particle physics yes it mentions antimatter and the records news commentary and diverse opinion on northern ireland total entries 5484
995702 it is very hard some days to know which way is up
995703 freedom soars on wings outstretched upon the wind of kindness but limitless is the sky when feathers have been strengthened by honest self reflection
995704 unconditional love does not require sacrificing self pride yes self never
995705 the secret lies in being brave enough everyday to embrace the truth that whispers constantly from within
995706 my friendship is eternal my ability to care at all costs is immeasurable my heart soul and spirits depth belong to only one man i am a woman of truth even in my humanness and i will always be perfectly flawed
995707 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
995708 q41 is it true that in england you sign in before you can post messages

995711 it came to me that this woman loves and worships the same god i do
995712 i had this sharpened awareness that in that moment she was in touch with god just as i was it was a dawning and an awakening and it was liberating because it liberates you from standing on a pedestal and looking down on someone else
995713 beyond 9 11 christians and muslims together a new world vision
995714 is that we can find a way to bridge the chasm between christians muslims jews hindus and buddhists and make atlanta a model city that over the next year or two we can develop an interfaith immersion program
995715 a soft evangelical i ask questions and listen rather than telling people what they ought to do or believe
995716 im the most unlikely candidate for becoming a spokesperson about islam
995717 i wondered who i was now that i wasnt a teacher preacher traveler or speaker
995718 you get beneath the dogma and creeds to the essence of what religion is about its about god in human beings in human consciousness
995719 a voice in my head said and you dont know anything about islam which was true i have five degrees four of them theological and other religions had never been taught seriously to me
995720 everything about my faith is rooted in the stories my two grandmothers told me
995721 no one formally taught me to pray as a child i had the question what is god like my grandmother answered that is like a drop in the ocean trying to understand what the ocean is like this is something i feel with my heart god is present in everything god is all around us
995722 there were a couple of imams muslim clerics and im thinking they know all this stuff and im stumbling around in it
995723 we had a pastor and an imam describe how they came to the faith that gives their lives meaning
995724 and we asked people to talk at their tables about how their faith came to them
995725 i dont think just knowledge about another faith is any good
995726 youve gotta meet someone who is of the faith who is speaking out of conviction and out of experience to really feel what islam is like
995727 puts muslims at ease because hes mastered the broad historical perspective of islam but also some of the nuanced details
995728 people are more open to learning a new perspective from someone they respect ben is not trying to convert anyone but to inform people and build understanding
995729 when i heard him talk about islam i thought we need him
995730 many christians are fearful of islam so they put up barriers they trust ben so they are willing to take the first step and listen for understanding
995731 if you sit in silence you can get deep enough into your faith that it touches another person
995732 the reality is that at the core were all the same
995733 in my 76th year i would be passionate about getting christians jews muslims and hindus together nothing in my history would point me in this direction this is not my dream i think its the spirit of god
995734 human blood is the life line of islam violence its hallmark and hate its foundation in the beginning islam lives on the blood of infidels when that is unavailable or becomes difficult islam must cannibalize itself
995735 like children playing with dynamite western intellectuals journalists and diplomats fantasize that they are achieving results in the middle east with their words promises apologies money and concessions yet how can such innocents cope with polities and societies whose basic ruling ethos is that of the serial killer can anyone really expect a stable society capable of progress in pakistan when a large majority of the population expresses admiration for usama bin ladin and what about the saudi system where as one local writer put it the big usama put into practice what the little usama learned in a saudi school the radical forces in the region are not expecting to retain or gain power by negotiating compromising or being better understood they believe they are going to shoot their way into power or just as good accept the surrender of those they have intimidated that is why so much of the western analysis and strategies for dealing with the region are a bad joke
995736 europe is being targeted for deliberate colonization by muslim states and with coordinated efforts aimed at our islamization and the elimination of our freedoms we are being subject to a foreign invasion and aiding and abetting a foreign invasion in any way constitutes treason if non europeans have the right to resist colonization and desire self determination then europeans have that right too and we intend to exercise it
995737 a muslim apostate once suggested to me a litmus test for westerners

995767 i think its come to the point where there needs to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
995768 packers president and ceo mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
995769 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers

995785 ive moved way up see i better throw it now or the pockets gonna collapse on me

995795 weve had some pretty big regular season games in the last couple of years a couple years ago when
995796 you mean playing perfect in a playoff game and winning is not winning a big game the way i look at this job is if youre waiting for everyone to get on your side and think youre great youll be miserable your whole career

995872 people ask if we alter the flavour of our sake to suit the american palate we do not we are just selling them sake that we believe is the best around
995873 whereas europe is traditionally wine country the us is not traditionally anything
995874 americans like their wine but its less established so the country is more open to new trends europeans taste sake and say yes its good and clearly a quality product but the next drink they have is wine
995875 but this too is slowly changing there is more potential in the uk and europe as europeans surely have a more refined palate than north americans
995876 young people who come here to drink my sake say they didnt realise it could be so good they thought it was an old mans drink
995877 the japanese are very concerned about what foreigners think of their country so if we have more success in the us market then japanese consumers may give it another try

995879 we no longer think of the history of cinema as a linear march towards only one possible language or as a progression towards more and more accurate verisimilitude rather we have come to see its history as a succession of distinct and equally expressive languages each with its own aesthetic variables
995880 so this is a promise given and a promise kept
995881 this bill will provide an important alternative to the way doctors currently get their information about drugs from the drug companies themselves
995882 by providing physicians with thorough independent research on all the drugs available to them we believe we can improve the quality of healthcare and reduce the cost of prescription drugs in america
995883 for far too long most of the information physicians receive to make prescribing decisions has come from the drug companies marketing reps not independent experts
995884 this important legislation will go a long way toward giving doctors another less biased perspective
995885 we need a program like this to counter the pharmaceutical industrys marketing free for all
995886 academic detailing programs already exist in other countries and in several states and theyve been shown to improve care and generate savings
995887 tempo che scendiamo e arriviamo alla sbarra dove erano parcheggiate e se erano portati via pure laltra allora io subito il pazzo del gruppo propongo una posta per beccare il ladro che torner per prendere lultima dopo 20 minuti un nulla di fatto e risaliamo a dormire la mattina siamo andati al commissariato e dopo 20minuti avevamo una denuncia bella che firmata per il biciclettaro quando arriviamo li e gli dico che ci avevano fregato 3 bici su 4 lui mi fa nessun problema mi date 450 euro e siamo apposto io gli dico di non averli e lui insiste minacciando di trattenermi il documento mettendoci nelle frasi anche qualche

996091 with a proven record of delivering complex military and commercial ships on time and on budget at a firm fixed price fincantieri will bring to the u s market its extensive expertise in modern ship design and construction methods thus greatly enhancing the technological capability and production processes at the yards of mmg
996092 this acquisition represents a significant step in pursuing the growth of fincantieri and its naval business overseas
996093 further we achieve a key milestone in the implementation of our business plan
996094 this will enhance the littoral combat ship teams ability to deliver high quality and high value ships to support the u s navys critical mission
996095 as our legacy business marine led the way in establishing manitowocs tradition of integrity commitment to stakeholders and passion for excellence the values that have driven the success for all three of our segments in addition this transaction expands the opportunities for mmg to continue its industry leadership in the future more importantly it will allow mmg to become part of a growing global organization that is exclusively focused on commercial and military shipbuilding

996097 i have serious problems about ranking law schools and the methodology but its a fact of life
996098 not participating not only wouldnt accomplish getting rid of the rankings it could be worse than it is now
996099 i think it has a real effect if the deans dont participate
996100 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
996101 given the fact that they already paid steven hatfill 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
996102 just another false track and a real diversion of where they need to be we dont know and they arent telling us
996103 after a thorough review of all the evidence testimony and facts of this case this court concludes the strongly expressed convictions of the trial court in this case may not be easily and objectively reconsidered
996104 it was clear that he had a point of view and we disagreed with it we tried the case and he cut us off at every pass ive never had something like this in my whole career and i hope i never do again
996105 will generate a groundswell of support among the american people as well as his colleagues in congress and lead to the development of comprehensive legislation to tackle the nations energy crisis
996106 an important step in the process of reducing our dangerous dependence on foreign oil
996107 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
996108 ive always believed that finding consensus will be essential to solving our energy crisis and todays package represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning
996109 its neat to see that people are still supporting me after all this because its just like you kind of wonder if the overwhelming fan reception was just because i was on the show and they were watching it
996110 its pretty fun to see that theyre still paying attention
996111 do you remember that i used to watch that all the time when i was little
996112 the novels are no longer just about owning that great pair of shoes chick lit in all its recently varied forms focuses on womens lives and tribulations in a fun filled way
996113 council is once again in a position where an awkwardly framed where the absence of an awkwardly framed question is before us
996114 the difference in price continues to be a bone of contention
996115 on the north side weve had cbas for the last 28 years
996116 somebody from this body needs to be appointed to that authority because right now we have no way of connecting
996117 it is clear from these results that these patients were not experiencing the degree of choice that choose and book was designed to deliver this may be only one hospital with results taken in a transitional period but we believe this could be typical of the national picture
996118 patient choice has been heralded as the driver for transforming the nhs and a means of meeting the expectations of patients
996119 using the access rules we had acquired at the time we were able to read the information including passwords which gave us system administrator access to every server several hundred in the organisation
996120 that level of access not only gave us complete control of their systems but we could have deleted any audit trail we might have left
996121 too many people install citrix without comprehensive knowledge of the design and management of the citrix environment and careful consideration of how to mitigate risk
996122 rule one is to implement citrixs own guidance about how to lock down a system read the manual please rule two is to be meticulous in how you define and provide access to information switching to role based access is a step in the right direction
996123 there are a bewildering number of professional bodies and associations even viewed from within the profession so what must it be like for the rest of the business world
996124 it is brilliant to reach the final of such a prestigious award weve been concentrating so hard on establishing limehouse in leeds that it was the last thing we anticipated to happen at this stage of the business and on such a national scale
996125 nick burton has done a tremendous job at bmedi it is now our job to ensure that the company continues to thrive and further grow our network of digital and creative companies in the west yorkshire region
996126 as a founding director i have lived and breathed bmedi for many years the passion that runs throughout the team and membership undoubtedly helped us through the transition from a funded project to a self sustaining enterprise
996127 the board and executive team know all too well that the continued success of bmedi will rely solely on the teams ability to deliver relevant and tangible benefits from an expanding range of key services to the people that need them the most and as a member myself it goes without saying that i am most certainly all for it
996128 being a funded project is certainly easier than having to stand on your own two feet lessons have been learnt over the past twelve months i think that bmedi s efforts to be functional from the outset certainly stood us in good stead during the transition
996129 having listened to members we have realised that there is much more that we can be doing and many more ways that we can add value the services we are working on are those that we think will be most timely and important to the growth of our members
996130 our analysis of these aspects of workplace behaviour reveals that women and men co mingle etiquette and emotion maintenance to be accepted in the workplace and to fit white expectations

996139 ive personally witnessed the devastation in the amazon that the oil companies have wrought upon these indigenous communities there are open unlined waste pits rainbow oil slicks on the streams high cadmium and lead poisoning in the children and wildlife when you see these crimes you have no choice but to speak up
996140 its of no importance to me what anyone thinks of my participation
996141 whats important is awareness of the facts and issues i truly believe when people have access to information for the most part they will make wise decisions
996142 it was naive of me not to realize that of course and unfortunately short sighted greed and opportunism would step right up to the plate as usual and heavily invest in going down a bad road
996143 its almost inconceivable that some would choose to do things like burn rainforests in malaysia to plant palm plantations or make bio fuels that compete with basic food supplies
996144 we absolutely need bio fuels to play a part in solving our energy crisis demands but its essential to make them sustainably
996145 im glad the message is finally getting across but i was not prepared for the enormous amounts of dollars and energy that has gone into producing bio fuels in an unsustainable manner
996146 well here we are kids try not to trip and fall down
996147 i welcome the opportunity to lead this company into the future

996187 you have some bad information mr mac is responding well to
996188 he asked that his privacy and that of his family is respected while he gets well
996189 people say that we have turned the corner we havent turned the corner weve made progress
996190 my philosophy is you take a freshmen class through four years and when we can get them through four years of consistent winning then you can say gosh i think the program has turned the corner

996201 i am sick of everything i dont want to live any more
996202 i accept shabana had come from a totally different culture and there may well have been a natural reluctance to discuss these problems
996203 she may not have realised she was depressed and i think it was a spontaneous and impulsive reaction to pressures around her
996204 i think she resorted to what would be to her previous culture something that was done
996205 if anything it was a cry for help because she had no other way of expressing herself and i dont think she had any understanding of the danger of using accelerants and fire
996206 er is geen geval bekend van ter dood veroordeling vanwege homoseksualiteit in iran in nederland is het beeld ontstaan dat iran homos executeert enkel vanwege hun geaardheid maar dat is niet gebaseerd op de feiten
996207 toch heeft de iraanse overheid de schijn tegen zich er zijn teveel meldingen van rechtszaken en executies in iran waarbij homoseksuelen betrokken zijn daarom kan men stellen dat homoseksualiteit een rol speelt in rechtszaken mensen worden berecht voor andere strafbare feiten maar seksuele geaardheid kan een straf verzwaren

996221 we are all very sad michael has decided to step down having been such an influential figure in the dressing room it is going to take some used to someone else being in charge
996222 it is a big job ive done it a few times and you only had to see how much it meant to michael vaughan yesterday to realise it is an encompassing job
996223 the one thing i would say about kevin is everything he has done in his career so far he has easily stepped up to the mark and found a way to deal with it

996255 it is imperative to come to terms with the essentially negative basis on which pluralism developed only in this way is it possible to begin to understand why virtually all the nations racial and ethnic minorities have confronted intense and virulent bigotry why all have had to struggle to preserve their ethnic identities and institutions and why the history of race and ethnicity has been fraught with tension rivalry and conflict

996269 all the religious stuff in my history as much as i pursued god looking for a way to please him and get the affection of the father none of it healed the stuff it didnt change me on the inside it wasnt until bad theology fell away and a relationship opened up and then i began to find out god had been there the whole time and waiting for me to be ready to deal with the stuff
996270 for me religion and relationship are very very contradictory ideas you can come up with any religion you want that posits either an impersonal or personal god at a distance and now its up to you to find your way there through a series of steps or finding the right road or something like that rather than a god that knows how lost we are and then pursues us

996314 virtualization is now a key strategic theme for every it department
996315 virtualization is now a key strategic theme for every it department
996316 we turned to virtualization because our data center faces a constant need to add more servers while also being limited by the physical space available without expensive expansion
996317 while it took us one year to get our high availability site up and running sungard came in and had our virtual recovery site ready to go in three weeks for our mission critical applications this experience demonstrates the value companies looking at virtualized recovery solutions can gain by tapping sungards expertise rather than handling internally
996318 server virtualization will dramatically change the it recovery services model for both the services provider and the customer with replication to a shared storage infrastructure and a virtualized server infrastructure customers can enjoy improved recovery time and recovery point objectives without the cost of dedicated and custom recovery solutions from the dr service provider
996319 the achilles heel of most virtualized it environments is that they rely on a single data center to facilitate system failover should an event occur
996320 a recovery strategy with no off site data may mean quite possibly no recovery virtual server replication services provides organizations an affordable way to have access to a secondary data center for protection of physical and virtual it environments

996335 the new bmw speed limit display will significantly reduce the risk of drivers exceeding the speed limit by mistake especially on roads with multiple speed zones
996336 there have been numerous reports that the governments focus on making vehicles with emissions at the higher end of the scale less attractive high fuel prices plus the ill informed antics of some members of the anti 4x4 lobby have weakened the residual values and reduced popularity among used buyers for four wheel drive vehicles
996337 certainly the people we speak to in the industry say that at auction 4x4s need to be in the very best condition to sell and that there are few customers for those vehicles of a poor standard
996338 of course one option is to shift the residual value risk to a provider
996339 renting a 4x4 only for those occasions when actually you need one makes practical environmental and economic sense as we have such a large fleet of 4x4s we can offer low rates for short medium or long term rentals and deliver them to anywhere in the uk then when its done the job just hand it back
996340 if youre a company buying a number of vehicles firstly make sure you spread the risk in terms of manufacturer colours specification and transmissions
996341 have a number of sales channels open to you through retail internet and trade so as one channel slows you have the ability to shift stock to another
996342 make sure all working vehicles are either ply or load lined from new to minimise load area damage to the actual vehicle during its life
996343 and of course for private and business users there the basic rules of all used vehicles full service history spotlessly clean and in good condition at sale time just because its a 4x4 doesnt mean buyers will accept less than good condition for it
996344 this is an important milestone in our companys rich history
996345 the last fifty years has seen not only an impressive catalogue of iconic vehicles come from our company but the establishment of a successful enterprise serving so many important customers in this part of the world
996346 from heavy trucks and light vans through to the premium luxury cars the three pointed star is famous for mercedes benz has proudly offered many solutions to the needs of the australian market
996347 in a step by step manner assemble the mercedes benz vehicle model range with an emphasis on heavy trucks and promote the export possibilities to countries of the south pacific region
996348 when we were assembling cars he had his own man on the production line verifying that every car was spot on hed look at every payment that came in and sign every cheque that went out
996349 secondly he was a great marketing guy who developed the system of distributors in every state thirdly he had great business sense one example was his decision to stop assembling cars here
996350 it was the right decision because the governments local content laws demanded australian made product in manufacturing meaning we couldnt maintain the integrity of our product

996353 the browser based ui to render the view with the browser not with gtk
996354 the d bus bridge is an essential part of that it lets you easily combine the services from the internet in mashups for example utilizing location information from a gps chip and then combining that with a google apps api and then adding some other services that are providing a binding on the ui layer
996355 it allows them to provide google apps integration but also make mashups that are operator branded and operator integrated they can bring the google service platform to their devices without having to join android they are deciding which services they are providing and not following what google provides
996356 operators can decide to use yahoo apis instead or their own apis
996357 you could use it to integrate a phones media player device with online services so while you are listening to a song the app can call up the online music store to check what similar music is available and make suggestions we believe there are huge opportunities to make very creative new mashups
996358 our main focus is on smartphones and high end feature phones but we have been working with nokia on internet tablets and are now working on mids running on moblin as well

996377 baja trophy truck racing is a very special challenge beyond the b models and beyond most vehicles with volkswagen components
996378 over the past 40 years volkswagens vehicles and technology had a significant impact on how the score baja events basically developed we look forward to the future of this partnership and also to clean diesel technology making its way into our sport

996567 certain elements of the isi of leaking information to the terrorists before they could be hit by the us or pakistani forces
996568 the united states has not met its national security goals to destroy terrorist threats instead al qaeda has regenerated its ability to attack the us and has successfully established a safe haven
996569 no comprehensive plan for meeting us national security goals in the fata federally administered tribal areas has been developed as stipulated by the national strategy for combating terrorism 2003 as called for by an independent commission 2004 and as mandated by congressional legislation 2007
996570 furthermore congress created the national counterterrorism center nctc in 2004 specifically to develop comprehensive plans to combat terrorism however neither the national security council the nctc nor other executive branch departments have developed a comprehensive plan that includes all elements of national power diplomatic military intelligence development assistance economic and law enforcement support as called for by the various national security strategies and congress
996571 given the powers that pakistans army has enjoyed over successive civilian governments there is no way the isi can be made answerable to the prime minister

996599 theres no way on windows xp to do this translucent windows are done through gdi on xp so no possibility of hardware acceleration beyond what we already do anyway vram is not supposed to be accessed from by the cpu the idea is that you upload the data there preferably not very often and let the gpu handle it using shaders or whatever and then show it on some architectures for some particular framebuffers theres advantage to writing directly to vram but windows isnt one of them so just keeping your buffers in vram may not be the best way especially if your application requires per pixel access on vista where each window is pretty much a piece of offscreen video memory there is a way to do translucent windows with full hw acceleration that is the data never leaves vram well be looking into this for future releases
996600 so first find out what quality level the recording was done then look for splitting titles in the manual and split accordingly 1 hour mode split in 1 hour increments 2 hour mode split in two hour increments etc look for nice spots to split keeping it within the record mode range once the event is split into increments then you can rename the titles part 1 part 2 etc and copy individually

996616 gary glitter is a persistent offender responsible for a catalogue of sexual crimes against children
996617 we are concerned that current travel prevention orders designed to prevent a sex offender from going overseas are not working hardly any have been issued in the past five years
996618 we want the uk government to urgently review the power and scope of these orders so that where there is clear evidence a sex offender poses a risk to children the authorities have effective powers to stop them from travelling
996619 where it is known that a sex offender convicted in another country is to be deported to the uk he is met at the port of entry by the police who interview him and pass any relevant information to the police in the area to which the offender is proposing to live
996620 the sexual offences act 2003 introduced a new civil order designed to ensure that those convicted of sex offences overseas are made to sign on the sex offenders register in the uk

996625 theres not enough time in the day to address all the people the media have her linked with
996626 im appreciative every time i see mitt on television on my behalf
996627 he does a better job for me than he did for himself as a matter of fact
996628 i was buzzing just signing for this club and to score a hat trick has just topped the last couple of days off
996629 the way this team plays suits me and theres more goals to come
996630 i prefer to play up front with a big man who flicks things on i gamble to get on the end of things
996631 whether im playing with a big or small lad hopefully ill make chances or score them
996632 the players have helped me and theyve not put any pressure on me just told me to go out and play my game
996633 taff was at all of our games last season and he came up to the training ground a couple of times a week but hes struggled with his hip so hell be doing more scouting work for us at home and abroad
996634 if he calls me and says sign this player then id sign him thats how much i value his judgement
996635 terry has done an excellent job and is a popular figure with the players its a pleasure to have him working alongside me
996636 stephen was released by coventry city but when i first enquired about him i was under the impression he was being offered a new contract
996637 i turned my attention to other players but out of the blue i found that he was a free agent i then put the ball in motion to try to bring him to the club
996638 it has taken us two or three weeks and a lot of competition but i know how important he can be for us
996639 he is an experienced guy who has played at the highest level i thought he is captain material and the type of guy our younger players could look up to
996640 he has bedded in quite well but he has not done anything for a fortnight he has been on trial at nottingham forest and he has been doing a bit of work on his own
996641 hopefully he will get more time against west brom tomorrow and then be contention for the game at yeovil
996642 when he is fully match fit i believe we will have a very good player
996643 sanjays technical expertise and industry experience make him ideally suited to lead mobile devices
996644 you can only vote once on each poll so you can go over the whole page once and then only vote for immunity and who will go in the tribes who have just visited tribal council and therefore have new polls put up each week
996645 up to now there has not been a call from the office development community for symbols so no percieved need exists
996646 delighted that all proceeds from these stunning images will once again be donated entirely to charity
996647 its great bringing my movie to a place that i feel familiar
996648 it is a brave decision because kp hasnt done much captaincy before
996649 but everything he has done in his career he has easily stepped up to the mark and found a way to deal with it
996650 i think that selfish aspect is overplayed he would probably admit in his youth he was a bit like that but i dont think he is like that so much now
996651 it was a bit too much for me during the last ashes series and affected my form as an all rounder but kevins a batsman and the captaincy shouldnt affect his ability
996652 his batting his aggressive and his captaincy will be similar
996653 he likes to work very hard and likes to think about all aspects of his game he has the backing of his team
996654 when i originally signed him up for notts i saw his talent as batsman and bowler
996655 im delighted for him but i think he will need all the help in the world the england players dont play county cricket and dont get experience of captaincy
996656 kevin has to make sure he is still focused on his job as a batsman you cant have roy of the rovers as captain
996657 you have to make the experienced paul collingwood the vice captain and you have to have former captains michael vaughan and nasser hussain giving him ideas
996658 england need someone they can respect and who can take them forward over a period of time
996659 there are precedents for the best player being the captain allan border did it for australia and viv richards they were both successful so why not
996660 the most important thing about being a leader is having the respect of the players because then they follow you and play for you
996661 he needs to surround himself with a good unit he needs to back his own instinct
996662 its often instinct you rely on on the field and man management off the field
996663 when you see a guy with a haircut like that you have to shake your head and wonder where hes going
996664 we had no doubt from very early on what an exceptional player he was going to be
996665 he went straight into our first team and his self confidence took people by surprise a little bit it wasnt really an english attitude
996666 im not suppose to bury my sons it should be the other way around
996667 his family and his job were always top priority he hardly ever stayed away from work he never drank nor smoke he left home as usual for work at 6am yesterday nobody expected this
996668 we dont know if he was in the truck or if he was standing on the bridge
996669 the ministry should ultimately be held responsible for not overseeing the dismantling project i think that there should have been a supervisor or a project manager on site to overseer the project if there was this tragedy would have been prevented
996670 preliminary reports also indicate that the crew employed to dismantle this bridge had been trained to do so by a british firm and further approximately fifty bridges of a similar nature have been dismantled without a single incident to date
996671 to begin with and from what i saw myself when i came to the site this morning was that the dismantling process was not being done the right way that is why the bridge snapped from the middle and collapsed
996672 it is unfortunate that one man was killed and four injured i believe that if the process was being handled in the correct manner this tragedy would have been avoided
996673 the reality is that this particular bailey bridge was erected in 1996 12 years ago in order to provide two way traffic on the southern main road across the caroni river and it is not associated in any way with the new mabey delta bridge across the caroni river which was commissioned in january 2008
996674 it should also be noted that this particular bailey bridge had not been in use for the last six months and it was being dismantled so that it could be used at another location

996730 yo lo que creo es que kirchner sufri un deterioro lento por la forma de gobernar y que lleg un momento en el que ps quicamente qued mal no se puede hacer lo que hac a l como presidente todo todo lo hac a l el dec a mir que la carrera es larga y no hay cuerpo que aguante ese estilo se mete en todo y eso lo va agotando lo va poniendo mal y yo creo seriamente que entr en un desgaste ps quico muy grande por eso
996731 buen funcionario para ejecutar rdenes que les solicitan por supuesto con un estilo muy malo pero no es moreno en realidad es el gobierno el que manda a hacer eso
996732 sergio massa es el dirigente joven m s capaz yo lo ve a como un futuro presidente espero que no le suceda lo que a otros j venes que entran a una picadora de carne
996733 tienen el frente totalmente tapado m sica muy fuerte que trasciende al exterior y casi no tienen luces internas
996734 we have no intention of getting out of the chipset business
996735 in fact our mcp business is as strong as it has ever been for both amd and intel platforms
996736 the retirees issues will not go unnoticed or their concerns will not be unheard we will be there for our retirees and their issues as well as our own
996737 every time we go on vacation it just gets more fun
996738 the thomas back pack is for vacation and the cars back pack is for school
996739 right now from the preliminary stages they do not have a lot of information as far as who the suspect was or what transpired or if anybody actually saw anything
996740 its not like anybody feels that any of those guys being mentioned in either party has to get it
996741 maybe its hindsight playing tricks on me but it looks like the short lists in some years past contained people of greater stature
996742 static caused by urgent sometimes vexing or even contradictory information played at too high a volume for too long
996743 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
996744 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
996745 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
996746 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
996747 liriano looked pretty good and i think it was just the right time for the first place twins to summon his butt from rochester
996748 that was a pretty odd looking lineup out there sunday but there was enough offense there for the first place twins to win
996749 if the first place twins remain in first place you think morneau has a shot at mvp and does it really matter
996750 now that the first place twins have taken care of last place cleveland its on to seattle for three games against the last place mariners you think carlos silva is gonna be jealous
996751 the middle infield is going to have to work together a bit better if the first place twins are gonna remain in first place
996752 anyone can make a baby but not everyone can be a parent
996753 the message that needs to be communicated to these people is your problem is not global warming
996754 your problem is not global warming your problem is your nuts
996755 theyre going to the gore movie an inconvenient truth and being fed all this its ridiculous
996756 well look back on all of this in 10 or 15 years and realise how foolish it was
996757 the human impact on the atmosphere is simply too small to have a major effect on global temperatures
996758 it bothers me that my fellow scientists are not speaking out against something they know is wrong
996759 but they also know that theyd never get any grants if they spoke out i dont care about grants
996760 this is the fastest temperature change in the instrumental record and it puts us back to where we were in 1930
996761 human rights activists everywhere to condemn this violation of mr juarezs civil rights child rape is one of the basic civil rights guaranteed by the un civil rights commission
996762 the united states our future colony refuses to recognize that child rape is an important part of our superior mexican culture
996763 mr juarez is missing work at the factory farm of one of my big campaign contributors so i have asked president bush to pardon him so he can get back to work where he belongs he will be whipped for missing work while he was fooling around with that girl
996764 because we say so since we duke professors are smarter than anyone we know
996765 mr juarez is doing the kind of raping that americans wont do we have many 10 year old girls in the us but not enough skilled us rapists my proposed legislation will grant mr juarez full citizenship upon payment of a fine of 50 00 payable to the republican national congressional committee which desperately needs the money if mr juarez doesnt have enough money to pay the fine he should go rob someone
996766 if she had taken the ride in my car that i offered her she would not have been home to be raped by this future democrat voter we offer him sanctuary in massatwochits hic
996767 the girls family didnt buy carbon rights i bought from a chinese farmer who promised not to burn a million tons of coal this year so there was a cyclone which caused this rape
996768 conservatives say that we just need to focus on maintaining free markets and let everything sort itself out through the miracle of the invisible hand but the political tide is turning against unfettered free markets and toward greater regulation
996769 this is the fastest temperature change in the instrumental record and it puts us back to where we were in 1930
996770 there are things you can do individually though to save energy
996771 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
996772 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
996773 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
996774 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
996775 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
996776 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
996777 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
996778 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
996779 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
996780 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
996781 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
996782 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
996783 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
996784 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
996785 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
996786 we talk about senator clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well in a role that is in many ways more powerful than the president
996787 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
996788 there is significant support among top mccain advisers that he make a transformative pick who would change the republican party someone who would appeal to moderate republicans and democrats this pick would be someone who like mccain has taken the unpopular stands made the hard calls and stood firm on principle a person who fills that bill these advisers say is joe lieberman
996789 you know something the republicans dont want to win this election they dont mccain may want to win but these people around him that are giving him this advice they must not want to win this election
996790 there is a reason the american people the past 100 years elevated only two sitting senators into the white house jfk and warren harding its because they believe most senators adept at compulsive compromise have no political compass and will sell them out
996791 were mad as hell and were not going to take it anymore
996792 change which have driven his campaign from the start mccain will be trading on his experience
996793 sen obamas background as a community organizer means he understands the value of reaching in florida communities to talk about his vision for turning the page on the failed politics of the past
996794 in honor of sen obamas birthday our volunteers will talk to their neighbors to share the story of his lifetime a story of bringing people together to create positive change as a community organizer a civil rights lawyer a constitutional law professor a state ssenator and now a u s senator
996795 sen obamas background as a community organizer means he understands the value of reaching in florida communities
996796 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
996797 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
996798 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
996799 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
996800 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
996801 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
996802 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
996803 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
996804 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
996805 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
996806 theyve taken a loophole in the law and with 15 people they have managed to establish themselves as a fringe party whose sole purpose is to confuse voters that democrats have support from a phantom party
996807 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
996808 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
996809 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
996810 no school should have to make a choice between books and transporting kids diesel fuel costs are slamming school districts and placing too heavy of a burden on our schools budgets
996811 an enhanced hybrid school bus tax credit will ease some of that burden so that schools can put resources where it matters towards our kids education
996812 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
996813 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
996814 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
996815 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
996816 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
996817 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
996818 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
996819 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
996820 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
996821 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
996822 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
996823 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
996824 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
996825 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
996826 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
996827 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
996828 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
996829 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
996830 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
996831 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
996832 water infiltrating the concrete slabs freezes and then thaws weakening the concrete and rusting the steel
996833 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
996834 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today
996835 big hurdle is fund raising even among a business community that is desperate to throw out mr mcgraw
996836 10 thinks you didnt know about west virginia gov joe manchin
996837 in my 31 years of social work i dont think ive seen a crime this heinous perpetrated against a social worker in the line of duty
996838 thats old uncle aunt insert name talking out of his her head again
996839 they were talking about a turkish ship that sunk while taking much needed supplies to greece as i was preparing it i was shocked why didnt anyone know about this
996840 everyone i talked to ended their interview by saying how nonsensical the tension between turkey and greece is unfortunately not a single turkish witness survives
996841 kurtulu until february 1942 was the symbol of hope for greeks after it sank more ships came but all of them were known as kurtulu to us people used to say we are hungry but kurtulu will come tomorrow
996842 things can be taken care of only with a compromise solution that will allow our three countries to prosper in the area in an environemnt of solidarity and friendship within the united europe real patriots strive for this purpose only as it is the only option we have for survival listen to the pavement patriots and you might as well sign the death sentence of cyprus
996843 they were talking about a turkish ship that sunk while taking much needed supplies to greece as i was preparing it i was shocked why didnt anyone know about this
996844 everyone i talked to ended their interview by saying how nonsensical the tension between turkey and greece is unfortunately not a single turkish witness survives
996845 kurtulu until february 1942 was the symbol of hope for greeks after it sank more ships came but all of them were known as kurtulu to us people used to say we are hungry but kurtulu will come tomorrow
996846 einem mehr oder weniger geplanten mehr oder weniger beabsichtigten oder bewussten nicht institutionalisierten lernen
996847 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
996848 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
996849 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
996850 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
996851 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
996852 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
996853 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
996854 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
996855 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
996856 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
996857 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
996858 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
996859 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
996860 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
996861 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
996862 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
996863 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
996864 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
996865 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
996866 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
996867 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
996868 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
996869 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
996870 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
996871 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
996872 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
996873 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
996874 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
996875 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
996876 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
996877 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
996878 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
996879 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
996880 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
996881 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
996882 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
996883 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
996884 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
996885 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
996886 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
996887 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
996888 the idea that were going to offshore drill our way out of this is just so absurd as to not warrant consideration if youre in a hole stop digging
996889 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
996890 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
996891 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
996892 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
996893 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
996894 can you please tell me what the lottery numbers will be in the next drawing
996895 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance
996896 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
996897 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
996898 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
996899 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
996900 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
996901 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
996902 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
996903 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
996904 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
996905 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
996906 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
996907 you know its not about you its about your country
996908 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
996909 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
996910 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
996911 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
996912 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
996913 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
996914 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
996915 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
996916 designers have mindsets that are constantly seeking ways of creating something new
996917 health professionals have an extraordinary amount of expertise knowledge and information at their fingertips designers have mindsets that are constantly seeking ways of creating something new when you bring these two groups together then there is a great possibility and opportunity particularly to innovate and develop new services we have a lot to learn from each other
996918 theyll see us coming in and have a press conference in english then say well take care of you when were done
996919 we do things outside the realm of news but it gives an image to the viewers that we care
996920 but the people who tried to do it before either didnt know enough about television or didnt know about the u s market
996921 one of the first questions i was asked by cable operators is what makes you think you can succeed
996922 if you want to keep asking me over and over again youre welcome to
996923 its great bringing my movie to a place that i feel familiar
996924 not like the cannes film festival where nobodys speaking english or the tribeca film festival where no one sits down
996925 theres something poetic about coming back to the place where i used to come for holidays camping trips with my dad and stepmother and my very large family
996926 she has such an incredible heart and such a generous spirit
996927 she does so much out of the glare of the lights to make the world a better place
996928 there arent a lot of role models for us in the world or people we can look up to
996929 people who are not afraid to stick their neck out people who are not afraid to stand up for things and be unpopular to go against the grain think outside the box
996930 and we need and i need michael moore in my life
996931 for many of our mountain commuters it is the only form of transportation that these people have
996932 everything that we do is being undermined by the fuel crisis
996933 you would put a lot of people out of work if you took their bus away from them
996934 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
996935 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
996936 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
996937 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
996938 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
996939 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate
996940 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record
996941 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
996942 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
996943 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
996944 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
996945 we think its high time that mr gore throw caution to the wind and streak naked across the arctic now that would really dramatize the problem of global warming and grab the public by the balls
996946 gore new yorker cover way too far over the top
996947 im gonna get me so of that reward and shut that mans pie hole up once and for all
996948 i never heard a man moan so much about anything much less about global warming and the coming judgment day he done scared the hell out of my chickens now they dont lay as many eggs as before
996949 when im done thinking up something that will finally shut that man up i just know my chickens will be laying like the used to
996950 but for now theyll have to wear ear plugs you best get a pair too because its gonna be a long ten years of hearing that man talking without them
996951 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
996952 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
996953 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
996954 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
996955 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
996956 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
996957 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
996958 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
996959 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
996960 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
996961 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
996962 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
996963 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
996964 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
996965 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
996966 the bulk of his treatment is completed but he still gets chemo once a week his immune system is still repressed so right now his staff believes he wont go you never know with him though he might get up one day and decide he has to be there
996967 the couples who are slowest to marry tend to be the quickest to split
996968 do i treat friends acquaintances coworkers and even strangers nicer than i do my significant other
996969 a political promise to do something 40 years from now
996970 because everyone knows thats meaningless ten years is about the maximum time that we as a nation can hold a steady aim and hit the target
996971 are the very same measures needed to renew our economy
996972 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
996973 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
996974 in one month than an average american family uses in an entire year
996975 burned through enough electricity to power 232 average american households for a month
996976 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
996977 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
996978 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
996979 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
996980 you dont see where all the carbon goes so there is a misconception that woody species such as trees and shrubs store more carbon thats just not the case
996981 will attend a weekend meeting with irans chief nuclear negotiator the meeting is part of ongoing efforts to persuade iran to stop its nuclear program
996982 abba and pierce brosnan thats the best movie i have seen in a long time
996983 weve tried to maximize the use of these moments with our founder and chairman al gore so that we can continue the momentum not just for our campaign but to keep the cause at the top of the news
996984 the challenge gore laid down today becomes a focal point and a rallying call for pr efforts around the campaign it gives our grassroots effort something to rally around
996985 these national conversations about oil prices energy and what are people going to do the idea to drill more as a solution thats the reason we needed to do this today to start to put a different framework around the issues
996986 shhhhhh he doesnt really mean it he is just trying to appeal to the tree hugger types
996987 he is saying much more libertarian sounding things in private conversations
996988 there obviously is a role for government theres a role for private industry theres a role for nonprofits and certainly a role for the american people individually and collectively
996989 theyll see us coming in and have a press conference in english then say well take care of you when were done
996990 we do things outside the realm of news but it gives an image to the viewers that we care
996991 but the people who tried to do it before either didnt know enough about television or didnt know about the u s market
996992 one of the first questions i was asked by cable operators is what makes you think you can succeed
996993 if you want to keep asking me over and over again youre welcome to
996994 its great bringing my movie to a place that i feel familiar
996995 not like the cannes film festival where nobodys speaking english or the tribeca film festival where no one sits down
996996 theres something poetic about coming back to the place where i used to come for holidays camping trips with my dad and stepmother and my very large family
996997 she has such an incredible heart and such a generous spirit
996998 she does so much out of the glare of the lights to make the world a better place
996999 there arent a lot of role models for us in the world or people we can look up to
997000 people who are not afraid to stick their neck out people who are not afraid to stand up for things and be unpopular to go against the grain think outside the box
997001 and we need and i need michael moore in my life
997002 for many of our mountain commuters it is the only form of transportation that these people have
997003 everything that we do is being undermined by the fuel crisis
997004 you would put a lot of people out of work if you took their bus away from them
997005 buscando simplicidad y m s rapidez en la operaci n pusimos m s arriba lo que m s se usa
997006 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
997007 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
997008 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
997009 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
997010 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
997011 if al gore is upset about carbon we must need more of it
997012 my bet would be on policy decision as usual however
997013 but you can put it on the agenda and try to move the country
997014 a 90 percent chance that the us has contributed 2 degrees f of temperature increase in the last 50 years
997015 what a great big long grand x you have dear n
997016 and the quickest and easiest way to back out the coal which is the worst of the problem and oil is to look at electricity generation
997017 i also think that the coal and oil industries can play a big role in this if they will make good on the promise that carbon capture and sequestration will be real
997018 first canis focaccia no cheese is italian pizza is american
997019 america is a deeply racist society and whites are to blame for all of the social problems befalling blacks
997020 kunhan emme p st t t joukkoa m r m n kaikkien puolesta
997021 all men have fear the brave ones lay it down and go forward some unto death but all to victory
997022 i would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of the republicans as a partisan witch hunt because i think weve got too many problems to solve
997023 i dont think the next president will do that no matter who he is
997024 i think a lot of us feel that the american people are entitled to the whole truth
997025 the american people are entitled to an investigation from an official body that has access to the classified documents that makes as much public as it can
997026 pardon any official from cabinet secretary on down who might plausibly face prosecution
997027 a lot of people think that that is not something that goes over well with the american people
997028 what we have much more of a tradition of is presidential fact finding commissions
997029 something like this would be unprecedented in the american experience and i think it would be absolutely necessary
997030 presidential commissions and national security the politics of damage control
997031 weve had panels that have looked at scandals weve had panels that have looked at intractable political problems
997032 but nothing in terms of looking at an issue that has this array of legal moral and even spiritual questions attached to it
997033 for the first time in olympic history we will have complete global online coverage and the ioc will have its own broadcast channel and content production facilities
997034 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
997035 gee i guess we ought to drive a bit less
997036 we need more onramps and parking lots and big box stores to fuel our auto centric lifestyle and bring in more tax revenue
997037 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates jobs are being outsourced home mortgages are in trouble banks automobile companies and other institutions we depend upon are under growing pressure
997038 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
997039 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
997040 many people doubted we could accomplish that goal but 8 years and 2 months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
997041 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
997042 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
997043 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
997044 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
997045 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
997046 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
997047 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
997048 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
997049 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
997050 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
997051 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
997052 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
997053 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
997054 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
997055 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
997056 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
997057 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
997058 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
997059 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
997060 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
997061 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
997062 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
997063 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
997064 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
997065 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
997066 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
997067 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
997068 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
997069 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
997070 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
997071 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
997072 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
997073 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
997074 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
997075 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
997076 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
997077 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
997078 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
997079 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
997080 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
997081 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
997082 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
997083 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
997084 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
997085 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
997086 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
997087 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging
997088 i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
997089 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging
997090 i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction

997096 si eso estalla no estaras para que nadie te reproche nada pero en el otro lado lo sabras
997097 la idea que se esconde tras este argumento es que dada la naturaleza de tales eventos cualquier comparaci n con algo menos importante que el genocidio la limpieza tnica las pruebas m dicas poco ticas o la extinci n es inv lida y considerada de muy poco gusto
997098 a medida que una discusi n argentina en internet se alarga la probabilidad de que aparezca una comparaci n en la que se mencione a la dictadura o genocidio de la d cada del 70 tiende a uno
997099 en un proceso progresivo y constante silencioso al inicio y estrepitoso en los ltimos a os pero siempre impulsado por el odio el rencor y la venganza esas organizaciones han utilizado con pertinaz intensidad medios de prensa afines particularmente orientados hacia las generaciones m s j venes para lograr que hechos de enorme importancia se eclipsen de la historia no de la memoria colectiva pero s de la memoria p blica el resultado ha sido una malversaci n de nuestra historia reciente que no s lo echa un manto de silencio y distorsi n sobre parte de una poca en la que los terroristas instalaron una violencia nunca vista en nuestro pa s sino que ha logrado hasta ahora silenciar las voces de condena sobre sus aberrantes cr menes
997100 pero siempre con postura extremas y asi estamos por extremistas y boludos no

997102 all of a sudden we all heard this scream this bloodcurdling scream
997103 the attacker was standing up right over top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him stabbing him stabbing him in the chest area
997104 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
997105 there was no rage in him it was just like he was a robot or something
997106 he was taunting police with the head in his hand out the window
997107 believe me if we could do our jobs without having you relive this terrible experience we would
997108 i tried to get to lay down at 4 oclock this morning but was up 10 minutes later because every time i closed my eyes id see this man in the window with some guys head i had just smoked a cigarette with
997109 pero en los tiempos que nos toca vivir en argentina la bandera simboliza algo m s que el nacionalismo o un chauvinismo barato la bandera es un s mbolo de uni n de un pueblo que reclama ser escuchado ser gobernado como lo merece un pueblo cansado de las tomadas de pelos de los patoteros y de los ladrones de siempre
997110 para los autores de esta investigaci n primera en su g nero ha quedado de manifiesto la existencia de una sensibilidad instintiva hacia la igualdad en los primates no humanos claramente contrarios a las desigualdades lo que significa que el rechazo a la injusticia est m s anclado en los instintos de nuestra especie que en nuestra cultura

997121 you could get a lot of strength from a person like frank who had suffered all the discrimination that a black man goes through in america
997122 frank was part of a group of black vanguard intellectuals
997123 mccarthy era strategy of smear tactics and condemnation by association
997124 struggled to find mentors in his search for a black identity
997125 he made his vision into a beacon a light shedding understanding and enlightenment on the problems that denied people regardless of race national origin or economic status their constitutional rights

997147 i would never fight in the armed forces with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels
997148 it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment
997149 you know i have been very clear in my denunciation of minister farrakhans anti semitic comments i think they are unacceptable and reprehensible i did not solicit this support he expressed pride in an african american who seems to be bringing the country together i obviously cant censor him but it is not support that i sought and were not doing anything i assure you formally or informally with minister farrakhan
997150 but if the word reject sen clinton feels is stronger than the word denounce then im happy to concede the point and i would reject and denounce

997159 seeing thousands of old 301 html pages from back in april from our old site that have not been in the index for 2 months now right back at the top of the serps
997160 habib bellaid ist ein junger technisch sehr gut ausgebildeter und kopfballstarker abwehrspieler der gro es potenzial mitbringt nach dem ausfall von aleksandar vasoski sahen wir uns dazu veranlasst in der innenverteidigung personell nachzubessern
997161 si todos creemos que las vacas vuelan entonces las vacas vuelan
997162 por qu los milagros han cesado pueden creer esa coincidencia supongo que los religiosos estar n viendo un milagro en esta coincidencia jajaja
997163 seg n muchas religiones un milagro es una intervenci n de dios en el universo
997164 desde el hombre m s elevado en dignidad hasta el m s humilde y oscuro existe un deber igual para todos corregir y mejorar la propia persona as el perfeccionamiento de s mismo constituye la base de todo progreso y de todo desarrollo moral
997165 y el sistema de ndices era por ende dios que es quiza lo unico que no sucumbe ante su recursividad esa habilidad de ser infinito jeje
997166 existe un complejo pero dicen que buen sistema de ndices
997167 4 decir que un dios infinito tiene conciencia es absurdo ya que la conciencia es un atributo de seres finitos y por tanto no puede predicarse a un ser infinito al definirse a dios como un ser infinito la conciencia tambi n tendr a que ser infinita pero si extrapolamos la conciencia al infinito sta se distorsionar a o desaparecer a dejando de ser tal conciencia de la misma manera que si a una circunferencia le extendemos hasta el infinito su radio sta deja de ser circunferencia y se transforma en l nea recta o bien desaparece junto con su radio por otro lado toda conciencia se basa en el par sujeto objeto y es conciencia de algo externo husserl brentano que al limitar a la conciencia la hace finita pero si dios es infinito anegar a al objeto externo hasta hacerlo desaparecer con lo que destruir a el par de conceptos sujeto objeto en que se basa la conciencia y sta ya no ser a tal
997168 no discuto en lo m s m nimo que esa consciencia sea totalmente distinta ni siquiera comparable con la humana por lo que negarla por infinita y recurrente ser a limitarla a lo que la humanidad es cap z de concebir
997169 no existen pruebas feacientes para avalarlar dicha fe ya que es simplemente un sentimiento el amor es tambi n un sentimiento inexplicable pero existe y no sigue l gica alguna y no por eso merece ser despreciado
997170 a lo que yo iba es que dicha l gica es limitada y realmente creo que nadie esta en condiciones de afirmar que no existe otra l gica superior a la nuestra
997171 con tu l gica pensando que te da las herramientas para encarar cualquier cosa para negar por completo con argumentos f cticos la religi n
997172 c mo explicar as vos el hecho de que el universo sea o no sea infinito con tu l gica
997173 no estoy tratando de decirte dios existe por que ni vos ni yo ni nadie tiene la capacidad verdadera de decir que no existe
997174 pero s lo planteaba esta noci n de que considero limitado el negar algo por completo en asuntos con peso y con repercusi n no superman ni los pitufos obviamente
997175 los d as pasan en el medio de este oceano infinito
997176 quiz hay una forma de pensar que nosotros los humanos todav a no podemos entender del todo
997177 visita todos los loqueros del mundo y no creo que llegues a encontrar mas de 100 personas que crean que los pitufos realmente existen
997178 sal a la calle y de 100 personas fijate cu ntas son creyentes podr s decirme que son ignorantes insustanciales que no pueden probar lo que sienten no me importa es simplemente que existe alguna diferencia entre dios y superman
997179 nuevamente no me pidas pruebas por que foto con jesus no tengo fotos de las apariciones tampoco pero ni yo ni el resto de los creyentes en el mundo sentimos que tengamos que probar nada
997180 si la l gica que usas para razonar todo lo que razonas te puede explicar por ejemplo entre varias otras cosas que el universo sea o no sea infinito
997181 la imposibilidad de razonar algo alguna vez te llev a vos o a alguien a pensar en un unicornio la respuesta en un sano juicio es no

997196 la idea que se esconde tras este argumento es que dada la naturaleza de tales eventos cualquier comparaci n con algo menos importante que el genocidio la limpieza tnica las pruebas m dicas poco ticas o la extinci n es inv lida y considerada de muy poco gusto
997197 a medida que una discusi n argentina en internet se alarga la probabilidad de que aparezca una comparaci n en la que se mencione a la dictadura o genocidio de la d cada del 70 tiende a uno

997234 hoy puedo afirmar que por suerte no obtuvimos la victoria porque de haber sido as teniendo en cuenta nuestra formaci n y el grado de dependencia de cuba hubi ramos ahogado el continente en una barbarie generalizada una de nuestras consignas era hacer de la cordillera de los andes la sierra maestra de am rica latina donde primero hubi ramos fusilado a los militares despu s a los opositores y luego a los compa eros que se opusieran a nuestro autoritarismo y soy consciente de que yo hubiera actuado de esa forma
997235 en un proceso progresivo y constante silencioso al inicio y estrepitoso en los ltimos a os pero siempre impulsado por el odio el rencor y la venganza esas organizaciones han utilizado con pertinaz intensidad medios de prensa afines particularmente orientados hacia las generaciones m s j venes para lograr que hechos de enorme importancia se eclipsen de la historia no de la memoria colectiva pero s de la memoria p blica el resultado ha sido una malversaci n de nuestra historia reciente que no s lo echa un manto de silencio y distorsi n sobre parte de una poca en la que los terroristas instalaron una violencia nunca vista en nuestro pa s sino que ha logrado hasta ahora silenciar las voces de condena sobre sus aberrantes cr menes

997258 comunistas son los afiliados al partido comunista militantes activos y agitadores actuan en el partido legal y en la ilegalidad
997259 filocomunistas simpatizantes del comunismo no se conoce su filiacion no son militantes activos son propagadores que justamente no se pueden identificar exactamente como comunistas
997260 criptocomunistas ocultan su verdadera ideologia tras otra aparente actuan en sectores politicos sociales gremiales culturales cientificos deportivos etc son los mas peligrosos de todos pues son verdaderos agentes de propagacion pues tras la aparente finalidad llevan adelante su verdadera ideologia que es comunista
997261 al comenzar el siglo xxi el nucleo duro de las argumentaciones de la derecha academica politica y militar es la tesis de la violencia reactiva desde este punto de vista las fuerzas armadas habrian reaccionado frente a una agresion previa de la subversion esta version de los hechos une a personajes tan disimiles como el periodista argentino mariano grondona o el general chileno manuel contreras sin embargo en los cuatro paises analizados la adscripcion de los militares al principio de la guerra interna fue anterior a la existencia de guerrilleros o combatientes armados

997368 body temperatures can rise and very high temperatures may damage the brain and other vital organs conditions putting people at high risk for heat related illness include high humidity dehydration poor conditioning to heat poor health certain prescription drugs and alcohol use
997369 our state had the highest rate of heat related deaths of these farm workers among the 21 states reporting
997370 crop workers might be at increased risk for heat stroke because they often wear extra clothing and personal protective equipment to protect against pesticide poisoning or green tobacco illness
997371 we are now seeing wnv in western massachusetts so residents there need to protect themselves from mosquito bites by using clothing to cover up or applying bug spray
997372 once we find wnv is in the environment the trend is for us to find additional positive samples from the same area wnv will be with us for the remainder of the summer
997373 in nearly every population of adult surgical patients either medical or mechanical thromboprophylaxis reduces venous thromboembolism by approximately 70 if one assumes similar efficacy in pregnant women 5 of the 7 deaths from pulmonary embolism in women undergoing cesarean delivery would have been prevented if a policy of universal use of medical or mechanical thromboprophylaxis for patients undergoing cesarean had been in place such a policy would reduce the mortality rate attributed causally to cesarean delivery to 0 9 100 000 or approximately 9 us deaths annually eliminating the statistical difference in deaths attributed to cesarean vs vaginal birth
997374 it seems clear that the majority of maternal deaths in the united states are not preventable the most common preventable errors in preeclampsia management leading to maternal death involved inattention to blood pressure control and signs or symptoms of pulmonary edema those involving postpartum hemorrhage deaths were related to inadequate surgical hemostasis in all these cases more prompt attention to clinical signs of hemorrhage and associated hypovolemia would also have prevented death
997375 it now seems to me that even striving for expression in a work of art is harmful to art art is an archprinciple as sublime as the godhead as inexplicable as life undefinable and without purpose the work of art is created by an artistic evaluation of its elements i know only how i do it i know only my material from which i derive to what end i know not
997376 painting relates to both art and life neither can be made i try and act in that gap between the two i am trying to check my habits of seeing to counter them for the sake of greater freshness i am trying to be unfamiliar with what im doing if you do not change your mind about something when you confront a picture you have not seen before you are either a stubborn fool or the painting is not very good

997385 this study will expand on two successful animal studies of rabicide i performed previously by the government of vietnam
997386 in those prior studies we achieved a 25 to 30 survival rate in animals that had already developed rabies we believe this strong survival rate is a historical first achievement for any post infection rabies treatment
997387 collaborating with cdc in designing and conducting these studies is an important step forward
997388 if the current studies are successful we anticipate that this will be instrumental in helping our anti rabies nanoviricide towards drug approval and widespread use across the world

997414 linserimento della bpco nella lista delle malattie croniche conclude mariadelaide franchi rappresenta una misura di migliore tutela del paziente ma per noi soprattutto il mezzo per ottenere il riconoscimento del suo impatto economico e sociale che il punto di partenza per una migliore prevenzione e una pi adeguata gestione di una patologia in crescita con allarmanti tassi di prevalenza e di mortalit

997423 laws restricting and governing abortion are worthless if they cannot be enforced
997424 and up until today they have not been enforced planned parenthood wants to keep it that way so the message being sent by this case as a whole is if you try to enforce these laws if you even try to talk about enforcing these laws we will bury you this overriding message has seeped into our body politic and threatens to corrupt some of our most basic and cherished principles such as freedom of speech and political debate the rule of law and the principle of equality before the law

997467 coming up with the venue was what made the whole thing work
997468 adrian cox had the idea i said yes we should do it jenni scott knew loads of comics people and damian cugley could do all the publicity and stuff
997469 we did it in winter early 1992 just before the start of term it was cold rained and people invaded from some other event which was to be a characteristic of pretty much every year we spent at the union
997470 a random selection of tables we had to pull around to make up tables and lights barely bright enough to see the panellists
997471 that first year we got 100 people to our surprise
997472 the finances hung together at that scale and we increased steadily to the 160 ish its on today the bar was a reasonable size and the garden lovely there was lots of space to sit and once we got caption in the summer we had fabulous weather every year except the year jenni was away
997473 i might be adding a historically rosy tint in remembering the caption committees of the past but looking back on the initial years i seem to remember us working together in a great synergy
997474 ideas unfolding as we sat together turning into something fantastic that no one individual could have come up with
997475 this actually is something i have a better perspective on now that ive been both a punter and an organizer
997476 when i was first involved with organizing caption i was never sure whether it was really something to be properly proud of i mean yeah we did it for quite a long time which was impressive in itself and people who came enjoyed it and said good things and came again and again but you could literally run a convention in a pub and if you told the right people you would get people coming again and over again like having a fun party it was enjoyable and worth doing but not necessarily earth shattering or notable
997477 we couldnt face the work of it and wasnt sure it was what we wanted to do but wasnt it sort of what we ought to try to do or something
997478 theres a bunch of stuff that have led me away from that thinking
997479 i think our themes and panel workshop ideas with the focus on inclusivity and creativity set us aside from other conventions in a good way
997480 i dont suppose people are going to come away from the programme items with their views revolutionised but at worst they will have been fun and at best truly thought provoking
997481 im not so sure about its influence on other events
997482 well follow the usual pattern of deciding on the theme for next year once weve recovered from the stresses of putting this years on captions relaxed yet doggedly small press attitude gives it a uniqueness compared to other cons so i dont see any need to change it if it aint broke
997483 i think its a very interesting time for small press comics right now the camden london underground market stall is a significant development not just because its a new event but because its people selling their stuff to the general public the comics scene has been too insular for too long its nice to see people getting their stuff out there for people to see
997484 a lot of you have asked how i started making money i started writing articles at shitty rates like 0 004 word off job websites later on i moved to things like forum posting and as i got more experienced i started website flipping

997617 the supporters have been fantastic with their involvement and generosity and it is thanks to them that treehouse can enjoy brand new sports facilities within their new home on behalf of arsenal i wish the children staff and parents of treehouse all the best in their new building
997618 when ars ne came to treehouse and announced the 250 000 target we felt so excited but daunted by the task ahead as this was the most ambitious target that arsenal had ever set to not only reach this target but to double it is phenomenal
997619 it is testament to the staff at arsenal who have been an absolute pleasure to work with but also to the generosity of the team manager directors and thousands of supporters who got behind be a gooner be a giver the 500 000 raised will make a monumental difference for treehouse as weve for the first time been able to secure a permanent building from which we can now reach thousands of children with autism and their families we cant thank the wonderful arsenal enough
997620 im so proud that arsenal has been able to raise this amount of money for treehouse its been a pleasure to see the partnership from beginning to end being so closely involved and seeing first hand the wonderful work the charity does for autism education it was great to be part of the presentation today and i wish the charity good luck for the opening of its new school
997621 there have been times during this partnership when we have had to pinch ourselves i never thought i would see my son danny who is a pupil at treehouse up on the big screens at emirates stadium i certainly never thought i would get used to seeing him up there treehouse has changed the lives of all of the children lucky enough to attend the school this year arsenal has been a huge part of that

997736 all i had was this baby amp the doctor dismisses the life of this child almost like it doesnt matter what people want to hear are assurances that they didnt do anything wrong that the doctors will try their best to find out however remote the possibility of how or why it may have happened i didnt get that i have a thyroid condition amp immediately i thought this was why all i wanted was some reasoning behind my loss i went on to have another amp another amp each time i was given the regimented speech no one wanted to listen to me what doctors forget to understand is that women know each amp every change in their bodies they know when something isnt right the patient needs to be involved they can often give vital information that could change the route that a doctor can take this is why is it important for patients to understand what is happening to them the person not the patient should be treated in this situation

997756 shes getting there day by day when i gave it to her she asked me why i didnt keep it i had six miscarriages before i had her
997757 i ended up reading your book before i gave it to my daughter actually after reading it i ordered another because i found it so helpful even after all these years
997758 you really didnt talk too much about it and there wasnt the internet for support sites like yours so i just went on and held so much in when my daughter finally arrived i felt like id been given the biggest miracle on earth and thanked god every day for her i still do
997759 i found myself in awe of her watching her learn grown discover there wasnt anything i wanted to miss i was lucky because i was able to stay home and raise her while my husband worked you might think that sounds old fashioned but its what i wanted
997760 i found myself thinking more and more of the babies i lost to miscarriage how much would they be like my daughter or would they be completely different would they look alike and have reddish brown hair like sarah or would they be more like their father and have very dark hair and eyes would they be boys or girls the more my daughter grew the more i realized my babies were real live human beings just like my daughter i never got to see them or grieve for them i did it in my own way but so much of it stayed inside

997763 yes yes it is and so very true although i felt the loss of each of my babies they found the right time to tell me theyd always be near and would always exist

997815 i know what it is you wrote a book on miscarriage i found it online and originally got it for my daughter who just suffered through one
997816 shes getting there day by day when i gave it to her she asked me why i didnt keep it i had six miscarriages before i had her
997817 i ended up reading your book before i gave it to my daughter actually after reading it i ordered another because i found it so helpful even after all these years
997818 you really didnt talk too much about it and there wasnt the internet for support sites like yours so i just went on and held so much in when my daughter finally arrived i felt like id been given the biggest miracle on earth and thanked god every day for her i still do
997819 i found myself in awe of her watching her learn grown discover there wasnt anything i wanted to miss i was lucky because i was able to stay home and raise her while my husband worked you might think that sounds old fashioned but its what i wanted
997820 i found myself thinking more and more of the babies i lost to miscarriage how much would they be like my daughter or would they be completely different would they look alike and have reddish brown hair like sarah or would they be more like their father and have very dark hair and eyes would they be boys or girls the more my daughter grew the more i realized my babies were real live human beings just like my daughter i never got to see them or grieve for them i did it in my own way but so much of it stayed inside
997821 how did you manage to get through six miscarriages howd you keep yourself together until your daughter was born
997822 i spent a lot of time cleaning the house and crying i didnt do much with my girlfriends and i didnt want to worry my husband any more than he already was after my daughter sarah was born id say about three years the chime of the grandfather clock in the hall caught my attention something about it sounded different i dont know why and it may sound crazy sarah was down for a nap and the clock chimed one i thought about the first baby i lost and felt a connection to my baby when the clock chimed it actually made me smile it was as if my baby was telling me that he or she was okay the same feeling happened on each hour from one to six by the time the old clock chimed six times i felt like all my babies were around me singing and telling me they loved me they were all happy in heaven and i was still their mother no matter what ever since then i take great joy in the chimes of my clock every day on the hour for six hours when im away from the house i always look at my watch and know the clock is chiming i think of my babies and send them my love
997823 yes yes it is and so very true although i felt the loss of each of my babies they found the right time to tell me theyd always be near and would always exist
997824 no im not but thank you for the compliment we all find ways to get through the dark times and when we cant find the way ive learned its usually presented to us all in due time

997930 following the successful adoption of email security in the cloud we are seeing increased interest from large and small organizations to leverage saas security to protect their http https channel

997978 my modelling stints really influenced me to try more exposures magandang preparation din ito for something more exciting like joining a beauty contest perhaps lets see
997979 but i wont go through scalpels just for the intention of joining a beauty contest kasi it defeats the purpose na para bang sa parteng yun lang ako lalaban
997980 but you know iniisip ko rin magpa augment ng boobs sa modeling hindi naman ito big deal most models dont have overwhelming breasts but if its going to make me feel and look better why not nasa akin naman yun e
997981 yeah im considering it too im also an actress remember again kung gagawin ko man yan i wont hide it sasabihin ko talaga sa press na nagpagawa ako ng boobs o nagparetoke ako ng ilong whats the point of hiding it kung tatanungin ako kung totoong nagparetoke ako kung totoo naman ano ang masama doon para i deny ko pa
997982 hindi naman kasali roon yung pagpapa augment ng breasts pero marami rin kasi ang nag e encourage sa akin kaya minsan pinag iisipan ko pero sa ngayon dahil marami akong ginagawa hindi masyadong pumapasok sa utak ko
997983 sabi ko nga kahit na sino pa yan even rufa mae if they want to do it why not kung gusto rin nilang i deny thats their life yung sa akin ay yung paniniwala ko lang na kung nagparetoke man ako bakit ko itatago
997984 i would rather comment sa working relationship namin ni p chi palayaw ni rufa mae napakasarap niyang kasama lalo na sa cruise noong mag shoot kami napakatotoo niya kung ano yung nararamdaman niya yun ang sinasabi niya and shes always funny
997985 i like her a lot nagkakasundo kami sa maraming bagay kaya shes the type na puwede ring masabihan ng problema na alam mong hindi basta ikakalat kung ano yung para lang sa magkakaibigan she will definitely keep it
997986 ewan ko nagki click naman kami as friends masaya kami palagi pag magkasama hindi rin siya pumoporma sa akin wala lang mahina ang radar ko pagdating sa ganyan id rather work and have fun kaysa isipin kung manliligaw ba sa akin ang isang lalaki kaya siguro i dont have a problem with that
997987 sc heduled to begin in two years for the pennsylvania turnpike and lawmakers in florida are requiring the turnpike agency there to go the same course new yorks metropolitan transportation authority is also considering moving to a similar plan the delaware river port authority which is currently taking flak over its proposal to hike bridge tolls between philadelphia and new jersey from 3 to 4 in september and to 5 in 2010 wants to move to automatic toll hikes every other year based on inflation starting in 2013 the increase would be rounded to the nearest quarter
997988 if smaller incremental toll increases are what the public wants it is a lot more likely to happen if you make them automatic than if you try to get a board to vote on them every year or every other year
997989 noted that under the plan the drpa could decide that an increase is not needed when it is due

998133 while work is progressing to control the release of water there is a potential risk of failure and the sudden release of the water stored behind the dam

998135 there is therefore a risk of flooding and erosion of the channel
998136 since they dont have any new ideas the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
998137 absolutely because in june a month before he said and did i mention that theyre going to say hes black john mccain doesnt have a racist bone in his body and theres no doubt in my mind that what senator obama is trying to suggest that hes a victim of something
998138 and you also suggest hes going to say the way hes going to get elected is to talk about your name the way you look and john mccain doesnt want to get elected on that so the idea hes not interjecting race quite frankly is not credible we went through this in south carolina john has an adopted daughter from bangladesh on the right they said john mccain had an illegitimate black daughter now without john doing one thing theyre suggesting that obama is a victim of john mccain interjecting he looks funny and sounds funny were not going to put up with this to say that thats not trying to interject the idea that youre a victim of john mccain trying to make fun of your name and your racial background is a lie
998139 so thats what he was saying just that hes younger
998140 no no no he has never said that he believes that john mccain is a racist hes never said anything that he was using race in this effort you cant quote him you cant find him saying that what he is saying is that he is a different kind of candidate and where the mccain campaign couldnt get any traction on the issues they go after him personally they go after him as a person who really doesnt fit the political mold
998141 no what he was saying is theyre trying to scare you theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that they are engaged in character assassination even john mccains partner in a number of initiatives in the senate russ feingold said yesterday theyve decided they cant win on the issues so now theyre going to try to destroy his character and that is exactly what this ad is calculated to do
998142 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president when you use the expressions that senator obama did three times this week youre making a personal insult to john mccain i know john mccain ive been with him for 20 years private and public this man does not have a bigoted bone in his body his wife and he adopted a baby from bangladesh who they love its just wrong for senator obama to have done that it was right for the campaign to call him on it
998143 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
998144 given the tenure of the mccain camps attacks on senator obama i can understand senator obama saying that senator obama wants to run as much as he can from a campaign thats focused only on race
998145 john mccain has worked over time to keep race out of this campaign and to keep the focus on issues this is not the first time that the race card has been played by the obama campaign bill clinton even said that the race card was played on him in south carolina and now the mccain campaign is saying look you introduced the whole notion of race
998146 what he basically said as i understand it and i think this is right is that theres a lot in there that he thinks could be constructive and if it means doing something that he has a lot of reservations about in order to accomplish something much larger thats constructive then thats the way a legislative process should work in a democracy thats how he would act as a president which is to move forward and to work with the people who disagree with him to find measures that he thinks makes sense
998147 what senator obama said is what we want a president to say lets look at all of the options lets compare them
998148 barack obama has always been in favor of offshore drilling but what he said is lets use first the 68 million acres that are already out there there is absolutely no reason why we cant begin where weve already got an opportunity
998149 its typical you know every once in a while we see him playing basketball
998150 i hope that senator obama will change his mind about offshore drilling but this issue of whether or not hes a leader this is a good test were out of session were out of business on energy when we should be in session doing the american peoples business pick up the phone and tell nancy pelosi who says offshore drilling is a hoax harry reid who says drilling is a red herring call the congress back in session hes the leader of the party youre a great guy you know all these people lets get the congress back in session
998151 you know there really isnt a significant shift whats happened here is that a bipartisan group of senators has come together with a comprehensive paid for plan on energy and this plan includes some additional offshore oil drilling what senator obama has said is he welcomes the plan he welcomes working with the senators he welcomes their energy summit in september so this is a great opportunity for working together with a bipartisan group
998152 senator obama is only in this position now because it became patently obvious over the last weeks particularly when nancy pelosi turned off the lights in the house of representatives and republican members refused to leave she had an insurrection in her own party because pelosi and reid at obamas behest were refusing to move forward on drilling so he is now trying to get credit for being all of the above energy planner
998153 he still believes we should not drill offshore what hes prepared to do is break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels and an energy policy thats comprehensive i think what you see in the response on this drilling is really the difference in how they might govern
998154 i predict to you hell find reasons not to be for it if this comes to a vote in the senate
998155 because the misrepresentation has been made that this is going to reduce the price at the pump this is again a decoy its not a solution
998156 you never say never to anything people have their parliamentary options available to them
998157 ive enjoyed working with senator mccain as he serves in the united states senate and i look forward to continuing to do that
998158 he says when hes president he can work with you the way that ronald reagan worked with tip oneill
998159 well i look forward to working with barack obama but stand ready to work with any president of the united states
998160 im worried that this approach is not worthy of the office of president that senator mccain and senator obama are running for for senator mccain to demean the race for the presidency in this way is i think not humorous i think its silly
998161 i support anyone that senator obama is comfortable with for vice president i didnt want to see a discussion of candidates for vice president without showing the house of representatives chet edwards for years our colleagues have said to him why dont you run for president he is an extraordinarily talented person he is a champion for veterans in the congress under his leadership we have passed including just on friday the biggest increase in funding for veterans health benefits and other benefits in the history of our country hes a master of needs of our military and their families he understands the issues of nonproliferation he has been a champion in the appropriations committee and the congress hes from south texas he represents president bush in the congress
998162 well i would certainly hope so but you know what senator dodd senator biden senator hillary clinton theres such a great array of people from whom senator obama can choose so any one of them im fine with i just wanted people to be aware of the extraordinary credentials of chet edwards and i hope he will be the nominee
998163 they have not and im always honored to be mentioned im proud to be campaigning for this incredibly bright man who is going the change course in this country but i think that all the speculation is going to come to an end soon because at least were going to get choices before too long
998164 i dont honestly know i talked to barack about it this weekend you know what he did he just smiled
998165 im supporting senator mccaskill on the democrats side after her feisty performance today i think shed be great for senator obama
998166 no i think the whole vp thing is a little bit overrated its important but maybe the media is giving it a little bit more importance than it deserves the key is whos at the top of the ticket
998167 youre pro choice and mccain says because of that even though he likes you a lot it would be difficult to name you as vice president take us inside the room if senator mccain says you know this is the difficulty i have otherwise i want you what do you say to him
998168 well john and i have been friends for 25 years and i know this issue is very important to john its obviously very important to probably the majority of the men and women in the republican party and i dont think john would ever make it a litmus test but when it comes down to a nominee selecting a vice presidential running mate it is their decision exclusively and i would respect their decision one way or the other
998169 john is not judgmental on the issue he feels very strongly about it will always feel strongly about it as the majority of the party but i have had that point of view before i got into politics i had it when i was in politics and i preserve that point of view now so inside the room i listen to my friend and be quite comfortable with any decision he made because he would make it for the right reason
998170 ill have that private conversation with my friend john and then perhaps report back to you
998171 the fact is he is black and he is injecting race its a way to make people more comfortable its the elephant in the room perhaps he misspoke a little bit but i dont think he accused john mccain of being a racist or running a racist campaign clearly he has sought to inject race in a healthy way and hes done it time and time again
998172 if you can define him as the black guy in the race its to his detriment i think obama is fearful of this but the way that he put it in mccains mouth i think it was a huge mistake by barack obama because barack obama doesnt want to bring up race in that way he wants to be the unifier he doesnt want to remind them that hes the black guy in the race so he did play the race card mccain responded and i think responded fairly
998173 theres a lot of danger in this for barack obama it cuts both ways but most of the negatives go to him its all about his response he has to have sort of a light touch on this if he comes off looking angry then that could be to the benefit of other candidates it sort of happened in tennessee with harold ford another telegenic african american candidate who found himself in the position of taking in these racial charges and responding in a slightly angry way the voters didnt like that and it turned out to be a big problem for him he lost
998174 doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
998175 i think that was an off the cuff remark i think he was but i dont think he meant to do it and i dont think it would be helpful for him to do it the american people dont like being called racist i think they consider race a tough and sacred issue which they want touched in an intelligent way they do not want it touched in the heat of a political campaign in my view whoever raises the race issue is going to hurt themselves
998176 this week expect that well see some face to faces between obama and some of these prospective candidates joe biden and evan bayh apparently will have some face time at some point this week hell be out in indiana and so were trying to figure out where joe biden is going to be meeting him
998177 ich kann euch ziemlich sicher garantieren dass es bei einem misserfolg von bioshock niemals wieder ein solches spiel gegeben h tte
998178 ich wei nicht mal wie wir die leute davon berzeugt haben f r bioshock zu bezahlen diese spiele haben noch nie geld eingebracht jeder publisher sagte uns bei der vorstellung von bioshock dass sich die idee gro artig anh re und wir 150 000 st ck verkaufen w rden der n chste
998179 ehrlich gesagt wollten wir tief im inneren diese art von gameplay popularisieren an der wir so lange hingen
998180 wenn die erste iteration davon nur ein kleines bisschen einfacher war als system shock 2 seht es mal so was glaubt ihr wie viele spiele dieses typs nun im vergleich zu vorher entwickelt werden wie lange dauerte es bis wir gr nes licht f r diesen titel bekamen
998181 jetzt zuk nftige spiele spiele der konkurrenten unsere spiele wir k nnen darauf aufbauen dass millionen von leuten kenntnis von diesem genre haben wie oft wurde diese art von titeln zuvor gespielt 300 000 oder 400 000 mal vielleicht jetzt haben wegen dieses spiels millionen leute dieses genre erlebt
998182 geht zur ck spielt dune 2 und schaut sie euch dann an sie haben warteschlangen gebaut all die komplexit t die man in spielen wie company of heroes hat mit deckung und solchen sachen es liegt an der popularisierung eines systems und die leute waren bereit darin zu investieren sie waren voller zuversicht dass es eine zielgruppe geben w rde
998183 i am told and i am satisfied that the failure of the eprs on this flight did not render the aircraft unsafe and did not in any way endanger the public who were flying on that aircraft
998184 in the event that flight continued for some hours perfectly safely from jfk to liverpool without any incident or difficulty it rather placed extra burdens and pressures on the pilot and co pilot to calculate manually the performance of the engines
998185 they were stretched more than ideally than they could have been in flying the plane safely and fly safely they did
998186 but by a most unfortunate error the flight operations director optimistically interpreted the requirement setting out one of the two systems monitoring each engine should be present rather than in fact the fairly clear requirement in the operators manual for the 757 that there has to be one epr operating for one of these engines
998187 that flight operations director reported to the new pilot who was taking the plane over that the aircraft complied with the air worthiness certificate and could be accepted for the flight
998188 it appears he had no hesitation in perfectly properly finding that the aircraft could depart safely
998189 i accept this was a technical breach and therefore only a breach of civil aviation authority requirements but it was an important breach nonetheless
998190 indeed as soon as the company appreciated the breaches had taken place it took immediate and robust steps to rectify the position and assure the public of its commitment to safety which hitherto had been exemplary
998191 it replaced the director of engineering it replaced the director of flight operations i am satisfied it has shown every sign of unreserved acceptance of its mistake through its employees and to keep its operations beyond reproach
998192 acknowledges the public must see aircraft operators and perhaps those specifically that carry passengers are free from contravening regulations and breaking the law
998193 it will help to do so if the public can see the air operator has learned its lesson and will be extra careful not to break the law again i am perfectly satisfied that is the case
998194 clearly we are pleased with the outcome and empathetic that the judge saw it in the manner that we always believed it to be
998195 there had been thunder lightning and heavy rain and it is thought lightning struck the aircraft
998196 effectively meant the aircraft was left in the position it arrived in
998197 increased the crews workload and potentially increased any error but there is no suggestion that these risks were realised on this flight it was an increased theoretical risk
998198 it is perhaps most important to stress this is not put as a safety issue
998199 there was at no stage any danger to the flying public or anyone else for that matter
998200 the fact that the certificate of airworthiness was invalidated does not equate to the aircraft being unworthy in respect of it not being safe
998201 this was not a case of simply turning a blind eye and carrying on regardless
998202 there was no commercial pressure on the airline to fly this flight in fact there was no advantage to the airline in flying this flight there were only 20 passengers in fact the flight would have been uneconomic
998203 put robust systems in place to ensure a failing of this nature does not happen again
998204 saddled with the label of being the first major airline in the uk to be prosecuted in the last 10 years

998223 i am very happy to be at the club it is a very good thing for me
998224 the manager told me he was happy with me against doncaster and i was happy to sign for newcastle
998225 he said he wanted to put me in the team in the future but he also said if i am ready to play now i will play the best players will play
998226 everybody has helped me settle in and feel good at newcastle

998230 i thought he looked sharp he made some really nice tackles where he didnt just take the ball but controlled it and played it out oh and he was quick i am willing to bet that he gets paired next to coloccini at some point in the not too distant future especially as taylor was responsible for the goal

998240 this is our inspiration to see that those who suffer now and in the future get a chance at survival
998241 we believe the phenomenal growth in the team sarcoma initiative in the last few years is indicative of the pent up need for individuals and families who have been affected by this disease to interact with each other and their doctors and nurses in a setting other than the traditional hospital setting
998242 we hear stories of amazing resiliency in the face of adversity of incredible courage when faced with treatments that are not stopping the growth of tumors of people who truly inspire us with the way they carry on with their lives in spite of the aftermath of numerous surgeries and extensive treatments these stories tug at your heart when you hear them you know that you must do something to make more people aware of this rare cancer and to support research to find a cure for it
998243 battles fought on the soccer field carried a special meaning that night
998244 my initial hopes were a handful of ryans friends participating in the
998245 i am so delighted with this amount as i never thought in my wildest dreams that this little letter writing campaign would generate such a tremendous response im receiving so many notes from people thanking me for helping to bring sarcoma awareness to the people of this state
998246 this is a remarkable coming together of institutions focused on a common goal to contribute to global knowledge of the sarcoma problem with an ultimate mission to eradicate this disease the team sarcoma events provide an opportunity to collaborate more effectively with other institutions working on the same problem by highlighting the need for teamwork
998247 especially important is the fact that this is the patients initiative and the number of participants is increasing it means that this problem is recognized by more people and it provides the chance for improvement of sarcoma treatment
998248 the most moving aspect of the knit a thon was the response i got from total strangers we advertised our event in the local newspaper and had several participants whom wed never met before this event has the potential to grow so much in fact ive already started planning for next year
998249 pointed out that the us food amp drug administration fda had attempted to do this several years ago its something that has been mooted in the european union too but in the us at least all that happened is that products now have a warning such as
998250 its not like herbal is all that different from our own basic medicine take for example willow bark sold as a herbal treatment and advertised with various uses by the chinese by several companies and others since the ancient greeks and how do you get it home right you get a bottle filled with pills i wouldnt be surprised if it was even produced in the same pharmaceutical factory as where regular aspirin comes rolling down the line just got a price tag twice as high slammed on it
998251 thats not to say i dont support the notion of thorough research safety monitoring and accountability but to compare the vast majority of herbals to pharmaceutical preparations is misguided and excessive
998252 i vote stricter regulations but ones that are separate from current pharma protocol guidelines
998253 the vast majority of herbal preparations arent viewed to treat disease in the way that pharmaceuticals are presented nor are they presented as cure alls she says
998254 but perhaps a sensible step is part way i e strong warnings on possible side effects and a cautionary there is no clinical trial which demonstrates absolute efficacy
998255 its natural i believe in it it does me good
998256 feeling good is pretty much proven to make people healthier and certainly happier
998257 by going to this quasi interim step it may even encourage manufacturers to undertake proper clinical trials to demonstrate effectiveness and therefore encourage greater use
998258 the problem is that if the more popular herbal remedies were indeed 100 effective the drug component would have been isolated and purified by now
998259 in modern natural product drug discovery activity guided fractionation often using an isolated receptor identifies an active molecule and a single molecular entity results from semisynthetic improvement of the phytochemicals drug properties the drug regulatory process includes guidelines for determining safety efficacy and quality as well as for setting acceptance criteria for each
998260 to pass through the current drug regulatory process a product specification including identification of the specific active components and their requisite levels along with identification and limits for the unsafe impurities is needed
998261 this is an extraordinarily difficult undertaking and if required would prevent herbal products from reaching approval
998262 this combined with the fact that some herbals really do work is the principal reason for a different different set of regulations
998263 i believe public health is not served by increased regulation in fact i believe we will benefit from the application of well understood scientific and medical criteria for the reduction of regulation the benefit of this approach to the public is the timely availability of lower cost drugs i believe this can be accomplished with no effect on safety
998264 many herbal remedies are known to have efficacy even in a crude extract
998265 traditional over the counter pharmaceuticals contain a single active component natural remedies usually contain several compounds of known efficacy green tea for instance contains high concentrations of around a dozen different catechin antioxidants the traditional pharmaceutical otc preparation must be held to a higher standard of regulation because of the higher purity and potential potency of the active ingredient
998266 i feel the fda over regulates and does not take into consideration scientific findings that provide a basis for reduced regulation
998267 i provide one example synthetic statins have moderate to severe side effects in 5 of patients cholesterol can be equally reduced by the intake of policosanol one recent study found no efficacy however dosage levels may not have been appropriate a group of long chain alcohols from beeswax side effects of policosanol were mild no worse than placebo
998268 consumers need to be educated on the difference between otc herbal remedies and pharmaceutical products
998269 not all natural products are safe the reason why otc have fewer listed side effects as compared to pharmaceutical is because otc products are not as thoroughly evaluated often the long list of side effects in pharmaceutical drugs frightens the consumer and the cursory listing of side effects gives consumer the false perception of safety
998270 this is an area where regulation should be tightened as many manufacturers of otc products do try to push the limits by making specific efficacy claims in non print advertisements and often they do get away with it
998271 i suggested that it would make sense from a safety perspective to bring herbal remedies under the same regulatory umbrella as regular pharmaceutical products
998272 a medical report in 1998 estimated that adverse reactions to prescription drugs are killing about 106 000 americans each year roughly three times as many as are killed by automobiles

998282 chromium was not included in the extracts that used in our published clinical studies or the efficacy tests
998283 the ingredients used in the final glucocil formula have records of many years safe human usage
998284 glucocil was not developed overnight we had thousands of tests and have plenty scientific evidence to support the product
998285 remember that the bioavailability of the picolinate derivative and its action on the beta cells is what will determine if there is a positive effect on insulin insulin sensitizer drugs i believe in some of the clinical trials are being used with the chromium compounds to see the possibility of synergy
998286 this product is being marketed as a dietary supplement not a food or drug and is designed to assist those who are trying to manage their condition primarily through changes in lifestyle primarily diet and exercise
998287 generally speaking those who are most interested in this product are those who are newly diagnosed and are not on multiple meds as is the case with those who are more seriously ill
998288 the typical glucocil consumer is someone who is looking for more natural nutritional support
998289 but maybe its time physiologically active herbal remedies were brought under the pharma umbrella maybe its time physiologically active herbal remedies were brought under the pharma umbrella rather than being sold disguised as food supplements
998290 our standard american diet sad lacks many necessary fundamental nutrients

998403 so denny youre telling me you had control of the house the senate and the presidency and you couldnt get anything done
998404 i think its unethical to stand in the way of creating jobs and putting people back to work
998405 you voted for him illinois now your stuck with it
998406 he just has this confidence that i dont know where it comes from or how he maintains it goes beyond confidence just outright knowledge that he can make a difference
998407 i dont believe i would be a normal average individual legislator
998408 i have a history of making some things happen where people said it was impossible
998409 maybe a lesser person wouldve stopped but i think his inner desire is so strong that he continues to move forward
998410 every human being has their breaking point and i dont know where that would be for my dad

998412 there was a guy about 130 or 150 years ago who had several losses before he won
998413 i cant quite remember his name but he went on to become the president of the united states his first name was abraham what was his last name again
998414 i am happy about it because i have something that others dont have
998415 i never had a problem with it and after i get publicity i will be famous because of it
998416 people who have seen this installation in jerusalem and the west bank tell me it has been quite cathartic for them but it has been a totally cathartic experience for me too
998417 i have become a collector of tears so many people wept as they recalled what happened it was genuinely shocking and many people who came to the first showing at al hoash gallery in east jerusalem also broke down in tears for them it represents a gaping wound that has not yet healed
998418 my research is about capturing the emotions of these people
998419 any reference to the nakbah or catastrophe means facing the facts about the events now termed ethnic cleansing that forced 750 000 palestinians into permanent exile
998420 i approach this as an artist from a purely humanitarian and spiritual aspect although there are others who want to see any concern or compassion for these people who we should understand are victims of 1948 as taking some sort of political stance i reject that totally
998421 return of the soul is not political but it is about seeing from a very human perspective that the palestinians have suffered and have been wronged and this tragedy unfolded largely due to decisions we made here in britain

998463 what could make it wash up on shore like that
998464 the act of shopping in order to relax or to make yourself feel better or happier
998465 ive spent 40 000 on shoes and i have no place to live
998466 so how does one enjoy retail therapy when times are tight
998467 whoever said money cant buy happiness simply didnt know where to go shopping
998468 its a completely different story line and a completely different fan base
998469 but what it does have in common is that its all based on word of mouth
998470 in my humble opinion i am none of those things
998471 the victim goes to bed and sleeps in good health about two oclock in the morning he is awakened by a severe pain in the great toe more rarely in the heel ankle or instep the pain which was at first moderate becomes more intense now it is a violent stretching and tearing of the ligament now it is a gnawing pain and now a pressure and tightening so exquisite and lively meanwhile is the feeling of the part affected that it cannot bear the weight of bedclothes nor the jar of a person walking in the room
998472 25 for re gassing when you spend 50 or more or 40 re gassing and de bugging no minimum spend applies
998473 ah yes madam but you see thats a special offer if you spend 50 or more
998474 im a ditsy blonde who doesnt quite understand that 1 1 2
998475 so its 45 to have the air conditioning re gassed but 40 to have it re gassed and de bugged
998476 garlasco il corpo di chiara sarebbe stato spostato da due persone
998477 what i do wish is that they would be more forthcoming more open at least those of us who were directly affected provided a little bit better information so we have some understanding of these circumstances
998478 i havent had a briefing from the fbi or anybody else for now over five years i assume that others who were involved have had a similar set of circumstances
998479 this has been a very tough ordeal for people that have been affected and it would be nice to say that at long last after all these many many years we have finally brought this to closure
998480 after the experiences the fits and starts of the investigation over the course of the last several years thats harder to do now but it would be nice to be able to do that at some point in the near future
998481 i mean you cant go through an airport and not be familiar with the extraordinary practices now employed
998482 i dont think weve probably accomplished all that we set out to accomplish i dont think were there yet weve got a long way to go but certainly weve taken a lot more precautions and were doing things differently in mailrooms and in airports all over the country
998483 didier will not play in our first game and will probably miss the second against wigan
998484 if there are no more problems he should be ready for the game after that tottenham on aug 31
998485 when you have a knee injury you just never know
998486 i have been getting a progress report from the doctor every day
998487 hes getting better and is working with a fitness coach back at the training ground
998488 i hope he will be ready to start training next week but he will not play until he is in good condition
998489 ive always felt pawtucket is in my opinion the best hitting team in the league
998490 he went out and did what we needed him to do obviously and what he probably needed to do himself it was a quality start
998491 they sent him down to work on some things and hes been working with chavy pitching coach rafael chaves
998492 early in the year when he was with new york i didnt have my changeup now its just ironing some things out mechanically and going after hitters a little more
998493 mechanics wise chavy and i have worked on a lot of little things in my last four starts im really seeing it a lot
998494 it actually was kind of good i got to clear my head a little bit andy pettitte always says get your mind right i got my mind right and focused on the right things and its working out so far
998495 its a matter of getting ahead of guys and attacking hitters and staying with your plan otherwise when you start throwing balls then your plan changes

998511 bottom line if you wait to buy a house you can afford today and mortgage rates go up which is a significant possibility you will end up paying a lot more for the same house

998513 at gemini we strongly believe that abnormal returns from venture capital can only come from large companies even very large companies both xjet and modu fall exactly in that category we try to back great entrepreneurs that are going after unique market opportunities
998514 israeli companies are dominating this space with companies like amobee pudding and others we have backed an israeli company called massive impact that is offering mobile advertising solutions in asia massive provides a great example for a company that identifies global opportunities beyond the us
998515 i am confident that israel can and will produce great companies in the next five to ten years
998516 absolutely just give me the chance i would love to be daredevil
998517 our goals are more of the same the idea that he said hes iron man in part 1 its one thing to say it and its another thing to actually evolve to the point where you can live in a heroic fashion you know they say the superhero movie always needs to follow and i said who is that guy get him out of here we want to do what worked for us last time in a way that evolves were talking about a guy who is put in an extraordinary circumstance and the people that are around him and how that creates a sense of family and how that disrupts whatever forces that we have to say that are working in his life i like the idea of an iron man 2 that youre able to understand various points of view youre able to touch on some subjects that are a lot more far reaching while still grounding it in entertainment
998518 someone told me the other day ive done it seven times now
998519 and its hard every single time cause its an awesome responsibility the first time you do it that was a three month process finding kevin conroy the first time this one was a little bit easier again i know the character better certainly and they gave me a better idea up front of what they were gonna do with this and how it was gonna be more comic a lighter twist on the batman which is nice because if you keep repeating yourself you dont grow as an artist or a person or whatever so i felt like great lets do something different and frankly when they told me what it needed to be i thought that i still needed someone with that bass in their voice i still need someone that has got that strength to scare criminals but i need someone whos got those comic overtones as well and my gut instinct was yknow diedrich bader could do this i know he can do this then after going through the whole artist process that i do everybody else decided diedrich bader was the right guy so that was a good thing

998528 sometimes hed say stuff like i wish i could get a girlfriend

998534 not believed to provide acceptable returns in the foreseeable future
998535 it looks to me like its good corporate fat trimming
998536 when youre at a very accelerated growth youre bound to overshoot a little bit and i think this is cleaning up some of the over spray
998537 the company tends to be willing to pioneer these locations
998538 and it may be an unfortunate side effect of their belt trimming that they may not be able to have that largesse in taking in locations that are not proven
998539 while we will continue to make loans to quality commercial and retail borrowers we are also continuing our efforts to reduce operating expense levels by carefully evaluating every aspect of our banking operations

998556 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
998557 replaced at a later date so that we can get oil into the market
998558 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency
998559 i made a general point about the fact that we need to provide the american people some relief and that there has been constructive conversations between republicans and democrats in the senate on this issue
998560 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
998561 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and offshore drilling
998562 its another example of short term political posturing from washington not the long term leadership we need to solve our dependence on oil

998574 the olympics were huge in my family and thats the only way they could catch the events they wanted to see
998575 throughout the history of the olympics most people havent been able to see most of games they were able to read about them in the paper or catch whatever highlights the tv network decided to show
998576 the silverlight player has been designed to give viewers the best experience possible
998577 youll be able to watch four simultaneous video streams of the live coverage
998578 in turin we streamed live one two hour gold medal hockey game now we are streaming live 2 200 hours
998579 the scope of what we are doing has never been attempted
998580 its a win for microsoft because anyone who wants to watch the olympics will end up using silverlight it will enable microsoft to install a base of silverlight users but it hasnt been tested on the same scale as flash

998981 whereas millions of africans and their descendants were enslaved in the united states and the 13 american colonies from 1619 through 1865
998982 lingering consequences of the misdeeds committed against african americans under slavery and jim crow
998983 whereas slavery in america resembled no other form of involuntary servitude known in history as africans were captured and sold at auction like inanimate objects or animals
998984 whereas africans forced into slavery were brutalized humiliated dehumanized and subjected to the indignity of being stripped of their names and heritage
998985 whereas enslaved families were torn apart after having been sold separately from one another
998986 whereas the system of slavery and the visceral racism against persons of african descent upon which it depended became entrenched in the nations social fabric
998987 whereas slavery was not officially abolished until the passage of the 13th amendment to the united states constitution in 1865 after the end of the civil war
998988 whereas after emancipation from 246 years of slavery african americans soon saw the fleeting political social and economic gains they made during reconstruction eviscerated by virulent racism lynchings disenfranchisement black codes and racial segregation laws that imposed a rigid system of officially sanctioned racial segregation in virtually all areas of life
998989 whereas a century after the official end of slavery in america federal action was required during the 1960s to eliminate the de jure and de facto system of jim crow throughout parts of the nation though its vestiges still linger to this day
998990 whereas african americans continue to suffer from the complex interplay between slavery and jim crow long after both systems were formally abolished through enormous damage and loss both tangible and intangible including the loss of human dignity the frustration of careers and professional lives and the long term loss of income and opportunity
998991 whereas a genuine apology is an important and necessary first step in the process of racial reconciliation
998992 whereas an apology for centuries of brutal dehumanization and injustices cannot erase the past but confession of the wrongs committed can speed racial healing and reconciliation and help americans confront the ghosts of their past
998993 whereas it is important for this country which legally recognized slavery through its constitution and its laws to make a formal apology for slavery and for its successor jim crow so that it can move forward and seek reconciliation justice and harmony for all of its citizens
998994 now therefore be it resolved that the house of representatives 1 acknowledges that slavery is incompatible with the basic founding principles recognized in the declaration of independence that all men are created equal 2 acknowledges the fundamental injustice cruelty brutality and inhumanity of slavery and jim crow 3 apologizes to african americans on behalf of the people of the united states for the wrongs committed against them and their ancestors who suffered under slavery and jim crow and 4 expresses its commitment to rectify the lingering consequences of the misdeeds committed against african americans under slavery and jim crow and to stop the occurrence of human rights violations in the future

999020 obama stammered helplessly for about two minutes before ducking the question completely
999021 anybody could look up the actual statements by the iraqi government and see they had nothing in common with obamas approach what if people who see this article use the internet it would be obvious we were stretching the truth to help the democrats thats supposed to be a secret
999022 theres no way ordinary people can find out what the iraqis themselves want i mean theres terrorists in iraq and we know they prefer obamas plan im sure there are others who agree with the terrorists
999023 i kept saying to myself focus on the dates focus on the dates
999024 but there was this terrible pain behind my eyes like somebody was inside my head twisting my brain into a pretzel
999025 its tough being a journalist right now obama supporters are always talking about what great judgment the guy has but the only reason his iraq plan isnt a complete cock up is that the surge worked obama opposed the surge and mccain didnt it does bad things to the brain when you try to wrap it around something like that

999029 health it is so significant and so important that everyone wants their fingerprints on it
999030 needs a national health information network that respects patient confidentiality but that also lets hospitals share records across states quickly seamlessly and accurately
999031 current legal barriers to such a networks formation include a patchwork of state and federal patient privacy laws flaws in federal physician anti kickback and anti self referral statutes prohibitions against practicing medicine across state lines and concerns about medical malpractice in an electronic health care environment
999032 rave about the need for affordable health care but too little is done in the area of ehealth
999033 i nstead of taking the initiative and forcing the issue top down they are implicitly hoping for a bottom up solution while taking partisan stances in the periodic debates over medical malpractice liability
999034 one area where the federal government could act and needs to act
999035 but will congress and the next administration have the vision and political courage to make a bold move that could save countless lives and reduce health care costs
999036 the nation needs revolution not evolution in health care informatics
999037 w hile the recent progress on e prescribing is important it will not be enough unless and until we implement broader more comprehensive payment reforms that push health care providers to use
999038 with the right solutions and by looking forward instead of left or right we can finally bring medical care into the 21st century

999041 health it legislation should also include adequate security and privacy protections for patient information without jeopardizing the viability of health it by exposing providers to unreasonable liability burdens
999042 should offer financial incentives to encourage adoption of new technology while educating americans on the value of such new technology
999043 american consumers deserve a health care system that reflects todays technologies

999053 peak buying is normally in march and april and this year the panic started in june
999054 this is a different dynamic and sellers werent ready they have a sort of rhythm and this year it just got blown out of the water
999055 theres no question this is going to be a hard winter for people because of the demand
999056 its not even a question of how much it costs for wood pellets or firewood so much as if theyre even available

999072 he didnt make it seem like this was a way station
999073 it seems like he was setting up a life down there
999074 i have no doubt that he would have been right back in high society circles
999075 didnt figure out what he did but he seemed very bright definitely

999108 it is with sincere humility and a determination to do good that i declare my candidacy for president of the united states
999109 we must ensure that our brave troops currently serving in iraq have exactly what they need to successfully carry out their mission
999110 although some have suggested that congress withhold funds from the war it is ultimately up to the president as commander in chief to find and implement a new strategy for success in iraq
999111 congress can be most effective by conducting the tough oversight needed to ensure a change in policy in iraq
999112 with specific regard to iraq funding one of the best ways to ensure congressional oversight over the war is to require greater transparency and accountability in the budget for the war
999113 please be assured that i recognize that our country must change course in iraq
999114 you may be certain that under my leadership congress will conduct the necessary oversight over the war and support our troops in iraq
999115 the stakes are high and failure in iraq is not an option
999116 although the rebuilding process will take time i look forward to steadily reducing our military presence in iraq and bringing our troops home to their families
999117 the first large scale operation of foreign oil companies in iraq since the industry was nationalized in 1972
999118 under the chapter entitled fiscal regime the draft law spells out that foreign companies have no restrictions on taking their profits out of the country and are not subject to any tax when doing this
999119 a foreign person may repatriate its exports proceeds in accordance with the foreign exchange regulations in force at the time
999120 may freely transfer shares pertaining to any non iraqi partners
999121 we need to make it clear that we intend to leave iraq and turn over the responsibility of iraq to the iraqi people
999122 searching for military solutions in iraq today is a fools errand
999123 we need to ensure that we are providing our servicemen with the support and resources that they need to get the job done
999124 office is investigating what tools are available to condition or constrain appropriations
999125 is by cutting the funding to this war just like the vietnam war
999126 the democratic congress has a mandate from the people to stop the war bring the troops back home and help iraq take a new direction we cannot do that if we appropriate more funds which set the stage for a sharp escalation of the war
999127 this president does not make decisions based on public opinion

999137 literacy test refers to the government practice of testing the literacy of potential citizens at the federal level and potential voters at the state level as used by the states the literacy test gained infamy as a means for denying the franchise to african americans adopted by a number of southern states the literacy test was applied in a patently unfair manner as it was used to disfranchise many literate southern blacks while allowing many illiterate southern whites to vote the literacy test combined with other discriminatory requirements effectively disfranchised the vast majority of african americans in the south from the 1890s until the 1960s southern states abandoned the literacy test only when forced to by federal legislation in the 1960s
999138 violates the individual right to bear arms protected by the second amendment
999139 here the government does not allege that mr vargas possessed the weapon with intent to use it unlawfully or outside of his home
999140 mr vargas is accused of keeping a gun in his home this conduct is protected by the individual right to bear arms enshrined in the second amendment
999141 the question now becomes which defendants with guns in their homes should benefit from that constitutional right
999142 one issue becomes whether to allow defendants to make these types of challenges even though they never applied for the permit
999143 mr vargas is alleged in essence not to have submitted himself to the complete discretion and the extraordinary power of the new york city police commissioner

999149 you could see how emotional michael was when he spoke about his family and its an emotional decision
999150 he likes to challenge us on a daily basis there are a lot of strong characters in the dressing room and a lot of opinionated people i sat down with peter and we had a real good discussion about how we want to take this team forward i think my position from a player to a captain is totally different and we need to unite and to get on the same hymn sheet
999151 i will always respect what happened in the past and i will always ask for advice im fresh into this and i will need some help one of the most exciting things is that i have had text messages and phone calls from senior members in the squad who have said they are right behind me
999152 i havent even thought that far ahead my concern this week is about how we can salvage pride from this series
999153 hopefully i am going to bat exactly the same way the way colly paul collingwood and i played is exactly the way you need to play against south africa and against australia you have to be positive and aggressive
999154 i cant comment on a case i havent heard about but what youre telling me sounds horrible

999161 in addition we have recently closed a 35 million revolving credit facility this facility will add to our liquidity and enable us to manage the future growth of our business furthermore this financing comes with a relatively low cost of capital and is considerably less dilutive to our shareholders than an equity offering

999169 we are excited to announce that we recently received notice of a design win from one of the largest enterprise storage and server oems confirming our qualification across multiple platforms using our zeusiops and mach8 iops ssds we expect production revenue from these platforms to begin in the fourth quarter of this year this is our second large enterprise oem customer win
999170 we are in the later stages of qualification for our zeusiops ssds with several other key enterprise storage customers
999171 we are in the later stages of qualification with several leading enterprise server oems for our mach8 iops ssd products we anticipate that we will be announcing additional qualifications at other major enterprise oems by the end of this year further we expect that both of these product lines will contribute significantly to our growth in 2009
999172 our mlc based products have now been qualified at a number of leading notebook and the ultra mobile notebook oems we believe the current environment of falling nand flash prices will help to further reduce the price of ssds to the end customer and stimulate demand in both of these markets we expect to begin shipping production units into these markets in the third quarter of 2008

999311 the discussion will be open and is designed to have a clear and clean situation for everybody for the 2012 olympics which will be played in london

999350 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
999351 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines

999358 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
999359 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
999360 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
999361 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
999362 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
999363 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
999364 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
999365 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
999366 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
999367 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
999368 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
999369 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
999370 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
999371 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty

999378 i think he just saw doing the jag corps as a form of public service work

999380 i think he out hustled terri bonoff in terms of delegate contact clearly

999382 i felt that the young man was enterprising energetic hardworking
999383 i liked the idea that he could make a credible argument about iraq because of course he had been there as a soldier
999384 i think its an asset that he would have some republican or conservative leanings at some point in his life
999385 hes not a knee jerk democrat hes not a democrat because dad and mom were democrats he actually had to think about the issues and arrive at some conclusions

999398 the dup and sinn fein have signalled they are moving towards a deal on devolving policing and justice powers from westminster to the ni assembly the parties have agreed there will be a single department of justice with a minister needing cross community support to be elected
999399 the two parties have said they will not nominate candidates themselves
999400 the failure of sinn fein and dup to agree on the issue has been a key factor in what some have described as a deadlock at stormont however the parties have written a letter to the assembly executive review committee outlining common areas of agreement but there is still no agreement on when transfer of powers would take place
999401 the sdlp and ulster unionists have yet to say whether they will nominate anyone for the job
999402 it seems that the only thing that the dup and sinn fein can agree on is that the sdlp should be denied a ministry to which we are entitled under the rules
999403 it is clear that the dup and sinn fein are attempting to play a game of executive gerrymandering that will deny the sdlp a ministry that would be rightfully ours
999404 the dup have held up devolution of justice long enough
999405 the devolution of policing and justice powers to the north is the final piece in the jigsaw of implementing the good friday agreement bending and breaking that agreement to serve narrow party political interests is not a basis to ensure a stable and effective ministry that is what the public want it is what all political parties should be striving for what have either the dup or sinn fein got to fear from another sdlp minister or a sdlp minister for justice in particular the answer is simply electoral as the party which delivered the new beginning to policing we are best qualified to take on the task of a devolved justice ministry for the sdlp this is natural territory
999406 the new estimates confirm that a vast majority of new infections in the u s occur in gay and bisexual men and that blacks are significantly more heavily impacted than other racial ethnic categories however the data fail to clearly link the two perpetuating a longstanding damaging polarization
999407 we need cdc to clearly show the hiv incidence numbers in gay men and other msm of color
999408 a substantial number of black people infected every year are gay or bisexual and a substantial proportion of gay and bisexual men infected are black in fact the heaviest impact is at the nexus of the two being both black and a man who has sex with men yet this population is significantly marginalized even stigmatized within both larger populations of which it is an integral part a national aids strategy must tackle this fundamental challenge
999409 the rising incidence in our communities is a direct result of years of policies and programs that demonize and ignore the sexual health needs of gay men especially african american and latino gay men who bear the brunt of the epidemic in the united states gay men of all colors face significant health disparities that directly impact the incidence and prevalence of hiv in their lives
999410 we must prioritize a holistic asset based gay mens health agenda that goes well beyond a navel to knee focus we must also address their physical mental emotional and spiritual health needs that when neglected foster conditions in which hiv thrives
999411 if this socially conservative country with far fewer resources than its wealthy neighbor to the north can ambitiously confront homophobia with government sponsorship and funding why cant the united states
999412 cdc talks of the need to develop more and better prevention messages including more prevention interventions for black gay men and gay men of all races but such strategies will never be sufficiently effective or taken up by those most at risk until and unless homophobia is directly confronted
999413 instead politicians of both parties and the department of health and human services have caved into pressure from right wing politicians squelching not only sexuality research but anti homophobia and pro sexual diversity messages in hiv prevention and general health promotion alike will our next administration buck this trend or will it be more of the business as usual thats decimating my community
999414 the decision to exclude puerto ricans from the hispanic incidence analysis is perplexing the cdc made a positive step forward in its original decision to include hispanics but has subsequently taken two steps back by again excluding puerto ricans from the hispanic incidence rates we will never have accurate estimate of hiv incidence in the hispanic community if this discrimination continues
999415 we call on everyone to mobilize demand respect and call for recognition from cdc of the health crisis that hiv aids represents in our latino hispanic communities in the united states puerto rico and the u s virgin islands
999416 we will not allow our experience of the epidemic to be invisible our health crisis is real we want an accurate picture of the impact of hiv aids now

999628 is divided on whether he should announce his running mate in the immediate days ahead but the republican is more likely to wait for barack obama to announce his choice first
999629 while mccains aides are tight lipped about revealing anything related to what has so far been a leak free process some of his advisers state a clear preference for not firing the valuable political bullet too soon
999630 by waiting to make a major announcement in the window after obamas much anticipated acceptance speech august 28 at invesco field and before he receives his partys nomination the following week for example mccain would be able to quickly shift the focus of the race following the democratic convention
999631 the most unlikely alliance in this election year hasnt come out of any political campaign
999632 its in the convergence of interests between billionaire oilman and republican party backer t boone pickens and former vice president turned environmentalist al gore
999633 are pursuing separate paths toward a shared goal cutting u s dependence on oil
999634 no i wouldnt im a republican i dont want to go to heaven and have to face my family up there and tell them i voted for a democrat
999635 dont send me chick flicks you know how to make an american quilt during a weekend at the lake with boys on the side

999637 you have meddled with the primal forces of nature mr
999638 on two occasions we felt let down when rahul dravid images didnt get khel ratna and yuvraj singh was denied the arjuna
999639 dravid was in good form we had won 16 odis on the trot and the team was on a high still he did not get the award
999640 yuvraj too was unlucky not to get arjuna after two years of consistent performance we are happy dhoni got it
999641 time will tell i hope it wont its a way ive been successful with so far in my career and something i want to try and keep at a real high level
999642 the way i play is very gut instinct orientated and i like to do things spontaneously i like to do what i feel is right in a situation
999643 i think over the years ive played cricket ive gained a good cricket brain my gut instinct when ive been batting for england has assisted me tremendously its a brand new challenge for me and i love challenges
999644 huge boots to try and fill michael was a great leader and a great friend
999645 you could see how emotional michael was when he spoke about his family and its an emotional decision
999646 he likes to challenge us on a daily basis there are a lot of strong characters in the dressing room and a lot of opinionated people i sat down with peter and we had a real good discussion about how we want to take this team forward i think my position from a player to a captain is totally different and we need to unite and to get on the same hymn sheet
999647 i will always respect what happened in the past and i will always ask for advice im fresh into this and i will need some help one of the most exciting things is that i have had text messages and phone calls from senior members in the squad who have said they are right behind me
999648 i havent even thought that far ahead my concern this week is about how we can salvage pride from this series
999649 hopefully i am going to bat exactly the same way the way colly paul collingwood and i played is exactly the way you need to play against south africa and against australia you have to be positive and aggressive
999650 ive been trying to subpoena senator jesse andersen lujan since he was a private person when he was working with cyfred to come to court to testify we
999651 this is all brand new to me obviously and its all news to me
999652 after consultation of the entire board may i submit the name for approval of the name of giovanni also known as bunny sgabmelluri as the next superintendent of education
999653 little kids need to get rid a lot of their energy during recess or lunchtime and the playground here is not good at all several pieces of equipment have been condemned
999654 our tasking today was to come out and focus mainly on the air conditioning units here at the school
999655 escape from digital handcuffs also known as digital restrictions management or drm
999656 new zealands law does not go as far as the dmca in the us but it is unjust nonetheless
999657 drm is nearly always the result of a conspiracy of companies to restrict the technology available to the public such conspiracy should be a crime and the executives responsible for it should be sentenced to prison
999658 free software means that people are free to cooperate and control their own computing
999659 you dont find malicious features in free software because the users are in control
999660 non free proprietary software keeps the users divided and helpless divided because each user is forbidden to share it and helpless because the users dont have the source code so they cant even tell what its doing to them
999661 to use proprietary software is to invite the developer to put his boot on your neck its power that nobody should have
999662 i dont have any other specific plans but id be happy to talk with any other free software developers about useful kinds of cooperation
999663 is based on ethical values of freedom and social solidarity
999664 we reject non free software regardless of what practical advantages or disadvantages it may have because one uses it at the price of ones freedom
999665 many geeks who prefer not to think about ethical issues chose the gnu linux system for its practical advantages and some of them also contributed to its development
999666 however they coined the term open source in 1998 in order to talk about the same corpus of free software more or less but without alluding to ethical issues and values
999667 i respect their right to their views but people with their views would never have sought to produce a completely free operating system the reason we have one is because of people who do care about freedom
999668 each software patent is a government imposed monopoly on implementing some computational idea or technique any software developer or computer user that implements the technique can get sued for it thus you as a developer or user can be sued by parties unknown to you over the ideas in the code that you wrote or the system that you set up
999669 the best solution to this problem is not to allow software patents however in countries that do all developers and distributors are likely to be threatened as red hat was by firestar and datatern a dispute settled last month
999670 that is why gpl version 3 requires companies that redistribute to get licences that cover all their downstream users
999671 the megacorporations cross license with each other and can force anyone else except a patent troll to cross license with them too thus they avoid most of the harm and patents give them a sort of control over their field
999672 the us government generally works for the megacorporations so it tries to bully other countries into allowing software patents governments that are inclined to bow down to the megacorporations give in but they shouldnt
999673 outlived by nearly 17 years the soviet state and system he had battled through years of imprisonment ostracism and exile
999674 the first time i heard about inglorious bastards was the variety review
999675 youre just giving them another tool to do it harm with its pound foolish and not very wise
999676 the world had inflicted a terrible injustice upon the palestinian people in 1947 1948 there would be no peace in the middle east until this injustice was somehow rectified and the palestinian people were certainly entitled to an independent nation state of their own
999677 you will forfeit the moral right to lead your people
999678 proclaimed the existence of the new independent state of palestine
999679 the real start of the middle east peace process by the palestinian people themselves
999680 administered under the laws of the mandatory as integral portions of its territory
999681 the palestinian people proceed forthwith to create the state of palestine
999682 in recognition of the courage suffering and bravery of the palestinian people living under israeli occupation
999683 the threat or use of force violence and intimidation against its territorial integrity and political independence or those of any other state
999684 occupied territory and hence subject to the provisions of international law governing the rights and obligations of an occupying power
999685 the failure of israel to respect the previous resolutions by the un regarding the status of the city of jerusalem
999686 all legislative and administrative actions taken by israel to change jerusalems status are totally invalid and urgently calls upon israel to rescind all previous measures and actions and take no further steps
999687 jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of the state of israel
999688 us embassy in israel should be established in jerusalem no later than may 31 1999
999689 they are not and could never be honest brokers for peace
999690 just and lasting middle east peace and withdrawal of israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict
999691 if however the power of the occupier is effectively displaced for any length of time its position towards the inhabitants is the same as before occupation
999692 but do not sell out our right to our state
999693 prove that the palestinians were willing to live in peace and harmony with israel
999694 deplores the provocation carried out at al haram al sharif and subsequent violence
999695 calls upon israel the occupying power to abide scrupulously by its legal obligations and its responsibilities under the fourth geneva convention
999696 terrorism originates from the statist system of structural violence and domination that denies the right of self determination to peoples
999697 right of individual or collective self defense if an armed attack occurs against a member until the security council has taken measures to maintain international peace and security
999698 sole rogue elephant of international law and politics for humanitys sake this administration must be restrained along with its israeli partner time is of the essence
999699 a severe defeat for israel in the court of world public opinion
999700 no compromise with the main purpose no peace till victory no pact with unrepentant wrong
999701 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
999702 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
999703 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it
999704 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
999705 i think right now rick will evaluate him and well plan a sensible campaign
999706 i was concerned at the 3 8ths pole and it looked like we were beat turning for home
999707 but he got down on his belly and he won though
999708 i thought we had a helluva shot turning for home i thought to myself we could do this again i am very happy right now we made him run thats for sure big brown looked great in the paddock and when he broke but down the backside i got excited coal play ran a big race
999709 hes a top horse it was little more than i was expecting he really struggled out there to run this horse down but zitos horse ran great
999710 he found a new gear and just kept sticking his neck out i knew he was going to get there at the top of the stretch that horse coal play took off but big brown took off after him today he showed hes a warrior
999711 were on the water right now just putting on extra lines in case it comes up
999712 its not going to be a huge issue for anybody in this area
999713 right now we want residents in travel trailers to have a more permanent residence to go to if necessary
999714 i would say its self explanatory and clear that you shouldnt extort patients
999715 i work on womens issues social affairs and workers rights
999716 he said lets make a deal you give me information and ill make it easy for you to go israel
999717 contingent on an applicants willingness to submit any information except for reliable information on his medical condition
999718 whatever is going to happen is going to be the right ending
999719 im going to be spazzing until i finish the book and find out
999720 ive been keeping this secret for years its fabulous to finally be able to talk about it im very much looking forward to the discussion at the event this tuesday in chicago
999721 we tell the enemies of god that god has saved those who will be even more painful for you
999722 as abu khabab has gone he left behind with gods grace a generation of faithful students who will make you suffer the worst torture and avenge him and his brothers
999723 the boys and girls who live with hiv are here and we are growing up with many goals
999724 we want to be artists teachers doctors even get married and have kids but achieving these goals will only be possible when we receive the attention we need when we are guaranteed the medicines that we need when we are accepted in schools
999725 its like a little ball that has little dots and is inside me sort of swimming inside me
999726 theres a whole new generation of young people that were born with hiv that are reaching adulthood it presents very interesting challenges
999727 they cant talk about their diagnosis in the school because they can be kicked out they cant talk about it in their communities with their neighbors
999728 we need to start getting young people involved in leadership again in hiv and aids because its easy to get kind of complacent
999729 i want to congratulate all the boys and girls who have graduated and got good grades
999730 sometimes i have so much fun that i forget i have this
999731 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
999732 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
999733 we are putting america at more risk not less risk
999734 across the spectrum of biothreats we have expanded our capacity significantly
999735 i think its an important risk but frankly im more concerned about bombs and guns which are easily available and can be very destructive
999736 one well placed student technician or senior scientist no cost with the salary being provided courtesy of the u s taxpayer and no risk no difficulty
999737 adherence to institute safety procedures by laboratory personnel is lax
999738 you can never say that the system is 100 percent secure
999739 but the research ethic today is one of much greater discipline and focus on security than was true prior to the anthrax attacks
999740 well there comes time when my mentor and i get to compete and i guess thats whats going to happen
999741 if thats what happens then im going to give it my best shot and leave the rest up to coach
999742 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate
999743 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
999744 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
999745 im excited its good to have him back in the house
999746 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
999747 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
999748 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
999749 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
999750 but like i said its not the first time and it wont be the last time
999751 if we played a game tomorrow aaron rodgers would be the starting quarterback
999752 im not going to change any direction that weve gone with this football team based on the information i have here today thats part of our conversation tomorrow and we have all the confidence in the world in aaron
999753 you can see how for people who were exhausted it would have been nearly impossible for them to descend without the ropes
999754 once their hands and feet are frozen they really are unable to move on their own power and it takes other people to carry them down
999755 its more technical its steeper the weather is more intense
999756 i dont remember actually going into the water just going off the board
999757 he has and has had from day one a fabulous attitude
999758 less than 5 percent of all the injuries we looked at were hospitalized
999759 they should not act like the former soviet union did in afghanistan
999760 the best way to have a home that expresses a love for reading books is to share your home with a life partner who loves being a reader
999761 suppose i love classical music what would happen if i have an intimate relationship with someone who hates classical music but loves heavy metal rock im into symphonies she collects metallica megadeath nine inch nails i wouldnt be able to take my partner to the concerts i enjoy or share the thrill of finding a great cd such a relationship would mean that i would have to give up a great deal of myself what kind of love is that and how long could we be happy
999762 eventually we get tired of all the compromising that such relationships require we get tired of giving up the things that mean so much to us
999763 being a christian is very admirable and being a jew is equally admirable but being a jew for jesus combines things that are impossible to mix
999764 if you think a lot about the holocaust about israel about torah wouldnt you be happier spending your life with someone who shared all this with you
999765 envision messianic judaism as a movement committed to yeshua the messiah that embrace the covenantal responsibility of jewish life and identity rooted in torah
999766 hebron is like the wild west and the army is the law
999767 we would see who could go without breathing the longest

999770 if even one kid looked at us the wrong way hed be slapped rocks were thrown at us during one patrol and we caught one of the kids who knew the perpetrators we beat the crap out of him until he told us who did it
999771 it was around noon we were accompanying shepherds from the village of tuba to a nearby wadi because the settlers regularly hassle them and throw stones in our direction
999772 the settlers demanded that the shepherds evacuate the area and idf soldiers who arrived at the scene also attempted to clear the palestinian shepherds from their grazing fields then in the middle of the argument and for no apparent reason the soldiers pulled down their pants and exposed their rear ends to us
999773 exclusive brad and angelina share their beautiful family with us

999777 a potentially bullish factor is the storm but it is not strong enough to disrupt supply yet
999778 we have reverted to the underlying fundamentals where oil prices are higher and the stock market not looking too good so in the coming days dollar demand is expected to be fairly strong
999779 oil prices have rebounded from 120 per barrel levels so the underlying fact is that there is scope for the rupee to depreciate we may see the rupee at 42 80 43 00 levels by the end of this week
999780 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
999781 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
999782 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
999783 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
999784 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
999785 the scientific community is really going to run with this
999786 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science

999801 we really believe we have come up with a contracting profile that responds to the commissions concerns and that we could negotiate a final contract much sooner
999802 if you tell me how many bids we are going to receive for each work package i can give you an idea of how quickly we can conclude the negotiations
999803 but the commissions rules on this are very clear and i do not see at this point how we can save a lot of time from the current schedule

999817 right now this wireless device p2p activity is not a huge problem
999818 the one reason the internet has grown is that the government has been hands off but they eventually may have to get involved on issues such as p2p file sharing as such activity does impact network and network service to other users
999819 this includes placing restrictions on accessing certain content and applications limiting throughput or the amount of data you can transfer and taking action to optimize or improve the overall use of our network and services

999833 you can take snapshots like the images weve shown here on smash bros dojo we had a snapshot mode in the past but you couldnt take a snapshot anytime in the middle of a match and they were saved to a gamecube memory card it wasnt like you could save several dozens of photos however this time there are sd cards with those youll have room to save plenty of snapshots
999834 this feature allows you to send your snapshots to people youve registered as friends for nintendo wfc play so you can give them funny little screenshots as presents you can view them in the album dont you think youd be happy to suddenly get a funny photo from a friend perhaps online brawling isnt the only way to compete uh as for that thing thats blurred out thats still a secret were still in development so i apologize in advance if it gets dropped but we are thinking of one more trick for this mode

999838 the sanction imposed on heath by the club on monday was a result of information stated by both heath and alan after being repeatedly questioned about the incident the magpies said in a statement tonight
999839 given the club has now found their information to be false it strikes at the principles of honesty and integrity that the collingwood football club is built on
999840 for this reason the sanction imposed today will be immediately reviewed by the club and media will be notified of a press conference to be held on tuesday
999841 i rang him and then i saw him walking down and then because there was a bit of a crowd around me i just told him to go because i didnt really need him there at that point shaw said
