8750031 nosotros comprendemos el acuerdo al cual lleg el senado entendemos las razones que nos esgrimieron pero nos parece que en un asunto de tal envergadura como es la psu que para la pr xima aplicaci n implica 261 mil estudiantes lo que cabe es mantener el proceso tal cual como se hab a establecido

8750034 esta prueba responde a una decisi n del consejo de rectores para su propio sistema de admisi n nos alegrar a que otras universidades privadas tuvieran un proceso de admisi n m s trasparente creemos que eso hay que procurar que es un deber que las distintas instituciones tenemos con el pa s y si para las universidades privadas pueden haber opciones de incorporar la prueba junto a otros instrumentos y determinar con toda claridad cu les son los requisitos de postulaci n que deben cumplir los estudiantes en esas universidades en buena hora porque se le hace un beneficio claro al sistema de educaci n superior del pa s y ayuda a todas las personas que hagan una mejor elecci n de las opciones disponibles

8750041 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8750042 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8750043 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent

8750050 mr lee is about meeting our responsibilities to our veterans
8750051 a large part of this vision is using our resources wisely to serve our present and future residents
8750052 were taking a proactive approach were doing more than waving the flag
8750053 we want to use community based services to achieve our ends and this represents an aggressive move forward
8750054 not only is the city of orting involved in this project but weve got federal state and county partners as well
8750055 the building is a unique treasure and we are committed to providing the services needed to allow our veterans to live in dignity and safety
8750056 those who think they know everything annoy those of us that do
8750057 patients come before money and we are currently in talks with the ministry about that
8750058 in that context the decision to outsource to an australian hospital with the capacity to perform that surgery within the next three months makes sense
8750059 those who choose not to go to australia will retain their place on the waiting list here
8750060 its not an isolated case as waiting lists at other dhbs are just as bad
8750061 mark is a more mobile guy that creates opportunities for himself to make some plays in addition to the normal plays in the offense
8750062 hes very competitive hes a great practice player hes got a great arm hes really a fantastic player i think hes going to do everything that anybody can do with this spot if he can hold on to his job and keep ahead of mitch mustain and aaron corp because the competition is on as it always is
8750063 we had a terrific run in our history here but the kids who have been in the program for so many years winning championships have all left us
8750064 this season has brought emergence of the leadership from guys like brian cushing rey maualuga and kevin ellison and mark sanchez and kristopher odowd we sense a whole new excitement about a program
8750065 the quarterback position is i wont say of concern but ill say of interest
8750066 were going to have five guys competing for that job we have a practice order and nate costa heads that up but justin roper did a tremendous job in our bowl game and probably his performance in practices leading up to that game and in the oregon state game gave our team the confidence i believe to win that football game
8750067 i think its a tremendous conference both from the talent of a playing standpoint and a coaching standpoint
8750068 if you look at a veteran quarterback i think thats a starting point if you look at an emerging defense i think thats another starting point youve got to have some support people on offense because a quarterback in and of himself cant do it
8750069 i thought of the songs that i would listen to growing up of the memories attached to some of the old stuff that my parents were playing and of the feelings attached to those memories
8750070 i thought it would be really cool to have a record that explores the different eras of soul music
8750071 i remember hearing it and thinking thats a dope song and hes canadian
8750072 the general consensus was your songs sound too mature for your look
8750073 i did voiceovers commercials worked on sessions in studios anything i did to survive was music related
8750074 im not stupid i think i can figure the rest of it out for myself thank you
8750075 next time i need help i will call on you
8750076 i might have done one or two things on film or television acting roles maybe ill be writing songs for other people
8750077 we now can say with reasonable certainty that we have a safe intervention that will reduce the chances that babies born very early will suffer cerebral palsy

8750097 what will it take to convince people the us isnt in recession
8750098 the us fed they want to raise rates but because of the fragility of the financial system they have to wait
8750099 at some point they have to raise rates to address inflationary problems
8750100 australian jockeys are among the lowest paid in the world
8750101 they ride because they love the sport but they deserve basic protections
8750102 thats why we are asking for a small proportion of the racing industrys prize pool to be set aside for the jockeys who put their lives on the line when they saddle up
8750103 it would be a shame to see it disrupt something like the spring carnival
8750104 if jockeys are not provided basic protections more of them will leave the sport putting the ongoing viability of the industry at risk
8750105 behind the glamour of the racing industry there is a side the general public dont see
8750106 our jockeys put their lives on the line each time they race
8750107 they shouldnt also be expected to risk financial ruin each time they race
8750108 insurance is hard to get because theres a lot of falls and theres not enough jockeys to insure
8750109 its a small array of jockeys around australia and thats all they can get

8750121 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly said avery shenfeld senior economist at cibc world markets
8750122 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8750123 a lot of the monthly indicators are suggesting recession but things like new orders and gdp suggest the economy is improving
8750124 if the us economy were growing at its potential pace the unemployment rate would not have risen a full percentage point over the past year said citigroup economist steven wieting who argues that data on new jobless claims are
8750125 with economies abroad slowing and the one time impact of tax rebates dissipating we expect annualised economic growth to recede to near 1 0 per cent in the third quarter and to maintain this pace into early 2009 before gradually improving said peter kretzmer an economist at bank of america
8750126 the better than expected outcome overall does not change our view that the economy is weakening with the beneficial effects of rebate checks and foreign demand fading fast smith said

8750147 i wish i could says it was 800 years ago and it was a barbaric era but of course it wasnt

8750149 ich denke wir werden uns so teuer wie m glich verkaufen es ist ein wichtiges spiel und wir hoffen gut auszusehen
8750150 alle meine freunde familienmitglieder verwandte und sogar bekannte werden zu der partie kommen ich wei dass sie uns fantastisch unterst tzen werden

8750152 unsere fans sind die besten der welt wir werden mal sehen was wir in dieser partie f r sie tun k nnen
8750153 ich habe mich von der verletzung nicht optimal erholt es bestand sogar die gefahr dass ich auch dieses spiel nicht h tte bestreiten k nnen

8750171 abbiamo lavorato pi che mai su questo disco e siamo entrati in studio solo quando eravamo convinti del prodotto che avevamo tra le mani la crudit di mala sangre ci ha resi ancora pi soddisfatti di questo nuovo album
8750172 ogni album prodotto la perfetta rappresentazione di un determinato periodo questa era senza dubbio la pi matura bella e potente per noi abbiamo composto un disco che raccoglie tutto quanto fatto e mostra quello che siamo come uomini e musicisti senza dubbio la miglior produzione da noi promossa e sfido chiunque a sostenere il contrario
8750173 c un mistero che accompagna il folklore e la superstizione

8750178 it isnt hard to understand why a building like this would receive so much attention

8750189 at present time there are no official reports in lebanon indicating this
8750190 into whether the death was in fact related to the virus
8750191 if you hear the dogs keep going if you see the torches in the woods keep going if theyre shouting after you keep going dont ever stop keep going
8750192 remember before we can keep going weve got to get going by electing barack obama the next president of the united states
8750193 when the democratic primary process is over and hillary tells me both privately and publicly that this is a time to come together and we have to do everything we can to help barack obama i take that as a moral imperative
8750194 because i really believe in the values of the democratic party
8750195 theres a coming together process thats not yet complete theyre still in a mourning period
8750196 the clintons have been very popular in the jewish community
8750197 the jewish community especially those of us who are democrats understands that this is probably the most important election in their lifetime and people are coming together to support barack obama
8750198 the effort to bring the democrats and particularly jewish democrats together is coming along very successfully
8750199 we reminded them that their sole responsibility in denver is selecting the electable candidate
8750200 it takes some time are there going to be some defections of course there always is but i dont think its going to be decisive

8750217 i dont think that well see the continued decimation of asset values on these banks balance sheets going forward
8750218 at amp ts consumer services agreement is substantively unconscionable and therefore unenforceable to the extent that it purports to waive the right to class actions require confidentiality shorten the washington consumer protection act statute of limitations and limit availability of attorney fees
8750219 conflicts with our states fundamental public policy to protect consumers through the availability of class action
8750220 the broader point is that companies like at amp t cant cheat people out of small sums of money and get away with it
8750221 the folks who were first to buy those are the early adopters those are the tech savvy ones and what it says is that big data buckets actually let you do a lot of stuff
8750222 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8750223 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8750224 my concern about the campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8750225 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8750226 we believe you are offering a high risk test that has not received adequate clinical validation and may harm the public health
8750227 were elated that we get to go back to the table in the mediation process and try to find a contract that our members can live with
8750228 while i am hopeful this expedited process will result in a ratified agreement i continue to have an obligation to balance the budget
8750229 the very best financial offer the state can afford in this economic climate
8750230 we estimate that all things being equal that additional 400 percent is making a difference
8750231 it might be a combination of conservation and changes to weather patterns but we cannot come to a definitive conclusion as yet
8750232 then i see a very good opportunity that basically i would hope that everything could be break even to profitable
8750233 we would hope to have the corporation profitable again by then
8750234 we are selling every hhr and cobalt we can make with either minimal or zero incentives whereas three years ago even the hhr you had to put 3 000 bucks on it to move it so i think in practice the price of small cars has gone up three or four thousand dollars
8750235 everything is shut off with valves at the seafloor so if theres any damage to the facility itself the oil or natural gas whatevers being produced stays underground and doesnt get out into the environment
8750236 so you got downsized its happening a lot this year 579 260 job cuts reported so far
8750237 a majority of people end up telling you its the best thing that ever happed to them
8750238 if you think about the sources of demand the us economy is unlikely to repeat the 3 3 percent real gdp growth we saw in the second quarter in the next few quarters and overseas economies have slowed sharply so the source of demand is not favorable there either
8750239 therefore i tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or about your body what you will wear
8750240 consider how the lilies grow they do not labor or spin yet i tell you not even solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these if that is how god clothes the grass of the field which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire how much more will he clothe you o you of little faith and do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink do not worry about it for the pagan world runs after all such things and your father knows that you need them but seek his kingdom and these things will be given to you as well
8750241 it was a lie from the beginning throughout the war and even today
8750242 this agreement will extend and enhance our already successful long standing collaboration with nikon and will allow us to provide even better products to our customers
8750243 this agreement is another great example of how industry leaders are coming together to collaborate through intellectual property licensing and by doing so enabling innovation that will ultimately benefit the consumer
8750244 we are proud of the quality of our broad global patent portfolio and we are pleased to be working with an industry leader such as nikon
8750245 we are executing well in this tough environment and are on track to achieve our targets for the year
8750246 the two per cent increase in total u s store sales was also more than entirely due to higher spending by customers from other countries
8750247 sales to new yorkers were below last year which should not be too surprising to anyone
8750248 even though the u s was weaker than expected i think a lot of investors thought that could happen
8750249 because everytime they talk to the chinese at the work site or in the office they said go and ask michael somare we deal with michael somare this is michael somares land this is what they are saying
8750250 i was a soldier and now i can t be a soldier anymore
8750251 i went from walking and was knocked back down to crawling
8750252 you can still do things it s not the end of the world
8750253 i instantly knew it was something i wanted to do
8750254 it s hard to walk into a room to talk to a shipmate soldier airman or marine who has had both his legs blown off and tell him that he can still achieve things
8750255 paralympics is the highest platform of competition for athletes with disabilities
8750256 that s what s really neat about the paralympics everyone has a story
8750257 redefining the quality and comfort level of its class over broad categories offering more customer value than ever before
8750258 i am convinced that this is going to be a life changing movie because ive been here at the films production for a couple of days and ive seen the heart of the people who are making it
8750259 catherine and i were in love when we were married but today were two very different people
8750260 roughly 2 000 pastors and pastors wives were at the screening i attended and many of them responded during the credits with a standing ovation
8750261 at another screening a different audience also stood in applause i spoke to one friend who said that after watching it he called his wife to tell her he loved her yes its that good
8750262 i guess all folks who self identify as are interested in cars that the public perceives as green
8750263 today there are so many options in the grocery store for college students to have a balanced meal while balancing school work
8750264 i personally like the frozen bags of corn and broccoli while my chicken is baking in the oven i throw a bag of vegetables in the microwave in less than 30 minutes you have a meal
8750265 use half cup of apples berries pears or peaches whatever you have around top the fruit with one cup granola sprinkle with a half teaspoon of cinnamon and sugar add one half tablespoon of butter spread evenly on small square pan and bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes
8750266 no one is reminding you to eat your fruits and vegetables so grab an apple instead of chips have a super salad instead of a super burger its habit forming
8750267 its fun and if you just take your time you will learn to enjoy it
8750268 presently were about 400 arrests higher than last year and about 300 arrests over our highest year which was 2005
8750269 for alcohol to marijuana then back to alcohol it is a never ending process for a lot of these kids
8750270 peek under the hood and say ok lets do an assessment this young man or this young lady is having problems in these areas and address those areas then we lower the chances that they are going to end up in the criminal justice system
8750271 maybe substance use or abuse it could be depression it could be attention problems it could be physical health problems
8750272 if you are convicted of a marijuana charge and you are trying to go to college you wont get financial aid so we looked at a lot of things and we felt that valley court diversion could meet our needs and we thought it was the right thing to do
8750273 the symbol of sufism itself is the rose the placement of the rare and refined beauty and sweetness of the rose blossoms at the end of a long stern stem full of prickly thorns aptly symbolizes the mystic path to allah the almighty
8750274 the reason these droplets were of such elegance is that they contained the essence of his soul
8750275 the most superior of all scents in the floral realm rose works simultaneously on the physical emotional and spiritual bodies purifying and uplifting all three
8750276 everything is shut off with valves at the seafloor so if theres any damage to the facility itself the oil or natural gas whatevers being produced stays underground and doesnt get out into the environment
8750277 probably the main lesson we learned from katrina and rita is to take care of employees make sure they have a place to stay food generators and a place for their families
8750278 its likely that well see a 10 cents per gallon increase in gasoline in texas and louisiana prior to the storms arrival
8750279 queensland energy resources proposal came at a time when the worlds scientists are warning that we have as little as 10 years to radically reduce greenhouse pollution if we are to have any chance of avoiding catastrophic climate change
8750280 this means that we simply cant afford to be expanding the fossil fuel industry not in the whitsundays not anywhere
8750281 ms bligh has made the right decision to prevent any new shale oil projects from taking place in the state but it is an easy decision the next step is to announce a stop the expansion of the coal industry in queensland
8750282 the truth is that australias addiction to coal is driving climate change which is almost certain to kill large sections of the great barrier reef over coming decades
8750283 it really comes down to a choice between coal or the reef
8750284 i dont envy ms bligh given the economic power of the greenhouse mafia but sometime soon she is going to have to make the tough decision to put the future of the state ahead of the vested interests of the coal lobby
8750285 it wont be easy but we know we can do it
8750286 if we drive the right investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy today we can gradually phase out dirty coal power and make the emissions reductions that we need to avoid a climate catastrophe
8750287 terrestrial television coverage for this event is excellent news it is just one more reason hoards of poker players will descend on one of irelands most beautiful regions in october this will be a blend of fun and with huge money plus european ranking points on offer some very serious poker playing

8750294 and we will be working hard to make it one of the best poker sites in the world
8750295 im getting to the point where i just love wild things now i dont know why
8750296 i thought it was the most wonderful thing ive ever done the super style was my favorite because you didnt have to hold on to anything and your arms were free it was like flying

8750305 vacations by rail has many fabulous rail trips and tours that people will find as great alternatives to the grandluxe rail experience
8750306 it is the hope of newts playing cards that a fun deck of political playing cards like politically wild will catch peoples attention and get them to take more of an active interest in politics
8750307 hopefully the politically wild deck will get more people interested in not only the important issues that effect the american people today but also get more voters to the polls
8750308 senator obama this is truly a good day for america

8750310 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day

8750312 one of the freshest funniest and most entertaining voices to enter the food blogosphere
8750313 so good has the lowdown on anything thats happening in the world of food media hes the guy who broke the lebron james papa johns scandal and the hilarious kraft cheese myspace debacle
8750314 fortune 500 corporations spend millions on r amp d for food products and marketing strategy eick picks them apart in a dc minute
8750315 i really like so good because it generally focuses on the more humorous food related news
8750316 always enjoyable if you havent read it yet do so immediately
8750317 like a bus full of carnies it scares the crap out of me to look at it but i stare anyway
8750318 a sandwich is just a sandwich but eick talking about a sandwich is epic poetry
8750319 jon eick has the rare gift of being diabolically funny without putting others down

8750334 personnellement je nai rien ressenti mais peut tre que mon ami bernard henri l vy lui la ressentie

8750344 saakachvili a lu la puret dangereuse et puis il a eu une prof de philo ancienne correspondante de sartre et comme
8750345 hes one of our horses and a guy that we count on for a lot of innings but you know what he has to take care of his body if his body is telling him that he cant pitch then he cant pitch were going to do our best to pick up his slack well just keep rolling
8750346 hes getting better again not quite 100 percent as much for his peace of mind as anything hes going to see dr andrews on friday morning
8750347 we dont want to put any pitcher in a position where he has to take the mound at anything less than 100 percent
8750348 we think this is the right move we had him penciled in i think you could tell from our answers to you guys the last couple of days this might be a possibility its the right thing to do
8750349 i think mentally its equally as hard as physically theres some sleepless nights youre thinking about all kinds of stuff and generally whenever youre dealing with something like this you end up thinking the worst and not necessarily staying optimistic all the time
8750350 were always concerned for all our pitchers when theyre less than 100 percent but were pretty optimistic
8750351 this thing is getting better it just makes sense josh has a great relationship with dr andrews hes an accomplished doctor we hope he comes back and can take the ball pretty soon
8750352 the objective reality is that apple does plenty of wrong
8750353 very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it
8750354 there was no going back at that point but after i sold it i quickly started to regret it
8750355 theyre skimping on materials on testing things to gain market share but theyre kind of pushing away people who have been with the brand even when it was struggling
8750356 a lot better than the alternative in terms of stability viruses being able to do high end graphics work
8750357 i wouldnt tell people to stop getting apple products they make very good products
8750358 sometimes you feel like youre in line with the soup nazi
8750359 its a really good deal to be part of the apple thing and you dont want to say anything to rock the boat no soup for you your apps are gone
8750360 the transgression has to be so egregious for someone to completely change the narrative
8750361 if something like this had happened to microsoft the long term impact would be much more for microsoft than for apple
8750362 it was a game we thought we had to win if you lose this game its an extremely tough series
8750363 his fastball was explosive its a shame the way the game ended
8750364 hes pitched so well for us all year he was the reason we had a chance he kept us in the game
8750365 at this point were trying to get wins and this was a big one
8750366 it doesnt get any easier we need to come back this weekend ready to play
8750367 we take pride in the fact that apuss emergency and disaster management program is recognized among its peers as being among the top higher educational emergency management institutions in the united states
8750368 we always stand ready to bring additional relief to the market if its necessary
8750369 it is not enough to increase yield we must also increase the value of crops improve opportunities for farmers to access markets and increase income for rural businesses and entrepreneurs that support agriculture
8750370 mutual value is the key for moving african aid programs from only providing short term relief to actually becoming sustainable within the community
8750371 its at that point that we truly achieve success in improving livelihoods
8750372 we must leverage science based knowledge and research innovation in new and creative ways that build on the strengths of each sector to address the market and consumer needs of rural africa
8750373 david suazo andr al benfica in queste ore il direttore tecnico del club portoghese manuel rui costa a milano per il trasferimento dellattaccante honduregno sulla base di un prestito con diritto di riscatto trattativa in dirittura darrivo che domani potrebbe essere chiusa si tratta di un passaggio importante del mercato nerazzurro suazo liberer in pratica un posto in rosa per larrivo di quaresma lesterno che mourinho attende per considerare chiusa la campagna acquisti nerazzurra
8750374 whenever we read the obscene stories the voluptuous debaucheries the cruel and tortuous executions the unrelenting vindictiveness with which more than half the bible is filled it would be more consistent that we call it the word of a demon than the word of god it is a history of wickedness that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind
8750375 creo que el manchester hizo una gran temporada y yo marqu muchos goles me siento muy orgulloso de haber sido premiado como mejor delantero aunque juegue de extremo esto es muy positivo para m y aumenta mi ambici n para mejorar gracias a todos mis compa eros de equipo y aquellos que me hayan votado
8750376 we just want canadians to see the guy we work with every day
8750377 the steady hand we need when the worlds economy is so uncertain
8750378 i like the fact that hes lowered taxes for all of us
8750379 we are prepared we are organized and we are determined to win this election especially with what the conservatives have done with regarding arts and culture
8750380 we anticipate that canadians will have a choice in the not too distant future on exactly how they want to see this country be governed through a period where there are economic difficulties across the board
8750381 when i see people talk about a technical recession even if thats true i dont think its a real recession
8750382 a recession is when people start losing their jobs and when your neighbour starts losing his job and there are job losses but overall employments pretty stable
8750383 whats interesting about mr dion is hes certainly the liberal leader that has taken his party farthest to the left at least since mr trudeau if not farther than mr trudeau
8750384 the awards draw a huge response per category and are based entirely on the visitors votes

8750389 as mobile marketing increasingly becomes a key channel for campaign managers and marketers interested in communicating with voters and consumers a solution for testing and monitoring common short codes is needed to ensure the delivery of critical information and reliability
8750390 is the global leader in on demand test amp measurement solutions for continuously improving the online experience
8750391 weve got all the top stories covered all the time
8750392 we are no longer overly concerned for the banks in terms of writedowns
8750393 that was the one bank that meaningfully beat analysts consensus
8750394 i think the pessimism going into the quarter was a little bit overdone
8750395 in the banks that reported yesterday as well as today the worst case scenario has not materialized cibc was not as bad as it could have been and with royal and td their businesses are actually in very good shape across the board capital levels are all very strong
8750396 the acquisition of postpath complements our strategy to develop an integrated collaboration platform designed for how we work today and into the future providing real productivity gains and a more satisfying user experience
8750397 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly
8750398 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8750399 a lot of the monthly indicators are suggesting recession but things like new orders and gdp suggest the economy is improving
8750400 if the us economy were growing at its potential pace the unemployment rate would not have risen a full percentage point over the past year
8750401 with economies abroad slowing and the one time impact of tax rebates dissipating we expect annualized economic growth to recede to near 1 0 percent in the third quarter and to maintain this pace into early 2009 before gradually improving
8750402 the better than expected outcome overall does not change our view that the economy is weakening with the beneficial effects of rebate checks and foreign demand fading fast
8750403 the turnout at the events continues to grow and the number of messages streaming in has been incredible
8750404 wiffiti allows the audience to stay actively involved in the discussion throughout the forums which puts our social media message into practice in a timely engaging way
8750405 the face of politics has changed dramatically throughout this election and emerging media technologies have clearly taken center stage
8750406 the outburst forum at the dnc gave us a chance to showcase wiffitis capabilities for sparking intense debates that extend far beyond the venue itself the forum panelists did an amazing job at propelling the digital conversation forward while still giving the audience control of the dialogue its so rewarding for us to see wiffiti used in this way
8750407 were fortunate to be involved in both the dnc and the rnc the democrats have gotten the majority of the buzz for employing emerging media in their campaigns so were proud to be opening up the social media dialogue to both parties
8750408 nuns are above all women and beauty is a gift from god
8750409 this contest will be a way to show there isnt just the beauty we see on television but also a more discrete charm

8750413 no creo que es un factor mental la falta de contundencia de los atacantes s lo es algo extra o que pasa en el futbol pienso que jugamos mejor en el primer tiempo aunque en el segundo marcamos dos goles
8750414 nada me sorprende me gusta el futbol ser criticado es as hay que tener paciencia gan el juego que es lo m s importante ante honduras durante los 90 minutos en muchos momentos jugamos buen futbol ahora va ser mejor y van a estar bastante contento
8750415 casi todos los juegos que giovani ha hecho con el tottenham lo hizo como delantero m s se que juega muy bien por el lado derecho no creo que haya problemas con l en el futuro va estar como centrodelantero cuando tenga m s experiencia

8750447 i would hope the canadians look into how to be more co ordinated on a worldwide level because what this documents is that medical isotope production is not unique to any specific country and should be viewed as a world resource
8750448 this is a cumulative situation where we cannot maintain a patchwork approach to isotope production and supply
8750449 we are concerned there is currently no reliable long term isotope supply solution to meet this growing demand

8750468 we believe that we should tell the europeans that its not a good agreement i think its the worst thing that could happen to us since slavery the nwu represents a large chunk of workers throughout jamaica and we believe that the epa will eventually affect the lives of the workers we represent and from this standpoint were strongly urging prime minister bruce golding not to sign the agreement let us go back to the negotiation table wit the europeans

8750471 category 5 hurricane when fendersplendor inc blew into town used to high profit margins and expensive distribution networks industry diehards where literally blindsided when fendersplendor cut the price of paint meters for car dealers in half
8750472 when i looked at the market for paint meters i realized that every new car dealer and used car dealer in america would want one if the price was more affordable after selling an existing gauge at a large discount i proved that the market was ready and decided to manufacture my own gauge we became the oem manufacturer of the fs 488 paint meter about 2 years ago and have dominated the market since then
8750473 first we cut the price in half then we developed an internet based direct sales model that cut the distribution cost see wholesale paint meters
8750474 we then decided to offer the industries first 3 year exchange warranty after selling several thousand fs 488s in the first 12 months we added an illuminated display so dealers could read the gauge more easily at night when customers commonly go to dealerships today over 5 000 car dealers rely on a fendersplendor fs 488 paint meter to make sure they dont miss hidden body damage on cars they are trading for or buying at auctions
8750475 we will continue to attack the industrial market with the fs 502 and have taken steps to make sure the fs 488 says in front of all competitors

8750625 odunsi puts forth a good argument and he seems to truly care about what he writes about i recommend this book highly and will definitely be reading the next chapters when they are published
8750626 the concepts presented in the book will open up a dialogue about how we look at our past present and future odunsi presents new ideas to chronic world problems in a very creative and imaginative way arguments presented are well worth debating and studying with the numerous current global crises taking place deep thinking the human condition is highly recommended to those concerned about why we are unable to solve world problems and why it is essential to change our approach when tackling major global plights

8750635 we created the il rts to provide todays solar cell structures with a simple cost effective alternative to low bow pastes and technologies
8750636 this revolutionary new tool is an industry first solution to the challenges associated with using wafers 200 and thinner in solar cell production
8750637 despatch industries introduces new in line rapid thermal shock tool
8750638 this is not a strip joint or gentlemans club this is a dance and fitness studio just like hundreds of others that have recently opened around the country including here in the pittsburgh area
8750639 just like itunes has forever changed the way we purchase and experience music tutor com is changing the way students get help with homework studying and the entire educational experience outside of the classroom
8750640 there are two palestinian governments one in gaza the other in the west bank hundreds of palestinians are rounded up on daily basis and theres a vicious blockade on the palestinians in gaza this is why we came to cairo
8750641 the americans are focussing mainly on the continuation of the process rather than on tackling the issues
8750642 im very happy because in the end israel had to bow to the will of the honourable people in the world and allow the ship to sail into gaza this is the first link in the collapse of the blockade
8750643 but at the same time im very bitter while some foreigners are risking their lives in order to help break the blockade others of our brother arabs and muslims are helping reinforce it
8750644 i cant begin to describe how much i respect the people who came to demonstrate their solidarity with us against the blockade
8750645 i want to express my personal gratitude to these people i feel they represent the living conscience of the world
8750646 the operation that could have saved my brothers life is very simple but it could not be performed in gaza because the hospitals lack the necessary equipment he died leaving five children because the rafah border crossing is closed
8750647 popular forces in the arab world must act before it is too late this is not just for the palestinians but to force their own regimes into respecting the will of the people
8750648 given the electronic war underwater mines and the threats of the israeli occupation it was a bold and courageous step towards breaking the siege on gaza the arrival of the foreign activists has sent a message to the world that says the blockade must end their action has stirred the stagnant water and drawn international attention to the sufferings of the palestinian people in gaza
8750649 your presence in al shati which is one of the eight palestinian refugee camps in gaza is a victory of humanitarian will and the desire for truth your determination in making this voyage has given a boost to palestinian morale and to the steadfastness of the resistance against occupation and the blockade
8750650 it is the simplest possible step they could take in fulfilment of their national religious and humanitarian duty
8750651 one look at the situation in gaza is sufficient to realise that these people are the victims of a humanitarian disaster it is wrong to remain silent in the face of crimes that are being committed against a people solely because they exercised their inherent right to elect the person they thought most appropriate
8750652 those who describe themselves as israeli peace activists realise that the rejection of the palestinian right to return is one of the pillars of zionist unanimity and they did not want to undermine that unanimity
8750653 they wanted to butt their heads against a wall so we decided to remove the wall
8750654 the court may not proceed with a request for surrender or assistance which would require the requested state to act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the state or diplomatic immunity of a person or property of a third state unless the court can first obtain the cooperation of that third state for the waiver of the immunity
8750655 which have rapidly become much more expensive over recent months
8750656 the study has shown for the first time that metabolic response to brain tumor treatment can be detected earlier and faster by metabolic imaging instead of through structural imaging or assessment of the neurological status of a patient
8750657 frequent use of this type of imaging may be a useful tool to follow a patients response to chemotherapy for malignant brain tumors
8750658 it gives us the ability to identify treatment failure early and more time to alter a patients treatment plan before the disease progresses
8750659 the resistance to this in the scientific community is enormous
8750660 for the first time we have a student who is using linguistic tools that have normally been applied to humans now being applied to non humans this is a move toward using the kinds of methodology that are appropriate in ape language based on 1993 monograph language comprehension in ape and child
8750661 this is a long term project starting from the beginning of where we have data
8750662 all of this is contextualized with our current research and larger programs such as forgiveness research the students are looking at the earlier data while investigators are looking at new data
8750663 this paper serves as an investigation into the early ontogeny of these kinds of competencies
8750664 these papers will eventually be assembled in a larger volume to look at issues in the development of forgiveness and other cultural dimensions of the apes lives
8750665 she was using language to get at what she wanted
8750666 she is very very clever and is fully capable of following the conversation the same way a human does this tells me that panbanishas knowledge of language is far beyond understanding the words to understanding how to use them in a conversation to get what she wants
8750667 one of the things janni has affirmed and affirmed in a way the lay person can understand is the aspect of turn taking if there is anything universal in human language its turn of talk
8750668 the fact that panbanisha has done this and its accessible even to an untrained reviewer i think is an important aspect of her paper she has looked at the whole social action and the meaning ideational flow going back and forth is obvious
8750669 originally repetition was thought of something that happens normally in human language
8750670 traditionally repetition in ape communicative behaviors is assumed to be proof that they dont have language its a kind of dichotomy or unfairness
8750671 hers will be the first ph d produced in ape language since the research moved to iowa
8750672 these bowl shaped depressions reflect the former location of relatively pure glacier ice
8750673 this late stage snow could accumulate in depressions on the crater wall and in favorable microclimate settings melt to produce the observed gullies and fans
8750674 are exciting because they establish a spatial link between recent gullies and accumulation of glacier ice strengthening the case for surface melt water flow in the formation of gullies on mars
8750675 we want to know how the brain areas that encode memory are organized
8750676 if your memory is affected by aging or alzheimers disease is there a way to learn that can capitalize on the brain structures that may still be working well
8750677 weve done britneys sets and a whole bunch of rock shows but this was far more elaborate and complicated and we had to do it in far less time
8750678 the biggest challenge has been making sure we dont damage the playing field underneath
8750679 it almost feels like a zombie at this point its the walking dead its such an abrupt end to what was e3 which had been this huge escalating arms race i understand why they really pulled the plug on the big e3 looking at the amount of money a company like ea would spend on it it was ridiculous amounts of money just to be present and competitive with everyone else so i think they were looking for a way to sign the arms treaty and de escalate the whole thing
8750680 we want calm to be stabilised in and around gaza and we hope it will not take very long before we see the release of shalit
8750681 we wish to see a breakthrough before the end of the year but i dont feel confident about such prospects and i dont see an agreement emerging out of the current negotiations
8750682 work will continue day and night so that the hall becomes ready for meetings before president mubarak delivers his annual speech at the opening of parliament in november
8750683 this is an encouraging sign that the restoration of the hall will be complete within two months
8750684 the alarms went off when the fire broke out on 19 august but such was the size of the blaze they had little effect
8750685 will have full access to reports made by the prosecutor general and criminal laboratories and will be able to call officials and parliamentarians for questioning
8750686 examinations will test their knowledge on a variety of subjects and not necessarily related to the discipline they teach
8750687 which implies that the government is not serious about increasing their salaries
8750688 some of the teachers who will be tested have been in the profession for over 30 years they taught the minister of education himself why after 30 years of teaching are they being tested now
8750689 this is an insult to teachers why dont they do this for all professions why just teachers
8750690 basic education will be elevated by applying national educational standards and school focussed comprehensive reform
8750691 the minister insists on the exam and there will be no other alternative this is for the welfare of students and teachers
8750692 this is not just about minimum wage it is about a policy which will eventually end up humiliating teachers and ending their career forever
8750693 so that correct answers can be altered and the numbers passing the exam controlled on what basis are we going to be tested
8750694 egypt is in trouble because its education is in trouble we call for the resignation of the syndicates leaders and the creation of a popular syndicate which will defend teachers rights rather than adopting government causes
8750695 the cadre is to establish the principle of reward and punishment to raise salaries of teachers benefiting about one million teachers against financial costs of about le4 billion
8750696 it isnt just teachers who prop up the education system there are huge numbers of administrative staff who play a vital role
8750697 we were told that our wages would be increased under the civil service law issued in 2007
8750698 they initially promised us a 50 per cent increase over three years
8750699 this promise was subsequently retracted because the finance minister claimed we receive more than our due in the form of examinations bonuses
8750700 it is incorrect to call this payment a bonus administrative employees who are absent from work due to sickness do not receive it it is therefore more accurate to describe it as a payment given in return for duties performed
8750701 nobody will give us anything unless we voice our legitimate demands for our rights after 36 years in this profession i earn le600 per month some administrative employees earn only le150 per month and take bribes just to survive
8750702 the new system has been created to increase the availability and to promote the quality of basic education and school teachers quality
8750703 i have no doubt the israeli government has the will and desire to destroy the aqsa mosque they only want to do it in a way that would make the demolition look as if it was a result of natural causes
8750704 everything they do here shows they are hell bent on destroying this islamic shrine it is time that muslim peoples muslim governments and muslim organisations across the world move to stop this blasphemy maybe tomorrow it will be too late
8750705 this sensitive issue could set the whole region on fire
8750706 the decision to build a synagogue in this particular spot shows that israel is interested in stoking the fire of religious tension
8750707 clearly israel is interested in neither peace nor co existence
8750708 growing persecution by the israeli state of its arab citizens
8750709 seriously infringes the freedom of speech and freedom of religion of the entire arab minority in israel
8750710 amazing wonders of the world kingdom of the west yellowstone yosemite amp glacier national parks
8750711 the important thing is not to win but to take part
8750712 it is perhaps one of solimans minor eccentricities to insist upon his debt to cairos foreign communities the jews in particular who according to him guided his first steps towards eminence without their attentive patronage says soliman he would never have become a known painter overnight when he was barely in his twenties
8750713 rarely did hassan soliman draw a specifically egyptian scene but his work was very much egyptian in its equanimity like the ancient egyptian reliefs carved on the walls of temples
8750714 i like to come here during the afternoons between shifts at the mechanics workshop where i work it is nice peaceful and quiet and there are enough interesting books the most important thing is that it is free i dont have the money even for a small subscription
8750715 from the pharaonic to the graeco roman egyptian history is very well covered here by some very impressive titles there are even some rare titles and the original catalogues of the countrys most important museums
8750716 we even have some of the records of the earliest sessions of the egyptian parliament here and we have a good part of the private library of ahmed lotfy al sayed that we share with the governorate public library
8750717 i found some titles on comparative urdu and arabic literary criticism that i would not have thought it was possible to find outside the capital
8750718 i found nothing that i wanted to read i did walk along the corniche but the same books are on offer in each place
8750719 this is not what i want to read about and i dont understand why they all have to offer the same collection of books what use it is for me to see the volumes of a book on the description of egypt i want to learn about the new economy and to read self help books and modern philosophy titles not the history of egyptian cinema or the books of abbas al akkad
8750720 when i go to the diwan or koutob khan fashionable cairo bookstore cafes i find interesting modern titles that i do not find here these expensive titles should be purchased and offered to readers at the public libraries but instead these libraries do not seem to be acquiring the newest publications
8750721 the highest turnover on any day of the year whether summer or winter is 50 people
8750722 i am not interested in reading and i dont want to go through all those books to see if there is something in them that i would like to read about
8750723 the issue is not about the display or the collection of books rather it is about the fact that despite the many efforts that have been made to promote reading most people are not interested in it people come to the library to meet and not to read it is almost a meeting place for young couples who come here under the cover of reading
8750724 i mostly come to join the drawing lessons and to play with plasticine but sometimes i pick up a book to read
8750725 i was not always a dedicated reader it was only three years ago when my mother asked me to clean the bookshelves of my late father that i got into the world of books
8750726 now i spend at least four hours reading every day
8750727 do you think that american diplomats should be operating the way they have in the past working with the palestinian government if hamas is now in charge
8750728 theyre the government sooner or later we are going to have to deal with them one way or another and i understand why this administration and previous administrations had such antipathy towards hamas because of their dedication to violence and the things that they not only espouse but practice so but its a new reality in the middle east i think the lesson is people want security and a decent life and decent future that they want democracy fatah was not giving them that
8750729 i think its very clear who hamas wants to be the next president of the united states so apparently has danny ortega and several others i think that people should understand that i will be hamass worst nightmare if senator obama is favored by hamas i think people can make judgments accordingly
8750730 we want to take senator mccain at his word that he wants to run a respectful campaign but it is becoming increasingly difficult when he continually tries to use the politics of association and makes claims he knows not to be true to advance his campaign this type of politics of division and distraction not only lead to a campaign not worthy of the american people but also has failed to help our families for too long
8750731 senator obama has repeatedly rejected and denounced the actions of hamas a terrorist organization responsible for the deaths of many innocents that is dedicated to israels destruction as president obama will work with israel to isolate terrorist groups like hamas target their resources and support israels right and capability to defend itself from any attack
8750732 this is a legitimate issue for the american people to think about
8750733 it is not only responsible to raise these critical issues in this election but it would be the height of irresponsibility not to have this discussion with the american people
8750734 only the usa and china consume more oil than california
8750735 do not violate in any form the strategic balance of power in the region
8750736 there is an agreement between the two sides that there will be no foreign soldiers in iraq after 2011
8750737 any decisions on troops will be based on the conditions on the ground in iraq that has always been our position it continues to be our position
8750738 there is no agreement until theres an agreement signed there are discussions that continue in baghdad
8750739 american forces would be only granted immunity inside their military camps and outposts not on iraqi soil
8750740 parliament must approve any deal and ensure it contains no secret appendices
8750741 many shia leaders think the iraqi forces are now able to crack down on any terrorist organisation be it the mahdi army militias or the cells of al qaeda without the assistance of foreign forces
8750742 some segments within the awakenings are being increasingly infiltrated by baathists and al qaeda operatives they must be challenged forcefully
8750743 has embarked on what appears to be an effort to arrest drive away or otherwise intimidate tens of thousands of sunni security volunteers
8750744 we joined the government in all sincerity but unfortunately when written documents are repeatedly flouted trust cannot remain we cannot find a ray of hope
8750745 si reclamas ahora tendr s que hacer lo mismo el mes que viene porque tambi n te lo vamos a cobrar as que espera y te evitas un tr mite
8750746 occidente corriendo desbocado a lomos de la tecnolog a sin saber exactamente hacia d nde se dirige
8750747 no hace nada que no se produzca de forma natural en el universo
8750748 cuando reflexionemos sobre nuestro siglo xx no nos parecer n lo m s grave las fechor as de los malvados sino el escandaloso silencio de las buenas personas
8750749 how do you authenticate the legitimacy the integrity of the consultation process is an issue what happens after this charade is over
8750750 in national life in political life process is just as important as the outcome
8750751 i understand that the constitution should be a living and breathing document which could be modified or changed if there is an emerging consensus to do so it is not cast in stone
8750752 the drafters of our constitution alluded to this possibility that in time some aspects may need to be re examined
8750753 it would be fool hardy not to modify or amend the constitution if there is an emerging consensus that some aspects of it need to be modified changed or amended
8750754 ill do it but what i really want to do is fuck
8750755 pulling him and pushing him keep doing it telling people this is a sad moment and look hes not doing it
8750756 he goes i dont want to do it i dont want to do it
8750757 he kept pressuring him make him do the knife thing pulling him trying to get his t shirt off pulling and pushing him he was saying just do it just do it
8750758 swung it once or twice and said i dont want to do it any more
8750759 it was an emotional time and the children were happy they asked for it no one forced anyone
8750760 if id known this would be the result of breaking the law i would never have done it
8750761 i will represent all lawyers my programme will serve every lawyer and my ambitions are those of all lawyers
8750762 taking such a step now would anger the 17 remaining chairmanship candidates
8750763 according to the law the nine cement companies have the right to appeal so cemex company intends to do just that as soon as possible
8750764 the verdict is expected to have a positive impact on all market dealers in different sectors
8750765 the fine is not high enough even though it is the highest it can it may be because of this that the government amended the law and raised the fine ceiling to le300 million
8750766 the government is currently selling the stones used in producing the cement at the very low price of le1 2 per metre which is unfair
8750767 the believer is not stung twice from the same hole
8750768 i see him growing up having a job and marrying
8750769 its his right to have a family and children of his own
8750770 i sent a question to the mufti ali gomaa and two months later i received the response
8750771 so the question related to a natural extension of the needs of the mentally handicapped many of whom want to get married after all its a natural instinct
8750772 he is a gift from god a part of the family
8750773 you feel a darkness surround you as if there is no way out forgetting that there is a god who takes care of his worshippers
8750774 he is like any teenager he hogs the mirror spends a lot of time choosing his clothes and has an eye for pretty ladies
8750775 we treat him as we do his brothers as normally as possible
8750776 control i have to keep an eye on him all the time
8750777 as he gets older his mind develops more and more so by the time he is in his 20s i am sure he will be more than able to marry
8750778 the problem here in egypt is the lack of awareness and regulations to assist handicapped people
8750779 there are still people who believe that having a mentally challenged child is a divine punishment
8750780 the public still do not know how to treat this segment of society so how can we expect them to marry
8750781 parents used to be ashamed of their children hiding them and refusing to believe in their potential
8750782 i am not personally in favour of their marrying however there is a fatwa that allows it
8750783 since there is a guardian for every handicapped individual can this guardian divorce him from his spouse without his consent
8750784 one cannot be a total invalid and marry or else that means he she is closer to being a patient than a spouse
8750785 only a judge can divorce a man from his wife
8750786 so if one is busy or corrupt the others are there to protect him
8750787 here the rights of the handicapped are not upheld by the government
8750788 we have laws that supposedly protect them but nobody implements them
8750789 these children are angels that serve on earth instead of the heavens and as they grow they also need love
8750790 i want him to either marry someone of the same iq or a healthy woman
8750791 i have seen it work out before with older couples but either way the marriage needs to be based on love and not pity
8750792 there need to be regulations on marriage to ensure it works in the best interest of the handicapped individual and is not just being used to protect the parents inheritance or to ensure the continuation of lineage
8750793 building or renovating a cultural palace is a cultural movement and a creation of a persistence liaison between the palace and the people
8750794 helps in achieving the ministrys two main objectives preserving egypts national identity and intellectualising the minds of citizens who are the cornerstone of any future development plans drawn up by the government
8750795 but with a little twist due to the development of time
8750796 it is impossible to continue offering the same services for more than 50 years
8750797 to help build cultural bridges with civil society especially those dealing with people with special needs
8750798 and if any structure needs modification in its architectural design the gocp is more than willing to do it but the rapidity of such work will depend according to the budget
8750799 protecting the life of a citizen is much more important than cultivating his mind
8750800 i am certain the gocp has a high calibre of employees but not all are in the right place
8750801 it was as if the blaze was fuelled by the very anger in peoples bosoms
8750802 too bad i wish they were inside burning like hell
8750803 youth suffer from a pervasive sense of alienation no one in his right mind would be ecstatic if his house burns down but if it is his enemys house that burnt down thats another matter altogether
8750804 youths suffer from a sense of alienation they do not feel they belong it was different in our day we graduated from university knowing we would find a job that suited our temperament today students graduate knowing they can only find a job if they have connections nepotism works for the wealthy and the well connected
8750805 in some ways the picture is rather depressing with a constant recourse to repressed rage
8750806 the very notion of the nation as protector and provider is no longer taken for granted young people want to immigrate and find better employment opportunities overseas we live in an age of globalisation but these angry young men do not benefit from globalisation what they see all around them is social polarisation unfairness injustice and joblessness those who have money dont work and those who work do not have money
8750807 it is all the making of the satellite channels that sensationalise the entire egyptians cannot fathom how these satellite channels can spew such nonesense it is all peposterous
8750808 this is akin to the vengeful outbursts of frustrated children writer mohamed el kerdousi wrote a somewhat offensive article in the independent daily al masry al yom berating the fact that the building was not set ablaze while mps were in session that means that he wished me dead
8750809 people had an instinctive sense of the historical importance of a place they had an innate affiliation with historical buildings buildings represented ideals and aspirations in the collective national psyche perhaps today they do not convey the same meaning to the younger generation
8750810 in this context gloating is an act of rebellion of passive defiance
8750811 these buildings were erected at a particular historical juncture distinguished by the education of girls as a means of emancipating women the foundation of institutions of higher learning the construction of railways and the mushrooming of theatres and newspapers the relationship between the rulers and the inhabitants of the land was no longer that of ruler and his subjects but rather between representative legislature and egyptian citizens
8750812 yes there is a widespread feeling of frustration there are genuine grievances there is a despondency that is engendered by the fact that youth realise that they can bring about little or no change there is a strong sense that the country is suffering from a process of fossilisation there is a hardening of feelings
8750813 there are about six million of them and they have no stake in the system in spite of the fact that their parents are government employees they have no faith in the future and inflation is hitting this segment of society the hardest moreover they are acutely conscious of social differentiations they are aware of the growing gap between rich and poor they understand that there is little or no chance of social mobility
8750814 people are betting on destruction this is the real interpretation of the general feeling of utter frustration and despondency the blockage of all social and political channels is calamitous there is widespread belief that tomorrow can only be worse
8750815 he is a son of a bitch but he is our son of a bitch
8750816 liberty all liberty for the people but no liberty for the enemies of the people
8750817 these are difficult decisions to make difficult decisions that we dont want to make
8750818 that being said weve spent the last two months working with agencies to ensure that theyre going to maintain their core services
8750819 the governors actions will put abused and neglected children at greater risk reduce access to medicaid and food stamps and further harm state parks and historic sites
8750820 were continuing to work with the agencies on management plans for further savings
8750821 its going to be devastating to local communities that depend on these sites for tourist revenue
8750822 the other 300 parks natural areas wildlife areas will remain unaffected
8750823 we have come to the end of 16 days which we will cherish forever
8750824 new stars were born and stars from previous games continued to amaze us
8750825 we shared their joys and their tears and marvelled at their abilities and will long remember their achievements here
8750826 the past 16 days have witnessed superb athletic performances and sportsmanship
8750827 let us pay tribute to all those who have participated in the games
8750828 the world is today in need of mutual understanding inclusiveness cooperation and harmonious development
8750829 the olympic flame atop the national stadium will soon extinguish and yet the chinese peoples enthusiasm in embracing the world will be ablaze forever
8750830 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
8750831 and so we believe the games had a good influence
8750832 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
8750833 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
8750834 we started the very first week of july with our auditions and weve been going three nights a week since then and all week for this week
8750835 because of the extensive and detailed nature of judge millers ruling the university is optimistic that the court of appeal will very quickly clear the way for construction to begin
8750836 we are eager to see the legal questions in this case resolved by the appellate court because the lower courts opinion created some serious questions marks we are obligated to take this case to the higher court for resolution
8750837 our case is fundamentally sound and we are confident that the court of appeal will reverse the lower courts position
8750838 this national award caps a long list of planning accolades the centre city plan has received since being unanimously endorsed by city council
8750839 the plan addresses many new services buildings and public spaces that will be required to successfully accommodate up to 40 000 new residents and over 60 000 new employees by 2035
8750840 i think its exciting and i cant wait to get there because i was a flood victim here so i know what its like to lose your home
8750841 during the assignment its going to be long hours like i told everybody before you might be up at 5 a m
8750842 homeless people people thats lost or losing all of their belongings anxiety you know everything
8750843 they already went through this three years ago and theyll have to relive the nightmares again
8750844 theyll be gone for fifteen days at least and maybe longer if they chose to stay longer
8750845 we have the ability in congress to change all that and start producing the energy we have
8750846 we need to produce in an environmentally sound way the energy we have
8750847 dici che noi russi siamo stati bravi alle olimpiadi non so non ho seguito i giochi ero troppo distratto da questa guerra nel caucaso proprio non riuscivo a concentrarmi su
8750848 la russia dovr reagire e non solo sul piano diplomatico
8750849 se preferiscono sostenere il regime fallimentare di saakashvili piuttosto che lapartnership con la russia non sar colpa nostra e la nato ad aver pi bisogno della russia e non il contrario soprattutto in afghanistan

8750855 defensive pressure on the line was the biggest thing then with the secondary weve got weve just got quickness speed talent its all back there
8750856 we want to lead the big sky conference in turnovers
8750857 defensively as long as they fly around theyre good if they slow down then theyre not good so theyve got to continue to fly around and make plays
8750858 were confident that if one of the ones go down then the twos and threes can step up and we wont skip a beat
8750859 well take stopping you four out of five any day
8750860 when you get down in the red zone and get challenged thats when youve got to be tough
8750861 weve got a good group of guys who are working hard
8750862 that way you can have the young guy follow the leader
8750863 were also learning where the quarterbacks like to throw the ball so we can get there
8750864 youre running them to death and thats not good because youre getting their legs too tired
8750865 you work out all summer to try and stay in shape but when it comes you still have a lot of in shape to get and were trying to get ready for the season so we can run all day
8750866 the first week you want to make sure your sound on the red zone sound on third down
8750867 on defense we need to get the packages down and make sure the guys understand the base of the defense and their responsibilities so they dont get beat
8750868 he was our best leader on the offensive side last year
8750869 he has always had a positive outlook on things and he is very consistent with his work ethic he is dependable and unselfish
8750870 hale has always worked hard and he is extremely tough
8750871 he is strong fast and he plays very smart he is a great all around football player
8750872 he is an electrifying player and is very valuable to our team
8750873 the guy never turns the ball over and every time he touches the ball there is a chance that he is going to make a big play
8750874 hes like the old timex watches he takes a lickin but keeps on tickin
8750875 there is not a more respected player on the team who has battled through adversity very much like kevin lapa
8750876 he has been granted a sixth year by the ncaa because of a medical hardship we are very happy and very lucky to have him back
8750877 the event has come along way since i received my letterman jacket in 88 the event used to be at the sky room and only the players who were receiving jackets attended with the coaches close to 250 people attended the event this year including players family members and other supporters of wildcat football i thought it was great to have some former players in attendance thanks to bob croyle troy juergens reid leland phil sotomayer dave stireman john thompson john knight ron mccall and patrick fife for your support as well as everyone else who worked to make this event possible
8750878 i thought here we go and went and took the call in the back room
8750879 they said theyre in the rebuilding process and asked if i could bring my nasty demeanor to baltimore and if i was ready to work
8750880 the ravens want some tough guys and thats why they like dave because hes a tough competitive guy
8750881 its a great route for him and hes totally prepared im so happy for him i couldnt be happier or think of a person more deserving than him
8750882 i had all these messages like hey where are you were drafting your boy where are you were drafting your boy dont you care
8750883 paul and pat kicked open some doors thats for sure
8750884 i dont think i would have been drafted if they didnt go before me
8750885 they were getting their nerves out by making food just pushing out dish after dish
8750886 i saw it the whole way so i just went up and made a play
8750887 i didnt want them to score or else theyd be talking crap all day
8750888 theyre competing against each other and its all in good fun but thats what you want to hear that guys want to make plays
8750889 there were situations where you could get the game going
8750890 there were third and 1s and they turned the ball over a couple of times
8750891 i think everyone had the first spring game jitters so it took us a while to bet back into the grove
8750892 we have to be more efficient and we have to have more players step up and show that they can play on saturday
8750893 maybe it was the nice sunny warm day for a change but both sides of the ball made significant improvement from last weeks scrimmage
8750894 red zone offense has been really good and pass protection has improved
8750895 he made the defense miss on several occasions and had a couple of nice pass receptions off of screens which he turned into big plays thats the performance weve been looking for since he came to us last fall
8750896 both cameron higgins and brendon doyle have the speed and quickness to avoid trouble
8750897 our defense has got better but we still need to get mentally and physically tougher in the red zone
8750898 run defense has been very good and there has been improvement in zone coverage
8750899 the interception by thyrell was big time play and we forced a couple of fumbles we need the defense to create more turnovers and this afternoon was a step in the right direction
8750900 hes obviously a big time running back and he was special today he didnt have a good scrimmage last week but he played like hes shown in practice
8750901 its good for the offense to get that confidence and for everyone to step up
8750902 when someone sees someone else make a good play then they want to make one too
8750903 weve got a lot of threats on the offensive side of the ball
8750904 weve got receivers who can run weve got running backs who can run weve got a good offensive line and the quarterbacks are both very good
8750905 our defense got better but we still need to get mentally and physically tougher in the red zone
8750906 the interception by thyrell was big time play and we forced a couple of fumbles we need the defense to create more turnovers and this afternoon was a step in the right direction
8750907 weber state has a good group in place and we still have some other good kids coming in
8750908 once we get everybody healthy and out on the field i think its going to be a real solid group
8750909 its the offensive line a good mixture of experienced older guys and good talented younger guys paul carpenter lawaia naihe kyle mutcher and cameron molifua have all played quite a bit and when we get travis harris and jared wilcox back from their injuries we will have some more experienced guys
8750910 i think the future is bright here at weber state in the offensive line category
8750911 you put the older guys in a niche with all those good young guys like alex tupulua caleb turner and j c oram and youve got a working offense
8750912 weve got good quarterbacks good receivers and good running backs there is no reason why this offense shouldnt put a lot of points on the board every week
8750913 we are extremely pleased and proud to receive this commitment from the judd hill foundation
8750914 this financial commitment will go a long way toward helping an already solid foundation in the reynolds center
8750915 he kind of reminded me a lot of russell westbrook an nba lottery pick in june he can play both on the ball and off the ball in the

8750971 there isnt a republican serving in the senate thats happy hes the nominee now theyre all supporting him but ill tell you they have told me ive had republican senators tell me they dont think theyll vote for him
8750972 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine
8750973 he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
8750974 when i began researching the alternative health space on the web i was amazed to see the lack of quality information portals
8750975 like many people i am passionate about alternative health and medicine but found no modern reliable websites with current news or information that helped me research homeopathic remedies or get the latest information i need on a regular basis since webmd doesnt provide the timely articles or information about alternative health solutions i wanted we decided to create the worlds first web 2 0 alternative health community
8750976 we want to give people the opportunity to learn about alternative health solutions instead of relying solely on western medicine or drugs
8750977 health is personal people go online to search for health information thats particular to whatever is ailing them so we also wanted to give people the opportunity to share their health stories whether its in a video article essay natural cure or in our forums
8750978 the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when i was eight years old somehow reflects on me and my values doesnt make much sense george
8750979 senator obama is appalled by this disrespect of a flag we love and that so many have fought and died for there is no excuse for anyone to treat that which we hold so dear with so little regard but the politics of association required to link obama to this picture in any way is ridiculous and a silly distraction from the important challenges facing the american people
8750980 wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears
8750981 hes currently scheduled to spend a solid two hour block from 9 00 to 11 00 p m pushing lies distortions and manipulations about barack and university of illinois professor william ayers
8750982 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8750983 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves
8750984 at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8750985 it is a waste we dont need to be playing these games obviously you see in the league that guys are getting hurt you dont need to play obviously with us having a long season last year going to the super bowl playing more games in the preseason and having a risk of injuries is not smart

8751031 are the punishments too harsh for students who break school uniform policies
8751032 i agree with the uniform policy i think its the best thing that pitt county schools has done so far parents had all summer long to get what their child needed for the school year also the guidelines were put out early enough for the parents to follow it was not a hard rule to follow unless you already have trouble following directions
8751033 one disturbing aspect of uniforms is students are told certain colors are
8751034 the big issue is teaching parents and students to follow rules we all do it in one way or another it isnt painful illegal or immoral and it doesnt cost any more to purchase attire that conforms to the rules than ones that dont

8751077 the announcement worries us because negotiations should have been finished a while ago
8751078 rather than being negotiated in an amicable way because it influences venezuelas country risk to a certain degree
8751079 for the sake of the presidents image and the countrys image
8751080 we are seeing a switch in the administrations policy that worries many sectors in the country
8751081 because we know that the government has played a dirty trick from a financial perspective and has implemented strategies that harm workers interests
8751082 we are afraid that president ch vez is going to say one thing and do another so were hoping that argentine president cristina fern ndez de kirchners administration makes them withdraw the decision he made
8751083 because a lot of the time the government makes announcements but nothing happens maybe its part of the negotiation process to create pressure we just dont know
8751084 we have to take over all of the companies they hold here and they can leave the country

8751089 i like just going out and doing my job completing my assignments
8751090 im used to it people mispronounce my name all the time
8751091 theyll get the name said right if i continue to make plays
8751092 even in high school ive always been a guy thats loved proving myself
8751093 it always feels better when you earn your playing time
8751094 i learned to enjoy the role of pushing people ahead of me to get better
8751095 if they dont get better then i usually overtake them
8751096 i had a lot knocks on my size but i say you cant measure heart
8751097 so i go out there every play with a chip on my shoulder and just try to beat the person thats across from me
8751098 i saw woodyard did a heck of a job jumping in once the lights went on
8751099 i feel real good but im a type of guy that has to get better week in and week out im trying to continue to prove myself on the field

8751103 i can be a tad difficult to work for im loud pushy and while i used to think we paid well i am no longer sure
8751104 i made a commitment to stay in the job for at least a year
8751105 i met the oldest child but not the others which my mother said was crazy to accept the job without meeting all the kids so well see
8751106 if you are fundamentally unhappy with your life you will be more unhappy if you take this job so do us all a favor and get some treatment or move to the rockies but do not apply for employment with us
8751107 also if you suspect all wealthy women are frivolous we are not for you
8751108 i have all sorts of theories on how to stack my dishwasher and if you are judgmental about ritalin for adhd or think such things are caused by too much sugar again deal break city
8751109 our committee takes these reported allegations seriously and we plan to thoroughly review this matter
8751110 if you do satire or parody you have to expect there will always be fools who will take it literally
8751111 how can anyone marry a person like that without looking to divorce them at the earliest opportunity
8751112 dude those two guys spend so much time together they are having quite the bromance
8751113 streep is sensationally good in rendering the whole yarn credible and in making dramatically moving songs such as slipping through my fingers sung to her departing daughter and the winner takes it all to a lost love its no stretch to think of her performance in oscar terms ranking with previous musical winners such as liza minnelli barbra streisand and catherine zeta jones

8751117 personal income and consumer sentiment may set the tone for trading on friday on wall headed into a long holiday weekend
8751118 hes just a pretty good actor who did away with himself and broke the hearts of his family and friends and he shouldnt get an academy award to memorialize his death each year more than 100 000 americans die of alcohol or drug abuse it would be madness to commemorate one such death with the greatest honor in cinema please give the academy award to someone whos had the courage to stick around
8751119 well i guess that means the academy endorses the drugging and sexual exploitation of 13 year olds
8751120 i guess that means the academy thought polanskis work merited an oscar
8751121 all that anyone working on the movie want ed to talk about
8751122 to lucas i say this wanna watch me make this pencil disappear
8751123 hey lets give this award to this dude who either may had been a total pussy and offed himself or he was an pill popper who had a few too many
8751124 if he doesnt win id like to see the performance that does
8751125 id think the same thing if he had punched my mother in the face

8751138 it was a honeymoon wedding with our family and friends so its sort of a double whammy
8751139 were in the process now of contacting the credit card company and finding out what type of insurance we have through visa
8751140 what im thinking right now is that were not going to be able to recoup our money and our wedding in scotland is going to be cancelled
8751141 the reason for going to scotland is that my fianc es grandparents are living there
8751142 we were going to see them because theyre unable to fly over here due to insurance theyre an elderly couple
8751143 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the u s specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8751144 they needed a short victorious war and if it didnt work out they could always put the blame on us make us look like the enemy and against the background of this surge of patriotism once more rally the country around a particular political force
8751145 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8751146 they were acting in implementing orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8751147 i dont think anyone should be looking for a new cold war
8751148 what we would like to see is the return to the status quo before aug 7th and the hostilities began before russia invaded georgia before the disproportional response to the regular flare ups that happen in the summertime out in that area
8751149 sodomy is a gross perversion and a stench in the nostrils of god

8751151 unless i am convicted by scripture and plain reason and i do not accept the authority of popes and councils for they have contradicted each other my conscience is held captive to the word of god
8751152 it was a sad success a success in that i have page after page after page of people who have called
8751153 only about 500 of them when i first checked had bothered to file for a franchise fee refund for the city of topeka that means theres a gap of over 6 000 people
8751154 i dont know about four days maybe two to three but four days is a lot
8751155 the delegates are having fun too this is almost kind of like a vacation for them
8751156 im looking for someone thats going to tell me then show me
8751157 probably at that point well be able to have an understanding on what each presidential candidate wants to do
8751158 they will make the decision at the last moment and sometimes unfortunately we think its a little like that
8751159 i think his proposals to improve the country are more positive and im not a big war believer
8751160 differences over religion cannot be blamed for these crimes we are distressed at the defiance of law and order by hindu fundamentalist leaders and their public comments which are spreading lies and hate their unpardonable excuse is that followers are uncontrollably angry about christian conversions in the region
8751161 we are also deeply troubled by the state and central governments inadequate response the fact that identical attacks happened in the same area exactly nine months ago is unbelievable what will convince authorities to protect human rights and enforce constitutional guarantees
8751162 we apprised him of the situation and requested emergency deployment of the army compensation for the victims rebuilding of houses and churches construction of relief camps and restoration of the rule of law
8751163 it would seem that there are times artistic choices are simply inappropriate but at others rules need to be broken in order to help society reflect upon itself
8751164 theres always been an energy behind it which still comes through whether or not the tattoos worked and thats more important
8751165 it dawned on me i had arrived as the previous train was leaving i hadnt just seen a dead man i had more than likely watched a man die
8751166 imagination is what inspires me to keep on acting the fact that this is a job that allows you to be imaginative and dream a bit with other people its a very precious thing to have
8751167 its about being a better system and obama and biden will do this

8751175 russian is moving forward altering the post soviet 1991 borders with unpredictable results
8751176 there is no place in todays world for attempts to redraw boundaries of our international order unless confronted by the international community russian policies will eventually force another conflict elsewhere
8751177 a unilateral attempt to redraw the borders of a neighboring country through the use of force
8751178 the work of the platform committee makes clear in no uncertain terms that the republican party is the pro life party

8751191 de acordo com t nelson a maior influ ncia do neologismo hipertexto veio do vocabul rio das matem ticas em que o prefixo hiper significa estendido e generalizado

8751201 theres a theme that recurs in your books and your speeches both about putting country first but also about honor i wonder if you could define read it in my books ive read your books but honor in politics i defined it in five books read my books your campaign today is more disciplined more traditional more aggressive from your point of view why the change i will do as much as we possibly can do to provide as much access to the press as possible but beyond the press sir just in terms of i think were running a fine campaign and this is where we are do you miss the old way of doing it i dont know what youre talking about really come on senator ill provide as much access as possible in 2000 after the primaries you went back to south carolina to talk about what you felt was a mistake you had made on the confederate flag is there anything so far about this campaign that you wish you could take back or you might revisit when its over do i know you says with a laugh long pause im very happy with the way our campaign has been conducted and i am very pleased and humbled to have the nomination of the republican party
8751202 ive been working to show canadians who believe in personal and economic freedom that the harper and the conservatives do not share their core beliefs said young
8751203 i cant think of a better way to do that than to take the libertarian party message directly to the constituents of calgary southwest
8751204 harper won by convincing the constituents of calgary southwest that he believes in small government and fiscal responsibility
8751205 when calgarians are presented with facts to the contrary and when they are presented with a clear alternative to the biggest spending government in canadian history i think voters will rethink their loyalty
8751206 calgary southwest voters punished the conservatives in the past for abandoning the principles of limited government and constitutional equality they took a chance on the reform party and stephen harper how its harper whos the out of touch ottawa insider and who has to answer my questions about why he saw fit to expand the size of government when he took over from the liberals i dont think his excuses are going work any better than mulroneys
8751207 our message is that the libertarian party trusts adult canadians with their own freedom and choices we believe in the basic decency and common sense of average citizens and think they can be trusted to manage their own affairs and make their own choices without the interference of government
8751208 people will make bad choices from time to time but thats all part of what it means to be truly free we need laws to protect people from the aggressive acts of others not laws that protect people from themselves
8751209 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
8751210 the party is called secret faggot i have to go just to confirm this

8751213 illness and medical bills caused half of the 1 458 000 personal bankruptcies in 2001 according to a study published by the journal health affairs in many cases illness forced breadwinners to take time off from work losing income and job based health insurance precisely when families needed it most families in bankruptcy suffered many privations 30 percent had a utility cut off and 61 percent went without needed medical care
8751214 could i just mention to you jay that in a moment of seriousness i spent five and a half years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair
8751215 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
8751216 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care

8751218 i really dont think the democrats gave a whole lot of emphasis to jeff merkleys speech
8751219 they gave him an odd time to speak and it was kind of hard to hear him with all that clamor im really not sure if he was up there to give a speech or take up podium space
8751220 most of the speakers at the republican convention are from a whole swath of different perspectives
8751221 merkley may end up being the only oregonian to address any convention

8751248 face lifts make the face tighter and when you pull on the skin it gets flatter you dont look like yourself anymore some actresses weve seen pictures of have had disastrous results

8751307 comprobamos c mo los recursos naturales son extra dos y contaminados por el ego smo de algunos de intereses de grupos de poder amparados por el actual modelo econ mico en perjuicio de los pobres los campesinos y los ind genas un cuidado especial merece el recurso del agua que empieza a ser escaso convirti ndose en el mediano plazo en fuente de conflictos en el mundo

8751310 frente a la amenaza ecol gica que estamos viviendo hoy d a un modelo neoliberal tan extremo y tan desencarnado como el que se est llevando adelante en chile creemos que es altamente perjudicial por la destrucci n de la naturaleza y sus recursos especialmente del agua dejada en manos de empresa particulares que ciertamente lo que buscan es el bien propio y no tanto el bien com n

8751319 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche que result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta situaci n desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8751320 emplazamos al general de carabineros de la ix regi n a que informe objetivamente sobre el origen de los balines que afectan a su personal
8751321 muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche
8751322 quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia y amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las armas de fuego en contra de los comuneros mapuches
8751323 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos
8751324 ante el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios
8751325 es un conflicto que el estado le ha instalado a la comunidad paichil antriao
8751326 el estado ha ido de alg n modo violentando permanentemente el derecho a la consulta y participaci n de la comunidad
8751327 el conflicto no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
8751328 el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
8751329 la m s importante que haya habido en el pa s por cierto la m s sangrienta
8751330 de modo incomprensible el gobierno se demor m s de 90 d as en dar respuesta a la huelga de hambre de patricia troncoso que la prensa tambi n acall
8751331 no fue porque exista una conspiraci n del silencio lo que hay es una autorrepresi n psicol gica en la sociedad chilena frente al conflicto con el pueblo mapuche creemos que si no lo vemos desaparece
8751332 neruda sol a viajar desde temuco a puerto saavedra pues all un colono de apellido winter le prestaba libros en ese tiempo el poeta escribi sus primeras obras los borradores de los veinte poemas de amor pero en todos ellos no hay un solo indio neruda no los vio y eso que en puerto saavedra no hay m s que arena olas y mapuches
8751333 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
8751334 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo
8751335 esta es una vieja historia cargada de decepci n y frustraciones
8751336 no hay museo m s chic en chile que el museo de arte precolombino
8751337 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
8751338 nunca los ej rcitos chileno y argentino han demostrado mayor grado de cooperaci n y fraternidad que durante la pacificaci n de la araucan a que los argentinos conocen como
8751339 nosotros reconocemos en los mapuches a nuestros ancestros pero andar pregonando que uno ha matado al padre es feo
8751340 si ese fondo no hubiera existido acota bengoa hoy el problema ser a inmanejable
8751341 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
8751342 el primer gran desaf o que enfrent la conadi fue pronunciarse respecto del proyecto de construcci n de la central hidroel ctrica ralco que requer a aprobar la permuta de terrenos ind genas como los delegados del presidente en dicha organizaci n votaron en contra frei los cambi as la conadi perdi su legitimidad cuando se estrenaba en sociedad
8751343 el informe qued archivado en alg n escritorio en la moneda de donde no volvi a salir
8751344 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
8751345 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
8751346 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
8751347 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
8751348 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio
8751349 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
8751350 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones
8751351 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado
8751352 hechos como el de este domingo el atentado en vilc n claramente est n absolutamente fuera del marco de trabajo en el cual la conadi est funcionando
8751353 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8751354 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
8751355 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
8751356 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
8751357 intercambio de informaci n para una mayor operatividad en la regi n de la araucan a fue el objetivo de la reuni n de seguridad que convoc el ministerio del interior y que tuvo la participaci n de la polic a civil carabineros la agencia nacional de inteligencia y un representante del fiscal nacional sabas chahu n quien no estuvo presente
8751358 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches
8751359 hay que mirarlo en su justa medida hay que darle la oportunidad a las polic as que trabajen tranquilas porque esta es una investigaci n de largo aliento no son investigaciones de un d a para otro para tener un resultado hay que tener paciencia
8751360 estamos tratando de obtener la mayor informaci n y yo he reforzado la cantidad de funcionarios para ver si podemos detener a las personas que corresponden de acuerdo a las instrucciones de los fiscales
8751361 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui

8751386 i went to new orleans a few days ago just for the night
8751387 i have a brace that helps me with my posture and i was wearing it and he was looking at me like i was crazy
8751388 i was doing my full dance in front of him but its hard because i kind of have to teach him and im just learning myself so i couldnt confuse him he gets so excited
8751389 we service people from knox chattanooga and obviously mcminn county and the surrounding counties here a lot of schools depend on us to play soccer and hold athletic events and were just at a standstill right now
8751390 it was a good place to be because as a ranger you went to camping areas you met people on the trail and you saw the unprepared and you could do a constant lecture from the trail head to the summit
8751391 i often ask people what they ate that they need those rolaids and they say everything i dunno know if its the type of food or the amount of food they eat at the fair
8751392 i never had another redheaded boyfriend the rest of my life
8751393 we have a fun booth how can you not have fun with ice cream
8751394 theres something about seeing the flag go up the flag pole playing the national anthem or going down the street in a parade playing the marines hymn you see veterans from korea struggling to stand at attention or just being proud to be an american thats very charging and unifying to me

8751399 a friend that keeps on telling you to shut up when youve spent almost your whole life trying to gather enough courage to say hi
8751400 shes on a high right now but her life goes in circles
8751401 its like a roller coaster ride shes highly sensitive and just one little thing could set her off
8751402 shauns return sends out a message and tells everyone what we are about
8751403 players want to come and join us and you can see the ambition we have with his arrival they say you should never go back but he only has to look at me to show thats not the case i did it at manchester united and it didnt do me any harm
8751404 we want shaun to be playing for england again he needed to get back to playing at premier league level to do that
8751405 the coach and the sports director want the player to stay and i am sure he will
8751406 our squad is complete and it is impossible for us to have one better than the one we have
8751407 robinho still has two years left on his contract therefore he is our player for the next two seasons so you can draw your own conclusions from that
8751408 in a healthy environment such as the one we have at the club there is no problem that cannot be sorted
8751409 our online partner kitbag always prepares in advance of any potential signings and unfortunately it accidentally made its way onto the site but has now been removed
8751410 the club has always made it clear he robinho is a major target and we hope to compete a deal soon
8751411 one of the things that is unique about this tournament is that its a 54 hole event
8751412 it you screw up the first day youve got more than one chance to get it back there are very few 54 hole amateur tournaments around
8751413 i know i may be a little bit biased but i would say its the no 1 amateur tournament in our area for the last 20 years
8751414 its always a lot of fun and we get some pretty good golfers out
8751415 this tournament always draws good players from around the region
8751416 the course is in the best condition its ever been
8751417 if a tree falls in the forest and there is no one around to hear it there is no sound

8751422 man cleaning some may be more applicable to the creative
8751423 yeah you think you can identify with that first post but theres no way any of you will be able to relate to this
8751424 if you dont get anything else done today please look into x its really important to me
8751425 we have a critical secret mission and only someone like you can save us we will hold down the fort and cover for you but it is urgent that you work on this today
8751426 hey you forgot to tell us how to get the most out of this guy
8751427 in addition to being a part of history the presence of job listings posted by proactive companies on our site spotlights their organizations commitment to true while at the same time tapping into an all too often overlooked but vastly impressive community of talented individuals
8751428 i think the fans had every right to be a little bit impatient they have every right to be frustrated and if theyre angry at the manager then thats just something he needs to deal with
8751429 his choice to sell anton is a business decision and has nothing to do with playing matters really there are a lot of factors other than what hes doing on a football pitch and what the manager needs
8751430 it just shows that its all very well having that money but if it is not invested wisely you can soon find yourself in trouble once things settle down behind the scenes and stabilise i think the players will be pleased
8751431 my father was very sure about certain matters pertaining to the universe to him all good things trout as well as eternal salvation come by grace and grace comes by art and art does not come easy
8751432 weve got blackburn and bolton away with kiev sept 17 in the middle said the arsenal director danny fiszman
8751433 its a good fun start one of the big issues for arsene wenger is the distances we have to travel they are tough games with very difficult stadia to play in
8751434 i am delighted for our fans we have once again drawn the champions of europe said the celtic chairman john reid
8751435 last season it was ac milan the year before it was barcelona if we are going to play in europe and we are very proud to be scotlands representatives we may as well start with the big ones
8751436 they dont come much bigger than manchester united so we are delighted we have done very well at home and are proud of our record the last time at home we pipped united at the post but they are european champions and we will not take them for granted
8751437 we talked to alex before we went in to the draw and we have the greatest respect for manchester united he is a fabulous manager who has a great record over the years but gordon strachan is building his own reputation we have won three titles now we want to make it four
8751438 when i send my team out i want to be able to sit back in the dugout and enjoy watching them play said rioch
8751439 i want them to play with plenty of energy and to play the sort of attacking pass and move game that will make the fans feel as though theyre worth the admission money
8751440 its not just about pretty football its also about my team working their socks off for each other you want to do it with class and style as well the thing is though im not the only manager who has that philosophy on football
8751441 just look at sir alex ferguson at manchester united his teams play some of the most attractive stuff you could hope to see but its under pinned by a tremendous team work ethic an incredible will to win and the proverbial 100 per cent effort
8751442 at united expectations are high wrote ferguson in his foreword to the new european football yearbook
8751443 they always are and you know that as soon as you come to the club we know that as champions of europe were the team that everybody wants to beat we also know that nobody has ever managed to string together two wins in the uefa champions league thats a challenge
8751444 it isnt a clash between torres and aguero said the argentinian
8751445 it is 11 against 11 atletico against liverpool torres is a great player but they have lots of other ones as well
8751446 ive heard the same whispers all day but thats one you will have to put to the clubs owners ive been travelling all day and now im here

8751448 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
8751449 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas

8751669 the citizens of afghanistan whether man or woman have equal rights and duties before the law

8751673 d c schools chancellor michelle rhee is negotiating what is probably the most aggressive union contract in the country shell be able to fire teachers but also be able to pay them more
8751674 the american federation of teachers which i dont think does anything for the people of the district of columbia is weighing in against it
8751675 and the only thing i can think of is that the heads of the union they want to keep their jobs
8751676 in the democratic party you have to be realistic about some coalitions that are wedded to the past on education

8751689 consumers typically think of pool building as a warm weather project but the reality is fall construction offers homeowners many more benefits
8751690 in autumn homeowners can take advantage of reduced pricing more flexibility on scheduling weather that can be more conducive to building and the added bonus of knowing theyll have a swimming pool to dive into over memorial day weekend
8751691 during summer months builders often have a backlog of requests and in many areas there can be long delays in processing permits
8751692 in the fall excavation and landscaping are rarely held up due to hard frosts rainy spells or unusual dryness whats more homeowners are generally not taking vacations in the fall so the builder and crew will have more access to the property

8751727 russian is moving forward altering the post soviet 1991 borders with unpredictable results
8751728 there is no place in todays world for attempts to redraw boundaries of our international order unless confronted by the international community russian policies will eventually force another conflict elsewhere
8751729 a unilateral attempt to redraw the borders of a neighboring country through the use of force
8751730 updates today with multi night runs in 2009 for seattle and san francisco
8751731 uno de esos partidos que sirven para demostrar que uno es futbolista de verdad
8751732 it makes too much sense were right across town a gallon of gas is awful high and with budget awareness these days its a great natural rival for us even though its a road game in my mind its a home game we can sleep in our beds and wake up and come play
8751733 its our season opener and its the first time the schools have played so its basically the d c crown
8751734 whoever wins will have bragging rights in the city for the year
8751735 the fact that they are in d c and right across town from us make it important its very exciting to start something like this
8751736 i think it was something that bernard and i had some conversations about when i started
8751737 bernard and dwight really got this rolling and its a credit to them for this game becoming a reality
8751738 this game is really important to us and to howard as well
8751739 it gains some exposure for both our programs it will help with recruiting in our area we play a great brand of football and howard does as well and i think the awareness we can build from this will be great
8751740 i think weve had some good response to this game so far
8751741 hoya blue has really tried to generate some interest and they have some buses coming over a lot of our alums have started to take an interest in the game as well its doing exactly what we hoped it would
8751742 there are a lot of people who have told me they want to come to the game just to see the two teams play
8751743 its exciting for us to have some built in excitement surrounding a game to start the season
8751744 hours after ottawa gm bryan murray held a news conference to announce the team was at a contractual impasse with restricted free agent defenseman andrej meszaros the hockey news has learned from a source close to the negotiations that meszaros has agreed to a multi year offer sheet with an average salary in excess of 5 million per season
8751745 i do think the election continues to be about barack obama
8751746 the desire for change in the country is strong and if senator obama can convince most americans the majority of americans that he will be a seasoned sensible trustworthy leader i think they are going to take a chance with him so far he hasnt closed the deal
8751747 and i think senator mccain would keep us on offense against terrorism and therefore protect us and i think senator obama would put us back on defense and that that would be certainly not as safe a situation for this country
8751748 senator obamas lack of knowledge about foreign policy is a serious concern
8751749 we prevailed in a hard campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8751750 sound familiar it did not work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8751751 what the democrats have been saying is that experience did not keep us out of an unpopular war and that judgment is better than experience
8751752 but the mccain folks have been very aggressive in changing that in putting the onus on obama and i think they will have to continue to be aggressive
8751753 because the bottom line is that although this race is close and john mccain could win barack obama has a slight advantage and so mccain has to continue to keep the heat on obama
8751754 really spoke to me as a woman and i think she spoke to a lot of people in that way
8751755 a lot of people say well what do you actors need why are you speaking up youre not people who need anything and its true were very blessed but almost all of us come from real middle class families and because we have the platform that we do it makes it a little bit easier for us to speak up speak out mostly im just here because im a bleeding heart liberal and a concerned citizen and i cant wait to hear the speeches
8751756 i dont feel very good about the last eight years and i feel like were in a place where we really need theres a lot of damage that we need to recover from and we need a very strong and inspirational leader to bring us out of this its pretty grim
8751757 over the last eight years during my travels ive seen the love that people abroad have for our country become so compromised that i dont know how well ever regain our stature in the world
8751758 if you go overseas you see how much theres an excitement that a country that the rest of the world felt got so lost suddenly is on track enough to make a change this dramatic not only an african american but a man whose name is barack obama
8751759 i really wanted to capture the heart and soul of detroit
8751760 at that time she was fairly unconscious she just seemed to be in agony and thrashing around the bed
8751761 its a shame that we had to lose one in such a way
8751762 senator obama this is truly a good day for america too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8751763 but ive got news for them too we worship an awesome god in the blue states and we dont like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states we coach little league in the blue states and yes weve got some gay friends in the red states
8751764 the past isnt dead and buried in fact it isnt even past

8751766 we have a much more extensive role in the broader world of advertising
8751767 we are working with dozens of major television advertisers advertising agencies television networks and cable players on a number of very compelling solutions that could help check what is becoming the most important issue facing the economics of the media business
8751768 one of the very important teachings from this data is unlike what many in the media industry may have assumed or wished for all viewers are fast forwarding ads at high rates
8751769 there are currently around 25 million households with dvrs most analysts estimate there will be over 50 million in the next two to three years
8751770 the issues related to fast forwarding through commercials are only going to become more evident and dire unless there is widespread adoption of ad solutions that are specifically molded for a world of dvr viewing
8751771 we dont see this ruling having anything to do with our business relationships with the cable world
8751772 in our view the cable industry has inadequate capacity for broad scale deployment of a network dvr solution its beyond the realm of most cable operators capacity

8751781 given phelps less than polished on air persona this is an interesting choice you would have a better chance of fred armisen medaling in the 100m butterfly than michael phelps getting a legitimate laugh in a sketch but well see the writers might make him look good most likely phelps will bomb so badly that hell make lebron james snl appearance look like carlin at carnegie hall over under on sketches involving goggles 2
8751782 it feels good man you know to get a second chance and i just have to take advantage of it first and foremost i dont want to let myself down definitely my little girl down im thankful for jerry the fans in dallas and my teammates for believing in me i need to keep doing what ive been doing to get reinstated staying with myself and my teammates and staying away form those knuckleheads and just stay focused
8751783 we are seeing impressive companies being built for under 100 000
8751784 that is great news for angel investors and angel funds
8751785 if we do this right this is berkshire hathaway built from the ground up around a unifying investment thesis called the user centric semantic web
8751786 to keep up the current pace of investment and incubation and capitalize on current low valuations and low operating costs for funding startups now is a good time to raise an early stage fund
8751787 in 24 months many of the companies we back today will be ripe for harvest
8751788 city embracing country is what the great allentown fair is all about
8751789 that ability to get nose to snout with those farm animals is just awesome

8751800 the white smoke steaming from the dugout last night wasnt just from troy glaus
8751801 that if a mans faith is sincere it is the most important thing about him and that it is impossible to understand who he is and how he will lead without first understanding the religious vision that informs his life
8751802 it came about as a choice and not an epiphany the questions i had did not magically disappear but kneeling beneath that cross on the south side of chicago i felt gods spirit beckoning me i submitted myself to his will and dedicated myself to discovering his truth
8751803 christianity is but one religious tree rooted in the common ethical soil of all human experience
8751804 with the speechs tone of moderation its welcome of faith into the public square and yet its insistence that people of faith conduct themselves in public debate according to democratic values it became what obama had intended a call to reform a redefinition of religions role in american political life soon his words were debated on cable news programs heard by tens of thousands on youtube and argued fiercely on web sites from every political perspective
8751805 whats happened what the premier has done is totally unethical and i would hope that the head office of the labor party has a strong look at it
8751806 i heard plan b when it was announced and i was truly amazed by it
8751807 to go against party policy in round one is bad enough to go against party policy and platform in round two as far as im concerned is unforgivable
8751808 youve got a government in nsw that has got a fairly big majority if the government cant get their bill through with their own numbers that tells you that maybe its not the right thing to do
8751809 if we are able to detect signs of autism within the first year of life parents will be able to immediately implement an early intervention plan which has already been shown to significantly improve the prognosis of children with autism
8751810 during each session i assess a range of behaviours including those that previous retrospective research has suggested are impaired in infants who later develop autism such as eye contact social and joint attention sensory motor behaviours and temperament
8751811 i also assess overall development parental concern and closely monitor the infants behaviour
8751812 so far i have identified at least six babies who are displaying behaviours or patterns of development that are of concern and may be indicative of autism
8751813 all of these infants are under 12 months of age which is far younger than the current detection age of between 18 months to three years
8751814 this is very promising and suggests that autism may be able to be detected during infancy much earlier than is currently occurring
8751815 there was a fire and then in the process the brakes could not catch that appears to be the cause of the accident although investigations are continuing
8751816 they were up in the highlands just after you leave sigatoka

8751819 i feel overdue but youve got to win it to deserve it im always expecting more from myself i would love to win even more than what i do
8751820 it looks like sometimes you go 10 steps forward and you bounce back 20 this is a real big day
8751821 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8751822 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8751823 social media is rapidly becoming a core channel for disseminating information fifty seven percent of this group of early social media adopters reported that social media tools are becoming more valuable to their activities while 27 reported that social media is a core element of their communications strategy
8751824 34 post opinions about products and brands on their blog and 36 think more positively about companies that have blogs
8751825 just over one quarter of the inc 500 reported social media was very important to their business marketing strategy in 2007 that number has increased to 44 just one year later
8751826 weve listened to feedback from our customers who asked that we provide a specific threshold for data usage and this would help them understand the amount of usage that would qualify as excessive

8751836 this is being subsidized by all these kids out there playing games
8751837 but the advantages and uses of it are amazing but it is something we are going to have to get used to
8751838 the large crowd that we expect is indicative of the campaign that senator obama has run from the beginning change happens from the bottom up
8751839 the real point is does this just feed into the growing perception that what we have is one big glitzy production
8751840 but really after the crowd files out after the fireworks take place the question remains what is left and is this person ready to be president of the united states
8751841 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8751842 i think thats taking some of the steam out of this rally
8751843 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure

8751859 the semiconductor industry has been under pressure now for sometime but one of the fastest growing businesses within semiconductors has been in programmable logic devices plds
8751860 one of the top companies in this business is san jose california based altr heres his bullish review
8751861 these plds are chips that allow software developers to use inexpensive software tools to quickly develop simulate and test their designs then a design can be quickly programmed into the chip and immediately tested in a live circuit
8751862 unlike other chips plds are based on re writable memory technology that means that if a designer wants to change the design on the chip the device can be easily reprogrammed
8751863 once the design is final customers can go into immediate production by simply programming as many plds as they need with the final software design file the result is that a final design can be completed much faster and less expensively than that of a custom fixed logic device
8751864 while altera also manufacturers other kinds of chips its the pld business that could really boost the companys business eventually altera plans to replace the asic business entirely with plds
8751865 one area where plds can play an important role is in wireless the chips allow data to be transferred and processed at high speed by wireless networks yet they require low power
8751866 this of course is critical as demand for fast processing power is rising quickly because people want and increasingly expect to be able to access the internet anytime from anywhere at high speeds
8751867 as wireless networks evolve from the old analog systems to the 3g networks in place today and 4g networks coming soon demand for alteras products should rise as well
8751868 another potentially big area of growth for altera is in base stations for wimax networks wimax is increasingly gaining popularity as a broadband wireless access technology with significant market potential
8751869 but for service providers to deploy wimax the system needs to be flexible highly scalable and offer a way for costs to keep coming down
8751870 altera announced in july that during the second quarter it racked up sales of 359 9 million up 13 from the second quarter of 2007 second quarter net income was 98 0 million up 43 compared with the second quarter of 2007
8751871 as the company develops new products and sells into new markets i think the profitability outlook will improve further i expect operating eps of 1 29 in 2009 compared to an estimated 1 19 in 2008
8751872 the company has done a great job of keeping costs down while focusing on its faster growing businesses sales continue to rise margins are strong there is very little debt and management is buying back stock
8751873 this is a fast growing chip company in a fast growing segment the industry i think shares should do very well especially if a market rebound is ahead i recommend buying shares of altr at current levels
8751874 hello welcome to the ymca after care building im so n so are you claires mom nice to meet you

8751898 he did not want to be a negro writer it is a crass disjunction but it is not his crassness or his disjunction we give lip service to the idea of the writer who happens to be black but had anyone in the postwar era ever seen such a thing

8751902 hes a leader on our football team not just on offense
8751903 hes a guy that works extremely hard during practice has big play potential and has all the physical attributes you want speed competiveness and hands that you want from a wide receiver
8751904 they dont have a history or at least a recent history in college football where you can look back and see what theyve done at that particular school
8751905 you dont know what theyve changed and that has added a lot of stress and anxiety towards those preparations
8751906 last year when i walked off the field after the texas game was over i was thinking wow
8751907 you were happy that you played well but you were thinking how much difference would a win have made for this university when you are going into this game its almost the exact scenario youre playing a big team from texas its the first game of the season and youre really trying to find an identity
8751908 the volunteers are so vital to the success of this program there is only one paid staff member other than myself so the volunteers keep the center running

8751920 when you look around to see who are the top women in the industry you really have a short list
8751921 ford lost a ton of senior executives particularly women it became like an endurance contest if id wanted to run marathons id have trained for one
8751922 i feel very strongly that organizations that are going to have long term viability and global economic ties will have talent pools that reflect their consumer base which means if we were to look in the automotive industry and look at the various levels it would not be reflective of the consumer base
8751923 it was a responsibility i was ready to take on
8751924 the actions that are taken today ensure that you will be around for the future
8751925 my father created something wonderful and i wanted to be part of it
8751926 i certainly behave as if it is irrelevant and have found that if i do so it soon becomes clear to people that it doesnt really matter who they deal with as long as they are good at what they do

8751935 and they are great dipping into books you can pick them up dip in and then put them down sometimes they might inspire you to go out and see a movie but sometime they wont
8751936 the before you die element risks being a vulgarism implying that knowledge should be consumed voraciously however i took the view that putting these buildings together in a list would implicitly reveal their comparative strengths and weaknesses
8751937 it derives from the arabic classic the 1 001 nights and implies the endless potential of storytelling as well as the absurdity of limiting the knowable
8751938 its not the number of things you do in life
8751939 if you do one thing really well then that can make a life finding a cure for cancer for example is one thing but a very good thing that would be the advice of the greek philosophers
8751940 the risk of having 100 things to do can become a distraction and you only skate across the surface they become 100 distractions rather than 100 things lived for
8751941 its an implicit critique of consumerism that life is lived by consuming more rather than living well
8751942 the volunteers are so vital to the success of this program there is only one paid staff member other than myself so the volunteers keep the center running
8751943 the volunteers have donated well over 2 000 hours thats 2 000 hours we could not afford to pay for with that said i send great thanks to the volunteers and all that theyve done

8751953 im not a psychologist and i dont know what brought on the free association that we heard from ambassador churkin
8751954 in breach of fundamental norms and principles of international law and sovereignty
8751955 russian is moving forward altering the post soviet 1991 borders with unpredictable results
8751956 there is no place in todays world for attempts to redraw boundaries of our international order unless confronted by the international community russian policies will eventually force another conflict elsewhere
8751957 a unilateral attempt to redraw the borders of a neighboring country through the use of force
8751958 dont pretend to be friends if you cant make the effort
8751959 nobody can limit the use of knowledge anywhere in the world
8751960 nigeria is never entering into any agreement with iran for any matter that has to do with weapons
8751961 there shouldnt be a misunderstanding between exploration or uses of energy to provide power and the uses of energy for weapons so that our relationship with iran will not be misconstrued by
8751962 the bottom line is that people can get a lot for their money for 400 000
8751963 nassau is a bit pricier but as you go east you will get more house for less money
8751964 some areas have always been more in demand and expensive like massapequa and new hyde park where 400 000 would be on the lower end of the price range
8751965 in suffolk the price differences are less drastic in general in nassau county the town will determine your price areas like the north shore are more expensive and areas on the queens nassau border are pricier because they offer less commuting time to manhattan
8751966 in certain areas like valley stream for instance it would be no problem to find a three bedroom 1 bath colonial for that price and in hempstead you will find many high ranches
8751967 its a good starter home you can finish the attic and improve the value of the home
8751968 last year that high ranch that now costs 400 000 would have cost 425 000 in 2005 it would have been 500 000 buyers today are saving at least 10 percent over early last year

8751973 the outsourcing trend is a salutary one for our globalized economy
8751974 outsourcing affords lawyers the ability to reduce their costs and often the costs to the client
8751975 there is nothing unethical about a lawyer outsourcing legal and non legal services provided the outsourcing lawyer renders legal services to the client with the legal knowledge skill thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation
8751976 at a minimum a lawyer outsourcing services should consider conducting reference checks and investigating the background of the lawyer or nonlawyer providing the services as well as any non lawyer intermediary involved
8751977 in some instances it may be prudent to pay a personal visit to the intermediarys facility regardless of its location or the difficulty of travel to get a first hand sense of its operation
8751978 when engaging lawyers trained in a foreign country the outsourcing lawyer should first assess whether the system of legal education is comparable to that of the united states
8751979 the lack of rigorous training or effective lawyer discipline does not mean that individuals from that nation cannot be engaged to work on a particular project what it does mean is that it will be more important than ever for the outsourcing lawyer to scrutinize the work of the foreign lawyers
8751980 what are your capabilities in the area of outsourcing legal work to india
8751981 may be susceptible to seizure in judicial or administrative proceedings
8751982 to inform the client how much the firm is paying
8751983 can go back and knock off the other languages within those language families
8751984 three years ago i met this norwegian girl online through an art site your stereotypical 6 foot tall blonde hair blue eyes and she was a very sweet girl but she didnt speak english

8751986 ik voorspel steeds meer moslimdictaturen in grote delen van de wereld ook in de vrije wereld gisteren hebben gedetineerde moslims in de gevangenis aan de nieuwe wandeling in gent van hun kloten gemaakt ze willen meer gebedsruimtes en ander vlees ik denk jongens jullie mogen al blij zijn dat jullie berhaupt vlees krijgen er zal toch wel een reden zijn waarom ze in de bak zitten h en dan nog een beetje gaan zeiken over gebedsruimtes en vlees ik heb schijt aan die gasten maar dat mag je niet zeggen want het is zogezegd rechtse praat herman brusselmans in humo uit humo nr 16 3319 16 tot 22 april wat is een communist iemand die smachtend verlangt naar gelijke verdeling van ongelijke verdiensten
8751987 de vrouw is een mens die ziet dat ook in de linkse de progressieve de emancipatie bewegingen alles nog steeds om de mannetjes draait
8751988 waar de overheidssector alleen maar dient om de echte werkloosheidscijfers te camoufleren met een pletwals van bureaucratie en nepbanen
8751989 mogelijk de beste manier voor de vlamingen om de belgische staat het voetje te lichten is om die massaal te negeren
8751990 moeten niet formeel hun onafhankelijkheid uitroepen het enige wat ze in dit stadium moeten doen is de geldstroom naar walloni stoppen en de belgische regering behandelen met de minachting en verachting die ze verdient
8751991 we have the freedoms we fight for and we lose those we dont defend
8751992 how dreadful are the curses which mohammedanism lays on its votaries besides the fanatical frenzy which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog there is this fearful fatalistic apathy the effects are apparent in many countries improvident habits slovenly systems of agriculture sluggish methods of commerce and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the prophet rule or live a degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement the next of its dignity and sanctity the fact that in mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property either as a child a wife or a concubine must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of islam has ceased to be a great power among men individual moslems may show splendid qualities but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it no stronger retrograde force exists in the world far from being moribund mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith it has already spread throughout central africa raising fearless warriors at every step and were it not that christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science the science against which it had vainly struggled the civilization of modern europe might fall as fell the civilization of ancient rome
8751993 wij hebben het recht niet om mea culpa te blijven slaan voor onze zogezegde onverdraagzaamheid als wij systematisch met onverdraagzaamheid worden geconfronteerd
8751994 maar ja dan heb je mensen als jos geysels groen die blijven volhouden dat het cordon gebaseerd is op een ethische afweging en dat er dus niet aan mag getornd worden terwijl diezelfde geysels al jarenlang weigert problemen bespreekbaar te maken het probleem met politici als geysels is dat ze geen gesprek aangaan met de bewoners van achterstandswijken die op het vlaams blok stemmen dat soort politici is eenvoudig niet ge nteresseerd in die meningen en onderbuikgevoelens die hen niet aanstaan

8751996 de vraag is of de islam wel in overeenstemming te brengen is met de liberale democratie en de vrijheid de verdraagzaamheid de verscheidenheid en het tegensprekelijk debat zonder dewelke geen open samenleving mogelijk is is de zaak rushdie niet het ultieme bewijs van de onmogelijkheid van de islam zich in te passen in onze samenleving toont zij niet aan dat de islam in wezen een intolerante en totalitaire ideologie is die botst met de culturele morele en juridische voorschriften die gelden in een open en democratische samenleving
8751997 ziehier wat ik u vraag te doen geloof niet dat er weerstand moet geboden worden aan de bezetter aanvaard eerder het feit van zijn overwinning en probeer er lessen uit te trekken voor de werkende klassen en voor het socialisme is deze ineenstorting van een vermolmde wereld verre van een ramp te zijn een bevrijding de weg ligt open voor de twee doelstellingen die de verzuchtingen van het volk samenvatten de europese vrede en de sociale rechtvaardigheid
8751998 als groot brittanni en frankrijk tsjecho slowakije ter hulp willen snellen door duitsland via belgi binnen te vallen dan zullen zij hier beschouwd worden als invallers
8751999 i think its time we taught them a lesson about how to win an election

8752014 police will allege the woman was greeted by a 74 year old man who entered the home and then assaulted the woman with a weapon before proceeding to the bathroom and assaulting the wheelchair bound man new south wales police said
8752015 as a result of the incident the man and woman both sustained multiple stab wounds to their backs heads and chests
8752016 like the mona lisa being taken out of the louvre or the uffizi gallery in florence losing its botticellis
8752017 this collection has sat at the very heart of the national collection it has been a source of pilgrimage for visitors or artists for the past 60 years and it really would be an incalculable loss

8752023 after 15 minutes you stop sitting on it and it really does feel like a stranger
8752024 a strong and directed leader of the new york state assembly who has been attentive and responsible in representing not only the interests of his district but also of the entire city
8752025 much remains undone in the area of state government and political reform and the speaker is responsible in part for that record
8752026 a strong and appealing first time candidate with knowledge and specific ideas
8752027 he has not generated the support within his district to wage the kind of successful campaign that is necessary
8752028 australian jockeys are among the lowest paid in the world
8752029 they ride because they love the sport but they deserve basic protections
8752030 thats why we are asking for a small proportion of the racing industrys prize pool to be set aside for the jockeys who put their lives on the line when they saddle up
8752031 it would be a shame to see it disrupt something like the spring carnival
8752032 if jockeys are not provided basic protections more of them will leave the sport putting the ongoing viability of the industry at risk
8752033 behind the glamour of the racing industry there is a side the general public dont see
8752034 our jockeys put their lives on the line each time they race
8752035 they shouldnt also be expected to risk financial ruin each time they race
8752036 insurance is hard to get because theres a lot of falls and theres not enough jockeys to insure
8752037 its a small array of jockeys around australia and thats all they can get
8752038 his absence gave birth to a myth around his name

8752045 esto parece serio estoy camino a mi casa para proteger mis pertenencias
8752046 what will it take to convince people the us isnt in recession
8752047 the us fed they want to raise rates but because of the fragility of the financial system they have to wait
8752048 at some point they have to raise rates to address inflationary problems
8752049 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly said avery shenfeld senior economist at cibc world markets
8752050 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8752051 a lot of the monthly indicators are suggesting recession but things like new orders and gdp suggest the economy is improving
8752052 if the us economy were growing at its potential pace the unemployment rate would not have risen a full percentage point over the past year said citigroup economist steven wieting who argues that data on new jobless claims are
8752053 with economies abroad slowing and the one time impact of tax rebates dissipating we expect annualised economic growth to recede to near 1 0 per cent in the third quarter and to maintain this pace into early 2009 before gradually improving said peter kretzmer an economist at bank of america
8752054 the better than expected outcome overall does not change our view that the economy is weakening with the beneficial effects of rebate checks and foreign demand fading fast smith said

8752090 gi per pi di un terzo della popolazione la guerra non risolve nulla ma il confronto continuer per ora si tratta del 36 ma ci riferiamo agli ultimi sondaggi condotti prima del riconoscimento di sukhumi e tskhivali avvenuto il 26 agosto e penso che la percentuale destinata ad aumentare

8752115 if youre afraid mccain is going to drop dead hes got a vice president who is fully up to speed and can step in
8752116 it makes sense to put the two of them together
8752117 im guessing mccains advisers think well maybe we need a woman she might attract the women who are disappointed that hillary didnt win to come over to the republican party but i think women who feel that strongly about hillary arent inclined to vote republican
8752118 it is good for them to help players learn english when i learned english i became a better player but to suspend them i dont think so
8752119 we have been puzzled if not surprised by some of the reactions
8752120 you have to interact effectively with your pro am partners you need to be able to do media interviews and you need to give a winners acceptance speech in english
8752121 they must speak at a level that effectively accomplishes those three things
8752122 what were seeing is that a handful of players dont speak to the level they need to be
8752123 were not just looking at the lpga as it is now
8752124 were looking at the future of the lpga as you well know we have a large international membership all indications are its not going to get smaller
8752125 if were getting any criticism its coming from outside the organization its not coming from the players and those are the people to whom it applies
8752126 surely if you can say hello thats english is that good enough
8752127 who draws the line about how many words youve got to know in english

8752131 after numerous discussions around the league we officially released marcus this afternoon
8752132 this is a painful day because of our affection for marcus who is certainly a class act
8752133 we did everything humanly possible to trade marcus which would have allowed him to play under the conditions of his contract with us unfortunately we werent able to make that happen
8752134 its also very possible marcus will choose to play for another team in our league regardless though of what decisions marcus and mona make we wish them and their family the very best
8752135 monetary union will be implemented in stages the last of which will be the most difficult

8752161 i think eli has always been confident in his abilities and confident in himself but i think there is a progression and we talked about it this time last year i know a lot of people had him on the hot seat the great thing about eli is that he has been consistent he has always put in the time and work i think that is what his teammates admire about him
8752162 i know there was criticism but it never affected me i just had to continue to work hard
8752163 i think that the thing thats encouraging to me is that hes throwing the ball better than he did a year ago

8752193 i think its fair to say that many if not most women these days dont settle for smooth political speak when it comes to their health care needs
8752194 we are so pleased that the health insurance advocate show is predominately listened to by women because national health care will absolutely take away many important aspects of the american health care system women have come to rely on lets see how many american women are willing to wait six months for a mammogram if obama care starts
8752195 there is no doubt that the health insurance advocate radio show is a compelling one of kind program
8752196 listeners are attracted to the health insurance advocate show in part because with todays current political discussion surrounding national health care they want to be informed by someone who knows the facts forward and backward not someone who is hoping to gain votes
8752197 in todays economy the last thing consumers need is to have charges they never authorized appear on their telephone bill

8752215 the scale and the magnitude and the speed at which the humanitarian crisis right now is deteriorating is very alarming and very profound
8752216 just from the beginning of this year the number of people in humanitarian crisis has increased 77 percent that is going from 1 8 million people to more than 3 2 million people
8752217 the cost of doing work in somalia is becoming higher and higher because of that we have to invest tragically in the security of our staff and also the security of all humanitarian workers in there to be able to deliver more effectively and this comes at a cost
8752218 and it is that cost which is rarely met by the donor community
8752219 any charges that the u s instigated this conflict are ludicrous

8752288 people look at their laptops during my presentations is there anything i can do about this
8752289 during this presentation id like to discuss how your organization can grow its revenues despite increased regulatory scrutiny
8752290 during this call i want to discuss three things the current regulatory environment how its hurting us and what we can do about it
8752291 este caso no puede prescribir porque se acus de delitos de lesa humanidad y esos no prescriben
8752292 send a message to the entire internet industry that access for people with disabilities is not only good business sense but an absolutely legal civil right its mandatory
8752293 to improve the experience for guests who require assistive technology
8752294 now that businesses know the courts will pay attention to this if a barrier is brought to their attention it gives them all the more reason to say lets deal with this and accommodate rather than say the law doesnt apply to me im not affected by this
8752295 one of the reasons this case was so risky is that that southwest case came out very badly we were very worried about the fact that the one precedent in the area was very bad
8752296 bellwether case in that it announces loud and clear to those who have web sites that they need to be accessible to everyone
8752297 the cost of making a web site accessible if its done at the beginning is fairly nominal
8752298 and the increase in market share is always going to be greater than the cost
8752299 this has gotten enough publicity that it just makes a lot more sense legally and as a business matter to accept it as an education
8752300 i think the new law is well intentioned but i think employers need to be proactive and develop ways to channel their employees concerns about product safety if they dont theyre going to give these employees another weapon in their arsenal
8752301 i think that industry very carefully and comprehensively polices itself american manufacturers as a rule are extremely responsible
8752302 we have now greatly increased the number of products that will go to trial with this new piece of evidence that says oh and by the way it was subject to a recall
8752303 a jury might assume that the product is defective that it must have been bad or why would the government have required this
8752304 make sure you clearly document why youre taking the action youre taking and make sure that those reasons are transparent
8752305 without a whistleblower protection the statute would be a toothless tiger
8752306 how do you enforce something like that without having people come forward without fear of retribution
8752307 as long as you have a reasonable belief youre protected from retaliation
8752308 whistleblower protection is in great need of being buttressed in this country there still remains enormous fear in the workplace throughout society by workers who are concerned about suffering retaliation
8752309 copyright holders who engage in open source licensing have the right to control the modification and distribution of copyrighted material
8752310 prior to this there have been no rulings on the enforceability of open source copyright
8752311 copyright licenses are designed to support the right to exclude money damages alone do not support or enforce that right the choice to exact consideration in the form of compliance with the open source requirements of disclosure and explanation of changes rather than as a dollar denominated fee is entitled to no less legal recognition
8752312 this is the most important election ever in my lifetime for the legal profession
8752313 unless we get a democratic administration elected in november the doors of the courthouses of this country will continue to close victims will be further deprived of whatever limited rights they have now and it will be a very difficult place for trial lawyers particularly to practice their profession
8752314 we get from time to time people saying youre biased in favour of the labour party every time i ask people show me a case of that bias explain to me where we got it wrong and why what we said was so unfair they seem to be unable to do so
8752315 the bbc is not impartial or neutral its a publicly funded urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people ethnic minorities and gay people it has a liberal bias not so much a party political bias it is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias
8752316 its not a conspiracy its visceral they think they are on the middle ground
8752317 the idea of a tax on the ownership of a television belongs in the 1950s why not tax people for owning a washing machine to fund the manufacture of persil
8752318 people who know a lot more than i do may be right when they claim that global warming is the consequence of our own behaviour i assume that this is why the bbcs coverage of the issue abandoned the pretence of impartiality long ago
8752319 its something very few people know about or think about

8752521 its a terrific sign that the celebration is instituting a number of these measures this year and i think it speaks well for the industry
8752522 if the movers and shakers and people who run the celebration get on board for this absolutely progress can be made
8752523 as long as people are competitive and want to win first and as long as it takes to do it there are going to be wrongdoings

8752530 the opening of these diverse markets demonstrates the global appetite for u s beef and the understanding and confidence nations place in americas science based international standards for safety
8752531 i think it is important to review this pattern of opened markets for their strategic placement in the world marketplace where surrounding nations and world travelers can once again enjoy the quality of american beef
8752532 its a little bit of a surprise how strong some of the numbers were in july
8752533 weve been waiting for some moderation but especially with some of the meat prices and how much has come through relatively recently at the retail level leads me to believe the overall number may be a little bit higher for the year

8752552 it is good for them to help players learn english when i learned english i became a better player but to suspend them i dont think so
8752553 we have been puzzled if not surprised by some of the reactions
8752554 you have to interact effectively with your pro am partners you need to be able to do media interviews and you need to give a winners acceptance speech in english
8752555 they must speak at a level that effectively accomplishes those three things
8752556 what were seeing is that a handful of players dont speak to the level they need to be
8752557 were not just looking at the lpga as it is now
8752558 were looking at the future of the lpga as you well know we have a large international membership all indications are its not going to get smaller
8752559 if were getting any criticism its coming from outside the organization its not coming from the players and those are the people to whom it applies
8752560 surely if you can say hello thats english is that good enough
8752561 who draws the line about how many words youve got to know in english

8752566 mcdonalds actually has been on our screen or prohibited list since 1999 so this is nothing new
8752567 what is new is the aggressive approach that theyre moving to in promoting and supporting the homosexual agenda
8752568 but to give the full weight of their corporation to promoting the homosexual agenda including homosexual marriage
8752569 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
8752570 the position of the church has not changed in standing by the standard of the church which has been on for time our position is not different from the one we took in 1998 which we called resolution 110 it is clearly stated there that in this church as far as we are concerned marriage is between a man and a woman it is clear and we have not changed that position secondly people who have other sexual orientation which is if you have a man who is living with another man and they claimed they are married we cannot accept them to be leaders in this church that is the position of the anglican community and that has not changed
8752571 all we are preaching is that we need moral conversion because we are having people who claimed to be religious but not conscious of the morality to do the right thing so all we need is moral conversion towards doing what is right and through this we would achieve national growth and development
8752572 for us in kaduna state we realised that to live peacefully we need to understand the religion of each other and so we are convinced that the best way to promote peace and encourage it is to know the well being of your neighbour and the well being of your neighbour is dictated by what he or she believes in the well being of the muslim is dictated by islam and so we are concentrating on the christians learning about islam
8752573 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
8752574 the interests of the embryo to have a future independent of its mother does anyone really believe that a fetus has any notion of the future
8752575 it is a theory that is both unproven and unlikely given that even toddlers struggle to understand the difference between tomorrow and next week
8752576 in trying to prevent what they see as cruelty anti abortionists can themselves be terribly terribly cruel i have no objection to people who oppose abortion as long as they dont insist that other people suffer for their views

8752578 weve listened to feedback from our customers who asked that we provide a specific threshold for data usage and this would help them understand the amount of usage that would qualify as excessive

8752581 ive got to say from my experience negative advertising is satisfying to politicians but tends to turn the community off
8752582 the public of western australia need to be aware of the team that they are going to be electing
8752583 ive sought the advice of the csiro geoscience australia and additionally the chief scientist to provide me with guidance as to the best environmental standard that we need to set for the processes
8752584 im confident that the process will be at worlds best practice in terms of disposal of waste
8752585 advice is clear to me that in terms of storing this material whether you store it above ground whether you store it in drums or whether you do re inject it into a saline aquifer the last option of re injecting it into the saline aquifer is considered by all the scientific advice that came to me to be the best most effective most environmentally safe way of dealing with the waste
8752586 ive said yes to the uranium mine because the proposal wont produce any adverse significant impacts on matters of national environment significance
8752587 obviously im very disappointed in the consequence of this debate but completely accept that this is a democratic party
8752588 i had a very strong view which i argued within the party too
8752589 the partys determined that we will have activities of this kind
8752590 im the environment minister of the government i have got to discharge my responsibilities as environment minister not on the basis of a personal view one way or the other but to get the best environmental outcomes i can
8752591 my views about this issue have been well known and i did oppose at the conference the change in policy
8752592 but i also made it clear that if it was the democratic will of the party that the policy would change and if that was the governments policy position that i would support it
8752593 im a cabinet minister and as a consequence of my role as effectively a decision maker i see my task now as being to make sure that we set the best possible environment standards we can

8752599 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
8752600 for 41 years weve lived in a state sponsored culture of death that has killed five million children and were now surprised that some of the surviving children have turned out violent with no regard for the sanctity of life
8752601 all of us have seen in the news the frequent reports of young people killing strangers in the street killing fathers defending their property killing people with learning difficulties killing other young people who are different to them
8752602 how many children know that their mothers have had an abortion what effect will it have on them knowing that they have been deprived of a brother or sister through abortion
8752603 if a society holds human life so cheaply is it any surprise that young people will also hold life cheaply and engage in violence
8752604 i earnestly call on all catholics in my diocese to support politicians who are opposed to abortion euthanasia and research on embryonic human beings
8752605 pc maker says quarterly profit fell as sales rise 11 analysts worry about the effects of a slowing economy on the company

8752608 if a church cannot tell its flock what to do with my body as the saying goes with regard to contraception then other uses of that body will quickly prove to be similarly off limits to ecclesiastical authority
8752609 may forget the reverence due to a woman and disregarding her physical and emotional equilibrium reduce her to being a mere instrument for the satisfaction of his own desires no longer considering her as his partner whom he should surround with care and affection
8752610 a voluntary project one can pursue for private reasons apart from any thought of marriage
8752611 we just need people to look after our community and make sure our community is well catered for and people are well catered for in all aspects of our community
8752612 mainly television will be the prime one that well be looking at to give them a better profile or a higher profile
8752613 if it stays there and other governments accept it and it stands the test of time that means it must be good legislation
8752614 finally id like to thank all of my political and industrial opponents for steeling my determination to carry on
8752615 you gotta have a hunger to do things and my opponents have given it to me
8752616 in many ways if it were not for you i would not have done as much or tried as hard my passion comes from a sense of injustice and it fuels my determination
8752617 i have learned something from everyone here im not going to tell you what it is because it hasnt always been good
8752618 hopefully with minority government therell be less lecturing and nagging and more wielding of power

8752626 the deal will also include duties on products placed in the sensitive track covering about eight per cent to 10 per cent to be reduced to five per cent by 2015
8752627 yes we hope so in that sense although there is a number of outstanding issues involved that will be done in bilateral
8752628 by the time the agreement come into effect on january next year we can see the real effect from such arrangement by the early part of 2009
8752629 obviously after 2010 we are going to see a lot more greater quantum jump i think it is not difficult to achieve and we will surpass the target
8752630 the new orleans area now has the best flood protection in its history

8752635 but not only that he is in the hopes and dreams the competence and courage the rightness and readiness of barack obama
8752636 but theres not much behind it and thats a perfect metaphor for barack obamas readiness to be president of the united states
8752637 listen if we didnt have a set the republicans would have attacked us for something else

8752654 if russia wants to change saakashvili and that was its aim here then its steps here were absolutely stupid
8752655 when we have a threat to our internal safety a military occupation then all georgians despite our political views or differences between us we must unite
8752656 even the radical opposition that says all of this was the result of the failure of saakashvili does not question the territorial integrity of georgia
8752657 if they found someone who could replace saakashvili he would have to explain why russias invasion was good
8752658 they can tighten control over trade in the winter they can engineer shortages to provoke popular discontent
8752659 as for saakashvili and his regime it is true that we do not like him
8752660 this is a question that should not be addressed to me but to the georgian government and maybe more accurately to the georgian people and of course those who have been supporting mr saakashvili
8752661 the russians are trying to say the whole problem is saakashvili and if only not for saakashvili they could normalize relations
8752662 first they are blaming everything on saakashvili and if someone will sacrifice saakashvili they will slice the next one
8752663 the results demonstrate this policy is working its about reducing the number of afl players using illicit drugs
8752664 yes there are a greater number in total but the rate and percentage of players testing positive because of our increased testing continues to decline
8752665 we are determined to put the health and welfare of players first

8752718 matter of fact on this trip i left phoenix went to death valley came through the desert to lone pine through bishop and came here yesterday im leaving for tahoe tomorrow and then will swing through yosemite ive never been there before visiting with my daughter in san francisco for awhile by then itll be getting cool so ill probably peddle on down to san diego
8752719 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
8752720 an increasing willingness to allow the actions of individuals to disadvantage and even endanger others if those actions derive from religious faith
8752721 studies have shown that 14 of u s doctors when confronted by possibly objectionable but legal medical treatments not only would refuse to deliver such care but also would refuse to inform their patients about it or refer them to physicians who would deliver the care
8752722 about 40 million people who would receive substandard care from these physicians who believe that their religious convictions are more important than the well being of their patients
8752723 our deference to religion in contemporary american society has allowed us to subordinate all other values it has allowed us to routinely accept religiously motivated behaviors that we otherwise would have no reluctance to sanction and that indeed would be impermissible with any other justification
8752724 in the united states we all are free to practice our religion as we see fit as long as we do not interfere with the well being of others by imposing our religious views on them if physicians or other healthcare providers who have religious objections to legal medical treatments will not at a minimum inform their patients about those treatments and refer them to others who will deliver them they should act in a way that is consistent with their convictions and the well being of their patients and find other professions
8752725 well the best thing i can say is that at least she doesnt trip over her own feet
8752726 i did request to be on a line with sean avery who i am very sorry that the rangers lost
8752727 i seem to be slowing down a little bit well see what happens
8752728 its always fun though i dont think theres anyone going to try laying anyone out
8752729 mark is a more mobile guy that creates opportunities for himself to make some plays in addition to the normal plays in the offense
8752730 hes very competitive hes a great practice player hes got a great arm hes really a fantastic player i think hes going to do everything that anybody can do with this spot if he can hold on to his job and keep ahead of mitch mustain and aaron corp because the competition is on as it always is
8752731 we had a terrific run in our history here but the kids who have been in the program for so many years winning championships have all left us
8752732 this season has brought emergence of the leadership from guys like brian cushing rey maualuga and kevin ellison and mark sanchez and kristopher odowd we sense a whole new excitement about a program
8752733 the quarterback position is i wont say of concern but ill say of interest
8752734 were going to have five guys competing for that job we have a practice order and nate costa heads that up but justin roper did a tremendous job in our bowl game and probably his performance in practices leading up to that game and in the oregon state game gave our team the confidence i believe to win that football game
8752735 i think its a tremendous conference both from the talent of a playing standpoint and a coaching standpoint
8752736 if you look at a veteran quarterback i think thats a starting point if you look at an emerging defense i think thats another starting point youve got to have some support people on offense because a quarterback in and of himself cant do it
8752737 i thought of the songs that i would listen to growing up of the memories attached to some of the old stuff that my parents were playing and of the feelings attached to those memories
8752738 i thought it would be really cool to have a record that explores the different eras of soul music
8752739 i remember hearing it and thinking thats a dope song and hes canadian
8752740 the general consensus was your songs sound too mature for your look
8752741 i did voiceovers commercials worked on sessions in studios anything i did to survive was music related
8752742 im not stupid i think i can figure the rest of it out for myself thank you

8752745 in december 2007 i was offered the position of investigator to focus on an unsolved double homicide from 1999
8752746 our chief of police darryl griffis read an internet article about dr bonds work at the university of leicester and northamptonshire police in developing latent prints on fired casings and it was decided that we should attempt to have our casings tested we checked with several of the larger crime labs and learned that everyone was interested in the process but none were ready to try it out we contacted dr bond and were invited to bring the evidence to northampton for processing in the hope that that with the leicester process a latent fingerprint might be located on the actual casing s itself which would help to bring more evidence against a possible suspect while we understand that there is no guarantee of positive results every possibility must be explored to bring the suspects to justice and closure to the victims families
8752747 the launch of acamp helps position western canada at the forefront of innovation and is an important milestone in albertas growing capacity for science and technology commercialization
8752748 i hope it happens because it means that i at least caught a pass and contributed in some form or fashion
8752749 it means ive been surrounded by phenomenal teammates who have allowed me to get open and do my job its a neat little thing but if we win the game then ill be ecstatic its an absolutely critical game and at this stage of my career ive finally realized that wins are more important than individual statistics
8752750 it kind of hurt him that he missed most of camp and the first couple of games of the season with a leg injury
8752751 its no secret that hes not the fastest receiver on our team and we have guys that get open deep
8752752 his thing is to get open underneath but there are times were going to throw downfield there are plays designed for him the coaches know he can get open underneath
8752753 jarious has handled the week well and the last two days hes felt a lot better but i think we would be foolish to expose him unless there was no other choice
8752754 buck played quite a bit in the last two weeks
8752755 i believe hes ready to go what has occurred has been good for buck he has a lot of confidence and i think his shoulder is as good as its been
8752756 ive played against both of them and theyre both winners so it doesnt matter who were facing well have our hands full
8752757 theres no pressure on me ive been in this situation before said pierce adding that hes more concerned about getting the team back over 500
8752758 youre never satisfied with that kind of record were a better team than our record shows we have a lot of talent on both sides of the football were just not playing as one right now thats disappointing
8752759 outstanding leadership in developing the science of laser cooling and manipulation of ions with applications in extremely precise measurements and standards quantum computing and fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and for his major impact on the international scientific community through training scientists and outstanding publications
8752760 we now can say with reasonable certainty that we have a safe intervention that will reduce the chances that babies born very early will suffer cerebral palsy
8752761 its a drug that has a very high safety margin and its not expensive
8752762 if they find themselves in the unfortunate situation of facing an early preterm birth they should raise the issue
8752763 north american obstetricians use magnesium sulfate regularly and this would be an extension of that use rather than a new drug that practitioners arent familiar with and has a lot of side effects
8752764 getting shots may seem burdensome and even downright scary to some children but they protect children against dangerous and deadly diseases
8752765 because of the success of vaccines american parents and healthcare providers have less experience than ever before with infectious diseases such as polio and measles
8752766 i think its time we taught them a lesson about how to win an election
8752767 the stakes in this election are too big we need all of you we have to out hustle out work out think them
8752768 the report will encourage the reserve bank of australia to be measured in its easing cycle
8752769 rumours of the death of the australian economy are overdone
8752770 commsec still expects the reserve bank to cut interest rates by 25 basis points next week however the latest result will clearly water down the more optimistic market views of rate cuts in coming months
8752771 twenty five basis points looks a done deal next week but further rate cuts from there have just become a whole lot less certain

8752776 it was involved in businesses in south america that werent travelling the way they hoped and instead of revealing the truestate of its business to themarket it chose to fudge mr murphy said
8752777 this was a surprisingly strong report that should end the discussion about a recession at least for now
8752778 this looks very serious it is windy rainy trees are also falling down and we have no electricity

8752782 it has been a frustrating and embarrassing problem to explain why this is the case
8752783 what will it take to convince people the us isnt in recession
8752784 the us fed they want to raise rates but because of the fragility of the financial system they have to wait
8752785 at some point they have to raise rates to address inflationary problems
8752786 police will allege the woman was greeted by a 74 year old man who entered the home and then assaulted the woman with a weapon before proceeding to the bathroom and assaulting the wheelchair bound man new south wales police said

8752788 australian jockeys are among the lowest paid in the world
8752789 they ride because they love the sport but they deserve basic protections
8752790 thats why we are asking for a small proportion of the racing industrys prize pool to be set aside for the jockeys who put their lives on the line when they saddle up
8752791 it would be a shame to see it disrupt something like the spring carnival
8752792 if jockeys are not provided basic protections more of them will leave the sport putting the ongoing viability of the industry at risk
8752793 behind the glamour of the racing industry there is a side the general public dont see
8752794 our jockeys put their lives on the line each time they race
8752795 they shouldnt also be expected to risk financial ruin each time they race
8752796 insurance is hard to get because theres a lot of falls and theres not enough jockeys to insure
8752797 its a small array of jockeys around australia and thats all they can get
8752798 its not a big working force where you can go insure 50 000 people or something like that
8752799 australian jockeys are among the lowest paid in the world
8752800 they ride because they love the sport but they deserve basic protections
8752801 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
8752802 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8752803 who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8752804 no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him
8752805 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly said avery shenfeld senior economist at cibc world markets
8752806 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8752807 a lot of the monthly indicators are suggesting recession but things like new orders and gdp suggest the economy is improving
8752808 if the us economy were growing at its potential pace the unemployment rate would not have risen a full percentage point over the past year said citigroup economist steven wieting who argues that data on new jobless claims are
8752809 with economies abroad slowing and the one time impact of tax rebates dissipating we expect annualised economic growth to recede to near 1 0 per cent in the third quarter and to maintain this pace into early 2009 before gradually improving said peter kretzmer an economist at bank of america
8752810 the better than expected outcome overall does not change our view that the economy is weakening with the beneficial effects of rebate checks and foreign demand fading fast smith said
8752811 we have made the ita all academic team each year since 2002 and i am very happy that we have made it again
8752812 i am especially proud that five of our eight players earned a gpa of at least 3 5 they all worked extremely hard for this honor

8752819 3 suggested that expressionless eyes obliged readers to provide their own emotions in different story situations
8752820 what would be your opinion about that for my part i think it works perfectly with louis riels preoccupations or visions of and the perfidy in john a macdonald eyes
8752821 i create out of two emotions mainly outrage at abuses of power by people in authority and guilt
8752822 what led you to the riel character at first his fight against a government or his psychological instability or both
8752823 coulton waugh argued that grays trademark use of empty ovals for his characters eyes led the reader to supply the expressions for himself and thus the meanings are

8752871 our mission in the m b a program is to increase the value of the degree with every passing day
8752872 as we continue to attract the best and the brightest in order to gain more national attention our strategy has been to grow in terms of the size of the program as we grow we have also attracted more out of state and out of region students which can lead to a multiplier effect when they graduate these students typically want to return to the region from which they came by going back to these areas it helps in our brand awareness and effectiveness on a broader basis geographically

8752935 how on earth this is going to make money for the airlines is beyond me
8752936 waits is an utterly magnetic performer it seems less like youve bought a ticket to a concert than to a different world
8752937 waits wove a spell as intricate and engaging as that of any performer i can remember seeing on a musical stage
8752938 you were in no doubt that you had just witnessed the greatest entertainer on planet earth
8752939 for a couple of hours every night on the glitter and doom tour with waits as lightning conductor whipping up the band stirring up his demons and roaring up a storm he puts on what is quite simply the greatest show on earth
8752940 a mindblowing concert tom waits is an old time magician
8752941 jesus gonna be here soon is wild and brutal november is the quintessence of all the autumns in this world innocent when you dream is marvelous and so sweet who wouldnt want a serenade like this
8752942 the concert is almost like finding a light that will guide you to salvation
8752943 tom waits leads a show that raises a panorama of his explorations and musical obsession since his beginning in the 70s
8752944 tom waits has put a spell on the le grand rex 8 years after the last paris show of the legendary californian singer songwriter he was welcomed by a standing ovation
8752945 personal sometimes brushing against pure genius in his parodies and in his viral ironies the wait in time and the strict organization requirements to avoid the reselling of tickets were vindicated with a spectacle so captivating that could not disappoint
8752946 it was an unforgettable experience the dark humor of mr waits work can disguise its beauty and compassion but throughout this performance there were transcendent moments when the song and its expression permitted a profound understanding of what he was communicating thats what makes a concert by a gifted songwriter extraordinary
8752947 and he lived up to every inch of his reputation as a dynamic and theatrical performer there is a certain grace in toms weird angular gyrations and posturing i didnt expect him to be so sexy said one fan indeed what could be sexier than the man standing arms outstretched beneath a shower of glitter
8752948 waits did the near impossible and lived up to the great expectations
8752949 tom waits returns to the road with searing two hour set packing more than two dozen tunes into a set that was sure to satisfy any fans that made trip
8752950 in the 20 odd years since tom waits last played dallas his music has grown more demented and at the same time more poignant
8752951 that unmistakable national treasure of a voice gave the troubadour the air of a carnival barker
8752952 the greatest musical event of the year the single best musical event ive ever witnessed
8752953 waits voice is actually more complex than most would give him credit for his most marked asset is an almost feral growl yet waits can also sing in a high almost fragile voice as well and croon with the rough beauty inspired by louis armstrong
8752954 tom waits has traveled to the source of the american songbook and returned with an alternate theory of its evolution the ingredients are recognizable in flashes vaudeville bebop spoken word brill building funk hip hop but the connections he makes between them are utterly unique he connected the dots for a rapt and grateful audience
8752955 tom waits keeps em spellbound at alabama theatre although the concert lasted more than two hours waits kept listeners on the edges of their seats wondering what hed so next no sluggish spots no dead ends just an immaculately paced consistently exciting meld of music and theater
8752956 fridays show at the plaza theatre probably was unlike anything ever seen in the historic atmospheric movie palace before and after its 2006 restoration playing out like some twisted journey through a house of broken mirrors fridays concert was part performance art part roadhouse blues revival all good
8752957 waits ultimately spent the night demonstrating that hes one of the last remaining character actors in american music a self proclaimed moonlighting thespian whos always known that music is another kind of theatre a very particular storytelling practice and that its all in the delivery
8752958 the main reason santa is so jolly is because he knows where all the bad girls live
8752959 i cant believe hes falling for lucy thatll all change once i take the stand oh who am i kidding ill just break down because i love the big lug so much anyone have a little model of an oil derrick i can stroke for comfort

8752988 la juventud y la vejez no est n dadas sino que se construyen socialmente en la lucha de j venes contra viejos
8752989 estos j venes se encuentran en una especie de tierra de nadie social pues son adultos para unas cosas y ni os para otras
8752990 entre los j venes de la regi n se constatan graves carencias u omisiones que afectan su formaci n integral al privarlos o limitarles derechos como la educaci n el empleo la salud el medio ambiente la participaci n en la vida social y pol tica y en la adopci n de decisiones la tutela judicial efectiva la informaci n la familia la vivienda el deporte la recreaci n y la cultura en general
8752991 particularmente en los j venes de los sectores populares esta situaci n adquiere perfiles n tidos la idea de un potencial ascenso social transmitida intergeneracionalmente se ve confrontada con la realidad una realidad caracterizada por un continuo proceso de disminuci n de las posibilidades de satisfacci n de las necesidades juveniles disminuci n que reconoce un sin n mero de factores aunque la falta de trabajo ocupa un lugar central y determinante
8752992 el mercado laboral es fundamental para los j venes como fuente donde obtener un ingreso y acumular destrezas luego de salir de la escuela el desempleo los priva de beneficios reduciendo la participaci n en el mercado laboral y elevando el desempleo de los adultos el desempleo tambi n puede degenerar en depresi n y otros problemas de salud
8752993 los j venes que encuentran trabajo tienden a trabajar en los sectores informales ganando menos y con menos seguridad en el empleo los an lisis sobre salarios y desempleo demuestran que la educaci n contribuye a producir mayores salarios especialmente entre la juventud con educaci n terciaria una educaci n superior tambi n escuda a los j venes del desempleo durante pocas de depresi n econ mica sin embargo los j venes ganan menos que los adultos en todos los niveles de educaci n a n tomando en cuenta experiencia y otros factores los trabajadores j venes con un menor nivel educaci n enfrentan la mayor inestabilidad en el trabajo

8753062 what most of us are expecting is a continuation of the legacy that the work we did in the 70s 80s and 90s was not in vain
8753063 thats really where the hurt is coming from that the younger generation would forget about us and the struggles we had to fight for this even to have a rap city we expect those that come after us to keep that torch lit
8753064 right now were dealing with a generation gap with younger people and us supposedly bitter old school hip hoppers

8753130 they understood that it is whatever it takes the date is the date
8753131 with a design build philosophy we managed numerous design changes occurred during construction
8753132 we just used creative coordination and careful sequencing of the work
8753133 with all the mechanical and electrical changes one of our challenges was installation on the fly we had to keep the project moving forward while trying to understand what the designers would be doing while anticipating what the owners would want
8753134 this could have made rescue and fire operations difficult had pmc not come up with a creative solution that would not only ensure jobsite safety but also satisfy city of reno emergency codes
8753135 we had to maintain the schedule through a lot of unknowns
8753136 we had to knuckle down and keep pursuing because thats what we do
8753137 its something i feel im very good at and i have a good eye for detail
8753138 we do offer pack ages but we structure our services however the builder wants it done
8753139 as far as the cleaning goes it is a lot more work than people think
8753140 cleaning the models involves a lot more than just dusting and vacuuming it involves a tremendous amount of detail work things that most people dont even think of that get dirty the builders expect perfection as they should which requires that we hire people that have a real eye for detail
8753141 theres been a great downturn in the residential market but there are directions where we can expand

8753144 we are investing in a lot of equipment to improve our processes and are building new products
8753145 in the last year in denver we put 1 5 million worth of new equipment into the facility and we added another 20 000 square feet
8753146 sound control has become a big issue across the country since a lot of the building is infill projects with mixed use development
8753147 some of the builders have even shut down projects while others keep their models open continuously
8753148 part of our success has been not trying to do too many things

8753164 i think one of the advantages is the support i get from my dads years of experience and having a very open communication channel between the two of us which is unusual in any company
8753165 the company culture is very close knit in fact we just had three employees who received their 30 year service award
8753166 i didnt come in as a family member where my dad handed me the business
8753167 i was made to earn the respect and earn the position
8753168 he has allowed me to bring my own experience to the company vs trying to keep the same hard fast rules
8753169 he has given me more latitude with employee evaluations and encouraged me to use my own judgment to influence the morale and productivity of the company
8753170 accountability is not finding fault it is asking what more can i do to improve the situation
8753171 we believe that in order to produce consistent positive results our company must be a system based company rather than just a company managed by individuals
8753172 accountability is not finding fault it is asking what more can i do to improve the situation
8753173 we have a firm conviction that if performance is measured then performance is increased
8753174 if performance is measured and the results are reported back then perform ance increases again gsl maintains performance records that are used to keep score

8753178 i started in the multifamily housing which led to doing commercial buildings then into the medical building field
8753179 i originally had no plans to build medical projects but i stumbled upon it as a progression of building retail projects
8753180 they are a worldwide provider of kidney dialysis equipment and treatments
8753181 we build their actual treatment facility both tenant improvements and actual ground up facilities
8753182 working with fmcna requires being on top of its game
8753183 there are ever increasing chal 120 b amp c s o u t h w e s t f a l l 2008
8753184 we sense their itch and we come up with solutions before they even scratch the surface
8753185 we identified ways to save them hundreds of dollars by better matching up the homes insulation windows hvac systems and water heating systems in ways that the energy consultants were unable to do in that process we became the industry energy consultant for our builders working with them the utilities and the product manufacturers to find the most cost effective and homeowner beneficial energy solutions for the homes they were building
8753186 most of our competitors have the plans and specs mentality tell me what you want and well put it in
8753187 but we do things the beutler way we create new solutions
8753188 we sense their itch and we come up with solutions before they even scratch the surface
8753189 and new builders were long term savings another iteration of beutlers innovative ways is aquachill a highly efficient air conditioner that uses water instead of air to cool the refrigerant
8753190 were trying to bring to the market what it needs and sometimes recognize it before the market does
8753191 but we realized that if we want something done right we have to 118 b amp c s o u t h w e s t f a l l 2008
8753192 were very interested in this technology and were hoping to prove that this product will have long term energy rebates
8753193 its not in the market for general sales yet until we get through the ahri air conditioning heating and refrigeration institute rating process which will be in the fall
8753194 the residential market is so devastated in terms of volumes tumbling right around two thirds in the past three years
8753195 we have to be able to size ourselves according to the market
8753196 we have to ramp up and ramp down really quickly and we have learned how to go up and down 25 percent within a four to fivemonth period
8753197 and you just have to adapt by constantly staying in tune with plans and specifications required for each facility
8753198 our market is fantastic for us our niche in the market specialty medical seems to be growing annually
8753199 it is because we can offer personalized service and monitor quality daily
8753200 we have eliminated a lot of layers of people involved in the projects
8753201 when one of our clients call our office they get a response within hours and not days regarding any concerns that they may have
8753202 we have a very hands on approach that lets our clients know we are looking out for their best interests
8753203 meeting deadlines is dealt with by monitoring subcontractor status on a daily basis and revising schedules as needed
8753204 there hasnt been a case where we did not complete a project on time
8753205 we are well in tune with the needs of all of our clients
8753206 we then work together with the architect and owner to alleviate these problems and discrepancies when they will be easiest to rectify in the very beginning of the job
8753207 john mccain was able to weave in his experience in a vietnam prison camp no matter what the question was
8753208 its much better than talking about how hes changed his total character between being a senator a kind of a maverick at the time and his acquiescence in the last few months with every kind of lobbyist pressure that the right wing republicans have presented to him
8753209 we do all we can because we choose to but we insist they do all that they must because they are obligated to
8753210 by the age of fifty five as a lawyer officer of the realm husband father popular citizen speaker and writer he had achieved as much fame wealth professional success and genuine affection as any person could desire
8753211 nevertheless for what most called a foolish scruple of conscience he threw all that away and died three years later alone in broken health his closest political colleagues abandoned him he was condemned as a traitor beheaded and his head placed on a spike on a bridge
8753212 as far as wingnuts go dana is pretty goddamn well grounded
8753213 aw dont be dissin dana for a wingnut hes not half bad
8753214 sh t i like dana more than i like jesurgislac and dana is near pathological in his desire to throw people in jail hes a messed up monkey but i still feel his humanity despite some of the missing parts
8753215 a week without common sense political thought was making me feel lower than a snakes belly in a wagon rut
8753216 dana troglodyte misogynist obsessive a complete loser every time i pick on him no matter how nasty a person he is i feel bad because he is after all a loser
8753217 holy mackerel the energy coming out of this country is unrivaled
8753218 its been very hard its just moving the stuff from one place to another ya know its just been real hectic
8753219 these families are typically their low income to start with
8753220 theyre typically living from paycheck to paycheck and even if they did have advance notice that they were gonna have to move its really hard for this client base to be able to save money to get ready to move
8753221 interviews with more than a dozen current and former american military intelligence and foreign policy officials some of whom would speak only on condition of anonymity
8753222 this is consistent with the united states government efforts to encourage countries to help us share the burden of keeping these dangerous people from engaging any combat
8753223 the united states has for a long time said that they are not interested in being the worlds jailers we work collaboratively with a any number of countries that are partners on the global war on terror to help us share the burden of keeping dangerous individuals from engaging in these activities
8753224 certain assurances that we always look for that they being treated humanely
8753225 i feel the competition right now is substantial and everyone is out to capture this market that seems to be holding strong
8753226 we feel that there are a lot of companies that sell air conditioning but our focus is on providing a good job at a fair price and maintaining those relationships with our customers
8753227 it is very fast paced especially with the commercial office buildings biopharmaceuticals and software companies like google and yahoo
8753228 i feel the competition right now is pretty stiff and everyone is out to capture this market that seems to be recurring
8753229 we strive to control our costs as much as possible with out having to pass too much to our customers this helps us to be competitive
8753230 manufacturers are starting to reappear a little bit and with the commercial market booming its more exposure for us to a higher level of customers
8753231 i think the challenge is obviously keeping our employee base at a high level trying to hang on to the good people when there is so much work going on and competition out there
8753232 we try to provide just a little bit more than the next guy as far as opportunities and personal challenges for our employees
8753233 we get involved in project labor agreements with some 122 b amp c s o u t h w e s t f a l l 2008
8753234 having the data to actually look at your product from a number of different ways i can confidently say we build a pretty great product
8753235 were one of the only companies that install and manufacture our own product the actual material were putting up is agate material
8753236 in the air force everybody wants our product but the way the money drops you can chase the projects for eight or nine years before you get it
8753237 weve done everything from maintenance facilities to guard shacks and some flightline work
8753238 every person that you use to work on an air force base goes through a full background check
8753239 everything revolves off steel and freight so those are our biggest obstacles to date
8753240 i see agate expanding and getting larger trying to get into some different marketplaces trying to expand into larger structural steel jobs specialty niches
8753241 our business philosophy stresses the importance of approaching each contract as a relationship building opportunity
8753242 kern steel has made exceptional efforts to complete the modifications ahead of schedule with quality work and customer service as their main priorities
8753243 in addition kern steel has repaired other defective welds in the areas of the modifications at no additional cost to the government in order to facilitate the best possible modification effort for these stands

8753246 were one of the only companies that install and manufacture our own product
8753247 what would the world be like if nobody did a job they didnt want to do
8753248 the less effort the faster and more powerful you will be
8753249 we work on many public projects and have many repeat customers which is something we are very proud of

8753251 this was a custom installation and had to be aesthetically pleasing and kern steel filled the bill very well
8753252 we have to keep our focus on the customer to remain competitive
8753253 as long as we can maintain the degree of product were supplying we will continue to grow
8753254 i couldnt imagine anything better than having our field be all ex military

8753257 in 1986 les mathews the owner of caretaker systems inc went to australia and witnessed the exposed aggregate finish
8753258 the name pebble tec was developed and an arizona based corporation was started
8753259 during 1986 and 1987 the application process was greatly improved while resources for superior quality pebble materials were found in 1988 the product was brought to market in phoenix
8753260 we search far and wide for the finest naturally tumbled stones
8753261 these are typically from such sites as river beds and beaches
8753262 a pebble tec pool finish offers a unique flexible design that will perfectly blend with landscaping and water features

8753265 we try to find the hardest jobs out there because anybody can build the easy stuff
8753266 when you look at something easy you dont look quite as hard at it as you do with something hard
8753267 its just going to be a tight job but we have an excellent general contractor out there c w driver
8753268 weve been working on this for several months on how were going to efficiently do our work as best as possible
8753269 you cant guarantee that but it would sure be nice to offer that to people who prove that theyre worth it
8753270 its going to be there and i think its going to be one of these sleeping giants thats always going to be there
8753271 during the early 1960s tradesmen in australia creatively applied small exposed aggregate finishes to pool decks
8753272 applying gt there are very few things that make a home more appealing to homebuyers than a swimming pool
8753273 pebble surface beach entries became widely accepted and before long the entire pool was installed with smaller exposed aggregate
8753274 over the next 15 years australian interest in pebble interiors for swimming pools grew in popularity
8753275 the remainder of this year theres not much change coming and the improvement will come 12 to 24 months from now
8753276 its one more thing that speaks to the quality of the product and our service to people
8753277 the successful projects are selling based on price vs selling on value
8753278 prior to six months ago a lot of builders were putting a lot of extra features in homes and buyers were willing to pay for them
8753279 mitsui was around even before the pilgrims landed at plymouth rock
8753280 our financial strength has allowed us to weather these tough times better than the competition
8753281 we have been prodded by our parent company to please use this opportunity to grow
8753282 with the capital that we have from our parent company the vision is to avail ourselves of the opportunities that are available in this market disruption and to emerge from this as a much larger company

8753287 el gobierno ha creado planes especiales que van en la direcci n de bajar las cifras como el programa j venes al bicentenario que capacitar a 30 mil j venes

8753302 australian jockeys are among the lowest paid in the world
8753303 they ride because they love the sport but they deserve basic protections
8753304 thats why we are asking for a small proportion of the racing industrys prize pool to be set aside for the jockeys who put their lives on the line when they saddle up
8753305 it would be a shame to see it disrupt something like the spring carnival
8753306 if jockeys are not provided basic protections more of them will leave the sport putting the ongoing viability of the industry at risk
8753307 behind the glamour of the racing industry there is a side the general public dont see
8753308 our jockeys put their lives on the line each time they race
8753309 they shouldnt also be expected to risk financial ruin each time they race
8753310 insurance is hard to get because theres a lot of falls and theres not enough jockeys to insure
8753311 its a small array of jockeys around australia and thats all they can get
8753312 its not a big working force where you can go insure 50 000 people or something like that
8753313 australian jockeys are among the lowest paid in the world
8753314 they ride because they love the sport but they deserve basic protections

8753344 i think this shows a shift in the way south africans are thinking
8753345 people are focusing much more on the here and now and want to fear something they can control its very oprah
8753346 there is nothing worse than having to untie your shoe in the middle of the day to get a tiny stone or a piece of lint out
8753347 then when you put your shoe back on the laces are much tighter than the one on the other foot so the rest of your day is disrupted
8753348 but in the end you know you can never win and you eventually have to stop sometimes in the middle of a busy street or a shopping mall and take your shoe off
8753349 the thing thats in there often turns out to be so much smaller than you think sometimes you turn your shoe upside down and you dont even see the piece falling out its so tiny you have to listen for it landing onto the floor to be sure

8753352 is helping me build a community of dog owners here it makes us a very visible example of responsible dog ownership

8753354 we have ceos of silicon valley based companies and people at much lower pay grades we all share the love of dogs ive been shocked to find out who some of these people are
8753355 you go to a dog park and people are standing around while the dogs get the exercise

8753358 its something that weve been looking at for quite a while now and the pieces fell together this summer after engaging some of our fans in the process
8753359 fans will see the mascot at community appearances and kids activities and occasionally at a wild home game if kids families or one of our community partners is involved
8753360 there are many community events and appearances that we would like to have a presence at but because of the demands of the nhl schedule and the sheer number of appearance requests we receive during the season we havent been able to participate
8753361 we feel that well be able to fulfill many more community and kid related requests by adding a wild mascot
8753362 were expecting a great crowd and hopefully great weather and a great walk out for us
8753363 its a lot as you can see by looking around theres several of them
8753364 it works like a bagger from your lawnmower we pick up threads tape and we usually always find a mouthpiece

8753388 each and every one is bringing something else to the table
8753389 obviously the older generation is not as diverse when it comes to computer skills and the young workers are extremely fluent in the computer communication and programs available today in the construction industry
8753390 if youre lucky enough to have experienced workers along with a young generation you have a terrific combination
8753391 in the past couple months the commercial sector has become a very competitive market because there are a lot of residential firms working for few jobs
8753392 these companies are starting commercial work the market has become far more competitive today than it was a year ago
8753393 you just have be selective in the work youre taking on and be extremely comfortable in what youre doing or you dont do it
8753394 if you compete with someone who puts in the wrong bid youre stuck with job numbers that dont make sense
8753395 you want to keep a small core of people that are experienced and knowledgeable and that you trust
8753396 and if you need additional help you hire on the basis of the project you never assign more than a small and effective core to a project
8753397 like anything else in life communication will make or break anything you do
8753398 its not how well you build but how you reduce the number of mistakes that can be made
8753399 being on top of all issues starts and ends with communication
8753400 this was a very complicated job but the communication between the architect the structural engineer the subcontractor and our company eliminated many potential issues
8753401 there were thousands of embedded plates in the panels and through the coordination of the architect engineer field supervision structural steel contractor and the tilt up panel contractor there were only issues with two embeds
8753402 the building also includes a steel framed tower that rises about 40 feet above the roof of the office portion of the building
8753403 this oval shaped tower also has a sloped roof at the top requiring large tube steel sections that needed to be curved on two axes
8753404 the walls of the steel members would warp as they were bent requiring coordination with the structural engineer in the end this section of the building was completed with minimal impact on the rest of the structure
8753405 the moment you are neglecting to address project issues with all parties its an invitation for problems
8753406 like anything else in life communication will make or break anything you do i think its our personal involvement in every aspect of our projects we have very few people all working together as a team that separates us from others
8753407 they have a number of projects being funded through their measure e school bond a capital improvement bond its an ongoing development and weve been there for five years
8753408 its a very large program in excess of 300 million to accomplish a number of needed additions and improvements on their campuses
8753409 we are driving toward establishing enough of a relationship with these guys that they just call us when theyve got a job to do
8753410 the other day i visited with six different general contractors to keep the rapport up
8753411 it was an ongoing discussion because of all the work on the las vegas strip and the local union reps wanting us to become union
8753412 there were a limited number of union contractors and it took us some time to make such a big decision the farrells and i got together and discussed it for about six months before we decided to fill out the application
8753413 we rely on the union to help us out with labor
8753414 if we land a huge job the union provides us with more field guys
8753415 the first thing you have to do is build a relationship
8753416 the general contractors have to trust you everyone knew who progressive roofing was back then but not aw farrell i initially sent letters out to the masses to let everyone know about the change we also hired an outside sales 152 b amp c s o u t h w e s t f a l l 2008
8753417 we would like to have a permanent presence in every sector of our region geographically
8753418 that created the need for not only schools but also for more police stations fire stations wastewater treatment and other services
8753419 but all that came to a halt it all slowed down
8753420 overall the industry is going through a correction and residential is having a reciprocal impact in certain public sectors like the k 12 education market
8753421 and as the residential market slows people change their plans to relocate
8753422 a lot of school funding is based on local bond measures and if passed they are based on assessed valuation of homes
8753423 when the value of homes decline the ability to issue bonds is also severely impacted a lot of planned bond sales revenue stream for public sector projects took a hit so were seeing slower growth in schools right now
8753424 even in the public sector there are some funds somewhere
8753425 this will create a very efficient juvenile justice system for the county of fresno
8753426 juvenile wards would be able to go from their court hearing to serving their sentence all in the same location having to do that without the added transportation costs and associated expenses in being decentralized is being eliminated
8753427 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
8753428 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8753429 who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8753430 no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him
8753431 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly said avery shenfeld senior economist at cibc world markets
8753432 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8753433 a lot of the monthly indicators are suggesting recession but things like new orders and gdp suggest the economy is improving
8753434 if the us economy were growing at its potential pace the unemployment rate would not have risen a full percentage point over the past year said citigroup economist steven wieting who argues that data on new jobless claims are
8753435 with economies abroad slowing and the one time impact of tax rebates dissipating we expect annualised economic growth to recede to near 1 0 per cent in the third quarter and to maintain this pace into early 2009 before gradually improving said peter kretzmer an economist at bank of america
8753436 the better than expected outcome overall does not change our view that the economy is weakening with the beneficial effects of rebate checks and foreign demand fading fast smith said
8753437 even if the damage from the approaching storm is fractional it could still be significant
8753438 sparse capacity means that every barrel of oil lost to the marketplace will be felt particularly as the northern hemispheres winter is just around the corner
8753439 regardless of its predicted path it is important for citizens in the gulf coast region to listen to what their local officials are advising over the course of the next few days and to take these simple steps to prepare
8753440 this is an exciting eleventh hour opportunity for players who have not yet secured their seats to the online tournament of a lifetime low stakes and the chance to win big its a dream for most players
8753441 if there was any deep division in the music scene in 1977 it wasnt people scratching their heads at less than stellar releases from kansas foreigner styx or steely dan and neil young it was the demise of live music as disco came to prominence i could make the argument that kansas nugent and other arena acts gained fans because people who hated disco really hated disco myself included
8753442 john jansens comments made me think of some of the bad things white people have done timothy mcveigh terry nichols the unabomber not to mention almost all the serial killers in the u s and all those arab terrorists theyre caucasian i just dont think we can afford to have white people running this country they are way too dangerous
8753443 i really used to be amazed how these individuals could be so blatant about who they really are and yet have their assemblies still pour money into their pockets so they can live like movie stars and then you have those who are of the new faith cashians and followers of santa christ

8753470 scientists have known for years yams contain high amounts of steroidal glycosides which are naturally occurring steroid alkaloids
8753471 listen some oranges contain 30 mg of vitamin c others contain over 300 mgs whos to say the trelawny yam isnt just chock full of natural steroids and if you eat enough of them you will get a steroid like effect
8753472 the problem for scientists is that we could never liberate all those powerful steroid alkaloids and make them usable until now
8753473 we just got finished with a clinical trial study on naturally occurring steroidal glycosides and the results were staggering
8753474 what we were able to do is cleave the sugar molecule off the steroidal glycoside and liberate its enormous nitrogen retaining effect
8753475 and as everybody knows steroids dramatically increase nitrogen in the muscle cell making it bigger stronger and faster
8753476 im using it on some of my pro ball players and theyre getting huge steroid like results with no steroid side effects some of them are getting so big and strong their agents have phoned me swearing up and down im giving them real juice i had one young player who gained 13 pounds of muscle in 30 days and lowered his 60 yard dash time by 3 seconds

8753511 wars and elections are both too big and too small to matter in the long run the daily work that goes on it adds up
8753512 i have to say that throughout my time in the position there hasnt been an abundance of them
8753513 weve garnered a lot of awards over the years for our customer satisfaction and the quality of our product
8753514 one of the things that we do is we survey our customers and we use a company called eliant
8753515 they survey about 190 divisions of builders across the country and we use that to benchmark ourselves we consistently score in the top tier of that rating and in the past have garnered no 1 rankings in the country
8753516 in addition to that zurich insurance is perhaps the major insurer of homebuilders in california and zurich is concerned about the quality of their homes because theyre insuring those things so they have a vested interest in making sure builders are building quality homes
8753517 they do that by conducting spot inspections on their builders in the latest zurich spot inspection we scored the secondhighest score that zurich has ever scored in their history
8753518 having the data to actually look at your product from a number of different ways i can confidently say we build a pretty great product

8753543 during a crisis the ability to communicate is even more critical for individuals families and emergency response personnel we are committed to providing our customers with the best network coverage possible in every situation
8753544 our preparations are designed to give customers maximum reliability from their wireless phones at the time of greatest need
8753545 in 2005 we saw in a very personal way that people depend on their wireless phones as a lifeline to the outside world not just for a day but for weeks and even months at a time

8753548 in our case photography is still waiting for interest to build im thinking of interest in photography as works of fine art that you might buy and hang in your home we expect to get that far eventually in some places it has already begun
8753549 i started out as a fashion photographer one cannot say that i was successful but there was enough work to keep me busy i collaborated with harpers bazaar and other magazines i was constantly aware that those who hired me would have preferred to work with a star such as avedon but it didnt matter i had work and i made a living at the same time i took my own photographs strangely enough i knew exactly what i wanted and what i liked
8753550 i spent a great deal of my life being ignored i was always very happy that way being ignored is a great privilege that is how i think i learnt to see what others do not see and to react to situations differently i simply looked at the world not really prepared for anything
8753551 somehow i feel like i can reach out and touch memory somehow it is malleable you can manipulate it form it shape it it certainly can shape you

8753568 there are a lot of aspects that look like a right wing think tank im very worried about that possibility
8753569 people are concerned about the blurring of the line between friedmans technical work in economics and his fairly well known persona as a political advocate of a very pure free market conservative or neoliberal position where the market is the solution to everything
8753570 donors will receive reports and attend lectures but they wont belong to the institute
8753571 they will have nothing to do with its direction and no economist worth their salt would take that kind of direction anyway we will bring in people from all over the world with all different approaches

8753581 but because those urls are now blacklisted so rapidly the spammers needed a way to bypass the filters they use these little swf files

8753594 the speakers notice seeking reply to the showcause within 24 hours was in violation to the rules framed by the assembly to deal with the cases filed under the xth schedule of the constitution
8753595 the bjp leadership suspended us some two years ago but koda took up the issue on the eve of the trust vote its known that we will vote against the soren government so mundas action is aimed at supporting soren during the trust vote
8753596 i can say with conviction that the situation in assam is much better than in most other states if a proper development strategy is adopted and followed these can be resolved in due course assam is doing exactly that pursuing peace and development side by side
8753597 we dont have as many blasts as in ahmedabad or need to beg for land from any politician like it is happening in bengal our government takes independent decisions that reflect the aspirations of the people but sadly only the negatives get published that we set up three medical colleges at one stroke was not highlighted nor was the fact that we are setting up a knowledge city a change of mindset is required vis vis assam i thank the telegraph for at least trying to bring about some positive changes through this initiative

8753608 that being said weve spent the last two months working with agencies to ensure that theyre going to maintain their core services
8753609 the governors actions will put abused and neglected children at greater risk reduce access to medicaid and food stamps and further harm state parks and historic sites
8753610 were continuing to work with the agencies on management plans for further savings
8753611 its going to be devastating to local communities that depend on these sites for tourist revenue

8753634 millimeter wave technology another form of body imaging technology uses non ionizing electromagnetic waves to generate an image based on the energy reflected from the body
8753635 creates an image that looks like a chalk outline of the passenger with threats outlined but does not reveal facial features

8753638 millimeter wave technology pinpoints objects made of any material including liquids rubber wire plastic and metal to quickly and easily locate weapons contraband and other threats concealed under an individuals clothing
8753639 the portals detect concealed and hidden objects such as metallic and non metallic weapons and virtually all known explosives and other contraband in seconds
8753640 the images generated through millimeter wave are lower resolution than that of x ray backscatter and as a result privacy may be less of a concern for the traveling public
8753641 first this technology produces strikingly graphic images of passengers bodies those images reveal not only our private body parts but also intimate medical details like colostomy bags that degree of examination amounts to a significant and for some people humiliating assault on the essential dignity of passengers that citizens in a free nation should not have to tolerate

8753650 it may involve changes to the structure it may involve changes to material but they result in not so many differences in the safety levels of the vehicles
8753651 the bumper to absorb energy to reduce the risk of injury is not the kind of bumper system you would design to help protect the vehicle
8753652 the data that we have really drives the direction and the nature of the standards we develop

8753678 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly said avery shenfeld senior economist at cibc world markets
8753679 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8753680 a lot of the monthly indicators are suggesting recession but things like new orders and gdp suggest the economy is improving
8753681 if the us economy were growing at its potential pace the unemployment rate would not have risen a full percentage point over the past year said citigroup economist steven wieting who argues that data on new jobless claims are
8753682 with economies abroad slowing and the one time impact of tax rebates dissipating we expect annualised economic growth to recede to near 1 0 per cent in the third quarter and to maintain this pace into early 2009 before gradually improving said peter kretzmer an economist at bank of america

8753693 australian jockeys are among the lowest paid in the world
8753694 they ride because they love the sport but they deserve basic protections
8753695 thats why we are asking for a small proportion of the racing industrys prize pool to be set aside for the jockeys who put their lives on the line when they saddle up
8753696 it would be a shame to see it disrupt something like the spring carnival
8753697 if jockeys are not provided basic protections more of them will leave the sport putting the ongoing viability of the industry at risk
8753698 behind the glamour of the racing industry there is a side the general public dont see

8753700 they shouldnt also be expected to risk financial ruin each time they race

8753709 our goal is to become a national leader in the definition and advancement of emerging academic fields in computing through the development of successful divisions that integrate computation with the arts humanities sciences and engineering
8753710 clemson realizes the importance of computing to education and research and is already ahead of many universities in developing an infrastructure that supports computing across all disciplines
8753711 clemsons goal is to be one of the nations top 20 public universities and in that quest one of the most important contributors is to have named professorships and named endowed chairs to enhance research and educational activities in a sustainable manner

8753849 it is good for them to help players learn english when i learned english i became a better player but to suspend them i dont think so
8753850 we have been puzzled if not surprised by some of the reactions
8753851 you have to interact effectively with your pro am partners you need to be able to do media interviews and you need to give a winners acceptance speech in english
8753852 they must speak at a level that effectively accomplishes those three things
8753853 what were seeing is that a handful of players dont speak to the level they need to be
8753854 were not just looking at the lpga as it is now
8753855 were looking at the future of the lpga as you well know we have a large international membership all indications are its not going to get smaller
8753856 if were getting any criticism its coming from outside the organization its not coming from the players and those are the people to whom it applies
8753857 surely if you can say hello thats english is that good enough
8753858 who draws the line about how many words youve got to know in english
8753859 its a big step to actually put it out there
8753860 i remember what roberto de vicenzo once said to me

8753867 its like starting over its like having a newborn in the house again are you prepared for that
8753868 no nobody is ever really ready for a newborn but it has to come out sometime so this has to happen sometime
8753869 no we wouldnt choose to have storms but what we will find in the storm is god who changes our fears to faith

8753872 todays data on gdp was encouraging and that is what investors really want to see a tick up in the economy
8753873 you hate to be underweight stocks when you have an economy that is performing better than expected

8753885 it is a big mistake for politicians to talk theology
8753886 it was in your room i noticed something unusual in your room have you redecorated recently
8753887 oh my god its the bracelet madison made me what the hell are you doing with it

8753889 i dont think you have a penchant for crappy kindergarten jewelry i know you like madison because for some reason you find children cute wait you find
8753890 mckay i dont know where you think youre going with this
8753891 but maybe you just want to be a part of me and as freaky as that sounds in a pining for me from a distance sort of way maybe having something of mine and hiding it and wearing it every day means yes i think you you are youre in love with me
8753892 i would like to ask the distinguished representative of the united states weapons of mass destruction have you found them yet in iraq or are you still looking for them
8753893 im not a psychologist and i dont know what brought on the free association we heard from ambassador churkin
8753894 those are well known we thought we had overcome them apparently there are still some lingering frustrations but there is no territorial ambition or desire to dismember iraq
8753895 im afraid this assertion ambassador churkin simply does not stand up to scrutiny
8753896 even if the damage from the approaching storm is fractional it could still be significant
8753897 sparse capacity means that every barrel of oil lost to the marketplace will be felt particularly as the northern hemispheres winter is just around the corner

8753901 we support the efforts for self determination and sovereignty of native hawaiians consistent with principles enumerated in the apology resolution and the native hawaiian government reorganization act
8753902 it refers to the apology resolution which is an apology for an illegal overthrow so it is a major recognition it tells us all that it was democrats who took this step for the state of hawaii
8753903 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
8753904 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8753905 who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8753906 no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him
8753907 all i want is for lindsay to be healthy and in a good relationship
8753908 i want her to use the gifts she has in the best ways and to help others i said it from the very beginning show me who you walk with and i will tell you who you are people may deceive us but our eyes and facts dont open your eyes
8753909 not from racial composition per se but from the better educational background and higher educational aspirations that are on average found among whites
8753910 the penetrating and punishing effects of neighborhood poverty undercut these efforts
8753911 i really believe if children come into a diverse classroom they model each other
8753912 you ll find them looking and seeing the children who are getting the praises and they start to mimic that because they want to be noticed right away
8753913 i think it needs to be diverse both economically and culturally if we are living in a diverse nation and world we need to have that here as well they need to know what is going on out there not just drugs alcohol prostitution and new babies
8753914 this is no more racially motivated than the man in the moon
8753915 i m not saying they re racists because i do not know what s in their hearts
8753916 but i do know they don t care they shoved this down our throats
8753917 if the government is going to send children 13 miles away to their school the government is preventing the parents from getting involved in the school at all and also preventing their children from having any after school activity
8753918 that s not the right side of the public school system to be on
8753919 we agreed on 2 000 rupees and he upped it to 2 700 61 just like that
8753920 its raining here people are on rooftops begging to be rescued

8753922 we are hungry were thirsty we have to drink something
8753923 then its all up to god as water levels are rising
8753924 everything else is gone i have had everything robbed from me
8753925 i came back to my staff and said i never never want to go to the consecration of another memorial for victims of terrorism
8753926 i want you to help us doing it alone is like one hand clapping
8753927 the royal canadian mounted police csis and other agencies have lost credibility
8753928 we don t target the muslim community we are trying to work with you
8753929 i want families to know these people are not following islamic laws they are not following american laws they claim they are serving islam but they are just serving themselves
8753930 within the islamic community the family has such a high status that everyone is worried about compromising one s honor and dignity people are also afraid to give islam a bad name especially in the current climate
8753931 i remember him saying the first time i m renting this for my wife and she will be here at a later date to pick up the keys
8753932 moments after we passed by a christian village people set it on fire and everything was over within minutes
8753933 over 300 people fled our village and have taken shelter in the forest
8753934 here we have almost nothing to eat theres a constant downpour our children are sick
8753935 our officers came under attack from bottles bricks and other missiles for two hours
8753936 there are a small minority of criminals who use the cover of darkness and crowded streets to cause trouble
8753937 i have watched the notting hill carnival go from strength to strength each year to become an internationally acclaimed event
8753938 nothing beats the sounds of the steel pans the aroma of delicious caribbean food and the dazzling colours of the costume parade
8753939 the carnival is the perfect london spectacle to captivate the world with its dazzling array of costumes and music
8753940 this year s event was enjoyed by more than a million people as the sights and sounds of the caribbean and other cultures came alive on the streets
8753941 i love the music and the dancing and i m definitely going to come again next year
8753942 i wrote the book in the hopes that children will get better lives
8753943 i want to see more integration and the responsibility for that lies with the somalians themselves and with the authorities
8753944 i m tired of being patient with a situation where children aren t getting enough food at home where women are beaten by their husbands where welfare payments to the somalian families are used by the men to buy the narcotic khat where the willingness to simply obtain more welfare money is stronger than the ability to care for children
8753945 half of the somalians in norway have been here less than five years have little education and have problems integrating
8753946 choose life choose a job choose a starter home choose dental insurance leisure wear and matching luggage choose your future but why would anyone want to do a thing like that
8753947 my best friend had a shave there raved about it and i was able to book a deluxe shave for my boyfriend by their lead stylist danny
8753948 the only thing i love more than double entendres is really good pizza and really artistic macncheese

8753952 sometimes its the chalk and the cheese that make the best combination
8753953 its not always best to have two people the exact same hooking up together because you know theyll have nothing new to teach each other
8753954 we had such a great time making this movie im just so glad that our good feeling has come across on screen
8753955 even a third of the way into the shoot everyone was saying oh id love to do another one and given the box office it seems very likely that we will be
8753956 or analysed it too much we just knew from my audition that we had chemistry and that we should take our cue from that it would see it through
8753957 yeah we used ourselves as a barometer of what might work
8753958 we would try a scene different ways to see what worked and we would always find one version where we would look at each other and say thats the one that works
8753959 because i think everything he does is funny so im a little biased
8753960 i think we both approach the success with a grain of salt
8753961 este es un sector intr nsecamente informal donde se perdi el principio de autoridad que se ha empezado a poner en vigencia en los ltimos tiempos

8753969 am anfang dachte ich lieber zu viele als zu wenige finger oder zehen nach den b z berichten ber yassir wurden wir auch auf der stra e angesprochen einige nachbarn rieten uns von einer op ab andere sahen sogar besondere chancen f r yassir dass er zum beispiel ein gro er klavierspieler werden k nnte aber letztlich haben uns die medizinischen argumente berzeugt
8753970 der berfl ssige zeh h tte nicht in normale schuhe gepasst und gleichgewichtsprobleme bringen k nnen die zus tzlichen finger teilten sich einen mittelhandknochen h tten nie vollwertig funktionieren k nnen die spreizung der finger w re immer gr er geworden und h tte ihn im alltag stark behindert
8753971 die wunden sind gut verheilt wir sind dem helios klinikum sehr dankbar weil es sehr seltene und deshalb schwierige operationen waren
8753972 in meiner privatpraxis habe ich einfach viel mehr zeit f r patienten
8753973 heilen ist wichtiger als unendlich geld zu scheffeln so verdreht wie das klingt bin ich deshalb auch heute nur noch f r privatpatienten da in meiner kassenarztpraxis hatte ich bis zu 100 patienten pro tag in der sprechstunde das ist flie bandarbeit 40 euro zahlte die kasse pro patient und quartal egal wie oft dieser vorbeikam man kann es als arzt auf dauer nicht vertreten wenn man nur 5 minuten pro patient zeit hat ihm nichts verschreiben kann was hilft in der privatpraxis behandle ich maximal 12 patienten am tag f r jeden ist eine halbe stunde zeit ich verdiene rund ein drittel weniger als vorher aber ich habe wieder spa an der medizin und das wichtigste ich kann den kranken wirklich weiterhelfen
8753974 ich behandle alle patienten gleich egal wie sie versichert sind
8753975 kassen kranke d rfen keine patienten zweiter klasse sein ich behandle gern und ich behandle alle gleich meine praxis hat rund 1000 feste patienten dazu zwei heime die wir betreuen plus hausbesuche bei alten menschen
8753976 die patienten gehen h ufiger in die praxis zudem leben in berlin mehr chronisch kranke als im bundesdurchschnitt

8753978 i just think its really important that we acknowledge the multicultural nature of darwin
8753979 one option is a rotating prayer story another option is to just acknowledge country and get rid of the lords prayer
8753980 its probably more correct to do a recognition of country than to do the lords prayer
8753981 what about the prayer for the flying spaghetti monster wed better include the prayer for that as well
8753982 i think its a way for the council to show that they recognise diversity
8753983 usually its a prayer that relates to community harmony and peace and finding common ground

8754010 a tenor del anexo ii del acuerdo acuerdo europeo de 15 de noviembre de 1975 sobre las principales v as de tr fico internacional una irculaci n automovil stica accesible s lo desde accesos o cruces reglamentados y en la que est especialmente prohibido detenerse o estacionar en la calzada no resulta que las v as situadas en las reas urbanas est n excluidas a priori al contrario hay que considerar que situadas en aglomeraci n urbana el t rmino v as r pidas que re nan las caracter sticas previstas en el citado anexo
8754011 tambi n se debe se alar que ese mismo acuerdo define el c oncepto de autopista en el sentido de que designa en particular una no cruza a nivel otras v as de tr fico automovil stico ni v as de ferrocarril o de tranv a ni caminos para la circulaci n peatonal y que est especialmente se alizada como autopista pues bien aun si la directiva modificada no remite expresamente a esa definici n el acuerdo puede ser un omprensi n del concepto similar contenido en el anexo i de dicha directiva
8754012 es preciso considerar que los est n comprendidos en el mbito de aplicaci n de la directiva modificada
8754013 a tal fin debe puntualizarse que el hecho de que el de la directiva modificada se refiera a los proyectos relativos a la construcci n de las clases de v as que en l se mencionan en tanto que el asunto principal tiene por objeto proyectos de reforma y mejora de una v a existente queden excluidos del mbito de aplicaci n de la directiva modificada en efecto un proyecto de reforma de una v a que por su amplitud y sus caracter sticas sea equivalente a una construcci n puede considerarse relativo a una construcci n en el sentido de dicho anexo v anse en este sentido las sentencias de 16 de septiembre de 2004 comisi n espa a c 227 01 rec p i 8253 apartado 46 y abraham y otros antes citada apartado 32
8754014 por ltimo hay que destacar que al igual que el tribunal de justicia ya ha se alado en relaci n con la directiva 85 337 el objetivo de la directiva modificada no puede eludirse mediante el fraccionamiento de un proyecto y que el hecho de que no se considere el efecto acumulativo de varios proyectos no debe tener como consecuencia pr ctica que se sustraigan considerados conjuntamente puedan tener efectos significativos en el medio ambiente
8754015 en lo que ata e a los proyectos controvertidos en el litigio principal de la resoluci n de remisi n resulta que todos ellos forman parte del proyecto de conjunto madrid calle 30 incumbe al juez remitente verificar si deben ser objeto de consideraci n conjunta proximidad geogr fica a sus similitudes y a sus interacciones
8754016 en consecuencia procede responder a las tres primeras cuestiones planteadas que la directiva modificada debe interpretarse en el sentido de que prev la
8754017 the discussion of race is a sensitive difficult issue even today in our society and of course the apology is not the end of the story
8754018 but it does reaffirm our national commitment to understanding and addressing in the words of the resolution how to rectify the lingering consequences of the misdeeds committed against african americans under slavery and jim crow and to stop the occurrence of human rights violations in the future
8754019 the fact that this government has not apologized to its own citizens african americans for the institution of slavery and for the jim crow laws that followed and accepted that fact and encouraged changes in our dialogue and understanding in the actions of this country to rectify that is certainly a mistake and today we rectify that mistake
8754020 just be a good human being countries should operate in the same manner slavery is abhorrent
8754021 injustice amongst some of us is injustice for us all
8754022 reparations are certainly one of the signals that america can send if they are serious about reconstituting american culture
8754023 it also resolves that there should be a commitment to rectify the lingering consequences of the misdeeds committed against african americans under slavery and jim crow and very importantly and to stop the occurrence of human rights violations in the future that does not say specifically anything about reparations but it also is important language because it does not exclude it
8754024 whats clear is that reparations is something that has legal precedent but its a political storm and game thats going on and for you to say youre sorry when we already knew and for you to say that we know that you continue to suffer its just insulting
8754025 and shame on us as black people for not addressing and responding to this en mass but we dont know who we are and if you dont know who you are you even dont have the wherewithal to know that you have to find a true ending i dont suspect that youre going to get some miraculous
8754026 what happens now is the next logical piece because your dialogue with me is im sorry i dont care about dialoguing about it because this is nothing new for us white people always want to dialogue but they dont want to change the hand of power you havent done anything for me because youve said youre sorry and i dont believe youre sorry because you continue to do the same behavior
8754027 post traumatic slave syndrome americas legacy of enduring injury and healing
8754028 i think an apology for the atrocities of slavery was long overdue
8754029 but i find it very interesting that mr cohen would call for a national apology during a heated election when he clearly needs african american votes for over 20 years while serving in the tennessee general assembly he never thought to ask the state of tennessee for an apology not once
8754030 before you can heal youve got to say im sorry thats basic psychology 101
8754031 if you hurt somebody and dont say im sorry how can you move on
8754032 this year marks the 200 th year of the end of the slave trade which was largely ignored by america americans blacks everybody is just not tracking that whereas other countries are at least paying lip service to the relevance of the end of the slave trade so america is in deep trouble around the world everybody hates america the american dollar is falling for instance the ghanaian cedi is equal to the american dollar or a little less than but a few of years ago it was like 100 million to one
8754033 weve got to be careful and look at the timing of this apology number one theyve served to barack obama the question of reparations with the intent of alienating either one or both communities no matter what his response is
8754034 whether its native american issues whether its african american issues and reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just to offer words but to offer deeds

8754057 i was just showing them the far side book i won last night
8754058 i was going to ask if you wanted to join us
8754059 oh like i have nothing better to do than explain cow jokes to the pegasus galaxys version of tarzan and jane
8754060 and you wonder why people dont want to sit with you
8754061 i need to see you and your team in the control room
8754062 you did tell your team that this wasnt an urgent matter
8754063 the malp we sent to mss 696 sent back some images that i really think you should see
8754064 you dragged us all the way down here to show us a jungle
8754065 thats what i want you and your team to go and find out
8754066 its asgard there was one just like it on cimmeria
8754067 seriously dont you people ever read the sgc mission reports
8754068 cimmeria was the first planet we encountered the asgard thats where sg 1 met the hologram version of thor as in thors hammer any of this ringing a bell
8754069 the asgard were one of the four ancient races that formed an alliance thousands of years ago along with the nox the furlings and the ancients we had always assumed that the four races had come together in the milky way galaxy but if this stone pillar is asgard
8754070 then maybe the ancients and the asgard go back even farther
8754071 no offence but isnt this more of an archaeological thing maybe we should send one of the anthro teams to check it out
8754072 elizabeth please enlighten the ranking military officer of atlantis on what a find like this means
8754073 we need to know what the asgard were doing here we have never before encountered asgard technology in the pegasus galaxy and the asgard have never mentioned anything about having been here which leads me to believe that their presence here was either marginal
8754074 or they were up to something that theyd rather we didnt know about
8754075 hey do you think they might be interested in setting up some kind of time share deal this place would make a terrific vacation spot maybe we can make that a priority in the negotiations
8754076 hey shouldnt we be going across one at a time
8754077 you know put less strain on the ropes do you have any idea how old this thing is it could be thousands of years old for all you know it could snap any second
8754078 you made it up are you insane i could have been killed
8754079 that was uncalled for even if it did get him to cross the bridge
8754080 i am sorry rodney it was not my intention to deceive you i truly did feel a wraith presence nearby
8754081 i sensed it only briefly and then it was gone it is very possible that i imagined it
8754082 maybe but from here on out we do things by the book ill take point ronon youve got our six
8754083 youd be complaining too if they were out for your blood
8754084 i am teyla emmagan and this is lieutenant colonel john sheppard ronon dex and dr rodney mckay we are travellers seeking alliances for trade and to aid in our ongoing battle with the wraith
8754085 we came here to study the stone pillar near your stargate we didnt realise there was anyone living here until we came across the trail leading through the forest
8754086 you are interested in the machinations of our god byleist
8754087 the stone with the writing byleists stone theres more like it
8754088 actually im probably this galaxys leading expert on the subject
8754089 kalell is our home our superman is ing tal lead council of the pawnim people
8754090 ronon id like you and teyla to head back to the gate and let dr weir know whats going on ill stay here with mckay
8754091 ing tal said hed let me look at the asgard relics after dinner
8754092 but you stay close to me i mean it no wandering away to look at shiny things that catch your eye
8754093 oh yes i have every intention of sneaking away at the first opportunity so i can get picked off by one of the blade happy mountain men
8754094 i hear that you are a brilliant scientist that you have unlocked the secret machinations of byleist
8754095 ive been known to unlock a few secrets every now and then
8754096 only the reason the asgard were here thousands of years ago and why the wraith havent been here since
8754097 what did you think i was doing all this time
8754098 well from what i can make out there used to be an asgard science lab here the exact nature of what they were studying is unclear but it had something to do with longevity and rapid cell regeneration if i had to guess id say that the asgard came here to study the wraith they probably thought they might find a solution to their genetic entropy problem that explains why there havent been any wraith cullings on this planet within living memory
8754099 okay did i just skip ahead a few pages cause that made no sense
8754100 there are no wraith here because the asgard set up that transporter at the gate to trap them and send them somewhere else probably to an underground holding cell like the one on cimmeria
8754101 i thought you said that the transporter thing hadnt worked in ages
8754102 its been stripped clean on the inside but theres no way of knowing how long ago that happened
8754103 so that means the wraith could return now and thered be nothing to stop them from making happy meals out of the whole town
8754104 i dont want to alarm you but theres a very real possibility that kalell could come under attack from the wraith
8754105 the god byleist watches over us always and keeps us safe he has done so since before recorded time
8754106 i hate to tell you this but byleist is no longer on the job
8754107 your god can no longer watch over been gone a long time now
8754108 byleist is with us always watching us watching you it was he that warned us of your arrival
8754109 byleist told us that you might resist your fate dr mckay
8754110 you should not fear it it is the destiny of all our greatest minds to make the ultimate sacrifice
8754111 dont worry we will allow him to witness the sacrifice
8754112 byleist will want you prepared for the mountains fire we must hurry he demands a high moon sacrifice
8754113 byleist we have done your bidding and brought before you the travelling scholar is it your wish that we should proceed with the sacrifice
8754114 proceed with the sacrifice as instructed and bring the other travellers to bear witness once i have received the offering your peoples safety will be guaranteed until the next harvest moon
8754115 we must move quickly if we are to reach the summit before the moon is high
8754116 i was hoping i wouldnt have to carry you up the mountain
8754117 if you have to sacrifice someone it should be me as the leader of my team i demand you take me in his place
8754118 id like all of you to go with dr beckett to the infirmary and get checked over well debrief once hes cleared you
8754119 mckays death has been a shock to all of us but i fear it has had a much greater effect on john
8754120 i get saved from the fiery pit of an active volcano only to get eaten by a wraith nobodys luck is that bad
8754121 i must confess it is refreshing to receive a sacrifice that doesnt cower and shriek before me
8754122 i see that it is true then that you understand this asgard technology
8754123 i didnt say that i just put two and two together and reached the only plausible conclusion
8754124 i have been monitoring you since your arrival in kalell i know that you are this galaxys leading expert in asgard technology your own words i believe
8754125 if youll recall im pretty sure i said i was probably this galaxys leading expert and thats true as far as i know but this is a big galaxy and theres bound to be someone out there who knows more about it than i do i mean it stands to reason doesnt it im just saying that i may not know as much as you think i know even though its true that i know a lot okay ill shut up now
8754126 if you value your life youd better hope you know enough about this technology to be of use to me
8754127 what do you need me for what possible use could you have for asgard technology anyways
8754128 in the pawnim repository you told lera and colonel sheppard that you believed the asgard were here experimenting on the wraith as part of a plan to increase their species longevity through rapid cell regeneration
8754129 this is the very laboratory you postulated was here the asgard as you call them used that device to manipulate their genetic code i have tested it on many of the previous pawnim sacrifices but the machine does not work you will fix it
8754130 that thing may never have worked in the first place and even if it did its been out of commission for tens of thousands of years do you even know what its supposed to do
8754131 the pawnims understanding of the asgard language is somewhat limited
8754132 but i believe this machine was designed to blend wraith genetic material with that of humans to create a hybrid capable of rapid healing and regeneration
8754133 i have fed recently and can go for quite a while before i need to feed again but make no mistake i will feed off you fix the machine and you will be able to regenerate and become the first human to survive a feeding refuse and i will make a meal of you now the choice is yours
8754134 but i should warn an astrophysicist genetics isnt exactly my area of expertise
8754135 you will do what you can and you will test the machine on yourself you will know if you were successful if you are still alive after i feed on you it is that simple
8754136 perhaps a few years trimmed off your life will motivate you
8754137 physically hell be fine he wont be using that arm any time soon but it could have been much worse no what im worried about is his mental state
8754138 aye for all the good it will do ive never met a more stubborn man when it comes to talking about his feelings
8754139 shes the best if anyone can get john talking she can
8754140 although i have a feeling when it does it wont be pretty
8754141 rodneys absence will leave a big hole in a lot of peoples lives
8754142 teyla and ronon filled me in on what happened on the planet
8754143 ronon sensed nothing but goodwill from the pawnim people and you know how distrustful he is of strangers both ronon and teyla never saw it coming
8754144 i know you are john we all are just promise me youll talk to someone whether you feel you need to or not humour me
8754145 if we were under attack then i wouldnt have to to deal with this
8754146 i i dont know if i can deal with this elizabeth the truth is ive been thinking about going back to earth
8754147 give it a few days john thats all i can ask if you still feel the same way then i wont stand in your way
8754148 theres nothing i can do to fix it because theres nothing to be fixed it isnt broken
8754149 as you already know the machine stores genetic information in its buffers to use later in the process of integration but what you didnt know was that they were using dna from the iratus bug which is like some long distant relative of the wraith the reason nothing happened when you tried the machine on your past subjects was that the iratus bug dna samples stored in the machines buffer have degraded too much over the years to be of any use so unless you happen to have a spare iratus bug lying around here somewhere
8754150 if what you say is true if this iratus bug is genetically related to the wraith then can we not use a sample of my genetic code in its place
8754151 already be changing one variable by using a human in the place of an asgard that alone might be enough to mess with the results now if you switch wraith dna for iratus bug dna on top of that
8754152 you forget that i have nothing to lose should the experiment fail you however stand to lose a great deal
8754153 you will no doubt be pleased to learn that the first part of the experiment was a success
8754154 you were unconscious many hours and i have grown impatient it is time to begin the second part of the experiment
8754155 i demand that you call rodney down here this instant so i can kill him before i start to cool down
8754156 okay job well done very good now to find a way out of here
8754157 i saw how you desecrated its resting place and i know you have it give it back now and i wont summon the guards for an execution
8754158 i am within my rights to kill you myself for thieving my property
8754159 he was a stubborn egotistical hypochondriac with a chip on his shoulders the size of new york at least thats what most people saw when they looked at him but those of us determined enough to get past all the bluster and sarcasm were allowed to see a glimpse of who the real rodney mckay was
8754160 its true he was riddled with insecurities and he was afraid of pretty much everything but thats what made it all the more amazing that he was always able to do what we needed him to do and if he was here today
8754161 i never told him any of this i wish i had i guess i just thought there would be more time
8754162 they must have got rodney to give them his idc before
8754163 if it is the pawnim id like to meet them face to face they have a lot to answer for
8754164 please stand back everyone i need a bit of room here
8754165 thats just it elizabeth i cant be certain until weve had a chance to speak with him ive run his dna and its almost an exact match save a few wee anomalies plus his blood work and brain scan turned out to be an exact match for our rodney if it werent for those tiny differences in his dna
8754166 actually id place him more in his early twenties although i doubt his age is the result of any genetic changes in his dna
8754167 like i said well know more once the lad is awake
8754168 when he arrived it looked like he was badly wounded
8754169 physically hes perfectly healthy his blood sugar was dangerously low when he first arrived but i put him on an iv drip and he levelled out remarkably quickly
8754170 whatever hes been through it has undoubtedly been very traumatic
8754171 hes sleeping very deeply slept like a baby through all the tests the poor boys exhausted
8754172 rodney or not that young man is my patient now and he will wake up when hes good and ready youll just have to be patient
8754173 perhaps we should take this opportunity to eat and relax i believe we have all missed lunch and im sure dr beckett will inform us the moment rodney wakes up
8754174 i was wondering when you were going to join us
8754175 you have to lock me up in the brig and post guards on me like right away
8754176 youve gotta be kidding me have you people no sense of self preservation you need to strap me down now
8754177 i assure you theres no need for that but if it makes you feel any better ill have you know theres a guard posted outside the door
8754178 what of course that doesnt make me feel better one guard thats not nearly enough
8754179 ye daft bugger youre the one told me to put you in restraints
8754180 forgive me for not wanting my friend to end up a dried husk on the floor
8754181 did you stop on the way to get pizza what took you so long dangerous man here
8754182 any chance you think it might be safe enough for us to come down there now were all kind of curious to hear what happened to you
8754183 so long as these trained military monkeys promise not to hesitate to shoot me at the first sign of trouble and when i say shoot i mean stun you got that right
8754184 im glad youre here saves me the trouble of having to go through all this a second time
8754185 are you telling us that the wraith came about as the result of a messed up asgard genetic experiment
8754186 yes carson you get a gold star for managing to keep up
8754187 arent the asgard those tiny big headed aliens like the one on the daedalus
8754188 theyre tiny like little kids i could easily snap one in half like a twig but the wraith
8754189 yes yes believe it or not i dont need you to connect the dots for me
8754190 the reason the asgard look the way they do now is because of the degenerative side effects of their cloning process basically hermiods current body is a copy of a copy of a copy and so on and each successive copy is genetically inferior to the previous one hermiods original body which most likely ceased to exist tens of thousands of years ago was not all that different from our own according to samantha carter who saw one of their preserved ancestors the asgard were once a tall lean and mostly androgynous race of people which when combined it with iratus bug dna led to the creation of the wraith
8754191 were you even listening i drained the life right out of him
8754192 on his own weapon i might add you were only defending yourself and unless you got off on it
8754193 or he ended up a dried up withered old man
8754194 then youre not a wraith rodney youre just the victim of really bad timing
8754195 rodney id like to run a few more tests in light of what youve told us including a full body scan
8754196 am i green or something or or did my eyes go all weird like a wraiths what arent you telling me
8754197 i just want to say for the record that i think the hair looks cute
8754198 theres no way that genetic manipulation could result in in this
8754199 i have a theory and if im right then its possible you may have just stumbled across a means of defeating the wraith once and for all
8754200 i guess its just good to know your appetites havent changed
8754201 mm its incredible maybe its because i havent eaten anything in days
8754202 i want you to come and have a look at this
8754203 what is it im supposed to be looking at exactly
8754204 that rodney is a sample of your skin cells once i knew what it was i was looking for it wasna hard to find dyou see the wee purple circles in each cell
8754205 carson this makes as little sense to me as the continued success of britney spears will you just tell me what youve found already
8754206 those tiny purple dots are mitochondria but theyre not the kind normally found in humans theyre similar to something i found in the wraith samples ive studied and i believe theyre whats responsible for cell regeneration in the wraith allowing for rapid healing and virtually halting the aging process
8754207 rodneys mind whirled at the implications of what carson was telling him
8754208 as you may recall the wraiths regenerative abilities are directly related to how recently theyve fed cut off from their food source the wraith become as susceptible to injury and cell death as humans which is why they hibernate between cullings
8754209 but i cant feed off people so by your theory those little purple dots should be dormant and yet i walked away from a sword fight without as much as a manly scar to show for it
8754210 and ive also noticed the way the needle marks disappear the instant ive finished taking your blood youre absolutely not a wraith any more than teyla is and you cant feed the way they do its my guess that your regenerative abilities are a direct result of the wraiths attempt to feed on you the enzyme he released into your system must have triggered the dormant mitochondria to become active drawing energy from the wraith through the link he created between you sort of like a car battery needing a boost and having the other car supply the jumper cables
8754211 aye im fairly certain its also the reason for your rejuvenation
8754212 look its not as if ive ever come across anything even remotely like this before most likely the regenerative effects will fade as they do in the wraith but i wont lie to you there is a good chance that they might be permanent the introduction of the wraith enzyme into your system may have supercharged your batteries as it were the effects of the experiment on a human subject are simply too difficult to predict without further study
8754213 i thought youd be thrilled at the idea of becoming virtually invulnerable youve admitted yourself that youd jump at the chance to get your hands on another personal shield
8754214 yes well the point of a personal shield is to prevent pain and injury something i might add that is far more preferable than suffering first and healing quickly afterwards
8754215 i should probably run him through some basic training make sure the new and improved mckay is up to field work
8754216 just take it easy on been through quite an ordeal these last few days
8754217 to see if i still have the ability to heal
8754218 and you didnt think a pin prick was good enough you had to try and kill yourself
8754219 okay i might have cut a little deeper than id intended
8754220 but i assure you it wasnt the first test id tried i was fairly certain of the outcome
8754221 yes fairly certain is as good as it gets when dealing with the unknown last i checked my newfound abilities didnt include prescience
8754222 i came down here to spring you from the infirmary
8754223 after the stunt you just pulled youre not going anywhere unless you have someone with you understood
8754224 you were in there for almost an hour mckay whatd you expect
8754225 i think were gonna have to get you some new clothes
8754226 dr weir has asked me to retrain you for field work
8754227 essentially youre a whole new person rodney youre younger fitter probably more coordinated and those are all good things but the point is youre different now and id rather know what your new strengths and weaknesses are before we set foot through the gate again
8754228 well start off with something easy alright after all its not like we can do any serious physical training until we get you a new set of workout clothes so what say we begin with weapons training and target practice sound good
8754229 colonel sheppard tells me you ran the marine training course
8754230 what that little jog really i hardly broke a sweat i dont know why the marines make such a big deal about it
8754231 i have often heard them boast of the difficulty of the course
8754232 i look forward to our sparring session later this afternoon rodney i have no doubt that your skills will impress me
8754233 you have done more than enough training for one day
8754234 now i believe there was mention of a snack earlier
8754235 you go right ahead mckay ive got performance reviews to go over before the daedalus arrives teyla ronon
8754236 i dont know what sheppard told you but im fine i just had a temporary lapse of judgement
8754237 rodney i agree with john that you need the support of your friends right now
8754238 i cannot even begin to understand what you must be going through you must have many questions and concerns weighing on your mind
8754239 a really bad one granted but i promise thats all it was look i know you mean well but you dont have to watch me every minute how much trouble could i possibly get into in a crowded commissary
8754240 i did have plans to visit dr heightmeyer this afternoon
8754241 you go along then ill be fine here until you get back
8754242 i will return in half an hour i trust you will still be here
8754243 and if they had stayed with me like youd asked them to instead of pawning me off on combat barbie here i wouldnt have tried to eat my way into an early grave with a piece of lemon pie
8754244 but the point is theres something wrong with me and you need to fix it
8754245 what are you still doing here go away dismissed or whatever
8754246 but despite evidence to the contrary i am not infallible
8754247 ill have you know that ive been through a hell of a lot over the last few days more than any normal human could withstand i daresay and its quite possible it has had a negative effect on my judgement as youve probably discovered by now my survival instinct is generally very strong
8754248 but since the whole volcano thing ive been a little off my game
8754249 i told you the first time was completely unintentional it was an experiment it doesnt count
8754250 but thats still a pretty big deal have you thought that maybe this is something you should be talking to heightmeyer about
8754251 and if it turns out you cant or wont help me out with this then ill go see her i just thought that with your past experience with this sort of thing you might have some insights that could prove useful
8754252 exactly what sort of thing are we talking about here
8754253 what were talking about is our shared history of violence
8754254 youve killed people ive killed people i need you to tell me how you cope with it so i can get over this little slump and get back on track
8754255 im black ops trained rodney ive knowingly and willingly pulled the trigger that ended a human life what happened between you and the pawnim sword smith was an accident its not the same thing at all theres a big difference between killing in the line of duty and killing in self defence you know
8754256 i i keep thinking about it from his perspective you know
8754257 i broke into his house in the middle of the night and tried to steal something that meant a lot to him and i was desperate john i must have looked desperate and dangerous and he had a little boy sleeping upstairs he must have thought he was only defending his home and his family when he attacked me you would have done the same
8754258 thats where youre wrong mckay i would never have attacked an unarmed man i would have tried talking to him first
8754259 please would you just can i just get through this
8754260 he did try talking first he said he wouldnt call the guards if i gave him back the gdo but i couldnt do that it was my only way home and then i ran and he was on me and we fought
8754261 he was huge and furious and he had one of those weapons you know like the kind the klingons use but i took him down and it was easy it was almost effortless which kind of scared me and then i heard a sound his kid must have seen the whole thing i just looked over and there he was john the look on his face
8754262 i know youre having a hard time with this right now but youve got to believe me you did what you had to do to survive and you made the right choice dont forget the pawnim had no qualms about throwing you into an active volcano
8754263 and you think that justifies taking another mans life and orphaning his child thanks for the help dr phil im sure ill sleep much better now
8754264 is there a pressing reason why you came banging on my door or was it your sole purpose to drag me out of my shower so you could stand there like a pair of pantomimes while i catch cold
8754265 youre telling me you tried to take your own life not once but twice today and you only just now thought to bring it to my attention
8754266 did i not tell you to let me know the instant there was any change in your condition
8754267 sheppard and i think it might be a side effect of the asgard device
8754268 right lets get you back to the infirmary shall we
8754269 is that the wraith enzyme that was fuelling your cells regenerative abilities is beginning to break down and is being released into your bloodstream at this rate you should be back to your old self in a matter of days
8754270 the bad news is that as the enzyme is released in his bloodstream in spurts rodney experiences episodes of euphoria and impaired judgement basically he gets high off the enzyme and in between spurts he crashes
8754271 like when i took a dose of the enzyme to get past those guards on fords planet
8754272 so far the enzyme is being released incrementally which should make the withdrawal symptoms bearable nevertheless id like to keep you here under observation for a few days just in case your condition worsens
8754273 please colonel keep your voice only just managed to get him to sleep hes had a very rough time of it im afraid
8754274 i thought you said he was going to be fine you said the withdrawal would be manageable
8754275 it was for your own good i know you havent been sleeping lately and atlantis needs its military leader well rested besides there was no point in calling you when there was nothing you could have done to help rodney
8754276 as i was telling the colonel last night the wraith enzyme is breaking down in rodneys system causing withdrawal symptoms i thought the process would take days you have to understand were dealing with alien human hybrid not something weve had much experience with
8754277 im still not certain why the enzyme was released all at once but for rodney the effect was like receiving a massive dose followed by an equally massive withdrawal thankfully rodney is too stubborn to give up and being in his twenties again certainly helped alleviate the stress on his heart
8754278 over the worst of it and hes sleeping it off with the help of a sedative but i daresay hell be feeling pretty miserable for a while yet
8754279 if rodneys restored youth was the result of the wraith feeding shouldnt he be older now that the enzyme has worn off
8754280 i assumed his rejuvenation was due to the botched wraith feeding and thats still the best explanation ive been able to come up with but as yet we dont know enough about the wraith to fully understand what they are capable of to be honest until this happened i had no idea it was possible for the aging process to be reversed only time will tell what the effects on rodney will be im sorry to say
8754281 i gave him enough sedative to keep him out for hours but the daft man keeps fighting it
8754282 im too tired to eat oh god you dont think the enzyme has permanently messed up my metabolism do you and wipe the smirk off your face this is serious hypoglycaemic remember
8754283 relax rodney youve only just come out of the pegasus galaxys version of rehab that would be enough to ruin anyones appetite give it some time and youll be wolfing down doughnuts just like the good ole days youll see
8754284 is there some reason why you keep touching me colonel
8754285 you wanna run that by me again this time without half of atlantis military personnel watching
8754286 tell me you havent noticed the way you and everyone else around here have been treating me those that dont act like im a plague victim seem to have developed the sudden urge to grope me and its not just you sheppard elizabeth carson teyla hell even ronon cant seem to keep his paws off so what gives am i suddenly less repulsive now that im younger are appearances really so important to you people because i promise you i am the same bad tempered ill mannered arrogant genius i used to be
8754287 actually i wasnt expecting you to attend the meeting rodney dr beckett informed me that he gave you strict orders to take it easy for a few days
8754288 im sitting in on a meeting not running the marine training course which i did incidentally
8754289 like loki byleist was less than scrupulous in his scientific endeavours the brothers were working together to create a cross species clone that would nullify the degenerative effects of our cloning process however their failures early on in the experimentation stage made it clear that our species genetic code had become too corrupted to withstand the cross species blending invariably the stronger genes of the second species became dominant in the pairing creating clones that were only marginally asgard in make up needless to say their preliminary trials were deemed misguided and dangerously flawed by the asgard scientific community and when they were warned to abandon their work they chose instead to flee to the pegasus galaxy m any years later loki returned to our home world alone according to his accounts byleist was killed by the by products of their experiments the creatures you now know as the wraith
8754290 clones youre saying the wraith are botched asgard clones but but but that makes no sense
8754291 from everything ive read about asgard cloning any clone created using byleist or loki as a template would have had an exact copy of their consciousness at least thats what happened when loki cloned general oneill so why would their clones suddenly turn on them
8754292 you are quite correct dr mckay under normal circumstances a clone receives an exact duplicate of the original consciousness however we are uncertain of the methods used by byleist and loki here in the pegasus galaxy it is possible they removed the clones from the device before the final stage in which the consciousness is transferred or it is possible that the alien species they chose to integrate into their clones was too strong overriding the implanted consciousness to satisfy the baser requirements of their new bodies
8754293 what youre telling us is that rodney the rodney sitting at this table is
8754294 incredible well that explains why youre in your twenties at least it would make sense to create clones that were at their peak physically
8754295 im sorry rodney i realise this must be terribly difficult for you but you must admit it is fascinating
8754296 i find out im not even really me and you think its fascinating
8754297 just because your body is a new model doesnt mean that youre not the real rodney mckay right hermiod
8754298 you are indeed a clone however the consciousness you harbour is identical in every respect to the original
8754299 i came out of that machine alone or did you think i simply failed to notice another me in the room
8754300 the asgard learned long ago that it is problematic for a consciousness to exist in two bodies simultaneously as you can imagine there were moral legal and psychological issues involved in persuading the previous host to remove themselves from the equation and allow the new hosts to take over their lives to avoid such difficulties it was decided that all asgard cloning devices be equipped with an eradication beam that would instantly and humanely dispose of the original body once a new clone was successfully created and imbued with a consciousness however the eradication beam was only just being integrated into the devices at the time loki and byleist escaped to the pegasus galaxy there is no way of knowing for certain if their device had this beam
8754301 so youre saying the device may have destroyed rodneys original body
8754302 it was the only plausible explanation im dead i mean not me but me
8754303 from the sounds of it theres a good chance their machine didnt have this eradication beam
8754304 then wheres the other me hmm if that device didnt zap me into oblivion then where did i go
8754305 is your new body not an improvement over the old one
8754306 and beckett has been completely useless in predicting what being part wraith might mean for me
8754307 you know im right we have absolutely no idea what kinds of surprises i could be in for like what will happen to me if a wraith ever tries to feed on me again have you thought about that will i get my wacky hybrid superpowers back or will i be un life sucked until im a toddler again it was bad enough having to go through puberty once i do not want to suffer through it a second time thank you very much
8754308 oh and on what do you base that assumption on your years of study on the subject
8754309 we could re create it using the data stored in the devices buffer
8754310 what if the wraith imprisoned him or he somehow managed to escape from the mountain what if hes out there somewhere and he wants his life back hes the original me he has dibs on my life i suppose youd probably get rid of me youd have to youd just dump me on some backwater planet where my vast intelligence will go entirely to waste or have to kill me because i know too much oh my god youre going to kill me arent you
8754311 im not whining im voicing legitimate concerns about my future welfare
8754312 you would be too if you were just a cheap knock off of the original
8754313 do you really see yourself as a cheap knock off
8754314 im me i know that but if it turns out there are two of me which one of us do you think will get the boot
8754315 guess were about to find out one way or the other
8754316 we arrived in orbit a few minutes ago and ran a routine sensor sweep i thought you might want to take a look at this
8754317 but on the bright side at least you wont be fighting with the other you over who gets to keep the orthopaedic mattress
8754318 do you realise that if the asgard cloning device hadnt worked that wouldve been it no more rodney mckay
8754319 just what part of he needs to rest dyou not understand
8754320 dr mckay were picking up two wraith cruisers on long range sensors weve got an hour and a half tops before they arrive so if you want to retrieve that information from the planet we need to move now
8754321 mckays in no condition to go running around an active volcano just yet
8754322 like i said hes in no shape to go on a mission
8754323 fine well scrap the mission for now and return for the device the next time the daedalus makes a run to the pegasus galaxy
8754324 were here we have plenty of time until the wraith arrive and and and i want my body back
8754325 now if you dont mind i need to get my equipment together
8754326 i want both teams on an open frequency at all times im giving you one hour to get the job done and get out of there understood
8754327 im sure i mentioned in the briefing that i destroyed the console
8754328 actually i think your exact words were i disabled the device i think this classifies as more than just disabling rodney this looks more like a texas chainsaw massacre
8754329 yes well i might have used a little more force than was strictly necessary but in case youve forgotten i was under considerable stress at the time
8754330 we can still retrieve the data from the buffer right
8754331 ive been working undercover amongst the pawnim for the last six years
8754332 what interest could the genii possibly have in the pawnim
8754333 we are after the same thing as your dr mckay many years ago we learned from one of our agents whod infiltrated a sect of wraith worshippers that the wraith had stumbled across a piece of alien technology that would allow them to feed off the same victim many times over i was sent here to join the community and report back everything i could learn about the technology i believed that the device if used properly could be used as a defence against the wraith but it was in need of repairs which is why i had dr mckay sent down to byleists hidden laboratory
8754334 wait you were the one who had mckay thrown into the volcano
8754335 the wraith posing as byleist was growing hungry and demanding a new sacrifice be made if dr mckay hadnt arrived when he did i would have been next and as much as i wanted to get my hands on that device i knew my skills werent up to the task of fixing it
8754336 you sent our friend to his death in that mountain
8754337 except you and i both know that isnt the case the night following the sacrifice a young man bearing the face of dr mckay was seen fleeing from the scene of a murder the dead mans six year old son said that his fathers attacker had the strength of three warriors and healed from a deadly wound in the blinking of an eye when ing tal went to consult byleist concerning the matter however he was met with an uncharacteristic silence
8754338 so the people of the village assumed that byleist was unhappy with them and they panicked
8754339 but i knew the truth that dr mckay had succeeded in fixing the device and had managed to kill the wraith
8754340 it appears that the pawnim are not the only ones to have noticed byleists absence
8754341 there are two wraith cruisers on the way here most likely sent to discover what has happened to him you must warn these people to evacuate before it is too late
8754342 i fail to see how the pawnims plight is my concern
8754343 it is when your voice goes up at the end
8754344 its not going smoothly is that what you wanted to hear
8754345 but whether youre ready or not caldwells been breathing down my neck for an answer
8754346 we need another hour at least to get this machine functioning again
8754347 but thank you so much for making the situation less stressful
8754348 teyla just told me the same thing seems the locals are convinced that byleist will return to save them if theyre deemed worthy so theyre not budging now let me tell you the same thing i told got ten minutes
8754349 its all youve got and were cutting it dangerously close as it is caldwell out
8754350 youve got ten minutes so get the lead out of your butt and get working
8754351 we need like two minutes three max were almost there
8754352 colonel there are a number of villagers making their way to the stargate ronon and i would like permission to accompany them so we can provide further protection from the wraith if it is needed
8754353 weve got hull damage on level six and our transporters and sensors are down
8754354 turn a slow see if we can get a visual on the target
8754355 okay so it looks like weve got a bit of a walk ahead of us
8754356 the wraith showed up and did a number on the daedalus transporters weve been ordered to make our way back to the stargate and rendezvous with the rest of our team back on atlantis
8754357 dont worry caldwell took out both cruisers and hey now you can take as much time as you need to finish your work
8754358 i thought you said you could get it working again
8754359 getting it to work is not the problem at least it isnt the biggest one any more
8754360 hermiod noticed that the buffer is only large enough to store the genetic information from one source at a time
8754361 unfortunately i inadvertently damaged the hardware that would have allowed us to access the data which means we wont know if its me or the wraith in there until we power it up and see what comes out the other end
8754362 look i dont know okay it could be five minutes or it could be five hours trust me no one wants to get out of here more than i working as fast as we can
8754363 no no no just give it some more time its too soon to tell for sure
8754364 whats the matter dont tell me youre afraid of heights
8754365 the asgard are unaccustomed to physical pursuits of this nature however if traversing this mountain is something of which you are capable i am certain i will encounter little difficulty
8754366 now the first thing we have to do is turn around and face the mountain
8754367 right good now weve got a decent sized ledge and plenty of good handholds so all you have to do is put your hands and feet where i put mine just follow my had lots of experience rock climbing
8754368 tell me is there anything you dont know how to do
8754369 never oh let me one of those guys who think theyre too macho to dance
8754370 i was just thinking about what was going through my head the first time i sat here after escaping from the lab
8754371 its silly really i was alone exhausted and starving and id just faced several of my worst fears and all i could think was that if youd been there you would have been proud of me
8754372 he fixed the alien machine he knows where to find the secret entrance to the laboratory now let me done everything youve asked of me
8754373 the others too you promised to let us go free
8754374 i will allow you to go but the others stay as collateral until dr mckay delivers the device into our hands
8754375 yes you you will take us to the device and explain to us how it works
8754376 so you automatically assumed i was dying thanks for the vote of confidence in my survival skills mckay
8754377 hey better to think the worst and be pleasantly surprised than the other way around
8754378 did you see that that was incredible seriously carsons gotta figure out a way to give this gene to all of us maybe with a retrovirus or something
8754379 and the other one tried to eat me but i killed it sucked the life right out of it and not a toddler
8754380 how about putting those super powers to work and helping me up
8754381 do you think you can stand on your own once i get you up on your feet
8754382 just put me down over there where the undergrowth is nice and thick
8754383 i think doofus about covers it if you think for one moment that id leave you here to get eaten by wraith or thrown into a volcano by the crazy locals
8754384 rodney you cant carry me across the gorge on your back
8754385 well im certainly not going to carry you over in my arms
8754386 you know what i meant last time i saw you cross this thing you hardly made it ten steps before you seized up and that was without having to worry about balancing another persons weight on your back
8754387 stop it that tickles you dont want me to giggle at an inopportune moment and lose my footing do you
8754388 get a move on would ya my arms are getting tired
8754389 oh you have got to be kidding me how is this even remotely fair
8754390 why would you even say something like that of course i wont let go
8754391 thats colonel obvious thank you and if youd let me finish i was going to say that you dont need to carry me for this i dont need the use of my legs to climb a rope
8754392 but you go first if you slip i can catch you
8754393 if i go first and i slip well both go down
8754394 either you go first or we just sit here all day because im not moving until you do and dont think for a moment that i cant do it super strength remember
8754395 i am not losing you again do you hear me
8754396 colonel sheppard i believe i can save him if you would please move out of the way
8754397 well why didnt you say so in the first place
8754398 you just died and came back to life no biggie
8754399 sorry buddy best i can offer is a power bar
8754400 so anyone else think we should make haste before the merry men over there decide to pull out the bows and arrows
8754401 you sure youre feeling up to it so soon after
8754402 you werent kidding were you about the mostly dead thing
8754403 we still need to get moving how are you doing can you walk yet
8754404 seems like weve picked up a few stragglers two pawnim women and three children seeking refuge on atlantis oh and colonel sheppard requires medical assistance so youd better give beckett a call
8754405 he took a wraith stun blast to the legs the man cant even walk please tell colonel invulnerable that he needs medical attention oh and better tell carson that he should probably save a bed for me too
8754406 it looks much worse than it is hard to believe i know but trust me i feel fine maybe a little twitchy and im so hungry that i wouldnt even turn my nose up at tofu but otherwise im fine great even
8754407 elizabeth thank god can you tell dr mosquito here that if he drains any more of my blood for his wacky experiments the well will run dry and why cant i get my nutrients the old fashioned way a tall glass of apple juice and some all i ask although i wouldnt say no to some roasted chicken and a nice side of garlic mashed potatoes
8754408 yell get your food just as soon as im convinced you can keep it down youre the one who was complaining about feeling queasy if youll remember
8754409 our young rodney has just recovered from near mortal injuries shortly after having been fed on by a wraith as before the enzyme activated his wraith genes which allowed him to heal but he lost a good deal of blood and
8754410 do you remember when i explained how rodneys regenerative abilities are fuelled by the enzyme
8754411 aye well the feeding charged his battery as it were but the energy required to help him heal from a wound that should have killed him has all but sapped it dry
8754412 rodneys about to go through a sudden massive withdrawal from the enzyme as it was the last time he suffered a withdrawal it was touch and go but i fear that in his weakened state having lost so much blood elizabeth i have to warn you that its highly doubtful hell be able to pull through this time
8754413 no and i dont plan on tellin him theres no sense worrying him over something we can do nothing about
8754414 i am sorry colonel but jumpers are off line there were no scheduled flights until 0900
8754415 we are installing new synchronized flight program none of the jumpers can be brought on line until the program has been fully uploaded
8754416 all i could think about was how disappointed youd be in me if i took the easy way out
8754417 you know id be a lot more than disappointed right
8754418 well of course you would my untimely demise would no doubt throw all of atlantis into utter chaos
8754419 not that i think you guys cant do your not as if elizabeth hired a bunch of imbeciles to man the most important expedition humankind has ever launched and before you say anything yes i am aware of the fact that i refer to my staff as a bunch of idiots on an almost daily basis but really thats like a term of endearment coming from me certainly i consider zelenkas brain to be first rate naturally hes not up to my level of genius but hes brilliant nonetheless and hes definitely my choice to take over my position when im gone oh do you think i should tell elizabeth that not that theres anyone else on atlantis even remotely capable of filling my shoes but maybe i should make it an official request
8754420 no i dont think youve got anything to worry about there
8754421 then whats with all the doom and gloom talk about handing over the lab keys to zelenka
8754422 so if anyone has the right to know its you
8754423 carson doesnt think im strong enough to survive another withdrawal from the enzyme
8754424 aye but it was wrong of me to keep you from the truth the way i did
8754425 you should never have had to learn of your prognosis that way
8754426 i wont lie to you your chances are slim at best but there is still a chance thats why i chose not to tell you i thought youd fight harder if you didnt know the odds against you
8754427 i always do my best when faced with impossible odds just ask sheppard
8754428 of course you are right rodney we have only just arrived on the daedalus and learned of your predicament we do not doubt that you will come through this stronger than ever
8754429 yes thank you for the in depth psychological profile agent scully
8754430 no i do or at least i will im sorry for what i might say the last time when it got bad lets just say i might say things horrible mean things and i want you to know that im sorry you know in advance
8754431 hes hanging on by the barest of threads frankly its a miracle we got him back at all and hes weaker now his hearts undergone a severe strain i feel i should warn you all that he wont be able to survive another crash like that
8754432 fine but only for a minute or two i mean it his condition is highly unstable and i cant risk you getting in the way if rodney takes another turn for the worse
8754433 okay buddy i only have a minute here before carson kicks me out so listen up
8754434 this is the crunch time this is the time where you pull off another one of your famous hail mary moves this is dozens of darts on a collision course with atlantis and youve got 40 seconds to get the shields up this is a sixty foot wave about to crash into the city and youre the only one who can get the lightning down to the shield generators in time its all down to you now pressures on and everyone here is counting on you to come back to us so youre going to keep fighting im ordering you not to die you got that rodney
8754435 relax rodney youve been get the tube out just as soon as youve calmed down
8754436 hey there sleepyhead welcome back to the land of the living
8754437 youve been out of it for the better part of a day
8754438 i feel like an elephant parked itself on my chest
8754439 yeah you made it doc says youre out of the woods now but you gave us a hell of a scare back there your heart stopped three times last night and every time we thought wed lost you for good
8754440 you ordered me not to die didnt you you were there the whole time
8754441 you must be hungry would you not rather come with me to the commissary
8754442 im gone for a few days and suddenly the entire science department decides to play hooky what is this junior high whats next spit balls to the back of my head when im up at the whiteboard of all the immature irresponsible and what were you and miko doing lurking around in the hallways i can usually count on the two of you at least to actually do your jobs am i not giving you enough to do is that it because that can be rectified my friend
8754443 i told them it would not work that you would sniff out the truth just promise you will not be too hard on them their hearts are in the right place their brains however
8754444 okay back up sparky what did the idiots do this time and how big a mess am i gonna have to clean up
8754445 thank you now as many of you already know dr rodney mckay recently celebrated his third year anniversary with the atlantis project
8754446 that when rodney came to me almost two weeks ago and proudly announced this achievement i was less than enthusiastic in my response
8754447 it was definitely a wake up call for me i can tell you i came to realise that as weve been moving from one crisis to the next somewhere along the line we forgot to live our lives so when miraculous circumstances returned rodney to us alive and whole if somewhat younger than before
8754448 i decided it was time to stop simply surviving and to really start living again
8754449 we are all aware of how precarious life here can be
8754450 so tonight we raise a glass to celebrate three years on the most incredible journey of our lives and to second make the best of them
8754451 under the circumstances im willing to allow you one drink but mind ill be keeping an eye on you
8754452 i said youll be happy to know that young pax has been taken in by an athosian family he now has a brother and two sisters and he seems to be adjusting surprisingly well all things considered
8754453 you do not fool me rodney i know for a fact that you have been inquiring after the pawnim boy just as often as he has been asking after you
8754454 ah if youll excuse me i uh ive got this thing and i should really be going
8754455 okay you got me what the hell are you doing mckay
8754456 so what is it then you suddenly develop a taste for the great outdoors
8754457 these things are disgusting what could people possibly find attractive about sticking a smelly carcinogenic weed into their mouths and lighting it on fire as if there werent enough things in this universe out to kill them they feel it necessary to seek out a slow and horrible death coughing up blackened hunks of their own lungs
8754458 okay so you know how alan shore and denny crane are friends best friends
8754459 well i was thinking that maybe you and i could be flamingos like denny and alan
8754460 we could hang out here on the balcony after missions and whatnot and and talk and such
8754461 but it was a comfort thing between friends there was nothing sexual about it
8754462 no they werent they just had a a special friendship it wasnt about sex
8754463 and neither am i but okay john you and i have been through a lot of
8754464 mmm how eloquent but been through a lot of crap together and what im trying to say is that will you quit smirking already this is hard enough to say as it is
8754465 as i was saying you and i already have a deep and unusual friendship by all rights the two of us shouldnt get along at all but we do hell even ronon pointed out once that we act like an old married couple most of the time
8754466 i know this may come as a surprise to you but ive always been a bit of a loner my longest relationship lasted all of six months and it only lasted that long because she lived in a different province
8754467 so you want us to what get married or something
8754468 why am i even trying look forget i ever mentioned it alright my mistake
8754469 not until you promise to stay put and listen to what i have to say
8754470 well im not saying ill marry you and im not having sex with you but im willing to give the other stuff a go
8754471 but can we please drop the term flamingos it kind of creeps me out
8754472 for another thing alan is a verbose liberal minded neurotic individual with a fear of clowns and denny is a gun toting flag waving captain kirk
8754473 youve really put a lot of thought into this havent you

8754479 if you dont have any you can recipe that stuff about only the
8754480 largest foodborne disease outbreak identified in the united states in the past decade based on the number of culture confirmed cases
8754481 a lot of people have had questions about it whove booked places for this weekend and beyond i talked to a guy who rented a home on 29th street for the middle two weeks of september bringing his whole family here and he said his wife was thinking of doing a cancellation
8754482 this was something that avalon did not bring on to itself it could have happened on any beach anywhere
8754483 that was the nightmare that you forgot and here its back again
8754484 i think everyones awareness has been heightened since the avalon incident
8754485 the incident in avalon may be a good test of the regulations and programs and laws in place to track down medical waste to its source hopefully there will be swift action

8754491 i would rather have a clean government than one where quote first amendment rights are being respected
8754492 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
8754493 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
8754494 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions
8754495 i pick up in mind a polynomial with nonnegative coefficients i can give you values of the polynomial only at most at two points that you pick can you tell me exactly the polynomial that i am thinking

8754698 i think the challenge that has gotten people so frustrated is they hear of all these great things they hear of the federal government saying weve approved over 100 billion

8754709 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8754710 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8754711 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8754712 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8754713 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8754716 the speech is one of the biggest and possibly craziest gambles of this or any other presidential campaign of the modern era it has every possibility of looking like a nuremberg rally it has too many variables to guarantee a good tv picture the set the athenian columns looks hokey big crowds can get in the way of subtle oratory

8754721 obviously lag will be a huge problem for online play
8754722 in order to prevent the lag were thinking about trying to balance it up at user interface level and input timing by using joystick or something like that we still havent got a complete plan as yet were still working on it thats all we can say at the moment

8754739 my understanding is that they will use the engine the maya files where the characters come to life but theyll be creating animated i think its a 20 minute cartoon
8754740 im personally quite intrigued to see how it comes out
8754741 if youre out there reflects the themes of hope and change responsibility and leadership and commitment to a better tomorrow expressed in the principles of barack obama and the hearts of the american people
8754742 weve been doing a lot of work on it in a conception level and getting into casting and crew and stuff in the number of times ive been to
8754743 its very much in the spirit of bryans books and certainly in terms of the first and second books there are whole sections that are straight from the books but then it slightly takes on its own momentum and kind of pace

8754747 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
8754748 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8754749 who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8754750 no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him
8754751 all i want is for lindsay to be healthy and in a good relationship
8754752 i want her to use the gifts she has in the best ways and to help others
8754753 the toughest situation weve faced in the 100 years of this companys history
8754754 its an attempted murder where the accused returned twice to repeatedly attack the complainant with a knife
8754755 the wounds he inflicted on her were grievous the brutality is extreme
8754756 the wagons were circled and everyone who became involved or affected by this story opened up their arms with expertise strength love and sometimes cookies
8754757 because of this reaction my loved ones and i have not only survived the journey but we have thrived coming out of the darkness as stronger wiser and enlightened to the strengths of our community
8754758 im glad its over and i apologize to the family that are hurting and for ryan
8754759 he shouldnt be classified as a dangerous offender he should be classified as someone who needs help
8754760 if anybody judges my son for what hes done they better take a good look at their own backyard
8754761 there is no doubt in my mind about the truth of what i was told by her nor the accuracy of the details
8754762 she not only survived the attack upon her but during the entirety of the attack she made efforts to pay attention and gather evidence
8754763 the accused was in possession of his faculties sufficiently to understand right from wrong
8754764 its important for us to see what is out there
8754765 we want to make sure that our standards and practices are the leading edge practices and that we leave no stone unturned to make sure that the propane facilities are very safe to operate in ontario and that the public is safe
8754766 for the public to have confidence in the public safety system the mcguinty government should have been out front on this
8754767 but its a government that doesnt like to take the blame so theyre shirking their responsibilities and im very disappointed in them
8754768 and i think we need to act on it sooner rather than later
8754769 if thats the case how come so many people have died and we dont know how many more will be showing symptoms
8754770 the ball fell through and consumer confidence is right down the tubes with respect to government and companies like maple leaf its absolutely outrageous
8754771 i think that it should be investigated at the nursing home but i think the plant in which all this has developed it certainly should be checked into very very thoroughly
8754772 its affecting more and more people than you can possibly imagine
8754773 school lunches are going to have to be re thought hospitals cafeteria this is a major major consumer issue
8754774 they have to find out what caused this so that it can never happen again
8754775 if they dont find out how do i know that next month its not going to happen again or with some other products more care has to be put into how our food is prepared
8754776 the important message for people is that if you have the symptoms that are associated with listeriosis that you take precautionary actions as you see fit in terms of seeing a health professional or public health person
8754777 because we knew we had made those products we had removed them from sale when the recall was initiated
8754778 we executed the recall we did it effectively efficiently and the products that are now being recalled were prepared and sold prior to the recall
8754779 if theres a problem with a product we pull the product off the floor and begin calling our customers and typically within 24 hours everyones been called
8754780 every game is a big game but thursday is a big chance for us to showcase nationally what we certainly hope to be about as a football program
8754781 the biggest challenge without a doubt is i feel like when people havent had a lot of success a lot of times theyre scared of success we cant be a university thats scared of success
8754782 i like to walk down paths nobody else wants to
8754783 i started walking today i brushed my own teeth today sat up in a chair today fed myself today
8754784 lets just say my foots got caught in the door

8754792 if we are able to detect signs of autism within the first year of life parents will be able to immediately implement an early intervention plan which has already been shown to significantly improve the prognosis of children with autism
8754793 during each session i assess a range of behaviours including those that previous retrospective research has suggested are impaired in infants who later develop autism such as eye contact social and joint attention sensory motor behaviours and temperament
8754794 i also assess overall development parental concern and closely monitor the infants behaviour
8754795 so far i have identified at least six babies who are displaying behaviours or patterns of development that are of concern and may be indicative of autism
8754796 all of these infants are under 12 months of age which is far younger than the current detection age of between 18 months to three years
8754797 ive got to say from my experience negative advertising is satisfying to politicians but tends to turn the community off
8754798 the public of western australia need to be aware of the team that they are going to be electing
8754799 the concern is capacity will be completely overwhelmed and we wont be able to deliver service to people who really need to have blood cultures
8754800 there is no test for those who are asymptomatic because its not clear that would give us any information that would be helpful nor is there any therapy that would be offered
8754801 that advisory as far as i can recall didnt mention what should we be doing if a healthy person comes in and asks to be tested

8754808 they will be able to compete with us on price but not on quality for that reason i dont think it will work

8754810 sierra leone has fantastic agricultural and mineral resources and a large and young labour force it shouldnt be the bottom country in the hdi
8754811 for every dollar that dfid provides to us we raise another ten in investment capital
8754812 if we employ sierra leoneans in the next five to ten years create business management schemes and bring people through managerial processes within our business we would be creating the next generation of managers and this is the only way to change the lives of the majority of the people

8754853 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue abortion that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition

8754862 the clubs go back a long way and many celtic fans have a soft spot for united but of course they wont when we play them
8754863 we had two fantastic games with them two seasons ago losing 3 2 at old trafford and beating them 1 0 in glasgow to qualify for the last 16 and alex ferguson wont want a repeat of that defeat
8754864 the games against celtic will be huge i am sure the players and the fans are all looking forward to that one fixture in the calendar
8754865 even after seeing the teams we have to face you never know if it will be an easy first phase or a difficult one
8754866 our first aim is to get through the group our second is to try to finish first in group b certainly we are very motivated and confident we want to start playing in the champions league as quickly as possible
8754867 bate borisov are a modest side who you have to show respect towards because every team can spring a surprise and if you lose points at the start they can be difficult to make up later on

8754880 castle crashers takes the best elements of traditional side scrolling beat em ups and adds lots of flair theres some great humor here and some nice surprises that will please most the bulk of castle crashers is an enjoyable ride and one every 360 owner should experience
8754881 even at a price of 1 200 microsoft points castle crashers provides great value the main storyline offers hours of bad guy beating and princess rescuing fun that it is sure to please the ability to play with friends should make the experience richer even if it is limited to a more local experience as a testament to its entertainment feature losses and some disappointing online play hardly slow this juggernaut of amusement down this is an absurdly hilarious romp you wont soon forget
8754882 castle crashers is an entertaining brawler but the replay value is chopped into little frustrating bits by a horrifically painful online experience im left wondering why i spent 15 1200 ms points on a five hour single player game multiple playthroughs will unlock new characters but the repetitive nature is a bit tiresome avoid purchasing castle crashers until the developer sorts the major online problems out
8754883 im tired of seeing plays about disfunctional families auguest osage county is overrated maria stuart doesnt bring anything new to the table
8754884 the last time i was here i was performing at the grand which is always fantastic and i actually performed as the invisible man

8754887 bly i too am hoping for hilarity i think kay bailey hutchinson is unlikely because shes pro choice and mccain needs to focus on his base mccain ronald mcdonald is my great hope
8754888 i read that today too and i hope its not true it really makes me fear the lieberman choice or hope for it because tomorrow night is also gores big speech at the convention
8754889 yeah ktm i think rice has that same possibly pro choice problem
8754890 will we risk the confused leadership of an inexperienced candidate

8754892 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly said avery shenfeld senior economist at cibc world markets
8754893 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8754894 a lot of the monthly indicators are suggesting recession but things like new orders and gdp suggest the economy is improving
8754895 if the us economy were growing at its potential pace the unemployment rate would not have risen a full percentage point over the past year said citigroup economist steven wieting who argues that data on new jobless claims are
8754896 with economies abroad slowing and the one time impact of tax rebates dissipating we expect annualised economic growth to recede to near 1 0 per cent in the third quarter and to maintain this pace into early 2009 before gradually improving said peter kretzmer an economist at bank of america
8754897 the better than expected outcome overall does not change our view that the economy is weakening with the beneficial effects of rebate checks and foreign demand fading fast smith said
8754898 what will it take to convince people the us isnt in recession
8754899 the us fed they want to raise rates but because of the fragility of the financial system they have to wait
8754900 at some point they have to raise rates to address inflationary problems
8754901 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world

8754906 australian jockeys are among the lowest paid in the world
8754907 they ride because they love the sport but they deserve basic protections
8754908 thats why we are asking for a small proportion of the racing industrys prize pool to be set aside for the jockeys who put their lives on the line when they saddle up
8754909 it would be a shame to see it disrupt something like the spring carnival
8754910 if jockeys are not provided basic protections more of them will leave the sport putting the ongoing viability of the industry at risk
8754911 behind the glamour of the racing industry there is a side the general public dont see
8754912 our jockeys put their lives on the line each time they race
8754913 they shouldnt also be expected to risk financial ruin each time they race
8754914 insurance is hard to get because theres a lot of falls and theres not enough jockeys to insure
8754915 its a small array of jockeys around australia and thats all they can get

8754930 winning or losing a couple of percent on a coinflip because i made the trade on tuesday and the fed said something an hour after i placed the order
8754931 in theory there is no difference between theory and practice but in practice there is
8754932 although pressure was lost for about five hours wednesday morning there was no indication of contamination and we conducted the tests simply as an added precaution to verify the water is safe to drink
8754933 station does not support the concerned authentication algorithm error 0x000d
8754934 there are so many things that we want to do more than we can do with the resources so when london studio was looking at the early work on eyepet and the prototype of eight days they knew they couldnt do all of them
8754935 i cannot tel but but i can say that they ve been working very hard since the release of shadow of the colossus
8754936 one thing this means is for republicans for once were probably not going to get outspent
8754937 it just shows that theyre very serious about winning this race
8754938 dino rossi did not knock this one out of the park
8754939 when the going gets tough republican rossis going to go to his bush bankrolled friends in washington d c for help
8754940 its an example of them having to bail a governor out a year and a half early
8754941 im sure gov gregoire has hit the big red panic button
8754942 the fact is the republicans dont have a lot of states where they are competitive this year and so theyre certainly going to put their resources here
8754943 this is as we told the union leadership this morning our best shot
8754944 the best package of pay and benefits in the aerospace industry

8754947 so even a small disruption of a week or two can cause a slippage in the delivery schedule
8754948 its my first republican national convention and im eager to represent washington as i cast my vote for john mccain for president
8754949 john mccain is exactly what our country needs right now hes a war hero who can keep our country safe from terrorists hes a spending hawk who can cut the pork from our bloated federal government and hes from the west and understands the importance of our hydroelectric dams
8754950 we felt his time would be better spent on the ground here in washington state
8754951 were now headed toward november and i intend to run as hard as ever he said in the statement
8754952 the grand jury mustve decided that mr smith having taken an oath to testify truly in a state proceeding stated intentionally and contrary to the oath a material matter which he knew to be false
8754953 we are certain that once all the facts are known the involved spog members will be vindicated and absolved of any wrongdoing until that occurs we are heartened by the news that detective ron smith is recovering from his serious injuries and that no other parties were injured except for detective smith and his alleged assailant
8754954 the detective just went bezerk making all sorts of threats and being very angry
8754955 the detective hes doing this intimidating youre a dirtbag anthony dont be calling me its the stuff you see and hear in the movies but when its real its chilling
8754956 at amp ts consumer services agreement is substantively unconscionable and therefore unenforceable to the extent that it purports to waive the right to class actions require confidentiality shorten the washington consumer protection act statute of limitations and limit availability of attorney fees
8754957 conflicts with our states fundamental public policy to protect consumers through the availability of class action
8754958 the broader point is that companies like at amp t cant cheat people out of small sums of money and get away with it
8754959 its important to remember that this decision is based on an old arbitration clause
8754960 weve since revised our arbitration clause to make it more consumer friendly and other courts have upheld it we continue to believe a consumer is better off pursuing a claim under our arbitration clause rather than pursuing a class action

8755000 there is a risk factor there are concerns about the air quality here and thats been an ongoing concern
8755001 given the workload that we face over the next 60 days to kick all that up in the air right now is just not smart
8755002 theres some concern that that might actually make things worse
8755003 we have employees who have conditions which are similar to mold allergies
8755004 the general consensus is its not really good for you

8755019 he spent the majority of his speech wheeling through the things he obviously feels more comfortable talking about the economy social security global warming africa eradicating malaria and hiv aids hillary becoming a debtor nation affordable health care the war on unions income disparity tax policy lost jobs crime rates the american dream hope all of them good things
8755020 all of them good things but things that dont move the needle on what is perceived as john mccains greatest strength keeping us safe
8755021 yes the former president forcefully made the point that the charge of youth and inexperience being leveled at obama was the same charge leveled at him in 1992 but he never made the case why obama would be better at keeping us safe beyond saying he would try diplomacy first
8755022 so while it was good to have clinton unequivocally voice his support for obama and lend his considerable authority to the case that obama is ready to lead his speech felt like a squandered opportunity
8755023 were surprised by how many people opted to get full albums
8755024 but it s a good value proposition talk about something that s been lost and forgotten
8755025 id actually make the point that for us second hand sales is a very critical situation because people are selling multiple times intellectual property
8755026 what were trying to do is build business models that are more and more online supported with additional services and additional content that you get online so people will see the value in not just getting that physical disc to play at home alone but actually playing those games online and paying for them
8755027 in our understanding of the business model we are actually giving away the rights to play and if you just pass it on pass it on pass it on that is not comparable to second hand sales in the normal physical goods area where you have physical wear out second hand cars second hand clothes second hand books theyre all physically wearing out so you have an inferior quality product
8755028 my understanding is that they will use the engine the maya files where the characters come to life but theyll be creating animated i think its a 20 minute cartoon im personally quite intrigued to see how it comes out lego every time theyve had a new brand out theyve done some cgi stuff as well but i think this will be quite different

8755031 the great thing about line rider is its elegant simplicity
8755032 we knew there was so much we could do to it but we didnt want to ruin it by making it too complex
8755033 he came out for about a month and a half
8755034 we put him up across the street and have him come over every day he and our lead engineer here started playing around with the next update of the flash version
8755035 after they did that we sat down and bounced around ideas like game design stuff and what we wanted to feature in the new games
8755036 you just push a button and it spits out an avi
8755037 i started watching these videos come out on youtube and called up techdawg
8755038 we had him come here to help us with course design he amazingly has really good design sense he flew out for about three weeks and sat down and went over game design ideas and tried to figure out what we wanted out of story mode maps
8755039 the differences with the wii are basically in the user interface

8755049 i dont think that developing for the ps3 is hard at all it was much harder developing for the famicom its true i mean give someone whos developing for the ps3 a famicom and see if they can make a game for it they wont be able to yeah thatll prove it well bet a drink on it

8755053 if you ever have a movie night like that again i want an invite
8755054 i wanted the story to have some dramatic power something to hold you i wanted the little side missions which are a staple of casual games to be a little more organic in some casual games they can get a little sloppy at least in wmc the little things such as the parts where you have to mix the chemicals in the lab have some relevance to the main story

8755067 music plays an integral part in action sports games and we wanted to provide the right background to complement the nonstop spectacular tricks and massive jumps in the game

8755075 but judging by for example the number of users who downloaded our patches there were a lot more active players than there were unit sales and i think we can safely say if they were still playing the game by the time our latest patch released and if they were playing on a pirated copy then they were a sale that didnt happen but probably would have had it not been possible to obtain the game illegally
8755076 we have spent a lot of time studying the emotional curve of the game and worked to ensure that the challenge of each enemy wave creates an enjoyable pace and progression throughout the campaign
8755077 we added a number of game mechanics in each level to create a large dynamic range of emotion and strategy so that we can engage both the hardcore gamer and the novice through one shared emotional experience

8755142 and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8755143 hes also going to talk about the difference between him and john mccain barack wants to bring change to washington and john mccain just wants more of the same he will lay that out in specific terms what that means
8755144 when you start with a proposition that the president of the united states is hostile to amtrak it creates a steeper hill to climb
8755145 its not a big secret in this town that joe biden is one of the biggest most vocal champions of passenger rail
8755146 dont really serve any purpose beyond signifying that a mobile device belongs to a 13 year girl or an irreparably confused adult
8755147 make your dog look as important to his friends as he is to you
8755148 since malcolm smith was brought into the picture it seems like the citys making a good attempt to reach out to business owners
8755149 at least we dont feel like theyre just going to steamroll over us anymore
8755150 their reluctance to meet seems to have waned of late and thats a good thing

8755153 this is a very serious crime incident which is very traumatic for victims and also very time consuming for our local police to investigate
8755154 i often ask myself what causes a person so young to commit such serious crimes
8755155 is it the non existence of good parenting for the child lack of values lack of respect for another person or a societal problem in that we have not provided adequate support for the greater family regarding their needs
8755156 leonard was very happy to be a soldier and very happy to be doing something worthwhile
8755157 the goal of peace in east timor was very important to him and it is very important to us
8755158 please forgive my intrusion id said hello earlier perhaps youd missed it im a journalist i freelance while im writing my novel
8755159 i opened your profile and see you do travel tours can i ask you a few questions if you dont mind
8755160 thank you for your comment it is fun to change you can ask it depends on the question as to whether i will answer and yes that is correct about the travel tours
8755161 well we run personal guided tours in world if someone is interested in a certain topic we put together a tour for them and come along giving background information or other help we provide the service for residents or for companys or colleges or tourist institutions
8755162 so you have packaged tours for example if theyre interested in the arts then these are the places to visit and things to see
8755163 right we customize it for the interest of the clients a tour guide avatar comes with you and as i said gives additional explanations while conducting the tour
8755164 what about other virtual worlds or is it just sl
8755165 well we did explore others but flash 3d are not really interesting to tour or others are more or less closed server environments so for now we stick to sl as this allows individual content creations
8755166 have you ever been booted off a sim you were scouting
8755167 well we do respect privacy its mostly the how you interact
8755168 what was the most interesting place youve seen in sl
8755169 geez thats hard to say there are some just breathtaking places either due to creativity of art or by the way how they are designed
8755170 oh i was on a neighboring sim so i tped over its a lovely peaceful place and random is known for his good taste
8755171 people say my god i would never have done that those people are very different from me
8755172 its about having one event to look forward to thats more about the community than about business
8755173 im going to pax because i think it will be fun to meet cool people who share similar interests and the chance to possibly get to talk to some industry folks
8755174 the sizzle is what sells and revealing new information with lasers and booth babes attracts more attention than showing off a game that is going to be released in two weeks
8755175 the type of content at pax isnt much different than the content we had at the first show in 2004
8755176 the dmca was intended to facilitate the growth of electronic commerce not squelch it
8755177 the court finds no reasonable juror could conclude that a comprehensive review of every file would be feasible
8755178 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights
8755179 youtube has gone above and beyond the law to protect content owners while empowering people to communicate and share their experiences online
8755180 so he stole some music and now hes being punished you break the law you go to jail whats the problem here
8755181 whew thank god the war on drugs stopped so we can arrest music pirates arrg matey
8755182 a bunch of rocks you cant break and paths you cant cross
8755183 what i can say for sure is that its a really nice looking game
8755184 since im still just puttering around in the introductory phases i cant tell you much about how it plays
8755185 your obsession with an overweight and biased blog opinion writer is disturbing at best
8755186 what will it take to convince people the us isnt in recession
8755187 the us fed they want to raise rates but because of the fragility of the financial system they have to wait
8755188 at some point they have to raise rates to address inflationary problems
8755189 a sale to a chinese bank would provoke a very negative reaction from the government and public opinion said konrad becker an analyst with merck finck
8755190 champion behind deutsche bank that political figures have called for over many years
8755191 maintains the stability and public confidence in the nations financial system by insuring deposits supervising financial institutions and managing receiverships
8755192 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly said avery shenfeld senior economist at cibc world markets
8755193 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8755194 a lot of the monthly indicators are suggesting recession but things like new orders and gdp suggest the economy is improving
8755195 if the us economy were growing at its potential pace the unemployment rate would not have risen a full percentage point over the past year said citigroup economist steven wieting who argues that data on new jobless claims are
8755196 with economies abroad slowing and the one time impact of tax rebates dissipating we expect annualised economic growth to recede to near 1 0 per cent in the third quarter and to maintain this pace into early 2009 before gradually improving said peter kretzmer an economist at bank of america
8755197 the better than expected outcome overall does not change our view that the economy is weakening with the beneficial effects of rebate checks and foreign demand fading fast smith said
8755198 as part of our preexisting policy we will continue to contact the top users of our high speed internet service and ask them to curb their usage
8755199 if a customer uses more than 250gb and is one of the top users of our service he or she may be contacted by comcast to notify them of excessive use
8755200 if the united states had genuine broadband competition internet providers would not be able to profit from artificial scarcity they would invest in their networks to keep pace with consumer demand
8755201 unfortunately americans will continue to face the consequences of this lack of competition until policymakers get serious about policies that deliver the world class networks consumers deserve
8755202 2008 has been another significant year for the company highlighted by the announcement of a special virgin blue in specie dividend the sale of the new zealand rail operations and the acquisition of the baltrans group
8755203 we are pleased with the performance of our core operations the integration of several new acquisitions and our balance sheet strength which will all support our ongoing strategic development
8755204 we discovered that it was ok to have a little high brow as long you have a lot of low brow thats entertainment value the one thing you want to avoid is the middle brow because the whole world is frigging middle brow at the moment
8755205 mecoms german division for instance comprised of berliner zeitung a national netzeitung an online only newspaper and various magazine titles should pay heed to these words this model might be seen as a good fit for germany

8755213 although kobe bryant apparently would like to join the bulls chicago general manager john paxson sent a message to the los angeles lakers superstar on monday dont count on it
8755214 what i hope is that target and other online merchants will realize how important it is to reach 1 3 million people in this nation and the growing baby boomer population who will also be losing vision
8755215 right now publishers are on a crash course with e textbooks they are expensive and impractical for a large portion of the student population
8755216 open textbooks are the way to let digital textbooks live up to their potential as a solution to overwhelming textbook costs they meet the needs of students as learners while protecting their interest as consumers we have known for a long time that digital textbooks could be a powerful solution and this report finds that open textbooks are the best course to take
8755217 although it is relatively rare to find the eggs and babies of extinct animals it is even rarer to find them inside the body of the mother

8755219 to suggest the u s orchestrated the crisis on behalf of political candidates is not rational
8755220 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8755221 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over

8755228 the question has been raised of cross contamination in distribution centers
8755229 we get quite a lot of check ins prior to hurricanes and also immediately after a hurricane because we do pretty well during a hurricane
8755230 not even the same organization it was three years ago
8755231 certainly louisiana stands a fair likelihood of experiencing the first serious hurricane since the hurricanes of 2005
8755232 not an occasion for panic but an occasion to put into practice all the preparation thats been done up until now thats what im here for to make sure were doing it
8755233 i am very grateful for this opportunity and i understand my responsibilities to the dallas cowboys and the national football league right now i just want to keep working hard so i can accomplish the goals that i have set for myself both on and off the field
8755234 theres no sure thing in life its nice to finally get the affirmation for all the hard work hes put in
8755235 the rest is up to him its time to play football hes a very motivated player
8755236 he has a good head on his shoulders he should be fine
8755237 adam has worked hard to get to this point but he also knows that there is still a lot of work ahead of him
8755238 he is fully aware of the opportunity that he has been given and he knows that this is an ongoing process
8755239 i think from the beginning there were a lot of critics saying that this couldnt be done that he couldnt turn his life around
8755240 im very happy for adam hes proven everyone wrong hes got a very bright personal and professional future
8755241 the name of a file format used to transmit videos over the internet
8755242 have veoh shoulder the entire burden of policing third party copyrights on its website at the cost of losing business if it cannot rather the issues is whether veoh takes appropriate steps to deal with copyright infringement that takes place veoh has met its burden in establishing entitlement to safe harbor for the alleged infringement here
8755243 even if the veoh decision were to be considered by other courts that case does nothing to change the fact that youtube is a business built on infringement that has failed to take reasonable measures to respect the rights of creators and content owners google and youtube have engaged in massive copyright infringement conduct that is not protected by any law including the dmca

8755255 it was a pretty easy decision to give back to fresno state and the football program after speaking with the fresno state administration about the direction the athletic department is going fresno state gave me the opportunity to showcase my talent the experience i had here with
8755256 they have the program headed in the right direction when i go to other schools and see how their program is run and then i see how fresno state runs its program i can see that fresno state is going to be at that level and beyond
8755257 we are delighted that cory has chosen to assume a leadership role in the continued development of bulldog athletics
8755258 given that he is an individual that has achieved extraordinary success at the highest levels of both sport and business it is indeed gratifying that he has endorsed the evolution of our athletics program further corys generosity will benefit hundreds of individuals and serves as a fitting tribute to his own student athlete experience with coach hill and coach sweeney
8755259 if you have been put in a position where you are successful you should give back to the people that kick started things for you

8755270 as of late this month the president and the would be successor from his own party have not spoken since
8755271 relationship fraught with bitter resentment grudging respect and mutual dependence
8755272 will be ushered out of the spotlight as quickly as possible if not in 14 seconds then not all that much longer
8755273 grievances nursed by both sides have only grown from there
8755274 im sure mccain is thinking is bush going to beat me twice
8755275 one former bush aide who spends his days publicly bashing barack obama sat down for lunch with me recently and before the appetizers even arrived lamented that the democrat will probably crush mccain he ruefully called obama one of the three three most talented political figures of his lifetime
8755276 and the president himself according to friends and prominent republicans privately rails about what he considers mccains undisciplined approach to the campaign and grouses about mccains efforts to distance himself from the administration
8755277 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8755278 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8755279 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8755280 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8755281 and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together
8755282 transformed with greek like columns and something the republicans yes wasted no time in pointing out
8755283 republicans who are mocking obamas appearance havent mentioned it but george w bush accepted his own nomination in 2004 on a set with a similar neoclassical theme with columns rising on either side of him
8755284 the mccain campaign calls the look at invesco field the temple of obama
8755285 ridicule from republicans because its setting up obama on this stage with these columns around him
8755286 well gee we envy the enthusiasm of 70 000 people in an arena like this
8755287 weve been struggling to make 1 percent or lose 1 percent i cant imagine any other business that can be viable that way
8755288 pan left switch to them and put up the names hold music
8755289 it really causes us to make some hard decisions about where to cut and probably its further impacted by the fact we are already in the year that we are talking about its not like we can plan ahead six months and make those decisions commitments have already been made to faculty and to programs that we are going to offer this year and so we need to go forward with those programs so there will have to be cuts in other areas especially our non academics areas
8755290 we feel the state cuts more because we are already having to make cuts to balance the budget
8755291 the problem for funding is never just a one year problem because its a permanent change permanent adjustment and we do not anticipate it being restored before the next years budget cycle
8755292 we didnt treat higher education any worse than most other agencies of programs in state government in fact we were able to reduce those cuts a little bit
8755293 families and businesses all across our state and beyond are tightening their belts in tough times and state government has to do the same
8755294 im not proud of our support for higher education we dont do well compared to other places around the country thats why a few years ago i proposed the promise scholarship program
8755295 i would note i have been a governor for six years commander in chief of the minnesota national guard for six years and before that i was the majority leader of the minnesota legislature i have some other life experiences as well
8755296 i then bumped into him shopping about five days ago and we shared a laugh and he told me about his plans for a holiday
8755297 he seemed terrific but that doesnt mean anything because people keep this stuff to themselves
8755298 he would have always fought such dark feelings but god knows what overwhelmed him on wednesday
8755299 he gave a very insightful performance about a person dealing with some very tough things

8755310 weve listened to feedback from our customers who asked that we provide a specific threshold for data usage and this would help them understand the amount of usage that would qualify as excessive

8755313 the astrologer claims to be a creative artist as much as the poet painter or musician and he will never attain to real greatness in his profession if he allows himself to be bound down too tightly by tradition or even by the calculation of his own experience we are all human but we are only worthy of the name of human insofar as we are divine inspiration and nothing else distinguishes humanity from the beasts that perish

8755318 let us walk properly in the daytime not in orgies and drunkenness not in sexual immorality and sensuality not in quarreling and jealousy but put on the lord jesus christ and make no provision for the flesh to gratify its desires

8755323 we have been puzzled if not surprised by some of the reactions
8755324 you have to interact effectively with your pro am partners you need to be able to do media interviews and you need to give a winners acceptance speech in english
8755325 they must speak at a level that effectively accomplishes those three things
8755326 what were seeing is that a handful of players dont speak to the level they need to be
8755327 were not just looking at the lpga as it is now
8755328 were looking at the future of the lpga as you well know we have a large international membership all indications are its not going to get smaller
8755329 if were getting any criticism its coming from outside the organization its not coming from the players and those are the people to whom it applies
8755330 surely if you can say hello thats english is that good enough
8755331 who draws the line about how many words youve got to know in english

8755340 it is not enough to increase yield we must also increase the value of crops improve opportunities for farmers to access markets and increase income for rural businesses and entrepreneurs that support agriculture
8755341 mutual value is the key for moving african aid programs from only providing short term relief to actually becoming sustainable within the community

8755512 has given everything he could to his country except his life
8755513 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8755514 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8755515 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

8755524 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8755525 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is

8755528 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8755529 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8755530 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats

8755532 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8755533 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8755534 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

8755564 kinder von armen familien werden immer mehr von der bildung abgekoppelt
8755565 eine kostenlose bildung f r alle und zwar vom kindergarten bis zur universit t und das ohne wenn und aber denn dass bildung kostenfrei zu haben ist dass ist eine mogelpackung
8755566 eigentlich ist bildung in deutschland aufgrund der gesetzlichen schulpflicht kostenlos tats chlich jedoch kommen mit der einschulung ihrer kinder erhebliche kosten auf die eltern zu nach unseren berechnungen sind das durchschnittlich einmalige kosten von ca 300 bei der einschulung sowie weitere laufende kosten f r die eltern w hrend des schuljahres die einkommenssituation im elternhaus steht somit im direkten zusammenhang mit den bildungschancen der kinder
8755567 so gibt es nach unseren recherchen eine vollst ndige lernmittelfreiheit nur noch in sechs bundesl ndern
8755568 ist wirklich gesichert dass die entsprechenden verfahren nicht stigmatisierend sind das armut nicht sch ndet
8755569 dies gilt nicht nur f r empf nger innen von transferleistungen wie alg ii gerade familien die knapp ber den berechtigungslimits der jeweiligen unterst tzungsangebote liegen k nnen besonders stark von den benachteiligenden strukturen betroffen sein dies gilt insbesondere wenn es sich um kinderreiche familien handelt
8755570 alle kinder haben ein recht auf gleiche bildungschancen daher fordert der deutsche kinderschutzbund endlich eine chancengerechtigkeit in der bildung f r alle kinder dies hei t z b eine kostenlose bildung von der krippe bis zur ausbildung eine kostenlose betreuung in ganztagsschulen die verpflegung in ganztagsschulen muss f r alle eltern bezahlbar sein und es muss eine vollst ndige lernmittelfreiheit geben
8755571 die regels tze sozialer transferleistungen sind am tats chlichen bedarf von kindern auszurichten hier muss es endlich einen eigenen regelsatz f r kinder geben der kinderzuschlag muss f r alle familien gezahlt werden die arm sind oder in prek ren einkommenssituationen leben
8755572 geringe finanzielle ressourcen von familien und kinderreichtum d rfen sich nicht negativ auf die bildungschancen von kindern auswirken deshalb ist unsere forderungen mehr chancengerechtigkeit
8755573 the commission has clearly recognized the importance of the internet as a platform for technological growth and innovation
8755574 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8755575 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8755576 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8755577 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8755578 plop plop fizz fizz oh what a relief it is
8755579 kamu sudah mula belajar mencuri di rumah sendiri apakah lagi perbuatan kamu yang akan memalukan ayah di luar kelak

8755581 kenapa kamu ni tahu tak kalau ayah terpaksa mengemis kerana persekolahan kamu ayah akan lakukan
8755582 orang lelaki kena bersekolah kalau tak dia takkan dapat membawa keluarganya keluar daripada kemiskinan
8755583 kak untuk dapat peluang ke universiti bukannya mudah saya cari kerja dan akan kirim wang buat akak
8755584 akak lihatlah pakaian adik ni apa yang akan kawan kawan akak kata kalau mereka tahu saya adik kakak
8755585 kak saya tengok ramai gadis pakai sepit macam ni saya beli satu untuk akak
8755586 emak tak payahlah kerja teruk teruk bersihkan rumah sambut saya balik
8755587 adik kamu yang bersihkan dia pulang kelmarin habis tangannya luka luka
8755588 tak kak tahu semasa bekerja sebagai buruh kontrak kerikil dan serpihan simen jatuh seperti hujan menimpa tubuh saya sepanjang masa kesakitan yang dirasa tidak dapat menghentikan usaha saya untuk bekerja keras
8755589 adik takde pelajaran biarlah adik bekerja dengan kelulusan yang adik ada
8755590 semasa sama sama bersekolah rendah setiap hari kami berjalan kaki ke sekolah suatu hari tapak kasut saya tertanggal melihat saya hanya memakai kasut sebelah kakak membuka kasutnya dan memberikannya pada saya dia berjalan dengan sebelah kasut sampai di rumah saya lihat kakinya berdarah sebab tertikam tunggul dan calar balar
8755591 sejak itulah saya berjanji pada diri sendiri saya akan lakukan apa saja demi kebahagiaan kakak saya itu saya berjanji akan menjaganya sampai bila bila

8755598 weve fallen into this false sense of urgency that they create
8755599 that idea that everything is breaking news and that if youre not watching us youre going to miss this thing
8755600 but nothing theyre saying is of any import because nobody filters it
8755601 if you like gordon campbell youll love st phane dion
8755602 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8755603 the health concerns primarily come from their high fat and salt content and sodium nitrate and nitrite commonly added preservatives and color enhancers nitrate related substances have been reported to cause cancer in animals but theres no proof they do that in people
8755604 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8755605 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8755606 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8755607 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8755608 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8755609 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8755610 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8755611 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8755612 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8755613 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8755614 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8755615 i am peace but these days nobody wants to keep me lit
8755616 i am faith but these days i am no longer indispensable
8755617 i am love and i havent the strength to stay lit any longer
8755618 people put me aside and dont understand my importance they even forget to love those who are nearest to them
8755619 why are you not burning you are supposed to stay lit until the end
8755620 dont be afraid for i am hope and while i still burn we can re light the other candles
8755621 spread love everywhere you go first of all in your own house let no one ever come to you without leaving better and happier be the living expression of gods kindness kindness in your face kindness in your eyes kindness in your smile kindness
8755622 do not let trifles disturb the tranquility of your mind life is too precious to be sacrificed for the nonessential and transient ignore the inconsequential
8755623 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8755624 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8755625 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8755626 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8755627 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8755628 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8755629 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8755630 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8755631 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8755632 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8755633 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8755634 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8755635 two americas one that wears condoms the other that back in the news first edwards came out yesterday and endorsed barack obama in related news the
8755636 consider the role of vice president and favored the position of attorney general
8755637 today cindy and john work together to promote adoption and to help women facing crisis pregnancies

8755642 the funny thing is when we picked out dates last year we were to have the book club meet on the 19th but whatever goes
8755643 cindy on the other hand with her button down suits and blouses looks like shes duct taped
8755644 the clothes we wear send a message and i think thats the message i dont think thats her intention though
8755645 im wearing the same thing i always do just brown today instead of black
8755646 ingatlah kepadaku apabila keadaanmu telah baik nanti tunjukkanlah terima kasihmu kepadaku dengan menceritakan hal ihwalku kepada firaun dan tolonglah keluarkan aku dari rumah ini
8755647 bukankah allah yang menerangkan arti mimpi ceritakanlah kiranya mimpimu itu kepadaku
8755648 dalam mimpiku itu tampak ada pohon anggur di depanku 40 10 pohon anggur itu ada tiga carangnya dan baru saja pohon itu bertunas bunganya sudah keluar dan tandan tandannya penuh buah anggur yang ranum 40 11 dan di tanganku ada piala firaun buah anggur itu kuambil lalu kuperas ke dalam piala firaun kemudian kusampaikan piala itu ke tangan firaun
8755649 beginilah arti mimpi itu ketiga carang itu artinya tiga hari 40 13 dalam tiga hari ini firaun akan meninggikan engkau dan mengembalikan engkau ke dalam pangkatmu yang dahulu dan engkau akan menyampaikan piala ke tangan firaun seperti dahulu kala ketika engkau jadi juru minumannya 40 14 tetapi ingatlah kepadaku apabila keadaanmu telah baik nanti tunjukkanlah terima kasihmu kepadaku dengan menceritakan hal ihwalku kepada firaun dan tolonglah keluarkan aku dari rumah ini 40 15 sebab aku dicuri diculik begitu saja dari negeri orang ibrani dan di sinipun aku tidak pernah melakukan apa apa yang menyebabkan aku layak dimasukkan ke dalam liang tutupan ini
8755650 akupun bermimpi juga tampak aku menjunjung tiga bakul berisi penganan 40 17 dalam bakul atas ada berbagai bagai makanan untuk firaun buatan juru roti tetapi burung burung memakannya dari dalam bakul yang di atas kepalaku
8755651 beginilah arti mimpi itu ketiga bakul itu artinya tiga hari 40 19 dalam tiga hari ini firaun akan meninggikan engkau tinggi ke atas dan menggantung engkau pada sebuah tiang dan burung burung akan memakan dagingmu dari tubuhmu
8755652 owen likes it so much that he made an offer on a home there
8755653 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8755654 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8755655 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8755656 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8755657 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8755658 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8755659 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8755660 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8755661 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8755662 dios m o no quiero provocar ning n tipo de agresi n sexual me reh so a vestirme con ropa provocativa ay dame dios m o a ser pudorosa no quiero exhibir mi cuerpo sin recato lo que menos quiero es provocar prostituci n mental
8755663 cuando exhibimos nuestro cuerpo sin recato sin pudor lo prostituimos porque provocamos en los dem s sentimientos hacia nosotros a los que no tienen derecho a no ser que deseemos ser propiedad p blica es decir que nos prostituyamos aunque sea mentalmente eso es la pornograf a una prostituci n mental

8755668 saya mengharapkan pembebasan hamed akan menjadi awal bagi tahap baru dan bahwa ini akan menjadi pertanda baik berkaitan dengan status pembaru
8755669 im satisfied with the draw although we didnt exactly land in the most spectacular group we have a mighty challenge on our hands against italian champions inter milan who have a very attractive side we got to see first hand in the last few years just how difficult it can be to play against greek sides but we cleared the hurdle of panathinaikos on the last occasion and thats a good omen you could probably consider famagusta to be the surprise package of the complete qualifying phase im interested to see them
8755670 on the whole we are in a group which leaves every opportunity open for us to qualify for the latter stages of the competition but we will have to be wary we know both inter and panathinaikos and are aware just how difficult a challenge they posed for us in the past
8755671 we havent landed in a cracker of a group but certainly every aspect of it is interesting jos mourinho will have fond memories of me from our win against chelsea at the weser stadium we didnt exactly have things our own way against panathinaikos in the past but we have a chance to make up for that now famagusta will be a completely new experience but we cant afford to underestimate them

8755684 overall we have been drawn in a group which gives us the possibility of reaching the quarter final but we will have to watch out
8755685 in inter and panathinaikos we have two teams that we know and they will be difficult opponents
8755686 you only have to look at inters squad to know what an attractive opponent we have drawn they can call upon ibrahimovic and adriano in attack they have a lot of quality
8755687 they are italian champions and we know what kind of job their trainer jose mourinho can do
8755688 the trainer of panathinaikos is also a familiar face we come up against henk ten cate for the third time in international competition he was co trainer in barcelona trainer of ajax and now panathinaikos
8755689 with their victories over tiflis and sparta prague in the qualifiers they have shown what they are capable of they only came third in their domestic league but they have strengthened their squad in the summer
8755690 the ultimate benefits of solid state will require software management and systems capabilities with ibm being uniquely positioned with its deep research and development capabilities and broad product and services experience to unlock that potential

8755704 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities
8755705 it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8755706 the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army
8755707 why seek a difficult compromise solution in the peacekeeping process it is easier to arm one of the sides and provoke it into killing another side and the job is done
8755708 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8755709 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it sounds not rational

8755714 if you did not arm and if you than did not uphold their crimes in the past and did not support their entrance and as it was vivid you had to bring the georgian military back home from iraq within the entire time of arming with mass destruction technology military arms that psychological factor in a man would not have been at the time of august 7 2008 people do not associate with one another unless they have something in common or a likeness in a personality or understanding between their mental thinking now back to the point if he is supported by a bully he does the bully act as he thinks

8755721 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8755722 they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8755723 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational

8755927 the university became aware of a possible compliance issue involving a football student athlete
8755928 we have looked into the matter and communicated with big 12 and ncaa officials and found that there were no violations
8755929 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8755930 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8755931 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8755932 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8755933 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8755934 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8755968 russian is moving forward altering the post soviet 1991 borders with unpredictable results
8755969 there is no place in todays world for attempts to redraw boundaries of our international order unless confronted by the international community russian policies will eventually force another conflict elsewhere

8755979 we try and keep our industry out of politics and into marketing opportunities but sometimes its very difficult to separate the two
8755980 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army

8755983 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8755984 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8755985 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8755986 the participants underscore the need for respect of the historical and cultural traditions of each country and each people and for efforts aimed at preserving the unity of the state and its territorial integrity

8756011 when we started building shopster we wanted to make sure that it was flexible we wanted to be able to deliver new features and improvements without having to overtly disrupt our users day to day activity in site because shopster has been built organically ed usually from user suggestions and needs weve had some functionality that didnt quite fit the mold of our existing navigation when we introduced shopster product source ed shopsters non storefront solution a while back we tried to fit it into our existing site it worked but we started to get the impression it wasnt as good as it could be it created some friction for our users
8756012 we were trying to cram features into a space they didnt necessarily belong in we thought about it threw around a couple ideas and models and it came to us that were dealing with a multi channel system now
8756013 three years ago shopster was a storefront product solution without the whole sell on ebay and other third party sites side of it so we broke down how our in site features were connected and rebuilt how things were put together for our users
8756014 plus it opens up the option to create brand new features and channels without the confines of existing navigation and functionality

8756093 there is no place in todays world for attempts to redraw boundaries of our international order unless confronted by the international community russian policies will eventually force another conflict elsewhere
8756094 a unilateral attempt to redraw the borders of a neighboring country through the use of force
8756095 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
8756096 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8756097 we try and keep our industry out of politics and into marketing opportunities but sometimes its very difficult to separate the two
8756098 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8756099 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8756100 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8756101 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8756102 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8756103 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8756104 the participants underscore the need for respect of the historical and cultural traditions of each country and each people and for efforts aimed at preserving the unity of the state and its
8756105 support the active role of russia in promoting peace and cooperation in the given region
8756106 trying to draw up a strong text signifying our unwillingness to accept
8756107 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well

8756109 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8756110 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8756111 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8756112 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8756113 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion

8756115 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8756116 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8756117 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them

8756127 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8756128 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8756129 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8756130 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8756131 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8756132 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8756133 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8756134 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8756135 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8756136 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8756137 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8756138 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8756139 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8756140 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8756141 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8756142 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8756143 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8756144 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8756145 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8756146 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8756147 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8756148 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8756149 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8756150 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8756151 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8756152 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8756153 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8756154 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8756155 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8756156 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8756157 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8756158 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8756159 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8756160 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8756161 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8756162 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8756163 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8756164 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8756165 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8756166 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8756167 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8756168 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8756169 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8756170 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8756171 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8756172 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8756173 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8756174 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8756175 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8756176 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8756177 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8756178 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8756179 the bottom line is that people can get a lot for their money for 400 000
8756180 nassau is a bit pricier but as you go east you will get more house for less money
8756181 some areas have always been more in demand and expensive like massapequa and new hyde park where 400 000 would be on the lower end of the price range
8756182 in suffolk the price differences are less drastic in general in nassau county the town will determine your price areas like the north shore are more expensive and areas on the queens nassau border are pricier because they offer less commuting time to manhattan
8756183 in certain areas like valley stream for instance it would be no problem to find a three bedroom 1 bath colonial for that price and in hempstead you will find many high ranches
8756184 its a good starter home you can finish the attic and improve the value of the home
8756185 last year that high ranch that now costs 400 000 would have cost 425 000 in 2005 it would have been 500 000 buyers today are saving at least 10 percent over early last year
8756186 prices have leveled out waiting six months to buy will not bring more house for the money real estate is a good investment now
8756187 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8756188 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8756189 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8756190 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8756191 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8756192 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8756193 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8756194 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8756195 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8756196 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8756197 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8756198 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8756199 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8756200 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8756201 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8756202 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8756203 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8756204 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8756205 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8756206 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8756207 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8756208 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8756209 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8756210 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8756211 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8756212 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8756213 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8756214 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8756215 thank you so much mr hermit for the wonderful seat to sit on while i take in the incredible beauty do you happen to have a cool glass of water for me as i am so very thirsty
8756216 mr hermit thank you so much for the wonderful seat the fresh clean water and the wonderful view would you mind if i spent the night here with you on this grand mountain so that i could see the sun rise over my kingdom

8756218 if we come to the irrevocable conclusion that we should have an election its not because we have polls that are any different than anybody else
8756219 its because that while weve had 2 1 2 years of government all the signs indicate that this parliament is at the end of its usefulness
8756220 a series of earthquakes occurring in the seismically active region
8756221 these earthquakes are too far offshore to be felt on land and too small to generate a tsunami

8756229 the acting high commissioner calls for thorough and independent investigations into all killings that have occurred so far
8756230 leaders of the different protesting groups have a responsibility to ensure that demonstrations are peaceful and that the demonstrators are not carrying sticks guns or other weapons and refrain from intimidation
8756231 thats what we are expecting and we are planning to give passage a safe area for them to come out of that
8756232 this is being treated as arson and until we can determine whether the family was inside it will remain arson

8756243 the whole broadband process has become a shambolic tendering fiasco
8756244 its something thats so confusing and causing such concern in the broadband and telecommunications community that were seeing investment frozen
8756245 this is from an outfit that claimed the election of the rudd government would turn australia from a flintstones era into a jetsons era overnight when neither of those claims are true were seeing broken promises racked up on broadband and no improvement in service availability
8756246 we have embarked on such a significant national project here involving potentially billions of dollars of public funds
8756247 we will therefore go through the most rigorous comprehensive public tender process to ensure probity is honoured so we can get on with the business of laying out and rolling out this network
8756248 we are committed to a digital revolution in australia we are committed to a digital education revolution in australia its the pathway to the future and were confident in the progress weve made

8756273 this has resulted in a substantial reduction though not total elimination in cardiac doses from radiotherapy for breast cancer hodgkins lymphoma etc
8756274 what is new is that recent studies such as those of japanese atomic bomb survivors and patients with benign diseases irradiated at lower doses have reported an increased cvd risk associated with radiation doses hitherto considered too low to cause cardiovascular effects
8756275 the low dose radiation effects on cvd risk are likely to remain challenging and controversial even more so than the linear no threshold arguments for cancer risk that are debated to this day but should not be dismissed
8756276 the effect of low radiation dose on cvd should be a concern for radiation oncologists who are involved in treatment of breast cancer hodgkins lymphoma and other cancers and for radiologists and cardiologists who are increasingly using interventional radiology and other new techniques eg intensity modulated radiation therapy these may deliver considerable doses to the heart the effects of very low doses as seen in nuclear workers are still uncertain as we emphasize in the comment but are of potential concern because of the large number of people occupationally exposed to such doses including medical radiation workers

8756285 i would like to ask the distinguished representative of the united states weapons of mass destruction have you found them yet in iraq or are you still looking for them
8756286 im not a psychologist and i dont know what brought on the free association we heard from ambassador churkin
8756287 those are well known we thought we had overcome them apparently there are still some lingering frustrations but there is no territorial ambition or desire to dismember iraq
8756288 im afraid this assertion ambassador churkin simply does not stand up to scrutiny
8756289 we have to work with other nations now in increasing the leverage that we have for that negotiation and increasing the sanctions that could be placed on the iranians

8756337 as for as da coaliz o capturaram um homem suspeito de trabalhar com os mais altos escal es dos criminosos de grupos especiais
8756338 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
8756339 the fact is that u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8756340 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the u s specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8756341 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8756342 i dont think theres anything to announce yet but i know that that is under discussion
8756343 it is time to establish the truth about the crimes committed before and during russias invasion of georgia

8756345 millimeter wave technology another form of body imaging technology uses non ionizing electromagnetic waves to generate an image based on the energy reflected from the body
8756346 creates an image that looks like a chalk outline of the passenger with threats outlined but does not reveal facial features
8756347 the smartcheck systems installed at jfk lax and phoenix sky harbor cannot store export print or transmit images
8756348 to date approximately 90 percent of passengers have opted for screening using smartcheck rather than undergoing a pat down
8756349 millimeter wave technology pinpoints objects made of any material including liquids rubber wire plastic and metal to quickly and easily locate weapons contraband and other threats concealed under an individuals clothing
8756350 the portals detect concealed and hidden objects such as metallic and non metallic weapons and virtually all known explosives and other contraband in seconds
8756351 the images generated through millimeter wave are lower resolution than that of x ray backscatter and as a result privacy may be less of a concern for the traveling public
8756352 first this technology produces strikingly graphic images of passengers bodies those images reveal not only our private body parts but also intimate medical details like colostomy bags that degree of examination amounts to a significant and for some people humiliating assault on the essential dignity of passengers that citizens in a free nation should not have to tolerate
8756353 second we question the supposed voluntary nature of this scan tsas assumption that the people who

8756368 if you cant take criticism maybe you shouldnt ask my opinion
8756369 speaker pelosis outrageous attempt to present what she considers the teaching of the catholic church regarding abortion is simply wrong and should be disregarded by every faithful catholic
8756370 the teachings of the church on abortion are consistent and unambiguous and it is very disturbing to hear someone who claims to be a catholic distort these teachings and sow seeds of confusion among the faithful by attempting to relativize the right to life
8756371 house speaker nancy pelosi stepped out of her political role and completely misrepresented the teaching of the catholic church in regard to abortion
8756372 education and health care were key to minimum provision moreover participants argued for the means for social participation the ability to engage in activities and social networks outside the home social participation was seen as being key to emotional well being and mental health and included for example social and cultural participation activities informal support networks and employment for those who could work it could also be said to include being socially acceptable in terms of self presentation whether in appearance when inviting people to ones home or being able to engage in the types of activities undertaken by peers

8756393 willst du mir erz hlen wieso du mitten in der nacht an meiner t r klingelst
8756394 sie wollen unbedingt dass ich ihnen sage was mir lisa erz hlt hat
8756395 sie verstehen es einfach nicht sie sind alle furchtbar w tend geworden und haben mich angeschrieen weil ich es ihnen nicht sagen wollte frau rosenkohl hat ganz viel geweint und ich hab geh rt wie sie meinen eltern gesagt hat dass wenn sie lisa nicht finden bevor ihr was passiert dann dann ist es meine schuld
8756396 wei t du manchmal gibt es nicht einfach richtung und falsch
8756397 es tut mir leid dass du so viel rger wegen mir hattest es war sehr mutig von dir dass du niemandem etwas gesagt es

8756399 jurnalistii si politicienii mananca aceeasi paine daca nu ar fi politicienii jurnalistii nu ar avea ce sa scrie nu ar exista stiri fara politicieni daca nu ar fi jurnalistii politicienii nu ar avea acces la alegatori trebuie sa avem un echilibru

8756403 ai doua variante sa te documentezi sau sa pui divertisment
8756404 daca puteti renunta la toate acestea sunteti jurnalisti daca nu faceti divertisment dar nu va numiti jurnalisti
8756405 la facultatea de drept spre exemplu se scrie teorie inca din antichitate fjsc nu face teorie ce teorie sa existe intr un domeniu in care prima carte teoretica a aparut in 1946 fjsc are 50 activitate practica care este o componenta esentiala in acest sens activitatile aplicative de la aceasta scoala de vara sunt in prelungirea actiunilor din cadrul facultatii
8756406 de la inceput m am intrebat de ce aveti toti fete de jurnalisti dupa ce v am ascultat mi am dat seama ca avem toti contact cu jurnalismul

8756420 we do have some witnesses we need to talk to and take statements from then and try to reconstruct that crash
8756421 we can reconstruct the crash as it occurred once they entered the median but we dont have a lot of physical evidence as to what caused them to enter the median
8756422 you look to a time when everyones excited about coming back and starting a new school year and all the great things youre going to do and you come back with news youve lost a classmate friend its a very difficult way to start
8756423 they factor in but they cant be the overriding concern
8756424 you have to try to make your final 53 the team that you want it to be you cant be concerned that weve only got one player at x position to get to this first game but after the first game its different because once you get into the season that all goes out the window
8756425 una prote na media incluye unos 300 amino cidos el adn que controla esto tiene unos mil nucle tidos en su cadena dado que hay cuatro tipos de nucle tidos en la cadena de adn una que consiste de mil enlaces o uniones podr a existir en 4 elevado a 1000 formas usando un poco de lgebra logaritmos se ve que 4 a la 1000 10 a la 600 potencia diez multiplicado por s mismo 600 veces da una cifra igual a 1 con 600 ceros
8756426 tenemos que distinguir rigurosamente los dos escenarios en la formaci n fortuita de mol culas complejas como los nucle tidos por medio de acontecimientos qu micos la producci n de nucle tidos uno por uno lo cual pudiera ser posible y luego la mezcla de los mismos en frecuencias muy especiales esto ltimo es absolutamente imposible
8756427 un hombre honesto provisto del conocimiento actual solo podr a decir que el origen de la vida se presenta casi como un milagro
8756428 de hecho la probabilidad de la formaci n de una prote na y un cido nucleico adn arn es realmente incalculable por otra parte la posibilidad de la aparici n de una cierta cadena de prote na es tan nfima que resulta astron micamente improbable
8756429 las rdenes de los planes reproductores para el desarrollo de la secuencia proteica y para la eficiencia del mecanismo que traslada las instrucciones que desarrollan el conjunto tuvieron que estar presentes simult neamente al inicio de la vida esta combinaci n de sucesos se ha presentado como un acontecimiento accidental incre blemente improbable y a menudo ha sido adscrito a la intervenci n divina
8756430 hasta ahora no hay ning n experimento con el cual podamos obtener todas las mol culas necesarias para la evoluci n qu mica por lo tanto es esencial producir distintas mol culas en distintos lugares bajo condiciones muy apropiadas y luego llevarlas a otro lugar para su reacci n protegi ndolas de los elementos da inos como la hidr lisis y la fot lisis
8756431 para los esc pticos la proposici n de que los programas gen ticos de los organismos m s elevados consistentes en cerca de mil millones de bits de informaci n equivalente a la secuencia de letras en una peque a biblioteca de mil vol menes conteniendo incontables formas codificadas miles de confusos algoritmos que controlan especifican y ordenan el crecimiento y desarrollo de billones y billones de c lulas de un cuerpo complejo fueron mezclados por un proceso fortuito resulta una afrenta a la raz n pero para los darwinistas que aceptan la idea sin la m nima duda el ejemplo tiene prioridad
8756432 porque las cosas invisibles de l su eterna potencia y divinidad se ven entendidas por la creaci n del mundo y por las cosas que son hechas para que no haya excusa porque habiendo conocido a dios no le glorificaron como a dios ni le dieron gracias antes se desvanecieron en sus fantas as y el tonto coraz n de ellos fue entenebrecido

8756463 we respect the right of elected officials such as speaker pelosi to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops given this responsibility to teach it is important to make this correction for the record
8756464 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8756465 if my assessment has been accurate it follows that many of our problems with prayer stem from a failure to understand the relationship of our praying to the ministry of jesus including his praying

8756467 kalau tidak diperbaiki akan besar sekali kerugian negara dibandingkan kontrak kontrak gas lain seperti di bontang dan arun

8756469 karena ada contoh dari lng badak dengan kontrak 20 dolar per mmbtu sedangkan tangguh ini hanya 3 2 dolar rekomendasinya adalah lebih baik membayar us 300 juta untuk membatalkan kontrak itu daripada rugi miliaran dolar untuk 20 tahun ke depan

8756472 if anything the fact that officials recognized the concern about the dollars decline seems somewhat supportive for the dollar as maybe benign neglect was not so neglectful
8756473 the dollars had its big rally and now its pulling back a little bit and youve got heightened degrees of uncertainty
8756474 we had a 1 3 million reduction in the uninsured and had a 1 3 million expansion in medicaid growth
8756475 clearly without medicaid and particularly the expansion of coverage for children we wouldve continued to see a rise in the number of people who were uninsured
8756476 while its superficially good news in that more people have coverage it exemplifies the stress the system is bearing
8756477 i dont think most governors are going to be happy to sustain the current medicaid and s chip rolls they have as the economy weakens
8756478 if private coverage cant keep up with population growth then were going to constantly have fewer people covered in the private sector in the absence of reform
8756479 thats why national health reform is necessary to save the private sector the federal role here is to try to do comprehensive reform and put financing of our health care system on more sustainable footing
8756480 the numbers have changed a little bit but it really doesnt matter if were talking about 47 million 45 million or 43 million the fact is its a significant number of people who dont have health insurance
8756481 it matters because it puts pressure on the health care system in terms of uncompensated care it matters because more people are not getting the kind of health care they need because they think they dont have access to the system or have the kind of access to the system that insured people have
8756482 it matters to policy people because if were going to try to solve this problem we need to know what its going to cost
8756483 we have a higher unemployment rate so fewer people with access to coverage
8756484 and those people with coverage are undoubtedly facing the decision of whether to keep their health insurance when dealing with higher gas prices and higher food prices
8756485 the economy had just begun to weaken in the fourth quarter of 2007 all reasonable models will predict that 2008 numbers will be worse and we would expect more people to have lost private coverage by then but given how vibrant the s chip and medicaid safety net is that doesnt mean the uninsured will go up a lot it just means we expect erosion in the private sector to continue and indeed intensify
8756486 massachusetts and vermont at this stage are the only states that have a commitment to universal coverage
8756487 there were major proposals in california pennsylvania illinois those have floundered you havent had proposals from the states that have had major problems like texas florida
8756488 whats shocking is the u s is the only major industrialized nation that fails to cover everyone and yet we spend twice per capita what the next closest country spends on health care
8756489 many of these countries in europe are older and have a higher fraction of elderly as total population and yet cover everyone at substantially lower costs

8756500 weve listened to feedback from our customers who asked that we provide a specific threshold for data usage and this would help them understand the amount of usage that would qualify as excessive

8756507 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8756508 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8756509 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8756510 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8756511 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8756539 statesman like assessment of where this country is and how desperately it needs a real change toward reform and retrenchment at home and restoration of diplomacy wisdom and prudence abroad yes he nailed it with this line
8756540 people around the world have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8756541 i dont buy his evisceration of everything the republican party has done in the last quarter century i think the gop did a great deal to rescue this country in the 1980s and early 1990s in fact i think clinton would have failed as a president without the foil of the gingrich gop but since 2000 the worst aspects of republicanism have crowded out its once necessary virtues the reflexive impulse to use force over diplomacy to use aggression over persuasion to spend and borrow with no concern for the future and to violate sacred principles such as the eschewal of torture with no respect for the past these must not just be left behind they have to be repudiated

8756555 todo es representativo de una realidad presunta t cita y referida a los arquetipos que todo proferimiento creador tiene necesariamente pretensiones fotogr ficas es en fin de cuenta realista realista en la medida que alude a una realidad y realista tambi n en la medida que es demostrativo de ella si no cu l es el origen de esas im genes
8756556 la verdad es que vivo en y desde y para la literatura y no siempre puedo separar vida de arte al menos no mi vida de mi necesidad permanente de escribir lo cierto es que mi materia prima es la vida la vida misma
8756557 y me veo recordando que me veo escribir y me recuerdo vi ndome recordar que escrib a y escribo vi ndome escribir que recuerdo haberme visto escribir que escrib a y que escrib a que escribo que escrib a
8756558 la obra de arte es la puerta por la cual el delirio nos invade a trav s de la cual la fluidez de otras formas nos penetra e irrumpe en nuestra sensibilidad de una manera musical
8756559 dentro del espejo duplicaciones y los nuevos acechos del cuento
8756560 el tratamiento fant stico en su obra es original se adentra en la experiencia alienante de la sociedad moderna se articula como una especie de radar art stico de los conflictos generados por nuevos m dulos culturales en sus cuentos se rompe el eje de las racionalizaciones que operan por modelos por uniformidades por caracterizaciones sostenidas en principios inamovibles se lacera el yo social e individual duplic ndolo rompiendo el cerco de sus protecciones e integr ndolo a otros cuerpos aniquilando el refugio de su indivisibilidad
8756561 la m sica se hizo m s intensa y yo sent que me divid a que cada estrato vertical del mi cuerpo iba adquiriendo independencia y que yo estaba presente en cada nueva parte que se desprend a de mi ser principal
8756562 una le osa rigidez se le ha ido extendiendo por todo el cuerpo siente la savia hac rsele pesada en la sangre y como sta comienza a endurecerse milim tricamente sin querer se maravilla del grado de hipersensibilidad que lo llena sabe que la lengua ha dejado de ser el nico veh culo de gustaci n lo que parece toneladas de lgido verdor amargo y susurrante ya le tapa los ojos oreja nariz boca y zonas er genas le es imposible abrir los ojos adheridas como est n las hojas a sus p rpados
8756563 tanto la experiencia personal como la ajena tanto lo que se imagina como lo que se sue a dormido porque igualmente real es una visi n que otra ya que stas se generan en la misma persona sensible observadora propensa a las extrapolaciones de un mundo a otro a los cruces de camino y las fusiones a confundir lo que pasa con lo que podr a pasar lo que se teme con lo que se desea la luz con la sombra
8756564 quienes me conocen familiares unos pocos muy pocos amigos saben a qu grado me resulta imposible separar mi vida diaria de la literatura como actividad superior del esp ritu como praxis que encarna en cada quehacer en cada gesto para m el ser escritor es inseparable de mi condici n de persona del prisma a trav s del cual veo las cosas tal vez por eso tengo tan pocos amigos y mi familia no sea precisamente el n cleo que m s lea mis libros por el contrario se me ha censurado el ponerme tanto en lo que escribo unas veces tras m scaras y artificios de f cil o dif cil revelaci n otras de forma menos ret rica sobre todo en algunos cuentos de mi libro caracol y otros cuentos
8756565 caracol recogido en s refugiado por la propia dureza de su caparaz n corporal nadie lo puede ver
8756566 yo s que el tiempo tenaz asedio de la vida existe
8756567 ignoro todav a lo que es el tiempo pero por otra parte os lo confieso tambi n s que hablo en el tiempo y que hace tiempo que estoy hablando del tiempo y que este largo tiempo mismo s lo es tal en virtud de un cierto plazo transcurrido
8756568 qu hac a dios antes de crear el cielo y la tierra
8756569 todo lo que a ratos pienso es real en su anarqu a absoluta imprevisible precisamente porque lo pienso y con im genes que se convierten en palabras que musitan mis labios lo atrapo este ca tico abanico de visiones se sucede sin mediar el tiempo ni una fija geograf a
8756570 lo cierto es que en esto de la literatura no he querido darme por vencido
8756571 durante a os he anotado en cuadernos y libretas toda suerte de pensamientos descripciones y escenas intuidas tratando luego de encontrarles una m nima secuencia de darles un sentido sin xito no me sale nada es como si estuviera muerto por m s que mi mente aloje semillas de donde se generan sin pausa todas estas elucubraciones no s cuanto tiempo ha pasado no quiero saberlo para no exacerbar m s esta angustia paralizante y aqu estoy aqu sigo y nada
8756572 dentro del espejo duplicaciones y los nuevos acechos del cuento
8756573 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8756574 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8756575 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8756576 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8756577 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8756578 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8756579 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8756580 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8756581 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8756582 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8756583 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8756584 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8756585 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8756586 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8756587 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8756588 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8756589 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8756590 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8756591 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8756592 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8756593 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8756594 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8756595 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8756596 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8756597 i need a moment to catch my breath and try to get my life back together
8756598 i watched her all week she was being tortured every day
8756599 i think you dont know what goes on in combat until you are in combat
8756600 i dont think they are going to put on a case in the future with a lack of evidence
8756601 as a result of a reducing workload directly attributable to increased use of fixed penalties and cautions by the police and crown prosecution service a number of courts have had to be cancelled each week at each of our court houses
8756602 i am deeply concerned about the increased use by the prosecuting agencies of judicial powers but it seems that those judicial powers are likely to be used increasingly given that they are a cheaper means of sentencing than by going through a judicial process
8756603 its obviously noticeable in court that were sitting less than we would normally do due to the cautions and penalty notices being handed out
8756604 the increasing use of penalty notices in leading to soft justice where offenders who should go before the courts are able to escape with a fine which they might not even pay and avoid a criminal record magistrates courts are the places where summary justice should be done and seen to be done
8756605 in particular the strength friendship and assistance provided by my estranged husband dale continues to be invaluable despite the tremendous pressures that he is under
8756606 together with the excellent medical care i am receiving i have also appreciated the fantastic support from my amazing group of close friends and staff members
8756607 but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8756608 it was apparent at this meeting that the governor did not presume kilpatricks innocence
8756609 to the contrary at this meeting the governor and her staff had prepared a blackboard scenario in which his presumption of innocence was ignored and significantly undercut
8756610 the governor explained that no matter the evidence kilpatrick had to resign because it was making michigan look bad
8756611 im acting based on what my obligations are under that law and based upon what city council has asked me to do
8756612 the inability to compel the attendance of the witnesses is a serious if not fatal blow to the defense in the removal proceedings
8756613 youll have to do the best you can we dont have subpoena power theres no argument about that
8756614 i dont think hell be able to get back on the field for at least six or seven weeks
8756615 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
8756616 on coney island in the shadow of the legendary cyclone roller coaster and nathans hot dog stand in an empty storefront on west 12th street
8756617 we try and keep our industry out of politics and into marketing opportunities but sometimes its very difficult to separate the two
8756618 russian protein industries are not developed enough to support the countrys needs
8756619 chicken leg prices and to a lesser extent pork prices would be significantly pressured
8756620 if i really like a girl my life suddenly isnt as busy as i make it out to be
8756621 suddenly i dont have that 9 00 a m spin class followed by a three week trip to outer mongolia
8756622 you make her a late meal you swing by for a quick hello you make that call
8756623 when youre not really interested you come up with excuses for not being there for her
8756624 when im with a girl im really into i look forward to seeing her all day
8756625 ill send her funny emails and try to make her laugh so shes in a great mood for our date that night
8756626 ill do ridiculous things like stand outside holding a radio like that movie say anything
8756627 i guess i just dont care if i look stupid i only care if it makes her happy
8756628 i attempted to get up to use the restroom rather urgently during the 7th inning stretch as god bless america was beginning
8756629 i dont want her to look like shes going into a convent school but its just a little too much for a 15 year old if i didnt know better id swear she was 25
8756630 such an event dangerously threatens our religious feelings it is not appropriate to hold it during the ramadan
8756631 this is the festival of arts and culture and there are many believers in our population as well
8756632 the lack of sexual freedom has made people in the region very prone to war mongering and crimes
8756633 this is a traditional society in which most people still do not accept the existence of different sexualities or identities
8756634 there were times we didnt think hed get the nomination
8756635 there is no kitsch or obscenity it is a successful work of art
8756636 esto supone para el ainsetano la esencia de su ser para las ni as y toda la gente que se viste para la morisma sta es como para un oscense bailar como danzante por el coso el d a de san lorenzo y s lo eso ya justificar a toda la representaci n
8756637 la morisma es el marco id neo para introducir cosas nuevas nuevos papeles o efectos este a o por ejemplo aparece por primera vez un grupo de gitanos a los que les sacuden moros y cristianos por igual
8756638 a nsa por s misma ya merece una visita con su variada y rica oferta tur stica de hosteler a y gastron mica pero adem s montamos un mercado medieval durante todo el fin de semana de la morisma con lo que el esfuerzo de venir vale la pena
8756639 seguran a chefe de estado fala sobre onda de criminalidade violenta
8756640 a onda de assaltos e crimes violentos que se tem vindo a verificar no nosso pa s uma coisa muito s ria todos n s esperamos que os criminosos n o fiquem impunes
8756641 os portugueses n o podem deixar de estar ao lado da sua pol cia das suas for as de seguran a mas h que ter uma estrat gia muito adequada para enfrentar uma situa o destas para que a imagem de um pa s seguro n o seja alterada
8756642 pensei nisto com todo o cuidado e n o t o est pido como parece a primeira vez que se ouve quero eu dizer amamo nos um ao outro isso um dado de facto de que nenhum de n s duvida j sabemos como nos fazemos felizes um ao outro agora somos livres de fazer as nossas pr prias escolhas de decidir sobre as nossas pr prias vidas ningu m pode dizer nos como havemos de viver somos indiv duos livres e agora as pessoas vivem de todo o g nero de maneiras podem viver de acordo com as suas pr prias regras e padr es sem ter de pedir licen a a ningu m a m e conhece dois homossexuais que vivem juntos num apartamento como marido e mulher dois homens em oxford na beaumont street s o muito discretos ensinam ambos no christ church ningu m os incomoda e n s tamb m podemos fazer as nossas pr prias regras por saber que me amas que posso dizer isto a minha ideia que edward eu amo te e n o temos de ser como todas as outras pessoas quero eu dizer ningu m ningu m mesmo ningu m precisava de saber o que faz amos ou n o faz amos pod amos estar juntos viver juntos e se tu quisesses se quisesses mesmo quero dizer sempre que acontecesse e claro que iria acontecer eu compreendia mais do que isso desej lo ia porque quero que sejas feliz e livre nunca teria ci mes desde que soubesse que me amavas eu amar te ia e tocaria violino tudo o que quero na vida sinceramente s quero estar contigo olhar por ti ser feliz contigo e trabalhar com o quarteto e um dia tocar qualquer coisa qualquer coisa bela para ti como o mozart no wigmore hall
8756643 weve got the lowest crime and the best detection rates in the uk we are very pleased
8756644 this gives a visible police presence which we will be continuing
8756645 understanding that all companies go out of business what do you think will cause your demise
8756646 but there is something that i must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice
8756647 we must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline
8756648 its one more piece of evidence that the mccain campaign is a war room masquerading as a presidential campaign
8756649 if they do it i will pay all of mccains mortgages next month
8756650 long wondered about why are bananas so cheap relative to other fruit especially since a lot of the fruit we consume in the u s is grown here while bananas are not
8756651 tale of a threatened species and the scientific heroes hunting to save the fruit
8756652 the book youve been looking for if youve heard rumours that the phallic golden fruit that adorns the breakfast table might be heading for extinction
8756653 new banana disease poses threat how serious is open to debate
8756654 if it did get over to latin america somehow it is almost impossible to stop when and if that will happen no one can say for sure
8756655 been working for a number of years on different opportunities to grow different bananas
8756656 s2 de la coada numelui pai la inceput ai decat 3 sau 4 masini dar iti poti cumpara licenta pentru s1 pentru a avea jumatate din lista cu masini si iti poti cumpara licenta pentru s2 in care aveti tot
8756657 we expect to see a quick and solid spike high within the next few weeks it may come as early as a few trading days from the date of this publication first we base this on the fact that the commitment of traders report in silver is showing us caution based upon countless previous experiences
8756658 march was one of the most volatile months for the precious metals ever experienced in modern history gold breached the 1 000 level and in a matter of days had fallen more than 100 silver moved above 21 per ounce and fell even harder hurting some folks who use leverage to trade these markets
8756659 this is the main point the fall is driven mainly because the price of precious metals is determined in a leveraged atmosphere as hedge funds panic and sell the commercial traders in the precious metals let out a huge sigh of relief as they are able to cover their short positions our sources indicate that many in the hedge fund community were urged to sell
8756660 last month we focused on the probability of the current corrective phase in the precious metals some are still of the opinion that the correction is almost over and we can expect to see silver and gold move toward their recent highs in short order we do not see that taking place and expect at least a three to six month corrective phase to develop
8756661 the market provided tons of information to comment upon this month but i want to keep it brief since much is available for free on the internet the cftc sent another message that they see no manipulation in the silver price i commented on this as did other silver commentators so if you missed it please check the main web site the thrust of my public article was that the amount of silver on paper is about 100 times the amount of physical silver and the silver derivatives are potentially a problem area in the future
8756662 i suspect a sharp and hard move to the downside similar to last year that will take all markets down including the mining shares and the metals
8756663 in this court we require reasons for an adjournment has your client any reasons why this matter should not proceed today has your client a valid argument against this winding up petition
8756664 i have had many years of experience at the law as you know and it is my considered view that faced with the prospect of imminent and unavoidable disaster it is always wise to adjourn it for 90 days
8756665 problem list of banks increased 30 percent in the second quarter to the highest total in five years as more commercial real estate loans were overdue
8756666 there is an enormous amount of uncertainty about where we stand at the moment we are in the midst of the worst financial crisis since world war two
8756667 there are periods when markets look like they are getting better then another grenade explodes another bout of fear of sustainability of some financial institutions perhaps more intervention by the authorities
8756668 most of all i ran to stand up for all those who have been invisible to their government for eight long years
8756669 the fox knows many things but the hedgehog knows one big thing a hedgehog concept is not a goal intention or strategy to be the best it is an understanding of what you can be best at the distinction is absolutely crucial
8756670 the us is epicenter of market turmoil and global economic slowdown the country most exposed to credit crunch
8756671 substantial liquidation has occurred in the comex tocom and otc markets although the etf holders remain broadly resolute
8756672 i am convinced that if we are to wake from the weariness that is taking hold of the church in this country we must return to the sources of our catholic identity and mission to renew our strength and vitality
8756673 in this way we will through the grace of the holy spirit be in a position to counter the negative and constraining influence of secularism and hedonism that is currently dominating our society
8756674 all catholics who love the church and care deeply about the future of catholicism
8756675 though we are strengthened and healed by the lord through his word and sacraments the majority of us are not responding to our lords call to go out on his mission of hope
8756676 one of the reasons why we are gathered but not sent is due to a lack of confidence and knowledge of the catholic faith
8756677 it appears that many of us have forgotten the basic truth about the nature of the church that we have been gathered as a people of god not to be served but rather to serve god and each other especially the weak and the poor
8756678 as i have reflected on the great issues facing this generation in the life of the church i have become more and more convinced that the answers are to be found through a prayerful faithful and creative engagement with the deposit of faith presented in the documents of the second vatican council and its great summary the catechism of the catholic church
8756679 we have all witnessed with alarm many who profess to be catholics disavowing the churchs teaching authority particularly that of the pope and the congregation for the doctrine of the faith dismissing apostolic traditions and the doctrines of the fathers and giving the place of honour to the fashionable opinions of society
8756680 it is necessary for all of us to re gain a catholic sense of balance between change and continuity through maintaining the catholic understanding of the church which in practice is a continuous tradition and a living present authority
8756681 are you voting for her because you like her politics or because you liked bill clinton
8756682 i as well as all employees of ferrari are extremely saddened by the news of the passing of phil hill a man and a champion who gave so much to ferrari and who has always greatly represented the companys values inside and outside the racing track
8756683 phil hill raced and won many competitions both with prototype cars like the 24 hours of le mans and the 12 hours of sebring won three times each as well as with f1 single seaters with our car phil won the formula one championship title in 1961 as the first american born to reach this result phil and i have always kept in touch throughout the years and i know i will miss his passion and love for ferrari very much my deepest sympathies are with his wife alma and son derek in this sad moment
8756684 i had quite a rough night in dublin bars last night
8756685 it was a night off so im feeling a little shabby
8756686 they do seem to like folk music here the whole country seems more attuned to the genre
8756687 i feel that its easier to tell stories and have a chat on stage there is an amiable feeling in the room
8756688 i didnt feel like a singer before when i had bands in high school i would write the songs but there was another singer because i didnt think i had a good voice and wasnt confident with it
8756689 when i was recording the debut on night a lot of those songs were just spoken really i didnt have any volume in my voice i was just not a competent singer i think ive become more confident playing so many shows falling in love with a lot of voices that i know arent perfect and therefore realising that its an ok thing not to have a perfect voice
8756690 it was scary going over there nashville and scary working with those people in a way and i could never have done that before because i would have felt like i was desperately unworthy
8756691 i think on some levels i still felt like a bit of a kid next to those people who have played on or made some of my favourite albums
8756692 but now i see a lot of people have funny voices she laughs so its fine
8756693 sen mccain has always been sensitive to national crisis in the 2000 race he postponed his announcement to run for the presidency because of the situation in the balkans and we are monitoring the situation very closely
8756694 hillary said shes going to do anything to support barack obama that makes two of us

8756710 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8756711 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth

8756713 weve listened to feedback from our customers who asked that we provide a specific threshold for data usage and this would help them understand the amount of usage that would qualify as excessive
8756714 we know from experience the vast majority of customers we ask to curb usage do so voluntarily
8756715 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8756716 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8756717 the whole segment where theyd sit around and play you really got to see that glen campbell was not just a great singer and showman but he was a wonderful musician
8756718 i was stuck even as a kid by the level of musicianship
8756719 hey glen heres a song that didnt do anything for me
8756720 he said tell glen im not using the christmas tree house and its right on one of the courses there
8756721 s mycket r k nt in r motsatsen till ut och utia
8756722 were surprised by how many people opted to get full albums
8756723 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8756724 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8756725 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8756726 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8756727 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8756728 the postponement of this will make it less likely that physicians will treat medicaid patients
8756729 if politics is a contact sport then yesterday was the super bowl
8756730 i took a knee to the groin and an elbow to the chin nobody in the crowd is camera shy thats for sure
8756731 i felt like i played four quarters in a giants redskins game
8756732 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8756733 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8756734 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8756735 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8756736 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8756737 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8756738 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8756739 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8756740 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8756741 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8756742 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8756743 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8756744 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8756745 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8756746 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8756747 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8756748 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8756749 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8756750 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8756751 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8756752 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8756753 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8756754 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8756755 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life
8756756 he is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of all creation for by him all things were created in heaven and on earth visible and invisible whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities all things were created through him and for him and he is before all things and in him all things hold together and he is the head of the body the church he is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in everything he might be preeminent for in him all the fullness of god was pleased to dwell and through him to reconcile to himself all things whether on earth or in heaven making peace by the blood of his cross
8756757 laminin is the major non collagenous component of the basal lamina such as those on which cells of an epithelium sit
8756758 for since the creation of the world his invisible attributes are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse
8756759 but god demonstrates his own love toward us in that while we were still sinners christ died for us
8756760 the code of canon law says in 915 that those whom the penalty of excommunication or interdict has been imposed or declared and others who obstinately persist in manifest grave sin
8756761 what is at issue is whether a politician who does not himself or herself participate in an abortion but supports a womans right to choose or however else shows support for abortion is guilty of grave sin and then obstinately persists in this state of grave sin
8756762 the churchs concern is for anyone who persists in grave sin hoping that medicinal measures which is how excommunication and interdict are to be understood may draw them away from the wrong path to the truth of our faith
8756763 st paul said that before receiving communion a christian should take part in self examination and only then receive the body of the lord after necessary conversion 1 cor 11 28
8756764 i deeply admire politicians for their desire to serve the public good and to make the many sacrifices necessary to win public office and to give themselves to public service
8756765 they ought to be motivated by a concern for justice good order the public good etc
8756766 one of the greatest areas for effecting justice is the support of life in the womb and through all stages of life abortion goes against the churchs understanding based on the teaching of jesus on the inviolability of innocent human life including the unborn and of the obligation of public servants to protect the weakest in society it is hard to see how the support of abortion is not a very grave evil
8756767 perhaps politicians embrace the support of a womans right to choose unthinkingly following party policy this is where the church with the help of its pastors and through fellow believers needs to come to the assistance of those who serve the public good
8756768 it may take time to work with political figures before one can conclude that they are obstinately persisting in manifest grave sin and that therefore denial of communion or of encouraging them not to present themselves for communion is reached as the medicinal remedy to draw them back to the way of christ our lord the way the truth and the life
8756769 if one were to allow catholic political or other public figures to freely espouse abortion without drawing to their attention that this is a grave evil
8756770 other believers might be tended to accept this not knowing any better and be led on the wrong path that is what scandal is

8756786 there was no vision that it would be moved in my lifetime
8756787 people realised that if there was a downturn in the numbers at the saleyards they may no longer be viable but generally they were seen as having a long life
8756788 when i left the council the consensus was that the area would be developed without impacting on the saleyards
8756789 no one disputed that it had to move out of the middle of wodonga but there was plenty said about the move to bandiana
8756790 the albury wodonga development corporation owned a lot of the surrounding land and planned further residential development
8756791 the corporation had to accept the decision and the land to the south was turned into industrial land as a buffer to the saleyards
8756792 they went all over the place to pick the eyes out of the good saleyards and understand the pitfalls of the bad ones
8756793 there was a rumour going around saying there were a lot of young women just having babies because of the baby bonus
8756794 theyre not doing it for welfare they still want careers and everything
8756795 we need to take a look at why rural girls are getting pregnant at twice the rate of city women
8756796 my babys dad said if you keep the baby then im not going to be able to handle it and ill kill myself
8756797 i sort of felt like i had two lives in my hands
8756798 they are safer vehicles and are easier to stop and the trailers go where the trucks go less 2 per cent so they wont move around
8756799 because they have to have more training youll have better drivers
8756800 and you will be able to move more freight with fewer vehicles
8756801 and being able to use one truck instead of one and a half or two trucks would make a real difference
8756802 but it would take a lot of flexibility out of the process i cant imagine being able to take them into streets so there would be some added costs at both ends
8756803 for the past eight or nine years seven b triples have been using the route between broadmeadows and geelong very successfully
8756804 as long as they use good designated roads like the hume b triples can have higher productivity moving more goods for less fuel and fewer trucks
8756805 its extremely alarming given this wire was deliberately placed at this location at a height that could have easily killed a motorbike rider
8756806 the wire was carefully strung and well anchored in place to cause maximum injury or damage
8756807 it would have been hard to see particularly at night
8756808 while it would cause damage to a vehicle the real danger is those riding motorbikes
8756809 if someone was caught in the act and someone was killed as a result the offender is looking at manslaughter
8756810 even if the person is not killed and just seriously injured the offender faces charges of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm
8756811 whichever way the draw goes whichever way the matches go as long as hopefully its a win for me im pretty happy about it
8756812 oh yes i remember i wont forget but id like to have a more recent memory as of like 08
8756813 miley cyrus is just a little too tarty forgive me i dont want her to look like shes going into a convent school but its just a little too much for a 15 year old
8756814 if i didnt know better id swear she was 25
8756815 she went from looking like a little farm girl to looking like royalty
8756816 now she needs to push back a little so she doesnt look too dowdy or old
8756817 i know what women want they want to be beautiful
8756818 that was always the thing for me to design and create dresses i am not capable of doing anything else
8756819 it was something that really excited me having a documentary on my life being made
8756820 when i work and i create i am not very approachable so having wires around me and knowing that everything was being recorded really did irritate me a little bit
8756821 they put up with a lot they were very brave they only screamed at us occasionally and we put most of it in the film
8756822 after so many decades after so much work after so much freedom can you imagine them telling me you cant do this you cant do that i would eat them
8756823 i turn it over to god and think theres nothing i can do about it and i also think what are the odds ive been flying for 18 years and had one emergency landing thats pretty good
8756824 we never lost cabin pressure so we didnt have to use our oxygen masks by the time we got on the ground the crack on the front of the planes window was huge and getting bigger by the second
8756825 it was like in the movies when they land and you see all the fire trucks and emergency crews thats a real experience
8756826 i didnt have any anxiety like the last thing i want to do is get back on an airplane i did feel like the pilots and the flight attendants handled it perfectly
8756827 they were so very calm it wasnt a scary situation until afterward when you think about what possibly could have happened
8756828 look we didnt plan on a freak river flood god must really want those kids dead
8756829 es bueno para que los chicos del club tengan respaldo
8756830 estaba tranquilo pese a que arsenal ganaba 2 a 1 porque en el f tbol siempre hay sorpresas
8756831 what really stands out when youve got vlad and teixeira back to back in the same lineup is what he isnt
8756832 lets put it this way i know which one i fear and it isnt him to me when you see truly great players they always have that extra edge that killer instinct well if this guy has it he doesnt project it hey hes a good player obviously but is he a guy whos going to legitimately carry a club for the money hes asking i dont see that
8756833 and ever since then philip just went 7 for 7 today on his field goal attempts during the team situation
8756834 he has really taken a huge step forward it has helped him knowing hes got the job secured
8756835 but were going to make a decision based on where theyre at the time
8756836 vai acelora care se intineaza cu blasfemiatorii eretici vai acelora care batjocoresc dumnezeiestile scripturi vai de cei cati murdaresc sfanta credinta cu eresuri sau incheie vreo intelegere cu ereticii

8756853 cel ce face pe tacutul de dragul rautatii planuieste videsug impotriva aproapelui neizbandind intru acesta se departeaza adaugand durere la patima sa dar cel ce tace pentru folos sporeste prietenia si se departeaza bucurandu se ca unul ce a luat lumina ce imprastie intunericul

8756882 jeder w chst mit dem vertrauen das ihm entgegen gebracht wird
8756883 expectation is that liv tyler along with several of the original villains will return
8756884 as a result the court waived his appearance for that hearing
8756885 my children have not managed to grow out of their uniforms before they have worn them out or left them on the bus
8756886 the shopping experience is so much easier if you do it online buying trousers with an adjustable waistband so they fit
8756887 it is great news for parents that they can kit the kids out for school on a shoestring budget without worrying that their new uniform will be in tatters by the end of the first week
8756888 more expensive school clothes might well be more comfortable but that does not mean theyll be more durable
8756889 it is just another way of getting consumer loyalty from parents
8756890 i think with the economy we are definitely looking for sales and thats part of why were in the sale section at target
8756891 a lot of people are definitely trying to get more bang for the buck
8756892 i am going to pick and choose what i can find here and then hit other stores as we need to
8756893 no one really writes with a pen and pencil like i did was in college
8756894 get away from the frenetic environment of the convention find some place quiet or talk to somebody in recovery

8756896 die angestrebten ver nderungen griffen in die budgethoheit des parlaments ein und seien daher unzul ssig
8756897 to those who still believe in the myth of a maverick instead of the reality of a politician i say lets compare to candidate mccain
8756898 candidate mccain now supports the wartime tax cuts that senator mccain once denounced as immoral
8756899 candidate mccain says he would now vote against the immigration bill that senator mccain wrote
8756900 i turn it over to god and think theres nothing i can do about it and i also think what are the odds ive been flying for 18 years and had one emergency landing thats pretty good
8756901 we never lost cabin pressure so we didnt have to use our oxygen masks by the time we got on the ground the crack on the front of the planes window was huge and getting bigger by the second
8756902 it was like in the movies when they land and you see all the fire trucks and emergency crews thats a real experience
8756903 i didnt have any anxiety like the last thing i want to do is get back on an airplane i did feel like the pilots and the flight attendants handled it perfectly
8756904 they were so very calm it wasnt a scary situation until afterward when you think about what possibly could have happened
8756905 this is a very serious crime incident which is very traumatic for victims and also very time consuming for our local police to investigate
8756906 i often ask myself what causes a person so young to commit such serious crimes
8756907 is it the non existence of good parenting for the child lack of values lack of respect for another person or a societal problem in that we have not provided adequate support for the greater family regarding their needs
8756908 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life
8756909 he is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of all creation for by him all things were created in heaven and on earth visible and invisible whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities all things were created through him and for him and he is before all things and in him all things hold together and he is the head of the body the church he is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in everything he might be preeminent for in him all the fullness of god was pleased to dwell and through him to reconcile to himself all things whether on earth or in heaven making peace by the blood of his cross
8756910 laminin is the major non collagenous component of the basal lamina such as those on which cells of an epithelium sit
8756911 for since the creation of the world his invisible attributes are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse
8756912 but god demonstrates his own love toward us in that while we were still sinners christ died for us
8756913 is that saying the rich and the poor have come together
8756914 how will it benefit all of society in the future
8756915 the investigation has not quite begun until the passengers who have been taken to hospital are being treated
8756916 whichever way the draw goes whichever way the matches go as long as hopefully its a win for me im pretty happy about it
8756917 oh yes i remember i wont forget but id like to have a more recent memory as of like 08
8756918 ibm has demonstrated for the first time the game changing impact solid state technologies can have on how businesses and individuals manage and access information

8756984 the bittern has suffered an ill fated history in the uk having endured extinction once and having been on the verge of extinction again in the late 1990s
8756985 we werent prepared to accept a second extinction of the bittern so we launched a rescue bid to keep the bittern as a british bird this bid has been so successful that a wide range of other wildlife has benefited too there are too many threatened species in the world and the turning around of the uks bittern population shows what can be achieved with a combination of practical determination proper research and appropriate funding
8756986 this years figures are a fantastic achievement and show that we can bring species back from the brink of extinction you would probably have to go back at least 130 years to find a better year for this booming bird
8756987 despite our success theres still much more to do we are working to halt the loss and fragmentation of the countrys wetlands and to create new ones
8756988 we know bitterns can thrive on coastal and inland freshwater wetlands and we are confident that we can extend its range still further so that more people can enjoy its distinctive booming call
8756989 it is vitally important that we conserve our rich variety of wildlife such as the bittern and that is why the government works with conservation groups like the rspb on these projects this years wet weather has helped the bittern population which shows the real impact of small changes in our climate understanding the impact of these changes is key to conserving our wildlife and taking forward effective management of habitats

8756994 were not after pointing fingers at any particular people what we actually just want is change
8756995 people keep saying im blaming this and im blaming that
8756996 what im trying to do is explain the range of pressures that were under
8756997 there are multiple pressure points and weve got to deal with each of them but first of all weve actually got to have an open and honest discussion about the pressure points in our hospital system
8756998 when you do get a growth a temporary blimp in numbers going up the hospitals cannot cope any more and you get this bed block scenario where then emergency department cant cope because they dont have the physical space to store the patients who have to be in hospital
8756999 they need extra physical space to examine other patients to determine if theyre right to go home or they need to be in hospital
8757000 the staff can only do so much and cope with so much
8757001 there is a whole spectre of patients waiting for 24 hours to be admitted in jason recliners chairs and being forced to go into wards in x ray rooms and waiting rooms shows that townsville hospital just cant cope any more
8757002 i think with this sort of work overload and the frustrations of the staff over the last number of years is it inevitable that people will seek a more sustainable work career for their future years
8757003 its just sort of running along as sort of an extended problem here and i think that makes people quite frustrated and worn out
8757004 that tells us there has not been adequate planning that the full population influx into queensland has not been properly calculated and the impact of an ageing population is not properly understood
8757005 we get anecdotal reports of people who have been set up to have elective surgery and then having it cancelled up to six to eight times
8757006 thats an absolute tragedy i mean its an indictment on the planning of health services in queensland
8757007 the balance between elective demand and emergency demand is something we and the staff of the hospital spend a considerable energy ensuring that we get the balances close to right as we can so in a time like this where the emergency demand increases then we look to how we can perhaps look to some of our elective patients
8757008 the design of the toowoomba hospital is such that we have a number of areas that we can open a surge capacity if you like
8757009 were fortunate to be able to do that and flex up the number of beds that we are able to open when demand is as it is now
8757010 this is a monumental moment in our nations history and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8757011 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8757012 i would like to ask the distinguished representative of the united states weapons of mass destruction have you found them yet in iraq or are you still looking for them
8757013 im not a psychologist and i dont know what brought on the free association we heard from ambassador churkin
8757014 those are well known we thought we had overcome them apparently there are still some lingering frustrations but there is no territorial ambition or desire to dismember iraq
8757015 im afraid this assertion ambassador churkin simply does not stand up to scrutiny

8757043 mr bear sat next to me at the craps tables and ordered me a giant pina colada he was wearing a hawaiian shirt and was pretty drunk already he asked me to come up to his room i nervously declined and he didnt really notice he just got up and went to puke in the back alley

8757048 a guiding hand is needed words fail perhaps not madeline albright is after all the woman who dubbed the u s the indispensable nation and said the u s sees farther than anyone else because we stand taller now be fair its difficult if not impossible to imagine why such a humble and self effacing perspective might lead to resentment and even hatred on the part of others and what is needed is an effective response to violent extremism oh my yes too bad none of that was available in the first few months of 2003
8757049 i think supporters of free markets too often defend low wages in an almost apologetic fashion you know wages really arent that low or yeah it would be great if cashiers could make 25 per hour but it would drive prices through the roof but theres nothing to apologize for low wages are good wages are prices and prices are signals just as an above market price for milk will give inaccurate signals to dairy farmers and result in a misallocation of farmland paying above market wages will give inaccurate signals to workers and result in a misallocation of human capital
8757050 god doesn t make policy people such as obama do thus no separation of church and state argument will fly here obama wasn t being asked about his position on the trinity or transubstantiation but on a hot button issue existing within a continual maelstrom of legislative battles so if it is above his pay grade i suggest that the presidency if not politics itself is also so strangely though while obama claimed that the question was above his pay grade legislating in areas in which it must be answered never seemed to be why he never shrank from making policy or pronouncements regarding abortion he never said i m uh sorry but this issue is uh above my pay grade i ll have to withhold judgment and uh recuse myself from votes nor did he take the logical compassionate and humane default position which is to say that since i don t know whether this being is human i ll err on the side of caution i won t allow him to be killed instead whenever obama was called to weigh in there was never any question as to where he stood shoulder to shoulder with the most radical elements of the pro abortion lobby and as with them we have to wonder not about when obama believes human life begins but whether he believes in the human right to life at all
8757051 what does a police state look like that is a good question maybe it looks something like this here is a photo of a small group of people trying to hold a demonstration in denver at the democratic party convention notice the police overkill but at least there is still freedom of the press right apparently not here is how the donutmunchers dealt with abc news producer asa eslocker mr eslocker was standing on a public sidewalk with a camera crew when democratic party officials were exiting a hotel he was doing a story on major donors to the democratic efforts and some of those major donors were coming out of the hotel police decided that he had no right to do that story and began by manhandling him and pushing him off the sidewalk into traffic abc news reports that the donutmuncher told eslocker youre lucky i didnt knock the fuck out of you here is some video of the incident welcome to america land of the free and if you believe that i have some swamp land in florida for sale
8757052 the third night of the convention biden aside presented a more coherent message than the previous evenings which were dominated by the obligatory tasks of undoing the rightwing attacks on michelle obama and satisfying hillary clinton and the hillary hold ons on thursday it seemed as if the obama campaign was finally able to get down to business making the pitch the evening program opened with melissa etheridge connecting god bless america to progressive favorites such as born in the u s a then came a series of iraq veterans and other former warriors who rammed home the point george w bush and john mccain have truly screwed up the foreign policy of the united states this was mccains turf national security and the democrats hit it hard by bringing to the stage tammy duckworth a paraplegic iraq vet who has as much standing as anyone to question and criticize mccains judgment on iraq past present and future
8757053 surely we ve all had the experience on the phone you call customer service with a problem and then get stuck listening to the person on the other end reciting a script at you the operator stops talking and the scriptwriter starts speaking through him you can tell when the switch occurs and your heart sinks one moment the person on the other end is talking to you you re being treated as a human being the next he s reciting at you you can tell he s reading from a script and is mentally in some far away land the reciter s brain disengages as the script takes over and yet yours is supposed to remain engaged at the end of the script you re supposed to have been convinced that s insulting and no one falls for it over the telephone so who falls for it in politics
8757054 are the police getting more comfortable throwing their weight around no matter whos watching they must be if theyre willing to roust network news producers accompanied by camera crews that are guaranteed to get their footage on the evening news abcs asa eslocker who was standing on a public sidewalk was forced into the street by officers before being wrestled into handcuffs and hauled off his crew captured the whole incident on video im not saying that its worse to harass professional journalists than it is to assault college kids and average people walking down the street im saying that it should be assumed to be incredibly stupid to attack people who have access to satellite transmission facilities and teams of lawyers
8757055 the layperson reads about the history purpose and language of the constitution and concludes that it strictly limits the ability of the federal government to intervene in foreign countries in the economy and in our private lives but legal scholars seem to rely more on supreme court decisions and established practices by the president and congress to effectively give the federal government carte blanche to do whatever they please for instance they will claim the first amendment prohibits states from allowing prayer in schools but allows congress to regulate political speech this is an inversion of the first amendment because while the first amendments language puts a limit on congresss power it does not limit state power so now barack obama is a presidential candidate whose entire program appears to me to explicitly or implicitly violate the constitution but im sure he would disagree and hes the one with the harvard law degree
8757056 the merest glance at america s founding suggests that no one really wanted full bore elective despotism nonetheless american presidentialists apparently find just that in the terms war powers and commander in chief and in presidential dominance of foreign affairs yet their forebear hamilton conceded that in war the president has nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces as first general and admiral of the confederacy federalist 69 presidentialists take john marshalls comment in congress that the president is our sole organ of communication with other nations as entailing lots of power and always presidents assert powers and store up precedents presidentialists turn presidential duties chores and everyday practices into powers and strong figures have built the office
8757057 paul gottfried thinks that abortion is as significant an issue as riverboat gambling to obama and mccain they talk about it when they have to to please some core constituencies but deep down they couldnt care less abortion does seem to be a trivial issue especially to republicans they had four years 02 06 with majorities in both houses and a republican in the white house to do something about it but they did not
8757058 obama says that one of his tasks for the convention is to help people understand who he is and where he came from thats his challenge because voters some innocently some not so innocently wonder whether he shares their values it is the weakness hillary clintons strategist mark penn tried to exploit explaining in one of his strategy memos that voters would find that obama was not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and his values whats striking about the political distance obama has traveled since 2004 is that the idea that he was emblematic of the american dream was not something he had to prove four years ago it was self evident it was one of the reasons he was speaking in the first place

8757092 hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants
8757093 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
8757094 dream big and you can grow up to become president of the united states someday
8757095 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more sen
8757096 these challenges are not all of governments making obama plans to say
8757097 but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w
8757098 i think its time we taught them a lesson about how to organize and win elections plouffe told the audience starting to assemble on the field this afternoon
8757099 youve helped us respond to the sleaze coming from john mccain and his campaign plouffe told the crowd the manager suggesting that this gathering was emblematic of the enlistment of voters which obama plans to make the core of his campaign for the white house
8757100 were going to undertake a voter registration drive the likes of which american politics has never seen
8757101 i have a dream speech 40 years ago on the national mall in washington will address the audience here so will rev bernice king his sister
8757102 job well done even in the midst of a bruising campaign in which the mccain campaign accuses obama of being
8757103 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to obama plans to say according to excerpts of his speech released
8757104 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8757105 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8757106 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8757107 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8757108 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8757109 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8757110 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8757111 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time
8757112 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8757113 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8757114 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8757115 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8757116 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8757117 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8757118 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8757119 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8757120 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8757121 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8757122 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8757123 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8757124 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power
8757125 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8757126 were scheduled to be on 45 state ballots by september 12 and were ready to rumble
8757127 the thing is i dont see what the obviously do not have a problem with female gamers or female bloggers but i dont understand why some women seem to think this is such important distinction for their blog
8757128 girls bored me they still do i love mickey mouse more than any girl i have ever known
8757129 has anybody heard the word guantanamo mentioned this entire convention
8757130 president obama and vice president biden will shut down guantanamo respect the constitution and make clear once and for all the united states of america does not torture not now not ever
8757131 sento le tue mani lo stesso anche se non ti ho accanto vorrei averti vicino per farti sentire che bello linverno quando un semplice abbraccio scalda pi di un bacio
8757132 aye chic keep ya head up learn from this the more you try the better and stronger youll be at it and experience breeds confidence
8757133 not a xenophobic party not an intolerant party we are a compassionate party that insists on the rule of law and endorses federal law

8757136 if he loses by 2 or 3 then i would certainly say that the racial issue was a major factor
8757137 i would hope that the democrats could have enough senators elected in november so that we would not any longer need to include joe lieberman among the senators
8757138 from his time served as a prisoner of war in vietnam carried to the white house on the backs of the media elite wait a second
8757139 you are so funny my little man i love you so so so much
8757140 you can do things for employees that dont cost anything but are worth a million dollars
8757141 small businesses can do these things because they arent constrained by a 500 page policy manual
8757142 every employee should be given the chance to determine how best to do their jobs as well as increased authority and leeway in the handling of company resources
8757143 we created employee committees to do things like set up a health fair a food co op and other projects
8757144 watching how employees manage these committees helps us create a great bench of leaders for the company
8757145 we cant give our staff thousands of dollars in bonus checks but we can do little things for them
8757146 we mixed up people from production quality control and maintenance
8757147 it was a great team builder because people from different departments are often at odds with each other
8757148 you would have thought people were winning oscars everybody was just thrilled
8757149 and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth
8757150 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8757151 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8757152 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8757153 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8757154 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8757155 the scheherazade of the sales rack unveils how to unearth haute looks for less and gives advice on dressing well from choosing tailors to finding bras
8757156 i have known the author for over twenty years time has proven he has indeed discovered the secret to overcoming one of lifes most difficult challenges if you struggle with ocd or know someone who does this book is absolutely a must read
8757157 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8757158 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8757159 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8757160 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth

8757163 its a good feeling to be back on american soil
8757164 i havent been back 24 hours but its funny today at lunchtime i said im kind of hungry and we passed a hot dog stand on the corner and some pretzels
8757165 how much more american can you get i grabbed a hot dog a drink and a hot pretzel it feels good to be back
8757166 i was at the launch of tigers new video golf game last night being able to talk to him just for a little bit he was saying how proud he was congratulations
8757167 the management and the administration at the hospital had been informed numerous times since 2005
8757168 they were warned there was a risk that the number of cases of c difficile would increase
8757169 she would tense up in pain while she was in a coma
8757170 in the past i had my sister with me and in the present im all alone
8757171 we need to boil that down we need to figure what changes have to be made to accommodate the concerns that are raised
8757172 theres been positive feedback but theres also been some adjustments that need to be made and we really need to sit down and talk about that and put our best foot forward
8757173 what are the adjustments that have to happen not to assume we got it all 100 per cent completely right
8757174 in my mind its a statement of principles its not a recipe
8757175 i think if we talk to people and tell them this is a statement of principles of intent and during the implementation that theres leeway to discuss with canadians i think thats the logical way to do it
8757176 those things sometimes may be different in magnitude but theres certainly at base the same problem and i feel that i have the experience to deal with that
8757177 we need to convince voters that we as new democrats would take economic issues as seriously as we do on social issues
8757178 and that includes issues around the environment and the economy that includes issues of key investment training and all of those things which well talk to more specifically during the campaign
8757179 if the partys going to gain electoral success in this province we need to go after soft liberals soft conservative undecideds on key issues that are important to them and the environment is one of those
8757180 i believe the way you attract green voters to the ndp is by proposing good policy around the environment
8757181 firmly believed that the ndp should continue to support separate school education
8757182 its a long campaign a bit of a marathon and im pretty used to running a marathon
8757183 we never really advise people in our seasonal forecast to bet the family farm on it because it is a bit of a crapshoot especially here in canada
8757184 people give us credit and i think after about 192 years weve been doing this people are relatively confident in our predictions and quite frankly so am i
8757185 if somebody doesnt want to believe it they dont have to
8757186 it really is a roll of the dice because we dont have the one kind of driving force that shapes the winters in canada
8757187 because weve come off a tough winter and a disappointing summer one might feel that nothing can get us down
8757188 or maybe itll be the straw that broke the camels back maybe people will say enoughs enough and there will be mass migration to the south
8757189 from our perspective theres absolutely nothing you can do about it

8757202 at times you get so over stimulated and agitated by these voice that you often flip out
8757203 i have to be very sincere the person that makes me feel very happy also because she chose vintage was julia roberts in erin brockovich when she got the academy award
8757204 i was very excited i was not in los angeles but i saw on television and i really was excited to see her when she appeared with my dress
8757205 when i work and i create i am not very approachable to know everything i say was being recorded did irritate me
8757206 the film was showing exactly what i am there were moments of anger when somebody says something that i dont like but i was completely myself from the beginning to the end and nothing was edited
8757207 it was amazing to kind of hang out with valentino and giancarlo for two years
8757208 i think its time we taught them a lesson about how to win an election
8757209 the stakes in this election are too big we need all of you we have to out hustle out work out think them
8757210 and if you just pass it on pass it on pass it on that is not comparable to second hand sales in the normal physical goods area where you have physical wear out
8757211 were not going to be overly confrontational with retailers were going to solve it with better more interesting and online offerings going forward

8757251 the four times boston marathon winner knew that she was ahead of the pack but suffered a rude shock when she saw romanian constantina tomescu headed for the national olympic stadium to steal the olympic marathon gold medal with ndereba having to contend with the silver kenyas first medal at these games
8757252 i didnt see her breaking away and after all i normally run my own race and i dont look at other athletes even tomescu knows that i thought i was in the lead and only when we got to the stadium i saw her and was a bit surprised but it was too late to do anything if id seen her earlier definitely i would have pushed
8757253 my strategy was to start strong and finish strong because god says he is the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end
8757254 no man can do what the lord has done for me

8757259 how does this man have such learning when he has never been taught
8757260 my teaching is not mine but his who sent me
8757261 did not moses give you the law yet none of you keeps the law why are you looking for an opportunity to kill me
8757262 you have a demon who is trying to kill you
8757263 i performed one work and all of you are astonished moses gave you circumcision it is of course not from moses but from the patriarchs and you circumcise a man on the sabbath if a man receives circumcision on the sabbath in order that the law of moses may not be broken are you angry with me because i healed a mans whole body on the sabbath do not judge by appearances but judge with right judgment
8757264 is not this the man whom they are trying to kill and here he is speaking openly but they say nothing to him can it be that the authorities really know that this is the messiah yet we know where this man is from but when the messiah comes no one will know where he is from
8757265 you know me and you know where i am from i have not come on my own but the one who sent me is true and you do not know him i know him because i am from him and he sent me
8757266 when the messiah comes will he do more signs than this man has done
8757267 i will be with you a little while longer and then i am going to him who sent me you will search for me but you will not find me and where i am you cannot come
8757268 where does this man intend to go that we will not find him does he intend to go to the dispersion among the greeks and teach the greeks what does he mean by saying you will search for me and you will not find me and where i am you cannot come

8757295 i was told that they are interested but discussions on this are very superficial before anything else its nothing that can happen in a few months if its going to happen its going to be bid out
8757296 we also have to be briefed on the plans of the executive and what direction they have for the hospital because we wouldnt want to be embarrassed when we are asked about it and we dont know anything

8757326 weve listened to feedback from our customers who asked that we provide a specific threshold for data usage and this would help them understand the amount of usage that would qualify as excessive
8757327 we know from experience the vast majority of customers we ask to curb usage do so voluntarily
8757328 caregivers have similar cortisol levels as controls their cells seem to be hearing less of this signal in other words something goes awry in caregivers white blood cells so they are not able to receive the signal from cortisol that tells them to shut down inflammation
8757329 because people have traditionally thought that higher cortisol is the reason that stress contributes to disease but this work shows that at least in caregivers its actually the opposite theres too little cortisol signal being heard by the cells rather than too much
8757330 we dont know how to account for the resilience of some stressed people exposed to severe sustained stress or the vulnerability of some people to relatively mild stress
8757331 the better that we understand the underlying molecular mechanisms that link stress to illness the more likely we are to make progress in answering these important questions
8757332 mr mathew naik is killed at kritangia village near raikia he was boys hostel superintendent for many years and at present he was diocese executive member they caught and put him in the water and cut into pieces and burnt in front of the church they have also targeted the christian leaders of the district all the leaders are hiding i request you with tears kindly organize the prayer for us

8757336 obviously youre balancing the needs to draw attention to the church against the needs of saving energy and thats something that requires careful consideration weve raised the issue about saving energy in church discussions but no one from outside has ever challenged the floodlighting

8757339 i visited one church in a place called ptsa close to the border with south ossetia where everyone was in hiding because normally when cars come to the village they have been looters
8757340 but i was able to speak to ossetians russians and georgians and share the message of hope amidst the sense of hopelessness and powerlessness and remind them of jesuss commandment after the resurrection do not be afraid
8757341 if russia is given the green light the entire world will be in disorder
8757342 he is insensible of both his own folly and danger and of the divine goodness in so miraculously saving him
8757343 i think there is a sanitised hagiographical view of charles wesley so it is helpful to see how even he struggled with his faith at times in the day to day life of the 18th century and found solace and strength in the divine
8757344 he had trials and tribulations and its quite helpful to have this portrait of charles wesley rather than this saintly halo endowed indi vidual
8757345 i believe the conference suc ceeded in doing this to a very remarkable degree more than most people expected
8757346 and there can be no doubt that practically all who were present sincerely wanted the communion to stay together
8757347 a strong majority of bishops present agreed that moratoria on same sex blessings and on cross provincial interventions were necessary
8757348 much support for the idea of a pastoral forum as a means of addressing present and future tensions so as to avoid the confusing situation of violations of provincial boundaries and competing jurisdictions

8757399 his friends heard a scream and a splash and saw a white guy running very fast
8757400 they went to look in the water and saw nothing and called police baltimore city fire department divers pulled ankushs body from the inner harbor about two hours later this is being investigated as a suspicious death
8757401 my brother is i mean was very nice i want to know who killed him
8757402 i think there will be something of a battle over how to define poverty and whether to count benefits whether to change the definition so that it results in more people being officially poor or something in between those two positions
8757403 i think from republicans youre going to probably find more of the types of policies that theyve proposed before so welfare reform made cash welfare benefits contingent upon work activity education of some sort
8757404 its worth noting is actually bipartisan agreement on starting to address at least that
8757405 thats six times as much as the antipoverty benefits that are actually counted to determine whether somebody is poor or not
8757406 so at best were getting a partial picture its an important picture and its important to have this be consistent and everybody understand whats going on but i think thats part of the backdrop here that these are useful statistics but they dont give us the whole answer of whats going on
8757407 i dont think thats going to happen but that gives you sort of the sense of the scale of whats going on and i think thats part of the reason why theres a lot of foment about trying to fix this
8757408 that would do the same thing that republicans i would say are gravitating around which is count more of the current benefits that are provided by taxpayers to help alleviate poverty as income but it would go beyond that
8757409 it would reduce poverty at the start by counting more benefits but then it takes steps away from that that result in defining more americans as poor than today and it does that by subtracting certain costs from income it varies the calculation of someones income based on their geographical housing costs and other measures
8757410 add that all up depending on your assumptions you could increase the number of americans who are poor by 15 million and go from about 37 million up to 52 million
8757411 again that all depends on assumptions and how congress would write this and all the sort of minutia of all this but its telling i think that theres agreement at least on the first step on counting more benefits that taxpayers already provide to determine who is poor
8757412 the good news is every family type is today less likely to be poor than in the year in which i was born in the late 1960s but the bad news is more americans are living and being raised in the types of families that are relatively more likely to be poor
8757413 just because of that sort of demographic drift that continues despite efforts in welfare reform and there are further efforts to try to get at the family marriage and policy in what was called the deficit reduction act a couple of years ago it becomes harder and harder every year just to stay still much less to make progress against poverty
8757414 some point to a general stagnation against poverty in the last generation and that depends on part on not paying as much attention to benefits that are provided but it also requires us to look the other way and discount the fact that the nature of american families is changing
8757415 one series which i think would be a particularly great addition to the collection is the wing commander series just me then

8757450 i think theres a reason why theres no bump youd expect the democrats would be be way ahead and theyre not
8757451 no credentials no experience and the american people are realizing that
8757452 what was really amazing last night was kerry making a joke about being for it being for it before he was against it
8757453 whats not funny at all is that jeff beatty supports the mccain bush republican policy of staying in iraq for 100 years
8757454 this guy should actually listen to the people of massachusetts who want to end the bush policy in iraq instead of making ridiculous claims to get the press to pay attention to him

8757598 it is good for them to help players learn english when i learned english i became a better player but to suspend them i dont think so

8757603 were not just looking at the lpga as it is now
8757604 were looking at the future of the lpga as you well know we have a large international membership all indications are its not going to get smaller
8757605 if were getting any criticism its coming from outside the organization its not coming from the players and those are the people to whom it applies
8757606 surely if you can say hello thats english is that good enough

8757617 it looks like the only defense these christians have is god himself because the indian government has proved itself unable to stop the violence
8757618 while condemning the dastardly act of murder we appeal to one and all to maintain communal harmony and peace
8757619 the christians were not at all involved in the incident nevertheless there have been already over 45 instances of violence including the burning alive of at least five persons and over 300 in rupagaon kandhamal
8757620 as a mark of our solidarity with our suffering brothers and sisters and as a protest against all acts of communal violence and atrocities on the christian community and other innocent people we request all our christian schools colleges and other educational institutions to be closed on friday august 29 2008 and we wish that everywhere peaceful marches rallies be conducted with black flags demonstration in a truly prayerful spirit

8757622 we appeal to the central and state governments to take strong measures to curb violence caused by any group in the country and urge all political social and religious organizations to desist from spreading communal hated which has already taken a heavy toll in our country
8757623 we simply cant drill our way to energy independence even if you drilled in all of john mccains backyards including the ones he cant remember

8757646 i and mohandas menon the cricket statistician for sure deducted runs from sachins school score in the world record partnership because the original score card was not tallying with the total score
8757647 we had to send the score card to wisden for the record to be included we found out the mistake in the scoring they were more then a dozen school boys who did the scoring and ultimately the score card needed to be tallied hence hesitantly and sadly we had to deduct four runs from sachins score
8757648 sachin smilingly says you had other options like the byes leg byes wides no balls and so on why did you deduct my hard earned runs

8757658 raiding a private party amounts to an encroachment of privacy
8757659 obscenity charges can be slapped if the accused are found to be indulging in obscene activities in a public place
8757660 any activity that violates the law is illegal whether it is committed in public or in private
8757661 if it was a private party with no commercial motive the patrons cannot be said to be violating the law

8757673 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8757674 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8757675 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8757676 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8757677 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice

8757727 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8757728 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8757729 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8757730 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8757731 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8757732 ive been skating miles and miles every week right now
8757733 were both teachers and we have three young children so moneys always tight
8757734 i dont buy as much organic food as i used to simple as that
8757735 i tend to look at the lower cost cheaper brands rather than the brands i went for before
8757736 and also where i used to buy free range and organic foods i tend to steer away from them now
8757737 we saw the chicken programme some weeks ago on the television and we saw how cruel it is with these battery chickens and we buy free range eggs as well but organic is just not worth it for us
8757738 id be very phobic about having anything other than organic products and so i feel its necessary and something im prepared to pay for
8757739 i tend to cut out other things food is very fundamental to me
8757740 in circumstances which give rise to a reasonable suspicion that possession is for a purpose connected with the commission preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism
8757741 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a re financing package that would have kept our aircraft flying
8757742 even as late as lunchtime today we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
8757743 incorporated in jersey and tax resident in the republic of ireland
8757744 notwithstanding recent suggestions concerning possible changes to uk tax laws the directors believe that the most appropriate structure is for the new parent company of henderson to be tax resident in the republic of ireland
8757745 this has certainly been more complicated than running a raffle this has all been done in discussion with the electoral commission at the end of the day we did raise 120 000
8757746 satisfied that all our donations fully comply with the law
8757747 obviously we carry out diligent checks on all donations and take care that we are fully compliant with the law we are grateful to all our donors for their kind support
8757748 these figures show just how reliant the labour party is on the unions to stave off bankruptcy with the labour party divided and gordon brown vying for the title of britains weakest ever prime minister it is clear that ordinary donors are deserting brown and labours union paymasters are calling the shots
8757749 while we welcome the unions support it would be wrong to suggest that they are the sole source of the partys funding or that their financial support in any way gains them any undue influence in policy making trade union funding of political parties is the most open transparent and regulated of all party funding and is in stark contrast to the shadowy funding arrangements of the tories
8757750 were certainly seeing a dip the question is is it a dip thats bouncing back again or it could be the start of a real drop
8757751 i was talking to somebody in the nfu and they were saying its happening in beef and everywhere because at the end of the day its a nice to have not a need to have
8757752 i predict demand will plateau a bit but not decline
8757753 these values are important to people still the concern about the way we farm the way the countryside is under threat at times about animal welfare
8757754 this letter really emphasised it and we said thats it
8757755 it doesnt sound like much but it all adds up
8757756 thats the little ways people are saving pennies at the moment
8757757 once the ground has been declared non organic you shouldnt go back to it
8757758 this is the same system we have in place today
8757759 the only difference is that we will now provide a limit by which a customer may be contacted
8757760 an extremely large amount of data much more than a typical residential customer uses on a monthly basis
8757761 as part of our pre existing policy we will continue to contact the top users of our high speed internet service and ask them to curb their usage
8757762 if a customer uses more than 250 gb and is one of the top users of our service he or she may be contacted by comcast to notify them of excessive use
8757763 at that time well tell them exactly how much data per month they had used we know from experience the vast majority of customers we ask to curb usage do so voluntarily
8757764 though the proposed cap is relatively high it will increasingly ensnare more users as technology continues its natural progression
8757765 if comcast has oversold their network to the point of creating congestion problems then well disclosed caps for internet use are a better short term solution than comcasts current practice of illegally blocking internet traffic
8757766 my case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subjected to over a long period by the present commissioner sir ian blair
8757767 long honourable and occasionally blood stained record on the championing of diversity
8757768 in short i think it is long past time we shut up stop making public statements about a private dispute and get on with the job we are paid to do
8757769 i do not think it was appropriate for this matter to be conducted in such a public way
8757770 est bamos en una guerra entre bandos vivimos un enfrentamiento entre los agresores ap tridas y la rep blica a trav s de su brazo armado
8757771 muchas gracias a los soldados que me ayudaron a salvar a la argentina hist rica de la agresi n comunista
8757772 la persecuci n a los delincuentes subversivos no fue represi n aplicando las leyes las fuerzas armadas cumplieron la misi n encomendada por la naci n de vencer al enemigo
8757773 y somos nosotros quienes estamos siendo juzgados ostentamos el dudoso honor de ser el primer pa s del mundo que juzga a sus soldados victoriosos que lucharon por orden de y por el bien de sus compatriotas
8757774 the number of users who downloaded our patches there were a lot more active players than there were unit sales and i think we can safely say if they were still playing the game by the time our latest patch released and if they were playing on a pirated copy then they were a sale that didnt happen
8757775 it takes nothing away from the pc gamer if the game is also available on another platform
8757776 console technology has advanced a great deal since we released far cry and our teams have since found it very exciting to push the boundaries of what most people today consider possible to do on those platforms
8757777 the consoles themselves are in one sense simply very good drm technologies that consumers welcome and pay for in order to receive the benefits that come with them
8757778 there are plenty of mothers who arent very well educated who provide a great home environment and conversely some highly educated parents who dont provide such a good home environment
8757779 the fiction looks brilliantly varied but once again it seems to be non fiction that is particularly ambitious and unafraid of scaling the really big themes of history culture and society
8757780 my current case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subject to over a long period of time by the present commissioner sir ian blair
8757781 it is to do with the continuation of that treatment into the very important job i was doing as co ordinator of the security and safety of the 2012 olympics finally it is to do with the victimisation i have suffered since my grievances leaked to the media
8757782 a windfall tax on the huge profits of energy companies
8757783 what we shouldnt do is create a climate that makes it harder to attract new investment
8757784 every possible line of inquiry to trace the family is being followed up including an all ports warning and speaking to family and friends
8757785 until we can enter the property we do not know whether the family was inside at the time of the fire which we believe was started deliberately
8757786 it is a large property and there is a lot of debris inside which will have to be painstakingly sifted through and examined
8757787 there has been a lot of speculation in some sections of the media which has caused serious distress to the fosters family and friends such speculation is not helpful to our investigation and until we gain access to the house and complete our search and examination we are not in a position to make any further comment on such issues
8757788 this is being treated as arson and until we can determine whether the family was inside it will remain arson
8757789 we are very concerned for the safety of kirstie and her family who are in our thoughts and prayers kirstie is a charming popular and hard working girl with many friends all of whom are hoping she and her family will be found safe
8757790 it is the greatest arts festival on the planet and plays an important role in developing and showcasing new performing talent on a world stage
8757791 i have been considering this for some time but felt it was important not to announce my departure before the festival so as not to impact on this years festival following discussion with the board i have now decided to step down with immediate effect
8757792 the board is very grateful to jon for his significant contribution to the fringe at a challenging time of great change in the short time he has been in post he has dealt with an unprecedented range of challenges the board appreciate his future career aspirations and we would like to thank him for all his hard work and to wish him well in the future
8757793 the mentality of letting go across the channel seems to be the same one that makes les anglais get drunk as soon as they leave their country
8757794 with barack obama bill and hillary clinton and even joe biden the democrats are streets ahead of the republicans in oratorical skill george bush dick cheney and john mccain are pathetic by comparison but it seems to be doubtful how much this matters
8757795 the toxic combination of bad policies economics and politics is responsible for the fact that a majority of people do not enjoy the good health that is biologically possible social injustice is killing people on a grand scale
8757796 the key message of our report is that the circumstances in which people are born grow live work and age are the fundamental drivers of health and health inequity we rely too much on medical interventions as a way of increasing life expectancy
8757797 a more effective way of increasing life expectancy and improving health would be for every government policy and programme to be assessed for its impact on health and health equity to make health and health equity a marker for government performance
8757798 the uk is at the forefront of tackling health inequalities but reducing the gap in life expectancy is still an issue
8757799 in the uk weve come an awful long way in the last 10 years to tackle health inequality
8757800 theres this mob of white folks and theyre calling for blood
8757801 i thought shit its time to get out of here i tried to drive out of the area but i hit a red light on ladbroke grove i drove straight through
8757802 they were shouting abusive remarks at us such as why are you helping the black bastards you are a lot of nigger lovers a group of white youths shouted come on you fucking coppers if you want to fight a shower of bottles were thrown and smashed in the road in front of me
8757803 in one street where some of the ugliest fighting has taken place
8757804 your correspondent found a group of men in a public house singing ol man river and bye bye blackbird and punctuating the songs with vicious anti negro slogans the men said that their motto was keep britain white
8757805 just after a violent incident in which a coloured man was chased down a street by white youths
8757806 they shattered the whole concept of britain as the mother country
8757807 in a neighbourhood studded thickly with elegant villas and mansions
8757808 notting dale is a plague spot scarcely equalled for its insalubrity by any other in london
8757809 my dad was from shepherds bush my mum from notting hill
8757810 youd rob your own gas meter or cut off pieces of lino to shove in the meter until there was nothing left covering the floor
8757811 she helped bandage him her brother went mad and wouldnt talk to her for six months
8757812 right opposite my house were two knocking shops brothels and people didnt like it
8757813 one day three boys from nearby white city thought theyd do something and threw milk bottles at the windows
8757814 that the jews are the cause of the influx of coloured immigrants
8757815 there wasnt much difference between him and hitler he fucking hated everyone he hated foreigners wanted britain for the british
8757816 the riots started off with a false rumour that a black man had raped a white girl it was just fighting which grew bigger and everyone joined in we were bored
8757817 to think that britains history is one of only white working class racism towards black people is a nonsense race has been one of the key things in the whole of the history that makes britain great racism was at the heart of empire it was institutionalised by the ruling class
8757818 i sometimes feel like some masai village elder sitting outside my hut watching the new arrivals wondering if they know anything about what made this area what it is
8757819 now theyre our strongest allies ive got a black son in law and hes everything a husband and father should be
8757820 i went to a funeral the other day and they said youre always here i said its because im a notting hill lady and i show my respects there arent many of us left
8757821 our betting shops are gone theyve closed most of our caf s and pubs someone got very rich on notting hill
8757822 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8757823 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8757824 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8757825 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8757826 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8757827 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8757828 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8757829 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8757830 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8757831 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8757832 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8757833 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8757834 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8757835 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8757836 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8757837 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8757838 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8757839 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8757840 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8757841 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8757842 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8757843 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8757844 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8757845 is likely to be limited while overall confidence in economic and housing conditions is low
8757846 we are going to see much more dramatic drops in output
8757847 the fears that i have expressed over the last six months have started to come to fruition ive obviously voted on quite a number of occasions now for small quarter point cuts but we need to act and we probably need to act in larger amounts than that we need to actually get ahead of the game and it appears that we are now behind
8757848 with the economy set to contract over the next year the outlook for the housing market remains bleak
8757849 what began as a fall in prices is fast becoming a housing crash the governments public dithering over whether to offer a stamp duty holiday is making a bad problem worse
8757850 compared with other forecasters nationwide is usually conservative in its predictions of house price falls so when it tells us there is a big fall we know something very serious is happening all the signs are that we are at the beginning and not the end of a very painful process rather than dithering over crackpot schemes to prop up the housing market the government must act to help the many thousands in danger of losing their homes
8757851 we did not want this film to be like a corporate movie there are many things in the film where valentino and i would perhaps not want to see ourselves nevertheless it went in
8757852 when you work and create im not very approachable and getting wires round my body really did irritate me a bit but i accepted it
8757853 it was amazing to hang out with them for two years they put up with a lot and they were wired for sound the whole time they were extremely brave the bravest people i know
8757854 a unique love story with the world of fashion as a backdrop
8757855 it is right and proper for each nhs to use its own policies and standard operational procedures to meet the differing needs of their national populations
8757856 it shows that the systems are different but not necessarily better or worse
8757857 we have four diverging systems but they are still trying to deliver the same thing
8757858 contraflow was implemented prior to hurricane katrina in 2005 and everything worked as planned local traffic traveling in and around pearl river and pike counties need to be aware of the contraflow activities and plan to use alternate routes if necessary
8757859 i dont think hell be able to get back on the field for at least six or seven weeks
8757860 i dont think hell be able to get back on the field for at least six or seven weeks
8757861 no man has been a truer friend than he to the cherokee people
8757862 our hope is that this research will improve the screening process for migraine in soldiers and increase education about migraine for soldiers and their health care providers u s military personnel should receive the best health care available and improving the diagnosis and treatment of migraine will likely improve soldiers personal and professional functioning
8757863 mile high live blogging an organized army assembles in denver
8757864 hey heres my take on this post check it out here
8757865 its like being a ceo of a corporation that has over 250 employees and has a 26 million budget each year
8757866 the salary that is being requested puts me right in line with other second class cities some that are a little higher some that are a little smaller in population
8757867 the mayor knew what the pay was before he ran for mayor he can get a part time job like everyone else
8757868 i really dont like the idea because i work at a pizza place and make 7 an hour and i can barely survive on that
8757869 im not asking for any more or any less than other cities the same size
8757870 he and his news crew were standing on public sidewalks covering an event of public significance and performing a press function protected by the first amendment
8757871 arresting a reporter for simply doing his job is both unconstitutional and un american
8757872 that free speech is curtailed during the democratic national convention underscores the need for continued protection of civil liberties regardless of the party in power
8757873 the use of unnecessary force and the arrest of a journalist who was reporting an important political story
8757874 were committed to investigating any and all allegations of unncessary force or complaints
8757875 the time has come for a change of leadership and this revolution will be televised
8757876 their names will be new but their faces and voices will be familiar
8757877 think of it as a fusion of hardball survivor and max headroom
8757878 you will cast an electronic vote which may or may not be counted
8757879 but remember if voting really changed anything it would be illegal
8757880 you dont have to wait till november 5 to know who will be our new supreme leader
8757881 my son ricky was in my bedroom looking for his underwear and he went into the drawer under my bed and something crawled across his hand
8757882 it sees too much of a coincidence that she died at the same time that we saw the spider
8757883 to come out with a w from the big house would mean a lot to the team
8757884 we have aspirations of a bcs bowl so we need to get a win its a must win
8757885 it didnt do us any favors having appalachian state going in there and whacking them like they did
8757886 it underscores the vulnerability of the only area in the us where energy production is growing mr rubin said
8757887 i found this dusty lamp and i rubbed it and a genie came out he was so glad to be free he granted me three wishes
8757888 for my first wish i asked for a million pounds and hey presto there it was a million pounds
8757889 then i asked for a beautiful women and shazam the most beautiful woman youd ever seen appeared and she became my girlfriend
8757890 we believe we must also be willing to consider using military force in circumstances beyond self defense in order to provide for the common security that underpins global stability to support friends participate in stability and reconstruction operations or confront mass atrocities
8757891 but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8757892 i found this dusty lamp and i rubbed it and a genie came out he was so glad to be free he granted me three wishes
8757893 for my first wish i asked for a million pounds and hey presto there it was a million pounds
8757894 then i asked for a beautiful women and shazam the most beautiful woman youd ever seen appeared and she became my girlfriend
8757895 in him we were also chosen having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will in order that we who were the first to hope in christ might be for the praise of his glory and you also were included in christ when you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation having believed you were marked in him with a seal the promised holy spirit who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are gods possession to the praise of his glory
8757896 they will see his face and his name will be on their foreheads
8757897 keep reminding them of these things warn them before god against quarreling about words it is of no value and only ruins those who listen
8757898 the lord is my chosen portion and my cup you hold my lot the lines have fallen for me in pleasant places indeed i have a beautiful inheritance
8757899 now these are the last words of david the oracle of david the son of jesse the oracle of the man who was raised on high the anointed of the god of jacob the sweet psalmist of israel
8757900 to an inheritance that is imperishable undefiled and unfading kept in heaven for you
8757901 now to each one the manifestation of the spirit is given for the common good
8757902 for this reason christ is the mediator of a new covenant that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant in the case of a will it is necessary to prove the death of the one who made it because a will is in force only when somebody has died it never takes effect while the one who made it is living
8757903 if you belong to christ then you are abrahams seed and heirs according to the promise what i am saying is that as long as the heir is a child he is no different from a slave although he owns the whole estate he is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father so also when we were children we were in slavery under the basic principles of the world but when the time had fully come god sent his son born of a woman born under law to redeem those under law that we might receive the full rights of sons because you are sons god sent the spirit of his son into our hearts the spirit who calls out abba father so you are no longer a slave but a son and since you are a son god has made you also an heir
8757904 do not pray for easy lives pray to be stronger men do not pray for tasks equal to your powers pray for powers equal to your tasks then the doing of your work shall be no miracle but you shall be a miracle
8757905 the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord has anointed me to bring good news to the poor he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to those who are bound to proclaim the year of the lords favor and the day of vengeance of our god to comfort all who mourn to grant to those who mourn in zion to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes the oil of gladness instead of mourning the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit that they may be called oaks of righteousness the planting of the lord that he may be glorified
8757906 for i am already being poured out as a drink offering and the time of my departure has come i have fought the good fight i have finished the race i have kept the faith
8757907 instead they were longing for a better country a heavenly one therefore god is not ashamed to be called their god for he has prepared a city for them these were all commended for their faith yet none of them received what had been promised
8757908 this mystery is that through the gospel the gentiles are heirs together with israel members together of one body and sharers together in the promise in christ jesus
8757909 thats taking them off very easily theyre coming off in sections very easily were laying them down when the memorabilia people get a chance to take their seats theyre out of there
8757910 this is what will be imploded in on itself so it will be phased explosions around the ring because as a circle you want to bring it in at chunks at a time
8757911 we just want to be real respectful to those events we dont pick the day or time that it conflicts with somebody else we want it to be successful for the whole community
8757912 please turn the strobe lighting off or emma will have a seizure
8757913 down payment assistance is a not for profit organization way of providing down payment assistance for home buyers who didnt have the funds to come up with their own down payment
8757914 i think its going to change our market a little bit i think its going to reduce the number of first time home buyers entering the market
8757915 you actually can claim a 7500 credit against your taxes in 08 or 09
8757916 republicans are subject to a different standard re intelligence than democrats
8757917 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
8757918 what is your view of human nature is the role of government to create conditions to let peoples natural goodness come forth or is it to restrain the barbaric impulses that are intrinsic to our being
8757919 bush to russia back off georgia well see how much impact this has
8757920 i find the charges of russian imperialism a bit tired coming from people who have insisted for years that invading other countries toppling their governments and setting up puppet states is not imperialism
8757921 i dont know what to do about georgia in case youre curious its complicated
8757922 i do not know why the other reporters were not moved
8757923 i think that will just encourage those who want to completely destabilize and destroy iraq and create chaos and a victory for the terrorists to hang on and hope for an obama victory
8757924 if hes ginned up to fight the good fight in iraq i would suggest that he calls up another 20 000 australians and send them to iraq
8757925 the ghost is not a weapon its a way of life
8757926 what could they do with a moog that they couldnt already do with an intercontinental ballistic missle
8757927 the beat was made by a guy i found on myspace i really digged his shit but unfortunately he took waaay to long time to mix it this is my original mix
8757928 same thing as slow down but this one he never even mixed i even think he stopped answering my e mails the song is still pretty cool even though it never got 100 finished
8757929 you have to do all you can to minimize the chance of causing an accident
8757930 i really think theres a lot of legs left in this stuff and a lot of stories i still want to tell
8757931 every time you go out and do a story you find five or six more the list gets longer not shorter
8757932 the concept was that we live in this great spot but were all in such a hurry that we drive by things without looking and dont even notice whats around us
8757933 its a great show and were proud to have it continuing on kron
8757934 the stars of the show have always been the people who were featured
8757935 our job is to go out and find interesting passionate funny caring knowledgeable people and then get out of the way of their stories
8757936 one of the keys to success was that it was celebrating where we lived we pay a lot of money for our houses its not always easy to live here
8757937 but we also have amenities that no urban area in the world has the entire world is here so we have all these cultures all these cuisines all these ideas and then we have a protected landscape that no other urban area has
8757938 our idea is to say well give you all of our best stuff
8757939 han descubierto algo sorprendente y que nos ha llamado poderosamente la atenci n
8757940 but then weve always been slightly out on a limb
8757941 our first manager said he either saw mischief in my face or sadness
8757942 ive always had a sense of longing ive had moments of joy but theres a dissatisfaction on some deep level that ive lived with for most of my life
8757943 but the most surreal one was thom yorke when radiohead and rem played glastonbury i had thom in my spa pool with the rest of radiohead and rem sat around watching it was a strange day
8757944 people are starting to say we were ahead of our time
8757945 people expecting us to be walking around with poetry books under our arms and being intellectual are going to be disappointed
8757946 we were never trying to be clever different or weird thats just what we did
8757947 our players run our team meetings and that was referenced i think two days ago it wasnt really necessary as far as i was concerned because as you watch northern iowa on film any team that wins 12 games is certainly capable of knocking of a division i team i think we are prepared and are taking them very seriously as they are one of the best coached teams that we wiill play
8757948 we actually played it in a couple of team meetings just to let it serve as a reminder to us that it can happen even though we are the team that is supposed to win
8757949 many fans may view the game as a step down when really it is just the opposite
8757950 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8757951 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8757952 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8757953 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8757954 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8757955 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8757956 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8757957 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8757958 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8757959 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8757960 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8757961 steve jobs who helped make personal computers as easy to use as telephones changed the way animated films are made persuaded consumers to tune into digital music and refashioned the mobile phone has xxxx he was tk jobs xxxx tk said xxxxx
8757962 an incomplete story referencing apple inc was inadvertently published by bloomberg news at 4 27 p m new york time today
8757963 the item was never meant for publication and has been retracted
8757964 this was a routine update of a biography by the obits department meant for the internal system and not meant for publication it was momentarily posted on the external wire in error and immediately deleted
8757965 une pratique consistant jouer le r le de ses personnages h ros de mangas danimation japonaise de tokusatsu de films ou de jeux vid o voire de ses artistes de musique favoris notamment en imitant leur costume et leur maquillage
8757966 occurred because prison officials determined that possession of typewriters aid the ability of inmates to breach safety and security
8757967 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8757968 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8757969 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8757970 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8757971 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8757972 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8757973 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8757974 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8757975 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8757976 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8757977 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
8757978 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
8757979 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
8757980 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
8757981 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8757982 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8757983 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8757984 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8757985 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8757986 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8757987 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8757988 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8757989 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8757990 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8757991 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8757992 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8757993 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8757994 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8757995 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8757996 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8757997 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8757998 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8757999 the concern is capacity will be completely overwhelmed and we wont be able to deliver service to people who really need to have blood cultures
8758000 there is no test for those who are asymptomatic because its not clear that would give us any information that would be helpful nor is there any therapy that would be offered
8758001 that advisory as far as i can recall didnt mention what should we be doing if a healthy person comes in and asks to be tested
8758002 while we dont have clout we do have water and we deserve a bigger voice in the future of our most important natural resource
8758003 rather than address our problems as a one time purchase we need to come up with a steady
8758004 this bill will be the first comprehensive statute to begin preparing california to adapt to the climate change threat to california water resources
8758005 those threats include a reduced sierra nevada snowpack and prolonged droughts in the colorado river basin
8758006 while we dont have clout we do have water and we deserve a bigger voice in the future of our most important natural resource
8758007 rather than address our problems as a one time purchase we need to come up with a steady
8758008 on behalf of the great state of new york with appreciation for the spirit and dedication of all who are gathered here with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and in our country lets declare together in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8758009 senator clinton has moved in the spirit of unity to suspend the rules of the convention and to nominate barack obama by acclamation as the presidential candidate of the democratic party
8758010 all those in favor to suspend the rules and nominate by acclamation barack obama say aye
8758011 two thirds of the delegates voted in the affirmative and the motion is adopted
8758012 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8758013 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8758014 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8758015 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8758016 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8758017 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8758018 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8758019 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8758020 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8758021 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8758022 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8758023 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8758024 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8758025 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8758026 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8758027 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8758028 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8758029 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8758030 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8758031 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8758032 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8758033 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8758034 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8758035 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8758036 huge selection of frames with single vision lens sunsensor potochromic lens tinted sunglasses lens bifocal lens and progressive lens
8758037 all single vision lined bi focal and progressive bi focal lens are of a premium quality high index polycarbonate composite polymer high impact resistant lens with full uv protection and a special strong anti scratch coating
8758038 the anti reflective lens coating is great for night driving and computer use the a r minimizes annoying and dangerous reflections and glare in night driving it also helps to reduce glare from computer screens to prevent eye strain anti reflective coating greatly reduces the external reflections on the lens surface which would mask the eyes producing a much nicer cosmetic appearance
8758039 we take great pride in delivering a quality product at an incredibly low price each order is carefully checked by our certified technicians for prescription accuracy and optical clarity before shipment since all orders are custom produced and unique all sales are final please be very careful in filling out the order form
8758040 if you are dissatisfied with your eyeglasses for any reason they may be returned for a 50 refund within a period of four weeks we do not reimburse for shipping and handling of orders returned for a refund
8758041 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8758042 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8758043 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8758044 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8758045 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8758046 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8758047 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8758048 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8758049 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8758050 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8758051 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8758052 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8758053 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8758054 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8758055 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8758056 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8758057 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8758058 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8758059 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8758060 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8758061 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8758062 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8758063 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8758064 there was always that there was notion that nobody was better than anyone else
8758065 everybody in pennsylvania knows that he is like one of the family i am really moved by the fact that he took his time with everyone he was incredibly gracious
8758066 lets welcome the next president of the united states barack obama
8758067 seeing all these familiar faces brings back such warm memories for me some of you supported me during my losing congressional race in 2000 and most of you were there for my victory in 2004 it is so great to see all of you here
8758068 employing aquaculture and other sustainable fishing practices are key to the long term economic viability of the granite states ocean resources the university of new hampshire continues to be a leader in this important field and is setting the standard for the region in this technology i am pleased this grant has been provided for research which will bolster the long term success of aquaculture off new hampshires coasts
8758069 we are very pleased with senator greggs support of our open ocean aquaculture research here at unh
8758070 his support has allowed us to successfully compete for and secure funding from noaa for this project technology for offshore aquaculture has advanced significantly in recent years however we need to achieve greater efficiency for production of native species like cod haddock and halibut to be commercially viable growth of marine organisms on cage surfaces increases drag forces and reduces the flow of oxygen rich water to the fish
8758071 todays announcement by the department of defense of the arms sales is certainly welcome news
8758072 the possibility of a freeze by the administration had led me and several of my senate colleagues to write a letter to the president expressing concern over such a possible action
8758073 in addition to the anti ship missiles the taiwan government has approved funds to procure a significant package of weapons to further its military modernization efforts
8758074 the importance of the relationship between taiwan and the united states cannot be overstated taiwan is one of the strongest democratic partners of the united states in the asia pacific region and serves as a model of freedom and democracy the relationship between taiwan and the united states has benefited both our countries for over half a century and will continue to for centuries to come a strong taiwan helps bolster peace and stability in this strategically important region

8758084 washington d c august 28 2008 lifesitenews com two more bishops have released statements condemning house speaker nancy pelosis widely publicized claim that the catholic faith could support abortion
8758085 speaker pelosis outrageous attempt to present what she considers the teaching of the catholic church regarding abortion is simply wrong and should be disregarded by every faithful catholic
8758086 the teachings of the church on abortion are consistent and unambiguous and it is very disturbing to hear someone who claims to be a catholic distort these teachings and sow seeds of confusion among the faithful by attempting to relativize the right to life
8758087 house speaker nancy pelosi stepped out of her political role and completely misrepresented the teaching of the catholic church in regard to abortion
8758088 cardinal archbishop asks for forgiveness for those who support the
8758089 manifest our suffering in the face of the ratification of the criminal abortion law in our city
8758090 makes legal what can never be moral as is the murder of innocent and defenseless babies in the womb of their mother and for which the government offers its health facilities for these abominable crimes institutions that in other times sought to defend the principle of life
8758091 we contemplate with sadness the egotism and pettiness that defends death before life and for that reason we lift our requests through prayer and the ringing of the bells so that in a sign of suffering mourning and penance for the indiscriminate slaughter of infants we may ask the forgiveness of god for those who have promoted voted for and ratified this murderous law
8758092 its not opinion and its not religion taking a life is not your decision
8758093 since tests havent begun yet we dont know what the ailment is
8758094 he comes every six months for a routine checkup around a month ago a checkup was conducted and he was in perfect health
8758095 weapons of mass destruction have you found them in iraq yet or are you still looking for them
8758096 im not a psychologist and i dont know what brought on the free association that we heard from ambassador churkin
8758097 in breach of fundamental norms and principles of international law and sovereignty
8758098 russian is moving forward altering the post soviet 1991 borders with unpredictable results
8758099 there is no place in todays world for attempts to redraw boundaries of our international order unless confronted by the international community russian policies will eventually force another conflict elsewhere
8758100 a unilateral attempt to redraw the borders of a neighboring country through the use of force
8758101 it is good for them to help players learn english when i learned english i became a better player but to suspend them i dont think so
8758102 we have been puzzled if not surprised by some of the reactions
8758103 you have to interact effectively with your pro am partners you need to be able to do media interviews and you need to give a winners acceptance speech in english
8758104 they must speak at a level that effectively accomplishes those three things
8758105 what were seeing is that a handful of players dont speak to the level they need to be
8758106 were not just looking at the lpga as it is now
8758107 were looking at the future of the lpga as you well know we have a large international membership all indications are its not going to get smaller
8758108 if were getting any criticism its coming from outside the organization its not coming from the players and those are the people to whom it applies
8758109 surely if you can say hello thats english is that good enough
8758110 who draws the line about how many words youve got to know in english
8758111 its a big step to actually put it out there
8758112 i remember what roberto de vicenzo once said to me
8758113 if you shoot under 70 everybody will understand you if you dont they wont want to talk to you anyway
8758114 i taught him one word seven years ago and he still doesnt remember
8758115 when you start with a proposition that the president of the united states is hostile to amtrak it creates a steeper hill to climb
8758116 its not a big secret in this town that joe biden is one of the biggest most vocal champions of passenger rail
8758117 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country from afghanistan to iraq from amtrak to veterans
8758118 weve listened to feedback from our customers who asked that we provide a specific threshold for data usage and this would help them understand the amount of usage that would qualify as excessive
8758119 we know from experience the vast majority of customers we ask to curb usage do so voluntarily
8758120 if you cannot multitask or communicate without being passive aggressive dont even bother replying
8758121 i can be a tad difficult to work for im loud pushy and while i used to think we paid well i am no longer sure
8758122 i made a commitment to stay in the job for at least a year
8758123 i met the oldest child but not the others which my mother said was crazy to accept the job without meeting all the kids so well see
8758124 if you are fundamentally unhappy with your life you will be more unhappy if you take this job so do us all a favor and get some treatment or move to the rockies but do not apply for employment with us
8758125 also if you suspect all wealthy women are frivolous we are not for you
8758126 i have all sorts of theories on how to stack my dishwasher and if you are judgmental about ritalin for adhd or think such things are caused by too much sugar again deal break city
8758127 i hope she likes it here i sent the ad to one of my old sitters and she said she felt it was pretty accurate which sort of stung a little bit
8758128 im very much hoping i wont have to cut them off today
8758129 people who go to our shows get really amped but they had nowhere to get plugged in
8758130 when they hear our music we want people to start thinking dialoging and talking about what is going on in our country
8758131 nobody in this band could do this if it werent for a bigger reason
8758132 ever since that moment ive had it in my head i dont ever want to abdicate responsibility in terms of changing the world
8758133 i think this is the biggest demonstration of the week

8758141 im getting on a bit while ive seen people tasered im probably reluctant to do it myself
8758142 if were prepared to use this on members of the public when we have to its only right and proper that the head of the organisation tries it out for himself
8758143 i think its a bit hypocritical when the police have been saying for months that the taser is safe and only has short term effects that the police commissioner himself is scared of being tasered

8758154 how on earth can an institution let alone its most senior corporate decision making body function in those circumstances as fully functioning members of the mps youd have to say theyre both finished
8758155 its not a matter of sir ian setting out to create some kind of policing oligarchy in his office these are all professional and committed men who are very far from being head nodding toadies but when youre under attack like he sir ian has been there is an instinct to draw the wagons around you and listen to your most trusted that has created an atmosphere where some are afraid to get involved others are too involved and others feel frozen out
8758156 my opinion is that the met would be better off without sir ian blair hes lost a lot of his authority through the gaffes hes made if the stockwell shooting had been handled differently it would not have turned into the own goal it has turned out to be

8758231 to imput legislation to disband the new york state thruway authority and make it a state agency just like the department of transportation that will be subject to the people and subject to the people we elect in new york state
8758232 i dont want to disparage anyone but i think were going to see more of this i think our legislators are going to look into this and i think were going to get to the bottom of this so we can all recoup because this is hitting us very suddenly and very hard

8758255 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8758256 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8758257 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8758258 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8758259 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8758260 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8758261 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8758262 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8758263 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8758264 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8758265 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8758266 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8758267 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8758268 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8758269 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8758270 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8758271 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8758272 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8758273 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8758274 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8758275 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8758276 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8758277 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8758278 no im not upset that bolts success took all the headlines
8758279 we cannot compare bolt with myself sprinting and distance running it is not possible to compare
8758280 to break two world records three with the sprint relay in an olympic games is very special
8758281 there are no words to describe how i feel what can i say its so very special for me
8758282 people at home expect success they are waiting to celebrate after each games yes there were a million or more on the streets to welcome us and the prime minister and president were there to greet us
8758283 iaaf president lamine diack greatly supported us on this and convinced the federation to allow kenenisa to compete in z rich
8758284 it is a good place with good organisation a very famous place to race
8758285 im a little tired as it is very close to the olympic games i cant push for a world record anymore this season
8758286 so i dont talk of records for this race after my successes in beijing i just come here to win
8758287 the marathon its too early for me to think of this yet i still have time to run many more 5000 and 10 000m races with faster times and breaking records i want to keep running these distances at world championships and olympic games for many more years

8758292 the photovoltaic industry is technologically and scientifically intensive in this regard russia can take advantage of its general scientific potential while developing such innovative industry sector
8758293 we expect the solar power market to develop in russia in the next four years and anticipate an introduction of subsidies and reduced taxes for companies in the sector
8758294 demand is so high that we hardly have any storage space clients purchase our product immediately
8758295 its hard for new players to come into russias energy sector
8758296 that project was so complex that it will only pay for itself in 70 years which is extremely high for the energy industry
8758297 market conditions will make solar power competitive with traditional energy because prices for traditional energy are growing while improving photovoltaic technology is lowering prices for solar
8758298 the solar power sector is growing exponentially its one of the most dynamic industries worldwide
8758299 the polysilicon shortage is a resolvable issue so we plan to increase our capacity from 8 peak kilowatt per year to 150 peak kilowatt per year in 2012

8758303 es mucho lo que han avanzado nuestros pa ses como se ha hecho patente durante las recientes turbulencias de los mercados financieros internacionales en las condiciones de fragilidad e indisciplina de otras pocas la reciente incertidumbre de la econom a internacional nos hubiese cobrado ya una alt sima factura
8758304 ser a imprudente sin embargo ignorar que nuestras econom as contin an siendo vulnerables y que lejos de disiparse los riesgos podr n acrecentarse en el futuro inmediato
8758305 todav a no sabemos qu tan pronunciada ser la reciente desaceleraci n de la econom a mundial

8758312 la uni n europea se gasta casi la mitad de su presupuesto en subsidios agr colas cuando podr a gastar m s en ciencia y tecnolog a en educaci n o en un aparato de defensa que le permitiera ser un interlocutor m s influyente en los asuntos mundiales
8758313 y se est n creando un problema porque sus consumidores tienen productos m s caros y de menor calidad algunas veces tambi n problemas porque sus relaciones con el resto del mundo se tensionan y claramente se ven afectados y evidentemente nos est n creando problemas a nosotros

8758315 it is good for them to help players learn english when i learned english i became a better player but to suspend them i dont think so
8758316 we have been puzzled if not surprised by some of the reactions
8758317 you have to interact effectively with your pro am partners you need to be able to do media interviews and you need to give a winners acceptance speech in english
8758318 they must speak at a level that effectively accomplishes those three things
8758319 what were seeing is that a handful of players dont speak to the level they need to be
8758320 were not just looking at the lpga as it is now
8758321 were looking at the future of the lpga as you well know we have a large international membership all indications are its not going to get smaller
8758322 if were getting any criticism its coming from outside the organization its not coming from the players and those are the people to whom it applies
8758323 surely if you can say hello thats english is that good enough
8758324 who draws the line about how many words youve got to know in english
8758325 its a big step to actually put it out there
8758326 i remember what roberto de vicenzo once said to me

8758354 ha i bet you let her get to third base
8758355 actually she didnt even let me get to the first
8758356 one point is that bhp could benefit because its near term profits are likely to be stronger than rios which could work in bhps favour and create the impression that it is more successful
8758357 the markets going to move more into balance and that might take some of the present froth out of prices
8758358 i would also note that there are some other significant producers which are presently quite small but there is a lot of new investment going on so there are going to be in the next few years additional players
8758359 clearly at the moment and for the foreseeable future they wont be as big as bhp or rio but nonetheless over a period of time theyll be emerging as significant players
8758360 i think the people here think they have a golden goose
8758361 people are obviously chasing the money in the mining sector
8758362 they are very isolated areas and the cost of living is high
8758363 you can easily get up to 45 degrees celsius during the day in summertime so there are fairly extreme conditions
8758364 being stuck in the middle of nowhere is very alien and different to the scottish countryside that i was used to
8758365 it was very strange but it has its own beauty when you see a little bit of rain coming into areas like the pilbara its quite spectacular
8758366 the towers future is secure and it can now resume its role as sentinel on this stretch of coastline its familiar silhouette will continue to welcome the many thousands of people who visit kimmeridge bay each year
8758367 at the current rate of erosion we believe it should be safe for the next 200 years
8758368 were both teachers and we have three young children so moneys always tight
8758369 i dont buy as much organic food as i used to simple as that
8758370 i tend to look at the lower cost cheaper brands rather than the brands i went for before
8758371 and also where i used to buy free range and organic foods i tend to steer away from them now
8758372 we saw the chicken programme some weeks ago on the television and we saw how cruel it is with these battery chickens and we buy free range eggs as well but organic is just not worth it for us
8758373 id be very phobic about having anything other than organic products and so i feel its necessary and something im prepared to pay for
8758374 i tend to cut out other things food is very fundamental to me
8758375 and probably better than the raw cow muck that goes on
8758376 the general public and the media should not be allowed out on farms without serious education beforehand
8758377 based on the number of 6 000 gallon tankers that came to apply it we came up with the best guess that 9 75m gallons were spread on 160 acres they were doing it 12 hours a day and a truck would arrive every 10 minutes
8758378 increased respiratory distress or breathing difficulties diarrhoea chronic during sludge applications all ages chronic and acute headaches persistent after exposure to odours relieved by leaving residence staph infections children covered by staph sores after playing in creeks or streams after significant rains presumed neurotoxin sensitivity seizures nausea elevated blood pressure and rash
8758379 youd have to eat 212 pounds of our biosolids to get what your body needs
8758380 in my opinion the land spreading of sludge is a serious problem we have mixed together pathogens with a wide variety of chemicals that are known to enhance the infection process it makes people more susceptible to infections
8758381 a viscous semi solid mixture of bacteria and virus laden organic matter toxic metals synthetic organic chemicals and settled solids removed from domestic industrial wastewater at a sewage treatment plant

8758384 there has never been a recorded outbreak of human ill health in the uk as a result of the practice of recycling biosolids to land
8758385 there is no documented scientific evidence that the part 503 rules which govern biosolids use have failed to protect public health
8758386 however additional scientific work is needed to reduce persistent uncertainty about the potential for adverse human health effects from exposure to biosolids
8758387 because safe means something to some folks and something else to others that doesnt mean were trying to hide anything if safety means compliance with the letter of the law then our biosolids are safe there are a finite number of constituents we can test for outside those youre in the realm of unknowns were always trying to figure out the next step were willing to change as technology changes
8758388 i wont have sludge on my land the heavy metals just sit in the plough layer waiting until someone realises there are long term problems for animals crops and us i honestly believe that all those who use sludge will live to regret it

8758403 this letter really emphasised it and we said thats it
8758404 it doesnt sound like much but it all adds up
8758405 thats the little ways people are saving pennies at the moment
8758406 once the ground has been declared non organic you shouldnt go back to it
8758407 with net debt now in excess of 1 8bn nervousness over gearing is unlikely to go away any time soon
8758408 our expectations for the year as a whole remain unchanged with progress weighted towards the second half as the benefit of all these fundamental actions begin to flow through
8758409 were certainly seeing a dip the question is is it a dip thats bouncing back again or it could be the start of a real drop
8758410 i was talking to somebody in the nfu and they were saying its happening in beef and everywhere because at the end of the day its a nice to have not a need to have
8758411 i predict demand will plateau a bit but not decline
8758412 these values are important to people still the concern about the way we farm the way the countryside is under threat at times about animal welfare
8758413 im not going to spend a lot of time on peters because its not the kind of issue that affects kiwis lives its messy but its not like secretly planning to sell public assets
8758414 will all this finally create a political consensus that we need to rid politics of the messy business of large private donations and replace them with partial public funding which is fair transparent and impartial

8758418 the united states has a system of taxation by confession
8758419 the gamblers guide to taxes how to keep more of what you win
8758420 nato has not traditionally played a role in energy security matters it can however play a more active role defending energy infrastructure and the flow of oil and gas on the high seas nato might also provide security for infrastructure in energy producing states facing unrest
8758421 the system is mechanical the channel senses the pressure inside the bacteria as a result the channel alters its shape and creates an opening releasing the pressure the motion is just like that of a camera iris and being able to see this motion is an amazing discovery
8758422 new chemicals designed to force channels to stay open or shut are likely to kill or at the very least greatly slow down the growth of bacteria
8758423 slowing down the growth gives the bodys natural defences time to tackle its bacterial invader
8758424 we have been able to show how this channel opens and closes
8758425 these channels are found in mrsa and c difficile and this knowledge has not yet been exploited
8758426 thousands have rediscovered what the uk has to offer this year
8758427 many people preferred to remain here to get better value and avoid rising exchange rates
8758428 in the case of donna challice the court decided that we had to have evidence from either eye witnesses or cctv to ensure that the person taken to court was in fact the person responsible
8758429 now if we find a contaminated bin under the terms of section 46 of the environmental protection act we serve a notice on every adult person in the household concerned
8758430 this instructs them what they should put in their bins if we do bill them and they dont pay they will not be prosecuted under section 46 but can be prosecuted for non payment of a bill which is much easier to prove and will be easier to enforce in the courts
8758431 it says it all that under this government hard working households who put their bins out on the wrong day get clobbered with larger fines than shoplifters
8758432 if labour is not imposing bin fines its forcing bin cuts and introducing bin taxes
8758433 people genuinely want to improve recycling and go green but labours bin policies will harm the environment by causing a surge in fly tipping and fuelling public resentment at town hall bin bullies
8758434 council tax has doubled under labour and all the public have got in return are cutbacks to local services
8758435 putting in place financial penalties for putting rubbish in the wrong bin is unnecessary and will catch lots of innocent people who make an honest mistake
8758436 councils should remember that they work for their constituents not the other way around and stop treating ordinary residents like criminals
8758437 this is absolute nonsense how are they going to police it what if someones bins are sabotaged
8758438 there are quite a lot of people who repeatedly contaminate their green recycling bin
8758439 we send them letters and try to educate them but if people will not voluntarily change their behaviour then we need to try other things
8758440 incorporated in jersey and tax resident in the republic of ireland
8758441 notwithstanding recent suggestions concerning possible changes to uk tax laws the directors believe that the most appropriate structure is for the new parent company of henderson to be tax resident in the republic of ireland
8758442 i was always noticeable and i always knew i was different
8758443 i did get some bullying at school because i was different because i was brown but a lot of other kids were bullied as well if you were a bit too tall a bit too small
8758444 one of the key political moments was thatchers right to buy council house policy i remember the excitement that went round that neighbourhood seeing people contemplating ownership after a lifetime of renting
8758445 my children werent babies any longer and the practice had become established
8758446 i almost felt at last im ready for public service
8758447 it was almost looking in the biscuit barrel not liking the look of the biscuits and slamming the lid shut
8758448 i heard one of his speeches when he said he recognised there was a whole generation of people who worked hard who wanted nice things themselves but who also believed in social justice i thought thats me yes we are business people we do want to make money we do want to do well but we really care about looking after each other
8758449 i dont think im fearful of anything apart from possibly rats
8758450 im a careful person and there will be no complacency in my campaign im treating maidstone and the weald as if its a marginal and i will work as hard as i possibly can
8758451 im not bored or frustrated with it because i havent done it people have asked me to but i havent because in this first period i really wanted to focus on the constituency if im asked to comment in the future i will but i wont be the person always putting my hand up there are a lot of people who are diverse and of colour in the conservative party who may well have a different view from me
8758452 i do not believe for one minute that boris is racist
8758453 i believed hed do it and obviously my selection as the ppc for maidstone and the weald is evidence in many respects that that has happened
8758454 if were removing party politics completely just the man and what he has to offer and what hes doing at the moment for america i think he would make a very very good president
8758455 at the moment ive just got to be a hard working prospective parliamentary candidate getting elected and looking after the people of maidstone and the weald thats the job and thats what im determined to do
8758456 ive seen a few of the costumes and theyre really beautiful but theres not much of them
8758457 the other day my fiance surprised me with a foot spa its one of the best gifts ive ever received
8758458 we have been petrified and absolutely out of our wits worrying about our own family but as for the corbys our hearts really go out to them tim was a friend of micks for over 30 years he was a renowned figure in the racing scene who was universally popular and will be sorely missed
8758459 mick is conscious and able to talk from his hospital bed and hes absolutely devastated at the loss of tim his heart goes out to sheila and adriana
8758460 its brilliant news the cost of living in this country is going up and up so this will be a real help
8758461 everyone has been shocked by how much their bills have increased
8758462 there is so much to pay out for these days and gas has become one of the major bills
8758463 more and more you need think about whether you really need the fire or the heating on because you know a letter is going to drop through the door saying your direct debit needs to go up
8758464 the rise meant a 50million increase in our operating costs in the last year alone and that coupled with the general economic downturn has led to difficulties which are being felt throughout the industry
8758465 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience and disappointment this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
8758466 weve done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a re financing package that would have kept our aircraft flying
8758467 my husband is trying to phone the credit card company now to see where we stand
8758468 i came tonight to see whats going on and found out there is nothing going out
8758469 ill try to get something else but it doesnt look good
8758470 the problem is that theres no way out of this without spending thousands of pounds
8758471 there should be protection for passengers a way for them to get home weve four kids waiting for us
8758472 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position but rather aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter
8758473 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
8758474 the scale of this criminal enterprise is unprecedented in this country
8758475 the roll call of deaths and injuries is horrific some 30 to 40 of these weapons are still unaccounted for and regrettably but doubtlessly the roll call of death and serious injury will continue to rise

8758477 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8758478 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8758479 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8758480 i turn it over to god and think theres nothing i can do about it and i also think what are the odds ive been flying for 18 years and had one emergency landing thats pretty good
8758481 we never lost cabin pressure so we didnt have to use our oxygen masks by the time we got on the ground the crack on the front of the planes window was huge and getting bigger by the second
8758482 it was like in the movies when they land and you see all the fire trucks and emergency crews thats a real experience
8758483 i didnt have any anxiety like the last thing i want to do is get back on an airplane i did feel like the pilots and the flight attendants handled it perfectly
8758484 they were so very calm it wasnt a scary situation until afterward when you think about what possibly could have happened

8758488 thank you for your interest in azo your sample request has been received please allow 4 to 6 weeks for your sample to arrive
8758489 i would like to arrange a meeting with a small representative landlord group to discuss payment of rent rental evidence service charge and insurance which will form the basis of our discussions with you
8758490 the archaic leasing and rent review structure that currently exists in the uk
8758491 you will be aware that this current climate is affecting everyone in different ways dealing with this issue now will help everyone in the long term as opposed to trying to deal with this matter as and when a problem arises
8758492 it is important to point out that your covenant will not be affected
8758493 it will have no effect on their shareholdings for the foreseeable future
8758494 our revenue outlook for the second half of 2008 is less certain we anticipate a lower rate of market growth than in the first half and are therefore taking some early steps to tighten our cost base in a number of markets
8758495 i have a sense the crisis has declined because the government has got more of a grip
8758496 the score rose three points between the first and second weekend
8758497 winning gold medals in the olympics seems to have had a lifting effect
8758498 i have recently read that certain councils have sent round health and safety officers to fish and chips shops to make them convert the salt shakers to ones having less than five holes so that their customers eat less salt this is lunacy
8758499 our mps are currently considering scrapping ancient rules made in elizabethan times which prevents idiots and lunatics from becoming members of parliament i suppose they consider this may be the one case where retrospective legislation is necessary to help to keep them in their jobs

8758502 as editor for linuxinsider for more than a year now i figured the time was right to start walking the walk with my personal machine
8758503 can i use itunes nope but there are a couple of apps such as amarok and gtkpod that allow you to sync the device you wont be able to use the itunes store but do you really want to pay apple to tell you you
8758504 how can i get my wireless networking card to work my old dell has a
8758505 is there an automatic backup feature or an app available not really but ubuntu forums has a pretty detailed set of instructions on how to accomplish a full backup through the command line
8758506 is there a driver for my printer yeah but that doesnt mean it works out of the box like it would with windows im able to print documents no problem photos well thats another story apparently im not the only person with the same issue sure theres a workaround there always is but it means ive got to transfer the photo to an sd card which i then put directly into the printer
8758507 so making it work takes some tinkering thats one of the charms of
8758508 but its a time consuming process that probably shouldnt be

8758516 how can i get my wireless networking card to work my old dell has a
8758517 ive obviously voted on quite a number of occasions now for small cuts but we need to act and we probably need to act in larger amounts than that more on economics
8758518 we need to actually get ahead of the game and it appears that we are now behind
8758519 people are starting to price in deeper and earlier cuts
8758520 when the markets look at which central bank is going to be the next one to reduce interest rates theyre probably looking to the bank of england before the federal reserve in the us before the european central bank and certainly before the bank of japan
8758521 so maybe thats why sterling is in the firing line because the interest rate advantage that has been there in sterling might not be there much longer
8758522 we have always believed it is a very valuable business and were always disappointed the market didnt concur
8758523 we felt the best course of action for shareholders was to sell it off
8758524 weve been proved more knowledgeable about our business than analysts in the city
8758525 the sale will allow us to concentrate on the thermal processing business which makes up 75pc of the groups activities
8758526 we plan to increase our activities in emerging markets especially areas where the manufacturing economy is growing
8758527 the need for energy will have to outweigh any environmental concerns if the lights are to stay on and in terms of carbon footprint burning locally produced coal has 14pc less impact than coal imported from russia
8758528 our hope is that this research will improve the screening process for migraine in soldiers and increase education about migraine for soldiers and their health care providers u s military personnel should receive the best health care available and improving the diagnosis and treatment of migraine will likely improve soldiers personal and professional functioning
8758529 when i got there another parent and another child were in the nurses station as well both children were scratching their arms and legs my daughter was really sick she was breathing hard she was dizzy nauseated
8758530 the parents are not connecting some of the symptoms that their children have experienced that may be connected to the chemical spill it took me a long time to figure out that what was happening to her might be related
8758531 the squeeze on consumers disposable income has had some impact on arrears
8758532 spend more time with his family and pursue other interests
8758533 scientists have identified a mutant form of a gene or allele that prohibits the growth of armour
8758534 by documenting the physical traits and genetic makeup of the offspring produced by these marine sticklebacks in freshwater we were able to track how natural selection operates on this gene
8758535 we found a significant increase in the frequency of this allele in their offspring evidence that natural selection favours reduced armour in freshwater
8758536 it leads us to believe that the genetic expression is also tied to increased growth rate
8758537 if the fish arent expending resources growing bones which may be significantly more difficult in freshwater due to its lack of ions they can devote more energy to increasing biomass
8758538 this in turn allows them to breed earlier and improves over winter survival rate
8758539 anoles are highly visual species so in that sense it is not surprising that they would use visual displays to mark territory
8758540 the dawn chorus may be a way of communicating having survived the night
8758541 if in the morning a bird doesnt hear its neighbor or an anole doesnt see its neighbor it may be an opportunity for the animal to expand its territory
8758542 prices were pretty much along the lines that we anticipated and our expectation is that well continue to see a very significant growth there
8758543 in the last few months there are indications of weakening growth in some markets but we continue to outperform and expect 2008 to be in line with expectations
8758544 we have been selling assets entering into joint ventures and talking with our banks the group is in a much better position to deal with issues at the fund level but we still need to address the loan to value issues in retail property fund the junction
8758545 what many would have thought impossible in the ongoing turnaround of the group
8758546 the 30pc fall in net asset value during the first half can clearly be attributed to problems in the banking and property investment markets exacerbated by high leverage rather than in the tenant facing business which has been resilient
8758547 taking into account that our co operation could bring some synergy to both companies i think we have good ground to build constructive dialogue with them during discussion we can achieve some agreements and compromises
8758548 we are continuously monitoring opportunities in the region but currently we are not in a position to announce anything
8758549 demand for copper from our customers has remained consistently robust
8758550 work on the first village communities in the hub will begin in the next 18 months
8758551 i would like to take this opportunity to thank those of you that i know have worked hard to gather feedback from colleagues and it is important you know that it was these views that have helped shape the counter proposal and the subsequent company response
8758552 the leak of internal company documents to the media did not aid a process which was open and already involved colleagues across the company in fact a considerable number of people have taken time over the last few days to contact me to show support for national big and the m amp s consultation process as a whole whether they were in favour of the proposals or not
8758553 despite this attempt to distract from the formal process the dialogue between national big and the company continued over a number of weeks resulting in a revised offer of a 62 week cap which national big has accepted
8758554 even with the reduction in fuel prices over the last few weeks competitive pressure on fares and volumes will continue and we are at best expected to break even in the second half delivering a loss for the full year
8758555 now clear that we will require further fundamental changes in our operating cost base in order to minimise losses in 2009 and to help ensure the long term viability of the business
8758556 there are a number of messages in the aer lingus statement that are aimed at constituents over and beyond the investor base
8758557 i know there is a lot of doom and gloom out there but i think we are penetrating more markets also people are not drinking more but are drinking better they are still trading up to premium brands more on leisure
8758558 i think it is because we are offering affordable indulgence and maybe in a world where you cant go out as often as you would like you will stay at home but still drink the best you may not buy a new car or a new suit but if i like johnnie walker black label i am still going to buy it
8758559 scotch whisky now generates 100 a second for this economy
8758560 i think there are not many companies in this environment giving 7pc to 9pc forecasts at the operating level and saying earnings per share will remain at double digit growth
8758561 for those who want more precision i would say in the current environment what makes people think my crystal ball can be any more precise than that you have a whole cocktail of economic forces to take into account
8758562 the numbers and commentary do suggest resilience in the spirits business and the benefits of spread
8758563 i believe in his ideals and his proposals to lead this nation
8758564 put this in the mtv news headline fat joe says daddy yankee is a sellout
8758565 just like that i gotta go in im talking to little cousins that like yankee and all that and theyre starting to believe that john mccain is the best candidate i cant have that
8758566 i opened the newspaper and got sick to my stomach
8758567 i felt like i wanted to vomit when i seen that the reason why i called him a sellout is because i feel he did that for a publicity look rather than the issues that are affecting his people that look up to him how could you want john mccain in office when george bush and the republicans already have half a million people losing their homes in foreclosure were fighting an unjust war its the latinos and black kids up in the frontlines fighting that war we over here trying to take the troops out of iraq and bring peace this guy immediately wants war if not with iraq or afghanistan hell start a new one with iran i feel real disgusted that daddy yankee would do that either he did that for a look or hes just not educated on politics
8758568 if he believes john mccain is the better candidate for the latinos
8758569 we could sit down even if he wants to get into a debate we can debate anywhere new york puerto rico
8758570 like i said with me my whole philosophy on blacks and latinos is were all one
8758571 were in the same ghettos same inner cities and were suffering from the same problems every problem the blacks have the latinos have theres two systems of health care the one for the rich thats really good then theres the one for the inner city where they leave ladies in the emergency room unattended for 24 hours until they drop dead people dont even check on her hours after shes dead this is normal stuff this is whats happening in the u s
8758572 my own sister to me she was murdered by doctors
8758573 she was having a baby in the bronx and they gave her an epidural a normal procedure that was supposed to numb her from the waist down they numbed her from the waist up because they had amateurs learning in the bronx hospitals not even real doctors students murdered my sister in the inner city in the bronx i love what barack is doing with the heath care system once he gets universal health care for everybody then we gotta step up our system to make it the best in the world
8758574 im a huge fan of the clintons i love hillary i love bill they hit home runs out the park i was so excited when bill was speaking it reminded me of why i love him hes articulate so smart greatest president of our era when he was here we had peace yasser arafat of palestine and the prime minister of israel shaking hands and hugging bringing peace in the middle east not war everybody had jobs the economy was growing george bush and the republicans turned the whole country around to where our dollar is worth half the euro dollar your man john mccain wants to continue the same tactics of the bush organization why should my man daddy yankee be endorsing mccain this is the only urban guy in the universe to endorse john mccain you got people who look up to yankee young teenagers that look up to him and might make the wrong choice john mccain is the wrong thing to do i dont think the republicans care much about minorities i cant believe yankee went and endorsed this guy
8758575 i travel the world doing shows and people hate the united states because of the policies of george bush
8758576 years ago you would go overseas and the people would praise you and love the united states i feel barack obama is the one person who could bring not just the united states but the world together i was in africa two days ago and i seen people with i love obama on their bumper sticker he just spoke to 200 000 people in germany
8758577 we have to vote and change this country around everybody has to get out there and register im not asking im telling you to go vote im forcing you
8758578 the minor iphone security issue which surfaced this week is fixed in a software update which will be released in september
8758579 weve re dedicated ourselves to work in this area performance in windows 7 and ie 8
8758580 this is a major initiative across each of our feature teams as well as the primary mission of one of our feature teams
8758581 im somewhat skeptical how much improvement theyre going to make at this point
8758582 anyone checking any code into windows 7 not only has to make sure its the most secure code and the most reliable code but theyd better be addressing the performance of the code as well
8758583 keep the cpu utilization low as that improves multi user scenarios as well as reduces power consumption
8758584 the walls started moving then the bang everything started coming down everyone started screaming
8758585 they either had a meal here or live here and were walking to the trolley
8758586 theres not much to say other than we have to find out what happened
8758587 all we know is the walkway collapsed on people who were using it
8758588 weve listened to feedback from our customers who asked that we provide a specific threshold for data usage and this would help them understand the amount of usage that would qualify as excessive
8758589 we know from experience the vast majority of customers we ask to curb usage do so voluntarily
8758590 a single point for deploying uploads to the top video sharing sites
8758591 a leading source of radical homosexual propaganda anti christian bigotry and radical transgender advocacy
8758592 i have been mocked over and over again by ungodly and unprincipled anti christian lesbians
8758593 six years in sodom from the journal of james hartline
8758594 around these katrina scarred parts aug 29 is still and will be for some time a black armband kind of day
8758595 for lionsgate studios however aug 29 isnt quite as sacred for them the third anniversary of the day the levees were breached and new orleans slipped under is something on the order of perfect timing a ripped from the headlines release date
8758596 the film does not depict or parody any actual natural disaster and the release date of disaster movie is in no way a reference to or joke about the anniversary of hurricane katrina
8758597 thats a hard line to swallow tasteless humor and b movie comedies have their place but this confluence of dates isnt just a cheap laugh its a cheap shot to an entire region still digging out from an all too real disaster
8758598 no les puedo decir porque yo mismo no lo he decidido
8758599 es un gran estadounidense y un gran y querido amigo en el cual conf o desde hace muchos a os

8758604 con esta direcci n el centro de gustav pasar sobre jamaica o muy cerca durante la tarde o esta noche y sobre las islas caim n la noche del viernes
8758605 esas precipitaciones pueden generar inundaciones repentinas y deslaves que pongan en riesgo la vida humana
8758606 el peligro se mantiene latente aunque a un plazo un poco largo todav a para el occidente del pa s
8758607 its been a bit of a struggle for us there
8758608 it doesnt fit in geographically as well with the other newspapers that we have in the north or over on the johnson county side so were kind of looking at several options for what we could do
8758609 if you dont want to get contacted if somebody wins then dont put your name in it that was just such a girl thing to do wimp
8758610 i just couldnt believe that that would be tolerated in the work place the message was pretty offensive to me
8758611 someone that i spoke with said that it might have been her 400th hang up and she was just frustrated herself but thats not my fault
8758612 i plan on taking it to the fullest extent that i can possibly take it to so that these kinds of things dont happen to other people
8758613 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
8758614 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
8758615 bandas de delincuentes subversivos terroristas que manten an fuerte presencia en el monte y en ciudades
8758616 the companys management and directors are of the belief that the interests of its stakeholders are best served through the assessment of opportunities and options available
8758617 we are executing well in this tough environment and are on track to achieve our targets for the year
8758618 there will be high prices and a company that is violating all competition rules
8758619 id like to know how much it will cost to fly rome milan once the only flights there will be those of the new company
8758620 air france klm confirms its intention and desire to remain a strategic partner of alitalia
8758621 the management of the new alitalia will remain in the hands of italian businessmen
8758622 once again alitalias debt and the bad company will fall on the citizens while a new company will be created that is useful to berlusconi and his buddies
8758623 what solution meaning what job is found for people who are not hired by the new company
8758624 many people thought the sky was falling this spring but the economy actually expanded quite solidly
8758625 at this point the future is so cloudy in terms of the development of the market when its going to pick up again
8758626 then i see a very good opportunity that basically i would hope that everything could be break even to profitable
8758627 we would hope to have the corporation profitable again by then
8758628 we are selling every hhr and cobalt we can make with either minimal or zero incentives whereas three years ago even the hhr you had to put 3 000 bucks on it to move it so i think in practice the price of small cars has gone up three or four thousand dollars
8758629 the folks who were first to buy those are the early adopters those are the tech savvy ones and what it says is that big data buckets actually let you do a lot of stuff
8758630 i think theres a lot of education on all parts about what you get for what data allotment or data bucket as the industry terms it
8758631 they havent yet tapped into the multimedia rich capabilities of the device and for the most part theyre likely still using it for light web browsing light email and for the most part voice use
8758632 they havent really gotten into the guts of what this thing can do
8758633 you will always have the vast majority of end users who dont seem to use it a lot because they really are using the device for mundane everyday purposes lets face it for all of the capabilities of todays smartphones the vast majority of us are still using it for voice calls
8758634 voice remains the killer application for every phone including the super sophisticated iphone
8758635 the two per cent increase in total u s store sales was also more than entirely due to higher spending by customers from other countries
8758636 sales to new yorkers were below last year which should not be too surprising to anyone
8758637 even though the u s was weaker than expected i think a lot of investors thought that could happen
8758638 we have grown our canadian store base where we are achieving much higher returns on capital and the economy is much healthier than we currently find in the u s
8758639 everything is shut off with valves at the seafloor so if theres any damage to the facility itself the oil or natural gas whatevers being produced stays underground and doesnt get out into the environment
8758640 probably the main lesson we learned from katrina and rita is to take care of employees make sure they have a place to stay food generators and a place for their families
8758641 its likely that well see a 10 cents per gallon increase in gasoline in texas and louisiana prior to the storms arrival
8758642 it was tough for me coming in here and redshirting watching other guys 7 days ago
8758643 when we partnered with petroglyph our pledge to them was that we would make their game a global sensation and that we would work with only the highest quality partners like goa to help support it
8758644 traditionally worldwide partners license a game after its been completed but we are working across the globe to locate partners who can contribute to design direction and adapt the game for cultural tastes in each territory for a true worldwide launch
8758645 goas products are only the highest quality highly anticipated products in the online gaming category and that is why petroglyph and true games project is such a perfect fit we are confident that our audience will be very enthusiastic about this game and that it will be a major title
8758646 whenever we approach a potential partner for this exciting new game their eyes immediately light up
8758647 with petroglyphs pedigree and their loyal following of fans we are sure this product will be a worldwide success it is just a matter of choosing the right partners and we couldnt be more certain of our partnership with goa
8758648 the bottom line is that were trying to capture as many tourist dollars as we can
8758649 were trying to reach out to a segment in the market that has been underserved in the past
8758650 its because theyre largely dual income with no kids and also because they like to travel more than the average person
8758651 they also are willing to pay the higher hotel rates which chapel hill has
8758652 when i travel i often look to see if theres a gay bar or if theres a glbt community center
8758653 it would be difficult to target the glbt community as a tourist market without having a stronger more visible gay community
8758654 especially in carrboro if you kiss nobodys going to look twice
8758655 ive been around when all the different gay nights popped up here and there then failed
8758656 we have all the pieces we just need to put it together
8758657 when i recently went to china for an indian festival a senior citizen asked me if there were any indian film stars or songs from the bombay film industry in the festival when i said no he remarked that he had grown up listening to the songs of awara i was very surprised to see the extent of penetration of the indian film industry at first it was asia and south east asia but now europe and the west are also looking at india which is not only the biggest film industry but also has quality films coming from it
8758658 last year shah rukh khan joined the incredible india campaign and recently aamir khan is the brand ambassador for the atithi devo bhava campaign for the union ministry of tourism he will promote the tourism ministrys efforts both for domestic and foreign tourists and increase social awareness about the needs of the domestic and foreign tourists especially women tourists
8758659 indian films are very good brand ambassadors for india but in that sense every indian who travels out of india is a brand ambassador for india
8758660 darkside clan who ranked third has been the most difficult rival
8758661 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8758662 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8758663 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8758664 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8758665 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8758666 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8758667 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8758668 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8758669 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8758670 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8758671 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8758672 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8758673 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8758674 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8758675 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8758676 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8758677 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8758678 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8758679 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8758680 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8758681 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8758682 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8758683 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8758684 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8758685 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8758686 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8758687 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
8758688 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8758689 who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8758690 no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him
8758691 weve never been in a deeper hole internationally and ive never seen the middle class more uncertain about its future
8758692 the russians are trying to do every solitary thing they can to hurt your economy
8758693 this is a good friend i need to know how he does
8758694 if you read history many of the three name people do become assassins
8758695 labor day weekend signals the end of summer and the closing of a number of attractions that can only be enjoyed in the warm weather such as the citys parks beaches and pools
8758696 although the fall will bring many new and exciting attractions including the opening of the rock amp roll hall of fame brooklyn childrens museum and the return of the intrepid sea air amp space museum we encourage residents to use the holiday weekend as a last chance to experience countless summer activities throughout the five boroughs

8758708 i have to say that was not a very professional introduction before please dont tie me in to family and my brother in laws establishment
8758709 i do apologize i dont know if we talked about your brother in laws establishment are you talking about with tmz
8758710 its an honor because beyonce is so talented and i admire her
8758711 i thought the next thing to do would be to make a sculpture of the person whos the ideal beauty of the moment
8758712 cindy on the other hand with her button down suits and blouses looks like shes duct taped
8758713 the clothes we wear send a message and i think thats the message i dont think thats her intention though
8758714 im wearing the same thing i always do just brown today instead of black
8758715 in a race almost as tight as hillary clinton and obamas run for the democratic nomination for president the poodle won by a dog hair with just a few hundred votes separating the top two contenders

8758717 the second year of the war that is to begin tomorrow night
8758718 i am thrilled with our eighth and most eclectic season to date we are continuing our deep voyage into the american psyche which i find fascinating a psyche that seems to move backward and forward simultaneously exploring this theme we have two exhilarating productions to offer this season irwin shaws bury the dead is a classic american anti war play that although written in 1936 remarkably feels as if it was written today given the global and domestic pressures currently facing our country ellen weiss and s original musical being audrey is a fascinating look into the joys and pitfalls of americas favorite pastime hollywood icon worship both productions investigate answers to the ongoing american questions how did we get here and where are we going

8758737 we applaud the republican party and especially the members of the platform committee representing grassroots pro life republicans across the country for making such a strong and unequivocal stand supporting life at all stages
8758738 the work of the platform committee makes clear in no uncertain terms that the republican party is the pro life party

8758742 its an unfortunate sign that climate change is coming rapidly to the arctic and that we really need to address the issue of global warming on a national level
8758743 this was a relatively cool summer and to have ice decrease to the second lowest minimum on record demonstrates that global warmings ongoing impact is profound
8758744 its going to accelerate climate change through changes in the reflectance of the arctic
8758745 its going from bright ice to a much darker ocean
8758746 the reason you tweak laws redefining them or broadening their definitions is to create the opportunity for a legal climate in which challenges may better succeed

8758751 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8758752 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8758753 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8758754 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8758755 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8758756 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8758757 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8759003 sustaining the ability of carers to provide the care and support they give to others is of critical importance
8759004 the two tier benefit recommended by the committee would be a major improvement to the current system
8759005 carers need a separate benefit which recognises that they are not unemployed but are making an important contribution to society
8759006 the committees excellent report lays bare the extent to which carers struggle to access the support they need while carrying out one of the most valuable jobs in our society
8759007 as long as we come to help celebrate the occasion with her everyone game
8759008 i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or uh a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity uh you know is above my pay grade
8759009 could scarcely empty a scuttle of ashes so handless was the poor creature
8759010 to sit back hoping that someday some way someone will make things right is to go on feeding the crocodile hoping he will eat you last but eat you he will
8759011 good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
8759012 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
8759013 ma perh palmiro non su quel sito di quei tipacci he sbavano per le strisce
8759014 i noticed that he was bumping into things things that he would not normally that you would think he wouldnt bump into
8759015 well manage well figure it out and make it work
8759016 people are really quite amazing they will sacrifice for themselves so they can give their pets the best possible care
8759017 they look around and you have to wonder whats going through their minds

8759019 if youre lucky enough to find them unlike me substitute key limes for the persian limes cooks illustrated says the taste is the same between the two so dont fret about calling it key lime
8759020 we need to boil that down we need to figure what changes have to be made to accommodate the concerns that are raised
8759021 theres been positive feedback but theres also been some adjustments that need to be made and we really need to sit down and talk about that and put our best foot forward
8759022 what are the adjustments that have to happen not to assume we got it all 100 per cent completely right
8759023 in my mind its a statement of principles its not a recipe
8759024 i think if we talk to people and tell them this is a statement of principles of intent and during the implementation that theres leeway to discuss with canadians i think thats the logical way to do it
8759025 early indications are that several shots were fired from the alley at that point witnesses indicate that there were two vehicles involved a black car and a black ford four door pick up truck with a lift kit
8759026 the investigation has determined the couple had just left the service station when the driver swerved to avoid a deer
8759027 the passenger had not fastened his seatbelt prior to leaving the service station this contributed to him being ejected
8759028 the car continued north narrowly missing a semi truck that was driving a short distance behind the officer was able to stop the vehicle and the driver was taken in for impaired driving
8759029 she was late in delivering and she had to be induced they sent her home because nothing was happening
8759030 next thing it came on they were racing back to the hospital my oldest daughter was driving and christine said i think its coming jenny was trying to get to the hospital on time then the next thing she heard was the baby crying
8759031 she is feeling great we were all kind of freaked out last night but she is happy and healthy and nursing everything is all good
8759032 wow she caught her own baby im so proud of these girls
8759033 my oldest daughter took a string out of her coat and tied it off while they were waiting for the ambulance
8759034 the operators were noticing some issues with them so we decided to shut the pumphouse down
8759035 people may notice a different colour to their water but thats all thats why weve put the notice out there
8759036 weve got water quality technicians that monitors all of our water according to protocols we have with interior health and everything is good
8759037 the majority of the drug transactions occurred with the designated downtown red zone however police also focused their efforts on several new trafficking hot spots within the city and westbank
8759038 in the two phases now complete police have arrested and charged a total of 46 different people with trafficking in a controlled substance

8759040 looking back at the custom bike world it was such a contrast it was almost nauseating so experiencing the performance world made me want to build a bike that could balance both worlds
8759041 about two years ago i planned this machine and built it to do things its like late 50s early 60s sort of caf racer crossed with modern custom sports bike but with modern techno harley and a lot of high tech thrown in this simple little sketch that i made on an airplane it was a bike that had a look to it it was also a look that no one had really delved into before
8759042 it runs just a front cylinder and where the cylinder of the v sits i run the supercharger harleys themselves are fun to work with but to take half of one was even a bigger challenge theres something fun in making a machine go fast that really is not supposed to i figured it would either be a grenade or wed get it to work quite well
8759043 we barely start with any factory parts at all its building a bike from a clean sheet of paper on this motorcycle everything from the kickstand to the frame all the body is all hand made the wheels are specially made the hubs for instance i started with 96 pounds of aluminum material and manually machined it down to an 18 pound hub i mean youre building everything
8759044 the industry has had a lot of negative exposure most notably the show orange county not to slam them they do their thing and they have their place but they will never really be considered bike builders its entertainment its an alternative to watching temptation island its not about bike building its not about informing or educating or showing people how things are done its about silly drama thats a whole different thing and we dont like to be associated with that in any way
8759045 part of it is i didnt really push it because thats not how i roll i always sort of had this idea that this is my work and if you like it great if people pick up on it thats awesome and if not thats fine too i let my work speak for itself and thats worked for me im really not the self promotion kinda guy
8759046 im looking at buying a few and putting them in our cars i think it would be advantageous for our members as investigators
8759047 it will make not only the person being stopped but also our members more accountable for their actions
8759048 we actually have many very innovative ideas in kelowna and are leading edge in many ways that is somewhat pleasing because people are continually picking my brain about what were doing because word has spread that weve had some success especially in the downtown core
8759049 the fact is that a very small percentage of people are responsible for over 50 of the crime probably five per cent of the people account for committing 50 of the crime we have to find some legislation to deal with keeping prolific offenders behind bars
8759050 were all struggling trying to find members to become police officers its getting to a critical stage that people dont want to join police organizations anymore

8759073 forty to fifty percent of kids today are overweight and if we dont provide them with a fun way to engage in physical activity during school they will never learn the life skills needed to change their habits
8759074 there are few if any other sports that translate to a curriculum like this one that promotes the right combination of physical fitness fun and easy to present lessons
8759075 we are very pleased to be able to offer educators an in school program that can have such a significant impact on kids
8759076 students will now have the opportunity to be introduced to an economical sport they can play their entire life while building their self confidence learning sportsmanship enjoying the benefits of a healthy lifestyle and most importantly having fun
8759077 this story is not true luke is not appearing on the show
8759078 i cant re imagine it currently its just not something that ive thought about to be quite honest i dont see it happening
8759079 im holding out for more money their initial offer wasnt what i was hoping for show me the money and im there dude
8759080 a citizen sees the beating in a parking lot police get there fast they see him beating her its a good solid case
8759081 he was on top of her actually in the act of violently beating her when the officers arrived with the knife in his hand
8759082 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world i think we know where the rest of this blog is going if you guessed it had to do with my father then you guessed right it really hurts because i have tried after all that my mother and siblings have gone through i really tried to make things work for the hope of having a father again wanting things to change even though people have said some people will forever remain the same having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is he has no idea what is going on in my life because i have chosen not to involve him in it his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame why he feels the need to comment on anything in my life that i may want to keep private is beyond comprehension if he really cared about me and my life then he would learn to respect my wishes by staying out of it samantha has not and would never sell me out nor has my mother who is wonderful this further proves that any information that my father has about me or the people in my life is internet based and about as accurate as a page six item im not going to engage any further though i probably could go on i have said enough i have a therapist and it is not the the camera man at x17
8759083 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love
8759084 but one day all of a sudden it just happened i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing
8759085 i was just so proud to show off my big old jim mcconaughey and his gift
8759086 david and victoria beckham were driving a car that had been scratched the day before when it had been left parked at the airport they were not involved in any accident at all there was no police no crash no paparazzi chase etc just very incorrect reports via internet gossip sites
8759087 the studio knew the trucks were rickety there had even been an internal memo about the railings
8759088 im shocked by the video when i look at amy i think for christs sake just get a grip of yourself enough is enough as the police know amy is a drug addict and she has now been caught twice on film taking illegal drugs they should arrest her and put her behind bars rehab clinics are a waste of money unless you want them to work amy doesnt want to give up drugs so shes got to learn the hard way in prison police have to act she is making a mockery of the law it has got to stop the price amy has got to pay is losing her freedom
8759089 a clear grasp of our foreign policy and national security challenges
8759090 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8759091 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and inexperienced to be president
8759092 and it wont work in 2008 either because barack obama is on the right side of history
8759093 embraces the extremist philosophy that has defined his party for 25 years
8759094 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more thanks but no thanks
8759095 it makes me think about all the suffering all the pain all the hurt so many people who gave all they had this is a down payment on the dream of martin luther king
8759096 when i got knocked down by guys bigger than me she sent me back out and said bloody their nose so you can walk down the street the next day
8759097 this year it is actually worse i have been here 54 years and i have never seen the water so low the situation so bad
8759098 i dont think the outside world realises just how dangerous the situation is not just for israel but for the whole region
8759099 there is a very real danger that this could lead to over salination the lower red line indicates the level at which the sustainability of the lake is threatened we are certainly very alarmed by the authorities willingness to go to the black line this development could well be irreversible
8759100 our cousins i say that because the bible says we are cousins have been drilling in areas they should not and this is diverting the water this is the politics of the middle east
8759101 they should be setting up manydesalination plants to get water from other sources theyre using israeli expertise in these matters all over the world but this is the one country which isnt using it enough i dont think it would be possible to deprive the farmers of their water so what is needed is alternative sources its that simple
8759102 quite big cracks are now appearing on the walls of our home that is due to the heat caused by the drought this is the hottest i can remember we desperately need some rain pretty soon maybe this is global warming
8759103 but the pumping out of the water doesnt help my husband was a fisherman and he has seen how the water has gone over the years and with it the fishes
8759104 we used to say even a few years ago that one place where you couldnt go wrong fishing was kinneret hebrew name for the sea of galilee but now it is getting very very hard because the stocks are so low many fishermen fear for their livelihood and so do i but it seems no one really cares about us
8759105 of course many of the disciples of jesus were fishermen at galilee if you recall he said he would make them fishers of men well that wouldnt be possible now there are hardly any fish left around here
8759106 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8759107 i think what senator obama wants to do is make sure everyone watching at home is going on to have a clear sense of where he wants to take the country that were on the wrong path and barack obama is going to put us back on the right track both here at home and overseas
8759108 we want to move on and embrace every race in south africa
8759109 our figures show that 85 per cent of those wanting to join are black theyre fed up of corruption and the lack of support from the anc and want to join us in a non racial party which represents everyone not the few
8759110 were not going to be the party of p w botha we are going to be the party of f w de klerk who is still massively respected in south africa
8759111 the national party handed over a modern state to the anc in 1994 despite sanctions but now look at the country we need to tackle poverty from the ground up not with black empowerment deals which benefit the few
8759112 the majority black population will always associate them with apartheid and a sizeable proportion of the white population feel betrayed by them for negotiating with the anc to end apartheid i do not see them making waves
8759113 i did a lot of aces and she made a lot of mistakes

8759122 this discovery is very encouraging and a great step forward in our quest to create new cancer treatments
8759123 because of the role hls5 plays in keeping cell growth at a normal rate we expect that these compounds will greatly slow down the growth of cancer cells
8759124 our preliminary data reveals that several of these compounds do indeed markedly slow down the growth of human cancer cells
8759125 importantly we also know through computer modeling that nearly all of these compounds have drug like qualities
8759126 from here we take the research to the next phase of laboratory testing with the ultimate hope of investigating if one of these molecules can be used to create a fresh treatment that can slow growth of cancer cells in patients
8759127 wir hoffen das beste aber wir bereiten uns auf das schlimmste vor

8759130 the record presented demonstrates that far from encouraging copyright infringement veoh has a strong dmca digital millennium copyright act policy takes active steps to limit incidents of infringement on its website and works diligently to keep unauthorized works off its website
8759131 one of the big issues here was whether there was an awareness of the copyright infringement

8759138 just in his tax policies alone mccain is saving corporate america 175 billion a year
8759139 theyre doing the public offering now so that the compensation can be taxed at the lower rate while bush is still in office
8759140 theyre betting obama is going to win and theyre getting their money while they can
8759141 i think we dont want to make too much of his promises on taxes

8759147 they want to make sure theres socialism when they need it bailouts and capitalism when they need that
8759148 i have always been committed to the principle that it is not the duty of government to bail out and reward those who act irresponsibly

8759151 sunday school is for discipleship and we wont change it until the rapture
8759152 this means that minesites like bgm can provide food resources for carnabys if they plan their revegetation strategies accordingly
8759153 if we can determine the areas they prefer to drink from we can go a long way to prevent them using contaminated areas
8759154 carnabys actually like to use some artificial water sources onsite such as drainage sumps these hold clean water all year round and have just the right combination of cover and openness with a small section of surrounding vegetation and trees
8759155 knowing this we can provide alternative drinking sources for cockatoos as well as design areas around the new residue disposal so they don t attract the cockatoo
8759156 over the last 50 years weve extensively modified the perth landscape to make it a better human habitat now its time to think about restoring some of the features that used to make it such good carnabys habitat
8759157 burns patients need to have their bandages changed three times a week for up to two months and this is a very painful experience
8759158 the children are already anxious when they arrive at the hospital because they know the procedure is going to hurt
8759159 however we know that pain perception has a strong psychological component that can be overcome with appropriate preparation and distraction
8759160 it was important that the product took only seconds to engage the child and it was also important that the distraction lasted 20 minutes about the length of time it usually takes a nurse to replace burns bandaging
8759161 the whole form of the toy is the interface it has a touch screen and vibrating handles

8759190 the game requests the player to be a hero and save black balloons by performing a number of energy saving actions such as switching off lights and appliances before the snowman melts because of the effects of climate change
8759191 we have designed this game to appeal to late primary school and early secondary school students but i think lots of adults may also enjoy playing it
8759192 the game really gives kids the understanding and empowers them by letting them know that their individual actions can reduce their impact on climate change
8759193 the game is really engaging kids think it looks cool and best of all it helps them develop a connection between the causes and effects of climate change while having fun playing the game
8759194 that such a large amount of fish is used for the pet food industry is real eye opener
8759195 what is also interesting is that in australia pet cats are eating an estimated 13 7 kilograms of fish a year which far exceeds the australian average per capita fish and seafood consumption of around 11 kilograms our pets seem to be eating better than their owners
8759196 while much of the criticism has been on the grounds that forage fish could be better used for human consumption directly particularly amongst the poorer nations of the world rather than in the production of food for farmed fish little attention has been paid to the amount of forage fish used by the pet food industry
8759197 pet ownership is increasing globally the pet food industry is moving towards a constant increase of production and manufacturing and marketing premium and super premium products these gourmet pet foods contain a significant amount of fish that may be suitable for direct human consumption while different raw material unsuitable for human consumption such as by products of the fish filleting industry could be used
8759198 i am not advocating the need to reduce significantly the fishmeal and fish oil use in aquaculture if it were to sustain in the long term in this regard it is important to note that all sectors associated with the aquaculture industry are making a concerted effort to reduce the use of forage fish
8759199 the central issue is not an advocacy of pets versus aquaculture or other agricultural animal husbandry activities but the need for a more objective and pragmatic approach to the use of a limited and decreasing biological resource for human benefit
8759200 ive just agreed to write a movie for sony and producer scott rudin about how facebook was invented

8759208 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law

8759219 i write to you to register my deep concern for the environmental and social problems associated with the albany project and would urge you to remove your support from this forthwith as the development is ecologically environmentally and socially irresponsible
8759220 it is clear to everyone that water is a very scarce resource on this island the fact that the albany development will site its golf course on top of the island s largest water lens is indefensible lined or not the golf course will impact the islands largest remaining water resource golf courses require fertilizers herbicides and fungicides to keep them green and healthy despite the most stringent protocols during heavy rains run off from the golf course will pollute the freshwater lens
8759221 the albany development s environmental impact statement says that total water use during peak period for the development will exceed 1
8759222 new providence island nassau is home to at least 215 000 people who use approximately 55 60 gals water per day compared to the 1000 persons who will be living at albany using close to 1000 gallons per person per day coupled with the astronomical water demands that albany will make on the system clearly it is a disaster in the making
8759223 adelaide was one of the first black african villages to be settled after the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade in 1807 in the bahamas the area is now home to approximately 100 residents who enjoy a 4 plus mile beach which has remained unchanged since the freedom of slaves and is voted the top of the list when it comes to beaches in new providence
8759224 an optional war is one in which we attacked them an obligatory war one in which they attacked us
8759225 every war is considered optional and not obligatory except joshuas war which was to capture the land of israel
8759226 an optional war is the war against amon or moab or ishmael 9 and the like a commanded war is only the war against amalek and the seven nations
8759227 they are only permitted to go to an optional war by authority of a court of seventy one judges
8759228 it is in any event obvious that gentiles are not legally able to capture land
8759229 even though land cannot legally be captured by gentiles if a gentile nation transgressed and captured land it acquired it through capture as a thief who acquires ownership of a stolen object because the rightful owners have given up hope of getting it back although there is definitely no permission to steal in any event it is acquired by the owners giving up hope
8759230 there the reason is because gentiles are not legally entitled to capture

8759247 we do not restrict access to our exams for anyone applying for initial certification or maintenance of certification based on whether they do or do not perform an abortion
8759248 we do not base this upon whether they do or do not refer patients to an abortion provider if they do not choose to do abortions
8759249 i think this provides broad application not just to abortion and sterilization but any other type of morally objectionable procedure and research activity
8759250 we think its badly needed our members are facing discrimination every day and as we get into human cloning and all sorts of possibilities its going to become even more important

8759266 when you have a major disturbance like bleaching it can affect a huge area of the reef
8759267 if you have extensive reserve systems then the chances are much higher they will contain small areas within that escape bleaching which can help to recharge the reef as a whole
8759268 the great barrier reef marine park authority have put a lot of effort into determining exactly where these protected zones should be located to give the reef the best over chance of recovery from bleaching events
8759269 new protected zones need to focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
8759270 coral dies when it is put under stress so what we need to be doing is reducing the direct human impact such as over fishing pollution and sedimentation across the whole area by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
8759271 these changes are substantial for some groups and indicate that little insurance is offered by current small scale nta management across the region
8759272 we detected declines in fish species richness across the western indian ocean in response to loss of live coral cover the one main exception is mombasa marine national park kenya where species richness and fish density have increased owing to management action
8759273 geography seems to be a key determinant in the ability of reefs to absorb and recover from such large scale disturbances and this should be considered for other regions likely to suffer similar large scale disturbances in the future
8759274 if we were put into individual capsules with our art materials and fired out into different parts of outer space we would still have everything we loved about painting which was the opportunity to lay on paint

8759276 most people would go to rats and mice for lab testing but when it comes to testing new wound therapies or products and cosmetics that go on human skin pig skin is our closest alternative and is most often used
8759277 however this is expensive the test numbers are limited and of course there are ethical problems to consider so using a human skin equivalent will reduce this use and possibly give more accurate results
8759278 obviously the ultimate goal is to avoid labs having to use animals altogether eventually
8759279 it is showing the model we use explaining how we go about making it and how these skin equivalents are used to guide and minimise the use of animals when we develop new wound healing therapies
8759280 we collect skin donated by consenting patients who have had surgery resulting in a surgical off cut and the skin is then processed in our laboratory to isolate the cells once they are growing healthily again we can bring them back together and create the multi component skin equivalent in the lab
8759281 so we deconstruct the skin and its cells and then reconstruct them we cannot use the skin off cuts themselves as those cells are dying and we need to get the cells back to a state where are growing healthily again
8759282 policy makers need to realise that by taking underground water we are mining a limited resource just as digging up iron ore is mining a limited resource
8759283 if we treat it as a minable resource we will have to rethink the way we use it and perhaps we will decide that using it to water lawns for example isnt the best use of a limited resource
8759284 until now underground water has been allocated on a first come first serve basis which was fine when the supply was being recharged every year but climate change has robbed us of that and we need to think more wisely about how we allocate what we have
8759285 it just seems a particularly wet season in the context of the past four or five really dry years
8759286 its hard to tell at this stage how much recharge this years rains will bring but they wont be enough to make up for the decline of the past couple of years
8759287 if a cystic fibrosis sufferer is found to be suffering from a respiratory infection in which haemophilus is involved then the treatment is more specific the better the diagnosis the better the antibiotic therapy
8759288 i have an interest in a particular organism found in cystic fibrosis and asked labs all around australia to gather it up for me
8759289 but they replied that it was too difficult because the organism was always covered by pseudomonas so i did a literature search and came up with this method which had never been followed through or evaluated
8759290 1 that plant twining direction is random 2 that twining direction is determined by plant tips following the apparent movement of the sun across the sky and 3 that twining direction is determined by the coriolis effect
8759291 we found no difference in the proportion of stems twining clockwise vs anticlockwise between the northern and southern hemispheres in fact 92 per cent of the stems we recorded twined in an anticlockwise direction
8759292 we rejected all three of our theories we are now investigating the possibility that the widespread phenomenon of anticlockwise twining arises as a function of the left handed bias of all biological molecules on earth
8759293 the more carbs and sugars you eat the more your appetite control cells are damaged and potentially you consume more
8759294 people in the age group of 25 to 50 are most at risk the neurons that tell people in the crucial age range not to over eat are being killed off
8759295 when the stomach is empty it triggers the ghrelin hormone that notifies the brain that we are hungry when we are full a set of neurons known as pomcs kick in
8759296 however free radicals created naturally in the body attack the pomc neurons this process causes the neurons to degenerate overtime affecting our judgement as to when our hunger is satisfied
8759297 a diet rich in carbohydrate and sugar that has become more and more prevalent in modern societies over the last 20 30 years has placed so much strain on our bodies that its leading to premature cell deterioration
8759298 it means diabetic wounds can be actually healed rather than just offering palliative care it could mean fewer amputations which are often necessary when these wounds wont heal
8759299 the cost of non healing wounds would be up in the hundreds of millions of dollars
8759300 a lot of wound care is done in the community and this dressing doesnt need changing as often as conventional dressings so it could save on time and travel costs
8759301 the gel sheet developed by dr molan is a unique patented system for holding medihoney antibacterial honey in contact with a wound while at the same time absorbing what the wound exudes
8759302 absorbency and antibacterial activity are two of the key benefits wound care clinicians look for when evaluating wound dressings
8759303 open source software fanatics jacked up on peanuts red bull and ingenuity
8759304 with elections approaching the nations business languishes yet our country is at war and facing a faltering economy rising oil prices and myriad other challenges
8759305 when there are lots of competing males trying to fertilise the eggs of females males produce larger more competitive sperm that live for longer
8759306 similarly when females detect that there are too many males competing for her eggs too many sperm can kill the eggs of some organisms the females play hard to get producing smaller eggs that are harder for searching sperm to find
8759307 these changes make sense if youre stuck to a rock like sea squirts are
8759308 if you cant run away from a highly competitive environment you must therefore make your gametes more competitive in order to get a higher chance of successfully reproducing
8759309 we manipulated adult densities in the field by placing either one low density or 15 high density sea squirts in a cage for one month
8759310 this research tells us a little as to how sex evolved in the first place
8759311 specifically it gives us some insight into why sperm are so tiny and males make millions of them whereas female eggs are much larger and are produced in fewer numbers
8759312 because these organisms reproduce by the ancestral mode of reproduction it gives us an indication as to how competition between males led to all sorts of reproductive strategies including the one used by humans internal fertilisation
8759313 for centuries people appreciated only the beautiful works of art and long life of the colours but little did they realise that these works of art are also in modern language photocatalytic air purifier with nanostructured gold catalyst
8759314 these vocs create that new smell as they are slowly released from walls and furniture but they along with methanol and carbon monoxide are not good for your health even in small amounts
8759315 gold when in very small particles becomes very active under sunlight
8759316 the electromagnetic field of the sunlight can couple with the oscillations of the electrons in the gold particles and creates a resonance
8759317 the magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can be enhanced by up to hundred times which breaks apart the pollutant molecules in the air
8759318 this technology is solar powered and is very energy efficient because only the particles of gold heat up
8759319 in conventional chemical reactions you heat up everything which is a waste of energy
8759320 once this technology can be applied to produce specialty chemicals at ambient temperature it heralds significant changes in the economy and environmental impact of the chemical production
8759321 philippa colins review shows young australians are anything but apathetic they are strongly engaged with political issues and social causes such as the environment poverty health and an australian republic
8759322 however they feel alienated and marginalised by old formal institutionalised politics
8759323 the review finds that for young people theres been a generational shift in australian politics the research shows its no longer about political loyalties its about political choice
8759324 young australians are distrustful of politicians and they are not content to accept the hierarchies in traditional institutions of democracy they prefer to engage in grassroots campaigns and cause based activities where they feel like they can make a difference
8759325 the underlying attitudes of young people are important for policy makers as they look to the future
8759326 more importantly young australians will be critical in shaping our democracy and our democratic institutions
8759327 civic education which has been the dominant policy response to dwindling rates of youth participation for some years is not the answer
8759328 the research shows that civic education programs and experiences where young people have little or no control over the process or outcomes can be counter productive
8759329 what weve seen from this literature review is that there are gaps in the research there are no specific studies on what young people would like democracy to look like there is little if any research assessing the impact of young peoples political activities
8759330 if there is a real commitment to protect all children then supporting families and children before they reach the point of being abused and neglected should be a priority
8759331 we already know many of the risk factors for child abuse and neglect and in many cases we could identify many children who are most vulnerable before theyre even born
8759332 the current approach does little to prevent abuse but focuses on intervening once much of the harm has already been done an approach that in my view is both unethical and inhumane
8759333 while urgent action is needed to protect children being abused and neglected we need to broaden adult focussed services such as alcohol and drug treatment mental health corrections homelessness family violence etc so that they can enhance the parenting of their clients
8759334 we also need to use health promotion campaigns with messages such as alcohol and children dont mix given that one in eight australian children now lives in a household with at least one adult who is regularly binge drinking
8759335 child abuse and neglect needs to be attacked in the same comprehensive way we have tackled other serious health issues such as smoking or coronary heart disease that is to identify the risk factors promote a range of interventions and change community attitudes
8759336 if we keep the current approach with its heavy emphasis on the crisis end of the scale then we will never see these rates reduce while we must look after the children who have been abused we must do much more to stop it happening to others
8759337 its very important for us to put on a great show in kansas city we owe it to kansas city because we have so many good young players were able to do this
8759338 they are bringing their best players we went over that before we scheduled the game they want kansas city to work and they want a good showing and as owner operators of the building they want to put their best step forward those folks wouldnt be coming up for a b squad
8759339 its very important for us to put on a great show in kansas city we owe it to kansas city because we have so many good young players were able to do this
8759340 this is the song that never ends as it goes on and on my friends
8759341 the feeling i get from many leafs fans is that they
8759342 the maple leafs are perennially and justifiably measured against the franchises last stanley cup winner in 1967 and there are precious can mark bell regain his form
8759343 we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8759344 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8759345 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8759346 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8759347 sustainable development is a key strategy for the survival of the planet and its people
8759348 we dont want the exam system to be the one thing that slows people down some schools might stick to having a final exam at 16 because they wont want the disruption of going modular
8759349 but there is growing evidence that schools are looking at personalised learning students could start some gcses in year 9 when aged 13 and finish them at the end of year 10 then they could start doing a levels a year early or they could treat year 11 as a bridging year and take time out from exams to do more exploration or do preparatory courses for a levels
8759350 the gcse is an important staging post its a stepping stone rather than the school leaving certificate it was 20 years ago
8759351 having units lets people build up in their own time
8759352 this would free up time for the last three years of school to be used either as a broader curriculum or to concentrate on a levels there is concern about the jump from gcses to a levels which is a shock for some young people
8759353 theres been a move away from rote learning and repetition towards using data and processing it
8759354 these new gcses will ensure that all young people are able to demonstrate their skills knowledge and understanding when studying for a qualification that meets their individual needs
8759355 the inclusion of controlled assessment and more varied question types will ensure that gcses continue to stretch and challenge young people
8759356 we have sought to further reduce police bureaucracy making sure that the public feel confident with police accountability while ensuring that the police have the power to carry out their key duties on the front line
8759357 having delayed introducing postcharge questioning in the area of terrorism it is now worth seeing how this works in practice before extending it more widely
8759358 the liberal democrats have long supported the introduction of postcharge questioning as an alternative to increasing the maximum detention period without charge
8759359 hes writen to a deer i bet ya a buck hes fawnin over a doe
8759360 i find dance such a beautiful and fascinating art form because it encompasses most other art forms it is sculptural it involves rhythm and music intimately light and dark and interplay of color are included movement of course without which nothing could happen on this planet and human beings with their imagination desire and energy which are the catalyst for all the ingredients already mentioned this is why i dance and look to see dance it is also why i love to choreograph
8759361 it was frustrating but its over and done with now and im not giving it too much thought any more
8759362 that day and the day after was tough to try to get my head around it the assistant ref made a terrible decision and it cost us two points but thats just the way it is and we have to get on with it
8759363 we should have scored before that but it didnt happen and we have to look forward to next week i still dont know why it wasnt given i was a body length onside and i dont know how he missed it we all make mistakes but that was a huge mistake for us especially at the beginning of the season
8759364 i dont know ive no idea what has gone on it is very hard to get communication from some people in life we just have to get on with it
8759365 last time we came here in 1999 for some reason i picked a weakened team
8759366 when i saw lazio celebrating at the end of the game like they had won the world cup i said to myself that wouldnt happen again there will be some changes of course but it will be a strong team so hopefully it will represent us in the right way
8759367 having watched zenit last season they played attacking football which captured a lot of peoples attention they had a fantastic season and i hope it turns out to be a really attacking exciting game
8759368 obviously its good for every attacking player at arsenal because of the way in which they play the game
8759369 when i first came here last season the manager told me that he wanted to try to play the same way but we had a lot of injuries last year and it wasnt easy
8759370 this year its been better and we are trying to play our football its great for me because i like to attack and if everybody stays fit i think we can go on and have a good season
8759371 its great to be a part of the team at the moment so i dont mind where the manager asks me to play
8759372 but i am happy to play on the right i have said before that i feel i can do a job there for the team its a different kind of role because i have had to learn the job from a defensive point of view but i feel that i have done well
8759373 it was really tough but we worked hard and deserved the goal we deserved the win tonight but they missed some really good chances before the end and god gave us this lucky goal we were lucky tonight it is not easy but i think this win will be very good for us and give the fans some joy
8759374 hargreaves has been training very well and i think he will get 45 minutes to an hour but i think it is impossible for him to play for england
8759375 this will be his first start and i wont be playing him for the full game he will then need a recovery period so i think it will be very very unlikely that fabio would risk him
8759376 you might think that anyone could play against andorra but england struggled last time then they have to go to croatia that is a very very difficult match you need players who are 100 per cent match fit to play in a game of that nature we know he is not ready for that
8759377 we decided that this was the best time he will be okay for the first group stage match next month
8759378 carlos is doing well it would have been great if he had been able to play a game before sunday i wish he had been eligible to play tonight
8759379 but he is making good progress he has been training with us over the last two or three days and been doing really fine he has done a lot of running as well he is really keen to make his mark in the premier league
8759380 steve is doing fine but wouldnt be as well advanced as cuellar he is doing pretty well although it feels as if ive been saying that for the last 10 days
8759381 he is coming along nicely and i think he will probably be able to join in with us in training towards the end of the week but we will not rush him back what we dont want is a group of players who are only half fit going into the busy months of september and october
8759382 if gareth stays with us for the foreseeable future i will be really delighted it will be a really big bonus for us
8759383 i know that everton are a big club who have a history of playing in important competitions like the uefa cup
8759384 i hope i can do my best for the team
8759385 he has been fantastic here and it is a bit of a shame but it is the players wish and we wish him good luck
8759386 its good i have a connection to charlton and im also going to be close to my family
8759387 its a great opportunity for me to play football at a high standard with a club who have ambitions
8759388 you say hello to my kids because theyre hanging off her chin
8759389 robinho still has two years left on his contract that being the case he is our player for the next two seasons so you can draw your own conclusions from that
8759390 he is a fantastic player i saw a lot of him last season watching the spanish games he had a very good season until he got injured and it broke his season up a bit
8759391 he has great flair and something that would be nice to bring into our team we have flair players already but he is another option and he could light up the league he will have to get used to it because it is different to spain but he showed he is a world class player both at madrid and for brazil and world class players adapt
8759392 i remember standing up in the bath one day and there was a mirror in front of me and i was so thin i hated it i never liked being that skinny
8759393 when i was doing shows and flying economy nobody ever fed me
8759394 its a pleasure to be compared with such magnificent players
8759395 to win this award is great because champions league football is the highest level
8759396 the pain is like if you stab somebody it is like fire you feel it even in your heart
8759397 the worse thing you can be in this industry is to be a white middle class male
8759398 the most important old master paintings loan in any public museum
8759399 for a century the agitation to preserve great works of art in british collections for export has been animated by anxiety that titians great paintings diana and actaeon and diana and callisto might be sold now the paintings have been offered on remarkably advantageous terms
8759400 the inability of the english to communicate intelligibly in their own language
8759401 if thats the case how come so many people have died and we dont know how many more will be showing symptoms
8759402 the ball fell through and consumer confidence is right down the tubes with respect to government and companies like maple leaf its absolutely outrageous
8759403 i think that it should be investigated at the nursing home but i think the plant in which all this has developed it certainly should be checked into very very thoroughly
8759404 its affecting more and more people than you can possibly imagine
8759405 school lunches are going to have to be re thought hospitals cafeteria this is a major major consumer issue
8759406 they have to find out what caused this so that it can never happen again
8759407 if they dont find out how do i know that next month its not going to happen again or with some other products more care has to be put into how our food is prepared
8759408 the important message for people is that if you have the symptoms that are associated with listeriosis that you take precautionary actions as you see fit in terms of seeing a health professional or public health person
8759409 because we knew we had made those products we had removed them from sale when the recall was initiated
8759410 we executed the recall we did it effectively efficiently and the products that are now being recalled were prepared and sold prior to the recall
8759411 if theres a problem with a product we pull the product off the floor and begin calling our customers and typically within 24 hours everyones been called
8759412 as with every human controversy there are absolutely two sides to this one and i will vigorously present mine at the appropriate time
8759413 i have never on any of these occasions discussed an actual case with an attorney the suggestion that i have favorites or some sort of black book is absolutely untrue
8759414 in those days on some occasions i returned to the courthouse after having wine with lunch but never in circumstances that would impair my judicial abilities
8759415 in retrospect i was a mess i was by then severely diabetic from the stress and weight gain i still drank too much and i was probably pretty much a jerk to be around
8759416 i understand there are a few other people using facebook pages under my name which i find more flattering than creepy but this is me
8759417 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8759418 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8759419 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8759420 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8759421 deep regret after seeking mediation he stressed that his claim had nothing to do with his disappointment at not being promoted
8759422 im content with my achievements so far im not seeking massive monetary benefits and i do not have grievances against the whole of the met an organisation that i dearly love and admire
8759423 long honourable and occasionally blood stained record on the championing of diversity
8759424 racism both institutional and individual still continues within the met
8759425 in fact it has not improved that much since the
8759426 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8759427 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8759428 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8759429 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8759430 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8759431 we have reached an agreement with thiago neves there are just details to be sorted out
8759432 my father made strenuous efforts to raise the money but couldnt convince anyone
8759433 the result is that we found ourselves working with three sorts of stock eastman kodak ferrania and gevaert
8759434 when he was making the garden of the finzi continis he would often drive from ferrara to venice and spend all night at the roulette table then drive back to be on the set on time
8759435 he was selected against nantes in the second match of the season but has had disciplinary problems since
8759436 he must now make a decision whether to stay or to go
8759437 if he stays he already knows the conditions so from now on it is up to him to decide
8759438 atletico madrid and liverpool will play not fernando torres and kun aguero
8759439 both teams have great players but they are teams the important thing is for the competition to get started and for us to be able get through
8759440 every game well play in this phase will be beautiful and the one at anfield will be too what we want is for everyone to see us and see that atletico madrid can be among the best
8759441 the group weve been given isnt easy but were going to do everything possible to get to the next stage
8759442 the games are there to be won and thats what were going to do
8759443 im very happy about the run of form im having
8759444 the olympic medal from the beijing games is something very pleasing but the game against schalke was another final for me luckily everything went well and i won both
8759445 if we hadnt won the champions league qualifier the gold medal win would not have tasted as sweet
8759446 with only 100 days to go until the melbourne 2008 homeless world cup kicks off there is real anticipation and excitement building and we invite the world to watch as the players stand proud and show us what is possible
8759447 the homeless world cup has demonstrated the power of sport to change lives and to change the world the sixth homeless world cup in melbourne is the pinnacle of the year round work by grass roots football programs in 56 nations which bring together over 30 000 players for training helping to rebuild their lives and communities
8759448 the homeless world cup is growing fast travelling to the far corners of the globe to engage people who are homeless to change hearts and minds and to pioneer imaginative solutions to address this key global issue
8759449 the victorian government is proud to be part of an event with the ultimate goal of raising public awareness and encouraging all members of the community to take positive steps to address homelessness
8759450 the challenges of homelessness are substantial but the gains for participants and the wider community in overcoming the barriers to success are clear
8759451 previous homeless world cups have delivered real benefits to those involved research has shown that over 70 per cent of players go on to find a home come off drugs and alcohol move into education jobs and training and develop better relationships with friends and family
8759452 football to me transcends colour race or creed i have witnessed footballs influence and impact on the lives of people from all around the world be it the beaches of brazil the streets of sarajevo or centre stage at the fifa world cup
8759453 i am humbled to be an ambassador for the melbourne 2008 homeless world cup and witness the positive power of football in our community and its quest to raise awareness and address homeless issues around the world
8759454 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8759455 denver hours before presidential nominee barack obama takes the stage at invesco field his campaign manager described the illinois senators acceptance speech as the
8759456 the convention may be more important to us than mccain because people need to know more info about obama and are hungry for it
8759457 ive liked how weve looked in pre season ive seen all the games and weve been a very capable side
8759458 were not the favourites to win the league but we could spring a surprise on real madrid and barcelona and we have to stick close to them
8759459 the coach and the president have to decide these things but were sure we can do well with the current squad
8759460 push pin test blow test finger roll test color of the fur length of the fur and relative softeness of the fur
8759461 ive bought a new car ive had a blood transfusion and ive booked our next summer holiday but dont worry ill be back in time for my 90th birthday
8759462 we havent closed the gap in fact the gap has widened but the health of those who are most disadvantaged in life expectancy and infant mortality is at the same level as the rest of the population was eight years ago
8759463 the first thing is it is measuring and monitoring the problem we have really got as good a measure as any other country of the magnitude of the problem the fact that the government has had the courage to publish the bad news is important secondly we are taking it seriously the fact that we havent narrowed the gap means we have more work to do
8759464 toxic combination of bad policies economics and politics is in large measure responsible for the fact that a majority of people in the world do not enjoy the good health that is biologically possible
8759465 in rich countries low socioeconomic position means poor education lack of amenities unemployment and job insecurity poor working conditions and unsafe neighbourhoods with their consequent impact on family life these all apply to the socially disadvantaged in low income countries in addition to the considerable burden of material deprivation and vulnerability to natural disasters
8759466 angry and abandoned my personal message to him was that im dying and hes taking any hope away from me
8759467 nobody can claim that all that has no effect on them at all
8759468 the human consequences for individuals of the things we do are there and very real that generates a pressure to do the job as well as we can which one feels particularly acutely when the decisions are controversial like this one
8759469 he showed a very very determined approach to this project
8759470 we went in there to say we have very real concerns he was courteous and polite and listened carefully and didnt move a millimetre on anything it was really firm resolve i think in his position i would have played it the same way he has got a tough job what we saw from nice throughout our dispute is a strengthening of their resolve to take very difficult decisions and stick with them
8759471 when i heard hed got the job i gave him a hug and a bouquet of flowers
8759472 sharp thoughtful receptive fair and with a deep understanding of process
8759473 all you can do is your best you are bound to make people upset and make mistakes from time to time but you cant do better than that
8759474 people at that level are not affected by the public if they are good
8759475 i dont get told by anybody in government what to say
8759476 hes a quiet reasonable intelligent man in a very powerful position and i think he should be very much more critical of the government and opposition in terms of what needs to be done
8759477 some people believe drill here drill now and thats it barack obama believes solar here and solar now and wind here and wind now
8759478 gave me a great opportunity to get back in the game
8759479 what came first the chicken nugget or the egg mcmuffin
8759480 this kind of flower dont grow on earth just letting you know for what its worth
8759481 i dont see the point of a partnership it wont be long till they start to trip
8759482 they came from mars women came from venus we think with our brains men think its all meaningless
8759483 im 100 convinced i wouldnt need to turn into a lesbian if me and the boys could just stop disagreeing on just about everything
8759484 im a much better woman did a 12 step program and now i can drink again
8759485 work as a mickey mouse greeter at the magic kingdom
8759486 do for self move for self try to stay true to self
8759487 we dont want no war things lets explore things with peace and reasoning we could get more things
8759488 when theres no one to turn to reality burns you you got to learn to be careful with your sperm dude
8759489 we got e mails from people saying well never listen to your music because we hate your name
8759490 which means they were offended by the name does it offend you yeah it wound up giving the name a whole new authority
8759491 wyzant has been a fantastic site for me personally i am contacted only for students in my neighborhood as close as a block away all emails are screened for scams so i never have to worry and my jobs can be done professionaly because the site takes care of all the logistical and financial matters it has been nothing but a pleasure for me to work with this site
8759492 quer a aprovechar brevemente para desmentir categ ricamente la tergiversaci n que hicieron al menos tres medios de comunicaci n acerca de mis declaraciones el d a de ayer respecto al proceso de consulta que tuvo la elaboraci n de estas leyes
8759493 planea ir el s bado a un acto en guayaquil
8759494 reforming the band had never really been on the cards but somehow here it is
8759495 garry and i said if we are going to do it some time then why not now its our music so why should we not play it in whatever way we want
8759496 it was obvious alvin didnt enjoy playing with us any more ric chick and myself we love playing as a band and the fans wanted to see ten years after in concert joe was a lucky find hes a brilliant guitarist
8759497 the drifters is a contract that a singer enters into
8759498 i wasnt on the bus but my entire band was
8759499 we were lucky in that we have a very skilled driver but the first thing a lot of our friends and families heard about it was when it was reported in the newspapers
8759500 if the leader is being affected by this song then that means there is something wrong with him but im talking about any head of family mkuru mkuru applies to any family but families make up a community and communities make up the nation
8759501 walk down the street in harare and youll find more people of any age who love tuku mtukudzis nickname or at least have heard of him than you will any politician
8759502 every day is a struggle and its getting worse all the time
8759503 i didnt choose to be a zimbabwean but the fact that i am makes me proud a lot of people have left the country perhaps they have better reasons to than i do to be proud to be zimbabwean is a totally different thing to anyone saying they can be proud of zimbabwe because now every day is a struggle
8759504 nothing is forever whether leaders or me and you like it or not things have to turn around our economy is ruined but everything changes at some point hope is vital for all of our people and anyway theres no such thing as an easy life wherever you are
8759505 i think it is impossible for him to play for england
8759506 thats my personal opinion this will be his first start and i wont be playing him for the full game it depends on how he feels at half time but it certainly wont be any more than an hour
8759507 i dont think he is ready for that in fact we know he is not ready for that he will need to get a proper recovery get proper training if it wasnt such an important game you could say well give him a bit of a game but i cant see it it is too important for capello and england
8759508 it didnt feel like a big game at the time
8759509 the stadium was half empty and it was a strange atmosphere around the hotel its just monaco i guess its a different place
8759510 the super cup has not always figured as the most prestigious trophy in the uefa calendar and i must admit that at one time it did not rank all that highly for me either
8759511 but ill tell you one thing for certain and its that manchester united will be giving it everything we have got
8759512 one of the few teams who have four people in the penalty area every time they cross the ball
8759513 for some reason within the mental capacity of my mind i thought it was best to play a weakened team
8759514 there were a lot of reserves involved when we lost i said to myself that wont happen again
8759515 and as players we didnt realise the importance of it to be honest we had an important league game a few days afterwards and that was the priority this time we havent so theres no excuse its a prestigious game and we want to win
8759516 but its also really important for us to get some players back on the pitch
8759517 if we have any more violence we could withdraw the champions league final from rome its not an ultimatum just a message that we are keeping an eye on it
8759518 its not an easy draw for us and the overwhelming feeling after wednesdays game against standard li ge is that we are just happy to be involved
8759519 the tie against atl tico madrid is the one that stands out and will inevitably generate a lot of interest it will mean a lot to all the spanish players but especially torres
8759520 the pleasing aspect is that there will not be an awful lot of travel involved
8759521 given that our next two league games are away at liverpool and chelsea were particularly pleased that the game that falls between those two is at home against villarreal
8759522 in last weeks press conference i said i was less optimistic and im even less optimistic today
8759523 ive no idea whats going on its very hard to get communication with some people
8759524 my lawyers have asked for a meeting with the fa because i still believe there is a witchhunt because at the end of the day what are my transfers to rangers liverpool and newcastle to do with portsmouth
8759525 the part when i was interviewed about benjani ok an extract of that should have been sent to portsmouth im ok with that but sending the whole interview to portsmouth which lasted about six hours and was a document of about 100 pages
8759526 at the end of the day if ive done it ive done it but what have i done wrong
8759527 we are not prepared to discuss the details of an ongoing case due to confidentiality
8759528 european football must be clean and transparent and we do not want clubs buying success on credit
8759529 we have to find the golden mean the right balance
8759530 there have always been rich and poor clubs the rich get richer and the poor want to take their place we should have more balance and we will see what can be done but we will do it calmly and coolly with the whole football family
8759531 i am against technology video replays but with two more assistant referees it will deter cheating in the penalty area
8759532 when you have signed a contract you dont break it
8759533 so ronaldo did the right thing modern football is apparently about not respecting contracts and trying to make as much money as possible thats a pity
8759534 ive always accepted the challenge and always took it on this will just be another great challenge as a footballer youve got to prove yourself every week regardless youre out there in every game getting judged
8759535 robinho is a great player so having him around will be great for the squad
8759536 we want to win the title this season thats the priority
8759537 our squad is complete and it is impossible for us to have one better than the one we have
8759538 i find it incredible that a club like chelsea has not realised that not only is the deal not done but that the president and the coach of real have said they do not want to sell maybe it was a mistake but it is a pretty astonishing mistake to make if robinho thinks he has to leave real to become the best player in the world he is wrong
8759539 when you leave madrid it is impossible to end up at a better club
8759540 its the first time ive seen him smile properly for ages because hes going to play football again
8759541 its such great news im delighted for him ive spoken at length to mark hughes and now i know hes going to be playing regularly
8759542 when he would come around to my house id wind him up by showing him videos of himself playing at manchester city and say this is what you used to do youre not the player you were
8759543 we want shaun to be playing regularly for us as well as for england it shows our ambition and where this club wants to be to other players and we have the means to attract them
8759544 i asked shaun what he wanted to do and he said i want to go back to city
8759545 obviously im delighted to come back to city and i just cant wait to get started again
8759546 william showed what a great player he is against fc twente
8759547 everyone has bad times last season at birmingham i made a big mistake by conceding the injury time penalty that led to the equaliser that was my thing everyone is behind william
8759548 the big thing is to feel that you are wanted by your club manager team mates and the fans
8759549 it was a big disappointment for the fans to see what happened during the summer but ade is a big big player last year he showed he has the quality to be one of the best in europe so we just have to be behind him i am sure if he starts scoring goals everything will be fine
8759550 i wouldnt vote for john mccain if he was a democrat
8759551 i would not vote at all before id vote for him by you soon
8759552 you can do things for employees that dont cost anything but are worth a million dollars
8759553 small businesses can do these things because they arent constrained by a 500 page policy manual
8759554 every employee should be given the chance to determine how best to do their jobs as well as increased authority and leeway in the handling of company resources
8759555 we created employee committees to do things like set up a health fair a food co op and other projects
8759556 watching how employees manage these committees helps us create a great bench of leaders for the company
8759557 we cant give our staff thousands of dollars in bonus checks but we can do little things for them
8759558 we mixed up people from production quality control and maintenance
8759559 it was a great team builder because people from different departments are often at odds with each other
8759560 you would have thought people were winning oscars everybody was just thrilled
8759561 its a hallmark of motor planning in humans and we were pretty surprised to find something like this happening in flies and so rapidly
8759562 everybody assumed that jump reflex would be the first thing
8759563 wed like to find that place in the brain where sensory information is turned into a motor code
8759564 eventually id like to be able to go to an engineer and say this is how you build a fly
8759565 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position but rather to aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter
8759566 the minor iphone security issue which surfaced this week is fixed in a software update which will be released in september
8759567 if the owner of the phone has favorite entries in their address book containing urls e mail addresses or mobile phone numbers then those entries can be used to launch the browser mail application or sms short message service software and gain access to private web favorites e mail messages and text messages stored in the phone again without entering the unlock code
8759568 n s acreditamos que sim que a participa o de lula ajuda a atrair votos por isso que gostar amos da presen a dele e ele est com muita disponibilidade
8759569 eu s vejo que eu t numa boa porque eu tenho meu presidente luiz in cio lula da silva inteirinho comigo e eles est o l na disputa
8759570 the absence s e f a c ferrari was regretted it would have been a timely gesture to send one car for phil hill the first american to become world champion but sentiment has little place in the maranello setup
8759571 i always thought i was down with the movement but ive been travelling around and hooking up with some of the younger guys and they see me as a crossover i say i aint crossed over yet what do you mean
8759572 yeah i think there is a british hip hop scene that is just like 2 000 12 inchers sold to 2 000 hardcore fans across the nation
8759573 they have their hip hop nights attended by 500 kids who nod their heads away to a pretty streamlined hip hop sound which needs to be done on a certain kind of drum machine and uses a certain kind of sample that comes from a certain age
8759574 i still find some of the so called not so intelligent stuff entertaining though theres only so much chin strokey stuff you can take at a time
8759575 ive tended to go for a sort of slow release shock value i like to have that rewind impact did he really say that i love to do that theres been a massive bunch of stuff lately about therapy amy winehouse with rehab and charlotte church saying she needs professional help everyones talking about it its such a self absorbed scene with musicians and artists going away for a few weeks to get pampered with a bit of therapy ooh mummy threw my dummy on the floor when i was two with me the melancholy aspect of my lyrics is really a learnt attribute its done for effect mostly
8759576 wonky beats midtempos bleeps and blurps crazy zany phraseologies and intergalactic organics
8759577 a lot of the time its pretty hybrid i listen to something like wileys album and i think bloody hell that sounds like soca or something this is quite a small island and we mix and match influences from all over
8759578 i remember being quite stubborn about it almost locked them out of that part of my life
8759579 but now im older my dad came to see me at brixton academy and he came over to my flat and saw the awards and he said oh this is very good why didnt you tell me about this a few years ago he actually introduced me to someone as roots manuva so i think hes quite proud of me
8759580 within music ive always had that lyrical undertone of a kind of lost priest that character of the priest whos still preaching but preaching with two cans of tennents in his hands the drunks and bums of the world have some of the most poignant tales and stories and wisdoms
8759581 im trying to gauge a path through the whole malarkey of it
8759582 just concentrating on whats important to oneself is pretty hard
8759583 i was getting lost in all that and losing connection with the old club scene of just jumping on the mic my agents trying to book me into shepherds bush empire or brixton academy or wherever trying to get me to the next level and im out there playing at a jazz jam in some little pub in hoxton
8759584 thats the big fight cos there is more to the movement of music than just being in bigger arenas or getting more sales that to me is my biggest test when im around younger mcs or producers they scoff at me like look at you now look at that chain look at those glasses look at you i think am i getting sucked up by all this i thought i was one of the grimey boys
8759585 no one thing or one person can be the saviour of such a wide cultural movement
8759586 i remember when we were doing the witness video we went to a primary school and the school song was a rap song the kids would rap the school song to me thats uk hip hop people say it doesnt really have an impact in the charts but the kids are still rapping
8759587 we must march like weve never marched before to elect barack obama the next president of the united states
8759588 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8759589 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8759590 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8759591 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8759592 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach

8759596 for there to be increased adoption of open source databases at the enterprise application tier a number of factors need to be addressed
8759597 these include increased enterprise functionality improved service and support offering proof that performance fears are misplaced increased resistance traditional database software licensing and a move to web based architecture for internal applications

8759706 we have been looking to add a pinot noir vineyard for several years but hadnt found the ideal spot until now
8759707 and as new zealand is considered the most remote developed country in the world weve quite literally gone to the ends of the earth to try to produce the finest pinot imaginable
8759708 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8759709 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8759710 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8759711 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8759712 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8759713 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8759714 the loss of agave plants has reduced our inventory but we do not believe this will constrain our ability to build our tequila brands to their full potential
8759715 while these are certainly challenging economic times we remain confident about the long term growth opportunity for our excellent portfolio of premium and super premium brands

8759720 its been about three and a half hours of trying to find out exactly what happened turns out it was made up it was a hoax
8759721 what wed like to emphasize is that parents talk to their kids about this kind of accusations because we had more than 40 officers from the fbi and our department here in terms of man hours easily more than 10 thousand dollars spent in responding to this incident
8759722 first of all its very much a comfort we dont have anybody missing nobody was abducted thats the good part of this bad part of this we as you heard explained before there was a lot of time and a lot of people devoted to this case
8759723 there was an impact we had students crying in the lunch room we had to have counselors talk to them
8759724 we take every missing child very seriously thats why were here in over drive because what if this was real
8759725 the question for obama is what have you done and what have you run
8759726 he has good oratory but when you shut off the teleprompter theres not much there

8759728 at some point the market will begin to look through the trough and gauge the strength of the coming upturn
8759729 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly
8759730 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas
8759731 but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession

8759733 we gt gt cannot reasonably draw any relevant conclusions from this data
8759734 after eight or 11 miles it reverts to being a completely normal gasoline electric hybrid which means you get about a 25 30 percent fuel savings but the point is they do burn fuel
8759735 a plug in hybrid with a limited range is a very nice thing to have
8759736 its wonderful that toyota is working on this if they have some test fleets out next year thats great but its not the same thing as a chevy volt which is not a plug in hybrid
8759737 the christian teaching on abortion throughout history is unchanged catholics who support so called abortion rights support a false right promote a culture of death
8759738 the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8759739 misrepresented the history and nature of the authentic teaching of the catholic church against abortion
8759740 human life from the moment of conception is to always be respected treated with dignity and protected
8759741 catholics who support so called abortion rights support a false right promote a culture of death
8759742 out of respect for the teaching of jesus christ and the church
8759743 any catholic who supports abortion rights has placed himself or herself outside of visible unity with the church and thus should refrain from receiving holy communion
8759744 the church has taught for centuries that life begins at conception and there is no room for misrepresentation of that teaching
8759745 in addition modern medical techniques have been able to confirm what the church has already known
8759746 surely there may be some catholic politicians who will take a different interpretation of this church doctrine during the coming election campaign but speaker pelosis remarks underscore once again the need for catholics and especially catholic politicians to form their consciences according to the moral truths taught by the catholic church
8759747 it is unacceptable that in a nation that is as prosperous as ours that 37 3 million people including 13 3 million children continue to live in poverty
8759748 at 12 5 the poverty rate indicates that reducing poverty is not a priority for this nation
8759749 this unacceptable figure represents the millions of families we see each and every day who are struggling just to make ends meet
8759750 across our nation catholic charities agencies are seeing more and more people having to choose between putting food on the table paying their utility bills or making their rent or mortgage payments
8759751 needing help with food rent clothing and prescriptions are all symptoms of much larger problems facing the poor and vulnerable in america such as low wages and the lack of affordable housing and health care
8759752 in this election year candidates for public office especially our presidential candidates must move from rhetoric to action and propose comprehensive plans to address the needs of more than 37 million people living in poverty in the united states over the next decade
8759753 we call on all americans to ask their candidates if elected what will you do to address poverty

8759757 we have the lip glossed heaving breasted newsbreak girl who gives us up to the minute convention coverage
8759758 we take on democrats and republicans but the republicans are here so theyre going probably to get the brunt of it
8759759 we really push the envelope theres going to be stuff we try to take to the edge
8759760 we support a human life amendment to the constitution and we endorse legislation to make clear that the fourteenth amendments protections apply to unborn children
8759761 we applaud the republican party and especially the members of the platform committee representing grassroots pro life republicans across the country for making such a strong and unequivocal stand supporting life at all stages
8759762 the work of the platform committee makes clear in no uncertain terms that the republican party is the pro life party
8759763 faithful to the first guarantee of the declaration of independence we assert the inherent dignity and sanctity of all human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed we support a human life amendment to the constitution and we endorse legislation to make clear that the fourteenth amendments protections apply to unborn children we oppose using public revenues to promote or perform abortion and will not fund organizations which advocate it we support the appointment of judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity and dignity of innocent human life
8759764 we have made progress the supreme court has upheld prohibitions against the barbaric practice of partial birth abortion states are now permitted to extend health care coverage to children before birth and the born alive infants protection act has become law this law ensures that infants who are born alive during an abortion receive all treatment and care that is provided to all newborn infants and are not neglected and left to die we must protect girls from exploitation and statutory rape through a parental notification requirement
8759765 we all have a moral obligation to assist not to penalize women struggling with the challenges of an unplanned pregnancy at its core abortion is a fundamental assault on the sanctity of innocent human life women deserve better than abortion every effort should be made to work with women considering abortion to enable and empower them to choose life we salute those who provide them alternatives including pregnancy care centers and we take pride in the tremendous increase in adoptions that has followed republican legislative initiatives
8759766 respect for life requires efforts to include persons with disabilities in education employment the justice system and civic participation in keeping with that commitment we oppose the non consensual withholding of care or treatment from people with disabilities as well as the elderly and infirm just as we oppose euthanasia and assisted suicide which endanger especially those on the margins of society
8759767 strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
8759768 the democrats have gone out of their way to alienate americas pro life majority by embracing the radical pro abortion agenda of barack obama
8759769 the republican party has once again demonstrated that it is completely in line with the majority of americans who oppose the vast majority of abortions
8759770 no woman will abort unless she has a sense of abandonment and rejection
8759771 nobody talks about the 21 conclusive studies that show that abortion and breast cancer are linked
8759772 you need to be a pastor and talk to the women who are still hearing heartbeats who are still traumatized
8759773 and the ethnic group that is hurting the most is the one that supports your party the most
8759774 speaker pelosis outrageous attempt to present what she considers the teaching of the catholic church regarding abortion is simply wrong and should be disregarded by every faithful catholic
8759775 speaker pelosis outrageous attempt to present what she considers the teaching of the catholic church regarding abortion is simply wrong and should be disregarded by every faithful catholic
8759776 the teachings of the church on abortion are consistent and unambiguous and it is very disturbing to hear someone who claims to be a catholic distort these teachings and sow seeds of confusion among the faithful by attempting to relativize the right to life
8759777 house speaker nancy pelosi stepped out of her political role and completely misrepresented the teaching of the catholic church in regard to abortion
8759778 i hear it all the time what about after the baby gets here well if i need a grant if i need an education if i need help i first have to get here
8759779 in the last 28 years we have seen huge differences and divisiveness on the issue of abortion in many situations quite frankly that issue alone has elected a member of congress to the house or a member of congress to the u s senate
8759780 its time that we take the politics out of abortion
8759781 for me it is time that the debate moves to a different level and that different level is the bill that we have introduced both republicans and democrats that will help reduce the number of abortions by up to 95 percent over the next 10 years
8759782 it is a blessing to know that at least for the first time our democratic party has made reducing abortions a major part of the democratic party platform
8759783 seventy percent believe that an abortion takes a life thats pretty startling
8759784 im excited that democrats at this convention are listening to those of us who believe that we have to champion the unborn child
8759785 the pregnant women support act is critical to achieving that
8759786 in 1973 nearly nine percent of births resulted in adoption by the year 2000 that had dropped to one percent why is that
8759787 democrats who are pro life democrats make a difference in our platform
8759788 argentina flaunts the dubious merit of being the first country in history to judge its victorious soldiers

8759792 nigeria is never entering into any agreement with iran for any matter that has to do with weapons
8759793 there shouldnt be a misunderstanding between exploration or uses of energy to provide power and the uses of energy for weapons so that our relationship with iran will not be misconstrued by nigerians and the entire international community

8759797 i met the oldest child but not the others which my mother said was crazy to accept the job without meeting all the kids so well see
8759798 if you are fundamentally unhappy with your life you will be more unhappy if you take this job so do us all a favor and get some treatment or move to the rockies but do not apply for employment with us

8759807 russian is moving forward altering the post soviet 1991 borders with unpredictable results
8759808 there is no place in todays world for attempts to redraw boundaries of our international order unless confronted by the international community russian policies will eventually force another conflict elsewhere
8759809 a unilateral attempt to redraw the borders of a neighboring country through the use of force
8759810 indeed this is the perfect and complete glorification of god when one does not exult in his own righteousness but recognizing oneself as lacking true righteousness to be justified by faith alone in christ
8759811 therefore says the pelagian he foreknew who would be holy and immaculate by the choice of free will and on that account elected them before the foundation of the world in that same foreknowledge of his in which he foreknew that they would be such therefore he elected them says he before they existed predestinating them to be children whom he foreknew to be holy and immaculate certainly he did not make them so nor did he foresee that he would make them so but that they would be so let us then look into the words of the apostle and see whether he chose us before the foundation of the world because we were going to be holy and immaculate or in order that we might be so blessed says he be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us in all spiritual blessing in the heavens in christ even as he hath chosen us in himself before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and unspotted eph i 3 not then because we were to be so but that we might be so assuredly it is certain assuredly it is manifest certainly we were to be such for the reason that he has chosen us predestinating us to be such by his grace
8759812 indeed this is the perfect and complete glorification of god when one does not exult in his own righteousness but recognizing oneself as lacking true righteousness to be justified by faith alone in christ
8759813 we really need to get rid of this item so lets try to sell more of it
8759814 we actually made this from scratch right here the way you would at home
8759815 everything here is made as if back in the day
8759816 i couldnt find a restaurant where the food is for real so i decided i would just do my own
8759817 the meat itself is just good you dont have to do anything to it
8759818 my case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subjected to over a long period by the present commissioner sir ian blair
8759819 long honourable and occasionally blood stained record on the championing of diversity
8759820 in short i think it is long past time we shut up stop making public statements about a private dispute and get on with the job we are paid to do
8759821 i do not think it was appropriate for this matter to be conducted in such a public way
8759822 we are pushing this material to uk media channels eg a bbc radio programme exposing tensions between aq leadership and supporters
8759823 i want to see year on year improvements like teachers across the country i have high expectations for all children there are no quick fixes but more can be done especially for children who are really struggling with basic literacy and numeracy and for those children who with a bit of help could reach the next level up
8759824 it is vital that children get the basics early in primary school but the results for seven year olds are flatlining
8759825 there must be a much greater focus on early identification of these problems and more one to one support for children with basic literacy and numeracy problems
8759826 the rise in performance across the key stages once again highlights that wales is making positive progress under our revised assessment arrangements
8759827 our focus is very much on consolidating progress made to date and building on it for the future the new skills based curriculum implementation of the foundation phase and developments at 14 to 19 will all help to ensure that our achievements are sustained and developed
8759828 is likely to be limited while overall confidence in economic and housing conditions is low
8759829 we are going to see much more dramatic drops in output
8759830 the fears that i have expressed over the last six months have started to come to fruition ive obviously voted on quite a number of occasions now for small quarter point cuts but we need to act and we probably need to act in larger amounts than that we need to actually get ahead of the game and it appears that we are now behind
8759831 with the economy set to contract over the next year the outlook for the housing market remains bleak
8759832 what began as a fall in prices is fast becoming a housing crash the governments public dithering over whether to offer a stamp duty holiday is making a bad problem worse
8759833 compared with other forecasters nationwide is usually conservative in its predictions of house price falls so when it tells us there is a big fall we know something very serious is happening all the signs are that we are at the beginning and not the end of a very painful process rather than dithering over crackpot schemes to prop up the housing market the government must act to help the many thousands in danger of losing their homes
8759834 in circumstances which give rise to a reasonable suspicion that possession is for a purpose connected with the commission preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism
8759835 the truth is that the tories change in language has touched a nerve reflecting a big gap in our own political narrative yet beneath camerons rhetoric lies the basic philosophy that failed britain in the past the tories demand responsibility without offering support they appeal for fraternity without any real belief in equality they have finally noticed society but remain implacably hostile to the state
8759836 the political language deployed by the opposition should also prompt us in the labour party to refresh our core story after 11 years in government
8759837 the danger is that we spend too much time emphasising what works and not enough making the case for what matters this is a trap all governing parties face even ken livingstone the archetypal insurgent became weighed down by incumbency in seeking a third term in office
8759838 the next agenda must be forged through starting with the pressures and the struggles that people face in their own lives at its most basic this means a clearer story about two things the limits of the market and the new frontiers of the welfare state old labour was hostile to the market new labour has arguably been too deferential to it
8759839 these figures show just how reliant the labour party is on the unions to stave off bankruptcy with the labour party divided and gordon brown vying for the title of britains weakest ever prime minister it is clear that ordinary donors are deserting brown and labours union paymasters are calling the shots
8759840 while we welcome the unions support it would be wrong to suggest that they are the sole source of the partys funding or that their financial support in any way gains them any undue influence in policy making trade union funding of political parties is the most open transparent and regulated of all party funding and is in stark contrast to the shadowy funding arrangements of the tories
8759841 most people are unaware of the various asian migrations to latin america and how it helped to shape the latino and latin american cultures
8759842 we will examine a lot of the asian influences within the diverse latino cultures this celebration combines the efforts of the lcc various purdue departments and many different community organizations in planning and sponsoring different events
8759843 i do think the american automobile business is deserving of government loan guarantees because the financial institutions in the u s are so stressed out right now
8759844 the acquisition of postpath complements our strategy to develop an integrated collaboration platform designed for how we work today and into the future providing real productivity gains and a more satisfying user experience

8759864 quicksilver improved performance by 250 at less than 1 20th the response time took up 1 5th the floor space and required only 55 of the power and cooling
8759865 performance improvements of this magnitude can have profound implications for business allowing two to three times the work to be completed in a given time frame for time sensitive applications like reservations systems and financial program trading systems and creating opportunity for entirely new insights in information warehouses and analytics solutions
8759866 the bbb processed a total of 5377 complaints about this company in the last 36 months our standard reporting period of the total of 5377 complaints closed in 36 months 1853 were closed in the last year

8759870 interesting to read all of the comments that individuals have that may not have been effected by this
8759871 our lives are so busy we were going out to dinner and getting take out constantly we decided to try your service after we saw your location when yes we were eating out a restaurant nearby we went online and found that your menus were quite pleasing to us as adults as well as sounded good for the kids age 13 amp 10 we decided to give it a try not only was the food yummy but guess what we as a family have lost 50 lbs by eating at home together and not spending all that money on dining out we bring the kids to make the meals and they see what is going in and realize its normal food not just a fancy name they dont understand thanks for making my life easier and healthier
8759872 i have to go down every aisle in the store
8759873 you cant feel the pleasure of the treasure without pressure
8759874 our previous email security solution was proving difficult to administer and costs were spiralling due to the hours we were wasting on managing security
8759875 since switching to sophoss appliances the it team has cut its security administration time by 99 percent leaving more time to deal with other non security issues since our employees now rarely receive any spam in their inboxes users are safe from the dangers of malicious or inappropriate links
8759876 prior to installing the sophos solution our employees used to waste time surfing the web
8759877 now weve got much greater control over the network enabling us to block or re categorise inappropriate sites in a matter of seconds and eliminate unnecessary time wasting its a really accessible and valuable piece of technology
8759878 it can be a bit scary to put all your security eggs into one basket but this one was easy over the years sophos has demonstrated dedication to support and customer service
8759879 combined with a suite of products and services which are easy to use and manage we felt very comfortable
8759880 we have specified the biometric site access turnstile here at derwenthaugh and it promises to offer substantial health amp safety benefits we know that everyone on site is aware of our safety policy and in the event of an emergency we can advise authorities if everyone has assembled at the muster point or if workers are missing the new biometric system means we can operate without the need for static security guards to check workers documentation
8759881 previously both wireless security and infrastructure vendors have focused on protecting the connection and the back end network while the perimeter where attacks cannot be detected has remained undefended
8759882 rf barrier mounts a strong defense by blocking signals from the designated wireless network from being effectively decoded outside the perimeter for example a retailer need no longer worry about the bleeding of its financial data beyond the walls of the building from legacy devices that dont support the newest and most advanced security standards as the first solution to provide cost effective perimeter wireless protection rf barrier can greatly expand the network managers confidence in the security of both legacy and modern wireless networks
8759883 our nokia wi fi smart phones handle sensitive voice calls as well as confidential emails and contact information
8759884 with our warehouse adjacent to an interstate highway and other major roads no one is comfortable with blasting a wi fi signal all over the place rf barrier lets us decide exactly where we want to draw the border around the coverage area and we know that the information stops right here and we can keep our infrastructure tuned to maximum power without worrying about the consequences of signal bleeding rf barrier dramatically reduces the risk of parking lot type security attacks and means we wont have to make excuses to management later

8759943 its not entirely clear whether he wants to create a movie about the creators of facebook boring or the actual users of the service more boring but neither sound like a good idea

8759963 there is no test for those who are asymptomatic because its not clear that would give us any information that would be helpful nor is there any therapy that would be offered

8759970 after numerous discussions around the league we officially released marcus this afternoon
8759971 this is a painful day because of our affection for marcus who is certainly a class act
8759972 we did everything humanly possible to trade marcus which would have allowed him to play under the conditions of his contract with us unfortunately we werent able to make that happen
8759973 while this concludes one chapter with marcus and the saskatchewan roughriders we have discussed the possibility of him remaining with our organization in a different capacity
8759974 its also very possible marcus will choose to play for another team in our league regardless though of what decisions marcus and mona make we wish them and their family the very best
8759975 they were unloading the grain and at some point it was realized that the boys at least one of them anyway was trapped in the grain

8759977 these young children cant foresee danger the way we see it its the responsibility of the parents to make sure their children arent exposed to dangerous situations that occur on a farm on a daily basis
8759978 just how much longer do you think environmentalists can strike deals that give up half of large wilderness ecosystems to industrial development for vague promises of protection simply more ecologically attuned folks know no more natural habitats can be lost and expect to survive climate change
8759979 the only meaningful forest protection is to work to keep all ancient primary forests standing and to meet needs for forest products from secondary forests regenerating into old growth there is no chance of achieving global ecological sustainability until ecological destruction ends what remains is fully protected and restoration begins
8759980 you cant present yourselves as cutting edge selfless and knowledgeable forest protestors and be routinely cutting deals to turn over millions of acres of ancient forests to fatcat loggers and miners
8759981 giving up on half of canadas boreal forests for a pocket full is mumbles is not the role of the rainforest action network members or donors they have no authority or expertise to be pursuing such deals
8759982 i was one of the original h o g members my card number is 9663 it was only four digits and we have over a million members now so you do the math

8759984 harley owners group really is about riding motorcycles and having fun its as simple as that

8759987 and people make fun of the way george bush talks all the time
8759988 hillary was incredible last night she was positive passionate and persuasive in her support of obama there were so many wonderful touching and funny moments i didnt just tear up during the tribute video i sobbed the part where chealsea said that the next generation should move ahead but not forget whos shoulders were standing on i couldnt have been happier as a clinton supporter at that moment and finally i managed to make it through the post msnbc review without wanting to break my tv they were glowing in their review of her speech amp while that doesnt make up for how they treated her through the campaign it was still very nice to hear also im tired of hearing about those bitter hysterical women who cant get over hillarys loss where are they im not convinced they really even exist other than the ones the media searches out just to make all clinton supporters look crazy im just so tired of hearing about it i mean i was a fervent hillary supporter as many of you prob remember but ive donated to obamas campaign wearing a pin on my bag amp planning to go campaign down in va when im home this weekend and later in the month will do what i can from nyc but were not exactly a swing state every hillary supporter i personally know feels the same way the stakes are way too high amp hillary agrees
8759989 well obviously the best way to fight misogyny is to vote a misogynist into the presidency
8759990 did they miss the whole speech last night did they miss the parts about unity getting behind obama and what john mccain is going to do to this country how selfish egotistical and self centered do you have to be to ignore the voice of the woman you voted for
8759991 what message will the democrats take away from pumas voting republican that they must continue moving further to the right
8759992 women are like tea bags they never know how strong they are until theyre in hot water
8759993 we have to educate these women who are disappointed hillary didnt win
8759994 we have to help them to understand whats at stake we cant have mccain appointing two supreme court vacancies
8759995 i wanted to address the issue of voting for mccain because it doesnt make sense to many of you and i can only speak for myself i dont like mccain but i will vote for him in protest of the democratic party for not running a woman at all because it is my revolt against them i know that mccains policies are worse for women but that is the sacrifice that i am willing to make sometimes things have to get worse before they get better if i can survive bush for 8 years i can survive mccain i want the democratic party to realize that they are nothing without the womans vote and not just roll over and be happy with what they give us and continue to treat women like second class citizens
8759996 haddall 75 east village reply to in perfect condition great draw spaces deepening at base idth 35 1 2
8759997 we believe we must also be willing to consider using military force in circumstances beyond self defense in order to provide for the common security that underpins global stability to support friends participate in stability and reconstruction operations or confront mass atrocities
8759998 god glorifying christ edifying scripture honoring way of thinking about evolution
8759999 we live in a world today that is very different from the world that our instincts evolved to deal with
