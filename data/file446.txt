4460000 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4460001 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4460002 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4460003 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4460004 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4460005 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4460006 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4460007 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4460008 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4460009 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4460010 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4460011 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4460012 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4460013 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4460014 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4460015 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4460016 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4460017 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4460018 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4460019 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4460020 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4460021 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4460022 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4460023 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4460024 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4460025 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4460026 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4460027 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4460028 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4460029 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4460030 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4460031 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4460032 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4460033 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

4460052 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4460053 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other

4460055 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4460056 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4460057 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4460058 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4460059 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4460060 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves

4460062 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
4460063 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4460064 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4460065 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4460066 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4460067 before the decade is out to put a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth
4460068 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4460069 it would be impossible to solely credit the surge for the turn around
4460070 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4460071 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4460072 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4460073 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4460074 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
4460075 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
4460076 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
4460077 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
4460078 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
4460079 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
4460080 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
4460081 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
4460082 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
4460083 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
4460084 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
4460085 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
4460086 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
4460087 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
4460088 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
4460089 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
4460090 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
4460091 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
4460092 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
4460093 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4460094 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4460095 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4460096 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4460097 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4460098 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4460099 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4460100 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4460101 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4460102 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4460103 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4460104 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4460105 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4460106 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4460107 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4460108 we began collecting carbon credits from afforestation projects or new tree plantings in the fall of 2007

4460111 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4460112 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4460113 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4460114 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4460115 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4460116 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4460117 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4460118 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4460119 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
4460120 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
4460121 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work

4460126 washington defense secretary robert m gates will endorse a 20 billion plan to substantially increase the size of afghanistan s army and will also restructure the military command of american and nato forces in response to the growing taliban threat senior pentagon and military officials said thursday
4460127 taken together the two decisions are an acknowledgment of shortcomings that continue to hinder nato and american led operations in afghanistan with the war in iraq still an obstacle to any immediate american troop increase in afghanistan the plan was described by officials as an attempt to increase allied and afghan capabilities in advance of deploying the additional american brigades that mr gates and his commanders agree are necessary

4460129 the soviet union citing the 1978 treaty of friendship cooperation and good neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries intervened on december 24 1979 over 100 000 soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100 000 plus and by members of the parcham faction amin was killed and replaced by babrak karmal the soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600 000 to 2 million afghan civilians over five million afghans fled their country to pakistan iran and other parts of the world faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides the soviets withdrew in 1989
4460130 nato took command of the nationwide mission to stabilize afghanistan in 2006 the allies expected to face little direct combat and to focus on reconstruction and on maintaining security in areas that were relatively calm in contrast the american led mission in afghanistan has focused from the start of the war on combat operations to capture or kill insurgents and terrorists as well as on training afghan security forces counter insurgency and reconstruction
4460131 yup but it would be much cheaper to just buy the opium crop
4460132 meanwhile the taliban managed to nearly eradicate the majority of the opium production by 2001
4460133 as much as one third of afghanistans gdp comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including opium and its two derivatives morphine and heroin as well as hashish production opium production in afghanistan has soared to a new record in 2007
4460134 it should be noted that operation enduring freedom afghanistan which is a joint us and afghan operation is separate from the isaf international security assistance force isaf which is an operation of nato nations including the usa the two operations run in parallel and although has been intended that they merge for some time this has not yet happened
4460135 i ask are we in fact at war with radical islam world wide and if so just say it
4460136 obamas popularity is not because of his race but in spite of it he is popular because of his charisma enthusiasm vision energy convictions and because of the confidence and hope that emanate from his persona
4460137 his stated policies are potentially extremely destructive and foolish such as massive tax increases and protectionism
4460138 it is our business however to go after terrorist enemies of the united states and our nato allies wherever we find them
4460139 it is this intensely emotional response to obama that is such a concern his followers love him with the zeal of cult members without bothering to discuss policy
4460140 what i am now is a citizen of a country that was attacked by people who flew commercial airplanes into buildings and i think we need to keep that in mind
4460141 but none of obamas supporters bothered to discover the facts which are readily available
4460142 is this e mail real it says no it is a bogus bunch of bird droppings
4460143 principles often take a back seat when there is a substantial economic consideration
4460144 youre using the obama campaign site as a reference for his tax policies
4460145 q would obama tax my profits if i sell my home would he tax my ira would he tax my water
4460146 i think the most reasonable take is that obama is probably doing just fine
4460147 like you said that left us no choice but to intervene destroy the training camps and remove the taleban from power since it was fairly clearly that they were in cahoots with al qaeda
4460148 all of that schoolgirl frenzy is frightening because there is no place for logic or thought
4460149 not that i am denying the possibility of it being a great conspiracy either
4460150 you sound like the republican version of a yellow dog democrat you spout nothing but republican cant
4460151 for bin laddin to keep getting volunteers something has to be causing them to join what do you suppose it could be
4460152 perhaps you use the self promotional material of a candidate to make decisions about their policies i preefer not to
4460153 some of his stated policies my emphasis are potentially extremely destructive and foolish
4460154 in the islamic world by their standards people who are called moderates are indistinguishable from terrorists by ours
4460155 the mere presence of an iraq run by friendly to the us and containing us troops is anathema to iranian fundamentalism and its desires for the iraqi south and the holiest shrines of the shia imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
4460156 it may be ifficult for you to understand iran and islamic facism is the nazi threat of this century
4460157 among the most disturbing political phenomena of our time is the emergence in the newly created state of israel of the freedom party herut a political party closely akin in its organization method political philosophy and social appeal to the nazi and fascist parties
4460158 hitlers legal power was based upon the enabling act which was passed quite legally by the reichstag and which allowed the fuehrer and his representatives in plain language to be what they wanted or in legal language to issue regulations having the force of law exactly the same type of act was passed by the knesset israelis parliament immediately after the 1967 conquest granting the israeli governor and his representatives the power of hitler which they use in hitlerian manner
4460159 but go ahead ed subscribe to the neville chamberlen nelson mandela jimmy carter theory of appeasement
4460160 jewish villages were built in the place of arab villages you do not even know the names of these arab villages and i do not blame you because geography books no longer exist not only do the books not exist the arab villages are not there either nahlal arose in the place of mahlul kibbutz gvat in the place of jibta kibbutz sarid in the place of huneifis and kefar yehushua in the place of tal al shuman there is not a single place built in this country that did not have a former arab population
4460161 we will have to face the reality that israel is neither innocent nor redemptive and that in its creation and expansion we as jews have caused what we historically have suffered a refugee population in diaspora
4460162 when we followers of the prophetic judaism returned to palestine the majority of jewish people preferred to learn from hitler rather than from us
4460163 imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
4460164 you conviently forget israel won the land when they were attacked in 48 67
4460165 spirit the penniless population across the frontier by denying it employment both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly
4460166 between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal if the arabs are in this small country there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to neighboring countries all of them not one village not one tribe should be left

4460168 i think a two by four will work just fine i just need to apply it a little less sparingly
4460169 question on my part as in israel and palistine i am ill informed is the current thinking in israel the same as in 1895 and 1940 respectfully
4460170 the zionist movement arose in late nineteenth century europe influenced by the nationalist ferment sweeping that continent zionism acquired its particular focus from the ancient jewish longing for the return to zion and received a strong impetus from the increasingly intolerable conditions facing the large jewish community in tsarist russia the movement also developed at the time of major european territorial acquisitions in asia and africa and benefited from the european powers competition for influence in the shrinking ottoman empire one result of this involvement with european expansionism however was that the leaders of the nascent nationalist movements in the middle east viewed zionism as an adjunct of european colonialism moreover zionist assertions of the contemporary relevance of the jews historical ties to palestine coupled with their land purchases and immigration alarmed the indigenous population of the ottoman districts that comprised palestine the jewish community yishuv rose from 6 percent of palestines population in 1880 to 10 percent by 1914 although the numbers were insignificant the settlers were outspoken enough to arouse the opposition of arab leaders and induce them to exert counter pressure on the ottoman regime to prohibit jewish immigration and land buying
4460171 an independent individual who does not go along with a group or party
4460172 how about compensation for jews kicked out all over the world
4460173 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
4460174 for mainstream american blacks the vast majority of churches have hebrew names
4460175 infered black muslim bho fit with this jew hatred or kinda love maybe here
4460176 the majority of black americans are unaware of the complexity of the meaning of israel to american jews but ironically afro zionists have as an intense an emotional identification with africa and with the third world as american jews have with israel doubly ironic this same intensity of identification with a motherland seems rooted in the mythologies common to both groups in this special sense in the spiritual sense implied by zion and diaspora and promised land maybe black americans are americas jews but given the isolation of black americans from any meaningful association with africa extensions of the mythology would be futile we have no distant homeland preparing an ingathering
4460177 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
4460178 considering the circumstances the best thing the palestinians could do is accept their fate and negotiate an agreement leading to the creation of a sovereign nation encompassing th gaza strip and west bank
4460179 why should any citizens be carrying guns and why one group but not the other are the arabs more of a threat to the jews than the jews are to the arabs
4460180 the real point as noticed here by one of americas most prominent one man bloggers is that the brits are actually leading the way in pointing out to the world that american faults are generally over reported and american strengths under reported
4460181 this article on zionism and its impact by ann m lesch
4460182 even if evidence does not link iraq directly to the attack any strategy aiming at the eradication of terrorism and its sponsors must include a determined effort to remove saddam hussein from power in iraq failure to undertake such an effort will constitute an early and perhaps decisive surrender in the war on international terrorism

4460191 if they show an increasing indifference to the value of palestinian lives even shooting innocent civilians deliberately and criminally it is to be expected not that it is excusable but it is understandable
4460192 it is to be expected not that it is excusable but it is understandable
4460193 the fact that so many of the hedgies are doing the same thing and indeed conceivably not infrequently are on either side of a trade combined with the heavy use of leverage and their hyperactive trading add up to a potentially explosive investment mix
4460194 could trigger a rapid liquidation the great unwind across many asset classes with unpleasant consequences for investment banks hedge fund investors and possibly a systemic impact for securities markets
4460195 that last paragraph by ma2 275 was snotty and uncalled for in my opinion
4460196 the only thing in the way is the difficulty of uniting so many different nations with different languages to a common purpose
4460197 if they show an increasing indifference to the value of palestinian lives even shooting innocent civilians deliberately and criminally it is to be expected not that it is excusable but it is understandable
4460198 it is to be expected not that it is excusable but it is understandable

4460204 nuclear energy well that was theorized by a lot of work put together by europeans but it didnt really amount to much until 1943 when they came together in chicago in the manhattan project

4460206 the ussr put the first satelite sputnik in orbit in 1957 a basketball with a radio transmitter inside that went beep beep

4460208 and of course most of the rest of world relies on european research for their own technological acheivements
4460209 and why should we care the palestinians celebrated the world trade center attacks
4460210 most power in europe is around 230 or 240 volts
4460211 what was lacking was israeli political will they still think after forty years that they can drive the owners from their homes

4460213 about 500 people nearly all of them palestinians killed in israeli raids and more than half of those armed militants have died in violence since the troubled israeli palestinian peace process was revived in november 2007

4460219 palestinian arabs and israeli jews tell two very different stories about the events of 1948
4460220 what have the palestinians or the gulf states given in reperations
4460221 by way of introduction the obvious cannot be overstressed here namely that israel is the occupier and therefore the aggressor while the palestinians are the occupied and therefore the victims paradoxically this fact is hardly ever even taken into consideration by western politicians thus ignoring the fundamental element of the conflict needless to say attempting to solve this conflict without differentiating between the aggressor israel and the victimized the palestinians will never lead to permanent peace
4460222 a native people is a standing reproach to any coloniser
4460223 isreal is the victim here and the only party involved who keeps their word
4460224 a native people is a standing reproach to any coloniser
4460225 i and the public know what all schoolchildren learn those to whom evil is done do evil in return
4460226 we should prepare to go over to the offensive our aim is to smash lebanon trans jordan and syria the weak point is lebanon for the moslem regime is artificial and easy for us to undermine we shall establish a christian state there and then we will smash the arab legion eliminate trans jordan syria will fall to us we then bomb and move on and take port said alexandria and sinai
4460227 if i were an arab leader i would never sign an agreement with israel it is normal we have taken their country it is true god promised it to us but how could that interest them our god is not theirs there has been anti semitism the nazis hitler auschwitz but was that their fault they see but one thing we have come and we have stolen their country why would they accept that
4460228 the most grievous expression of the situation in the occupied territories under olmert and barak is the daily killing
4460229 in the end the so called palestinians are all doomed
4460230 israel has offered a peace deal to the palestinians which would annex 7 3 of the west bank and keep the largest settlements israeli reports say
4460231 meanwhile more folk die while desperately trying to break the fairs fair
4460232 the character of the provisional palestinian state will be determined through negotiations between the palestinian authority and israel the provisional state will have provisional borders and certain aspects of sovereignty be fully demilitarized with no military forces but only with police and internal security forces of limited scope and armaments be without the authority to undertake defense alliances or military cooperation and israeli control over the entry and exit of all persons and cargo as well as of its air space and electromagnetic spectrum
4460233 strange in 1945 there was no israel either so whats your point that israel does not exist
4460234 the brits you spoke to are mistaken the problems in the middle east were started by the british and the french after world war one
4460235 as to where this policy of the british and later the americans originated we neednt look further than a series of meetings held in britain starting in 1905 headed by prime minister sir henry campbell bannerman from this a high committee was formed it specialized in matters of colonialism consisting of members from the participating states of leading historians social economic and agricultural analysts scholars geologists and experts in oil and gas the members of this committee met in london in 1907 the final decisions made by the conference were threefold 1 separating the muslim lands in the east from those in the west making their unity more difficult 2 planting a new enemy for the muslims on their lands in the first qiblah and the third of the holiest mosques this would draw their attention to a new enemy focusing all their energies on defeating him and in turn weakening their capability of resisting western aggression causing them to forget what occurred during the days of the crusades 3 establishing an advanced base for the disbelieving colonialists at the head of them britain to protect their interests implement their plans and schemes and ensuring the outflow of natural resources from the region as well as the import of their goods and products into the markets of the region the goal of the colonialist powers then and now is to keep arab peoples backwards by not enabling them to elect popular leaders and to control the vast mineral wealth that the arabs were fortune enough to possess
4460236 the sykes picot agreement concluded in 1916 divided the middle east into areas of influence for france great britain and others giving the french control over modern syria and lebanon

4460240 this policy to shoot first if there is the slightest doubt has rendered it almost impossible for us to do our jobs in gaza along with the rest of the international media
4460241 government spokesman mark regev said israel understood the role of an independent free press in a free society
4460242 these are situations that are faced internationally and we have got to find a better way to try to make sure journalists are not caught up in crossfire
4460243 these findings mean that a journalist with a camera is at risk of coming under fire and theres not that much that can be done thats unacceptable
4460244 sometime before the creation of israel england pulled back its support of a jewish settlement
4460245 the balfour declaration illustrates the contradictions in a single paragraph
4460246 his majestys government view with favour the establishment in palestine of a national home for the jewish people and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non jewish communities in palestine or the rights and political status enjoyed by jews in any other country
4460247 when the question of the british mandate over palestine was discussed in parliament it became clear that opinion in the house of lords was strongly opposed to the balfour policy as illustrated by the words of lord sydenham in reply to lord balfour
4460248 the harm done by dumping down an alien population upon an arab country arab all around in the hinterland may never be remedied what we have done is by concessions not to the jewish people but to a zionist extreme section to start a running sore in the east and no one can tell how far that sore will extend

4460281 that extra day is going to save me just a little bit of extra money
4460282 i spend 13 14 a day driving to and from work about 80 miles so its going to help out a lot
4460283 working those couple of extra hours means less time im in this traffic because by that time a lot of that rush hour traffic will be gone away and its clear sailing back up to cherokee county

4460302 domineering and abrasive his opponents accuse him of hoarding and abusing power and of running the nation through a clique that will neither tolerate dissent nor engage in dialogue with the opposition which he has repeatedly made clear he despises and considers weak the government also faces pressure from rising prices and high unemployment and over complaints about a weak judiciary that many government officials concede lacks independence and which the opposition says remains corrupt economic conditions remain difficult enough that many travel abroad for work

4460335 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4460336 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4460337 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4460338 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4460339 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4460340 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4460341 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world

4460370 thirty seven percent of colorado residents 50 65 years old have higher education degrees if you think about the generation from 22 35 only 35 percent have a higher education degree
4460371 we stand a chance of our children being less educated than we are and thats an absolute shame
4460372 and most of our competitors around the world would be ashamed to have the kind of grade inflation that we suffer from
4460373 we need to reach for a higher standard at every grade level we need to spend more time on tasks more time in school and we need to improve the quality of our teaching
4460374 but the time may not be used as usefully as it could be
4460375 instead of just putting a bunch of facts and numbers on the board and having your students memorize them
4460376 that 15 years from now when they want to get a job theyre going to be 25th in line if they dont improve their educational skills
4460377 this isnt about more dollars this is about fundamentally changing the way we deliver education to kids having higher expectations higher standards
4460378 million dollar lofts in a historical building would suggest that people are priviledged and want to maintain their privacy 06 25 but we do understand that were on a public park and thats one of the features and benefits of our building
4460379 exclusive in the sense of affirming the unique truth in the revelation of jesus christ but not in the sense of denying the possibility of salvation to those outside the christian faith inclusive in the sense of refusing to limit the saving grace of god to christians but not in the sense of viewing other religions as salvific pluralist in the sense of acknowledging the gracious work of god in the lives of all human beings but not in the sense of denying the unique and decisive nature of what god has done in jesus christ
4460380 there is a tension inherent in the christian faith between universality and particularity a tension between the belief that god loves the whole world universality and the belief that jesus is the only way to god particularity
4460381 i believe it would help us if we recognized the twin interdependent missions of son and spirit it reduces tension between universality and particularity and fosters a sense that they are complementary rather than contradictory the two poles turn out to be both and not either or
4460382 the life giving spirit breathed out by the father works in the world and in all of history
4460383 to you o people i call and my cry is to all that live
4460384 gods spirit and wisdom are at work everywhere their actions pervaded history from the beginning and continue to do so
4460385 grace is extant not only in christian contexts but in every place where the spirit is
4460386 the tension between universality and particularity is eased when we do justice to the twin mission of son and spirit the truth of the incarnation does not eclipse truth about the spirit who was at work in the world before christ and is present now where christ is not named the mission of the son is not a threat to the mission of the spirit or vice versa on the one hand the sons mission presupposes the was conceived and empowered by the spirit on the other hand the mission of the spirit is oriented to the goals of incarnation the spirits mission is to bring history to completion and fulfillment in christ thus the double mission of son and spirit canprovide the perspective we need to handle the tension of universality and particularity
4460387 exclusive in the sense of affirming the unique truth in the revelation of jesus christ but not in the sense of denying the possibility of salvation to those outside the christian faith inclusive in the sense of refusing to limit the saving grace of god to christians but not in the sense of viewing other religions as salvific pluralist in the sense of acknowledging the gracious work of god in the lives of all human beings but not in the sense of denying the unique and decisive nature of what god has done in jesus christ
4460388 there is a tension inherent in the christian faith between universality and particularity a tension between the belief that god loves the whole world universality and the belief that jesus is the only way to god particularity

4460394 the tension between universality and particularity is eased when we do justice to the twin mission of son and spirit the truth of the incarnation does not eclipse truth about the spirit who was at work in the world before christ and is present now where christ is not named the mission of the son is not a threat to the mission of the spirit or vice versa on the one hand the sons mission presupposes the was conceived and empowered by the spirit on the other hand the mission of the spirit is oriented to the goals of incarnation the spirits mission is to bring history to completion and fulfillment in christ thus the double mission of son and spirit canprovide the perspective we need to handle the tension of universality and particularity

4460558 its time for big corporations to pay their fair share
4460559 this year youll see an even bigger difference because of the economy
4460560 this year the sales tax holiday is sure to be much needed and much appreciated by families shopping for school clothes and fall wardrobes
4460561 the main benefit is the tax savings on top of the fact that retailers have aggressive promotions
4460562 the holiday is always a good incentive to bring shoppers back downtown and take advantage of great offers that a lot of the stores have
4460563 downtown has everything from national retailers like bass shoes factory outlet chicos izod van heusen and a number of independents like douglas mens store footsies ha bas cruz cortez intima boutique nefertiti and many more
4460564 were expecting big crowds for the holiday weekend especially with gas prices right now
4460565 we would expect that a lot of people in the houston metro area who might have traveled further will take advantage of having great beaches and shopping on galveston island
4460566 a sky est cortando o sinal da mtv em todo o brasil
4460567 weve heard what he edmondson has said and not all of us have the same mental picture of where hes going
4460568 so we decided that the best thing to do would be to meet with roger and ask him directly weve got a lot of investment weve got a lot at stake were all heavily invested in motorcycle racing and we want to see the sport grow
4460569 we have a lot of opinions none of them will be new to him
4460570 we track operators dont have a common position other than that motorcycle sports have to grow
4460571 the manufacturers have invested substantial amounts of money that are important for the sport to grow
4460572 if they are not in we will suffer our customers will suffer and the participants will suffer that obviously is a major issue
4460573 if theres no money who pays the name riders the people who attract the audience if no ones paying them what happens to them do they go to europe if they do theyre useless to us in terms of drawing a crowd you wouldnt even have the up and coming talent they wouldnt have a place to ride
4460574 if youve got 5000 spectators and theyre paying 30 you can do the math
4460575 now if youve got 50 000 spectators its a different story
4460576 my concern with dmg is that i dont see replacement money if the manufacturers go out not even a rumor of replacement money if dmgs position is that like nascar they have this huge body of non industry sponsors the national guards the subways and that moneys going back to promoters great but that doesnt exist right now and we cant afford to wait six seven eight years before that happens we understand what rogers goal is were concerned about getting there
4460577 now we have a schism and i wish to hell it hadnt happened because were so close to moving forward it comes down to the single issue of manufacturer money
4460578 its not that broke lets leave it in place through 2009 and lets start now making plans for 2010 lets give it time and time will be a great healer jointly well make it work nobodys right and nobodys wrong in this as long as its rational i dont care if my ideas are the ones that are implemented this is not about me even though i think some of my ideas might be successful now is not the time to bring them up
4460579 it just happens that the first question that were dealing with is the state of motorcycle road racing is going to be in 2009 and quite frankly we dont know
4460580 as much of an enthusiast as i am as a track owner i cant be an enthusiast
4460581 whatever we do has to have a rational basis even if we go into an event knowing were going to lose money we make a rational decision to lose money now to get it back later we have to run it as a commercial enterprise
4460582 i had the surgery and am sore right now but i am going to vir and will see how i feel saturday morning

4460584 the championship is always on my mind but my real goal is to get a podium at the rest of the races
4460585 ive never seen the track before but these types of tracks seem to suit me i learned racing on go kart tracks so the tight stuff has come natural hayden won the last time out so i want to stay in front of him and leandro because its important to finish in front of them for the championship
4460586 now that we have some time in we can see the progress the riders are making at the mid ohio race we were really able to see just how far every rider has come there were a lot of crashes and red flags in the other classes that weekend but our boys put on a great race with no crashes and everyones lap times were within about 2 5 seconds the riders are maturing and were put on a great show for the fans
4460587 am i miserable because i listen to pop music or do i listen to pop music because im miserable
4460588 am i blessed to see sacred connections because i listen to pop music or do i listen to pop music because i am blessed to see sacred connections

4460593 first you want to shake it around with lots of water

4460602 you hear stories like that and it keeps you going yknow the early prospectors only took about 25 per cent of this provinces gold wealth according to mineral surveys that means three quarters is still out there waiting for you and me
4460603 the worst day prospecting on a creek beats the best day at the office
4460604 every spring that snow melts and pushes the gold off the mountains and down the streams
4460605 that means every year you got a fresh crop of gold in there not too many people know that

4460675 maybe if id gone to a smaller kitchen and i was a bigger cog in a smaller wheel i wouldnt have felt the need to go down my own path and maybe i wouldnt have ended up this way
4460676 no i knew i wanted to have a restaurant but that was it when i opened i thought maybe one day id have a michelin star nine out of 10 in the good food guide is amazing the fat ducks score last year i thought theyd stopped doing tens a few years ago so it was the ambition i never had in terms of ratings this is almost like the last frontier its such a special thing because it came out of the blue
4460677 i was very very excited and slightly disbelieving i found out a couple of weeks ago but i couldnt tell anyone until last night it was a kiddy thing if i told somebody maybe it wouldnt happen

4460680 what do we want a restaurant to do feed us well memorably courteously and offer value for money the fat duck does all that and much more its great fun and it all adds up to a dining experience of the most wondrous enchantment
4460681 its extremely rare that a restaurant cooks perfectly on a consistent basis but weve had so many superlative reports that were delighted to recognise the fat duck as the best restaurant in britain
4460682 my first paid job as a chef was opening the fat duck when i look back on it i think naivety is a beautiful thing had i known what was going to come in the ensuing 5 or 6 years i wouldnt have had the guts to do it
4460683 we cant take our foot off the pedal we cant think that the fat ducks got a name and whatever we do is fine we cant ever think that way

4460689 and so when all are present in combination as part of this syndrome you have a situation where you dont even need to be as diabetic or hypertensive as you might otherwise have to be to experience erectile dysfunction and that fact has been raising concern among clinicians
4460690 so we followed up on case reports and anecdotal evidence that statins being used to lower cholesterol over a six to eight week period among patients with metabolic syndrome seemed to also quickly improve erections even before cholesterol levels go down

4460701 we look forward to explaining more fully our reasons for the decision and the careful review given not only by our staff but also by representatives from our member schools

4460711 dana came up to norfolk as an 18 year old and the coaches were very impressed with him
4460712 i think his expectations were a little high so he had to learn to battle through getting sent back down to norfolk last year
4460713 he wasnt happy with the season he had in norfolk and it left a sour taste in his mouth so i think hes determined to make amends this fall
4460714 when he went down to norfolk matts game kept rising and rising and they brought him up at the end of the season
4460715 our goalie coach jeff reese really likes karri and thinks he will be a good goaltender in this league
4460716 hes a battler very competitive and has the skills to go along with that so i feel hes shown that hes right there knocking on the door to be in the nhl on a full time basis
4460717 it was unfortunate that he got hurt the year after we drafted him but he did come back a little bit during the playoffs
4460718 i feel he made a wise move coming over to north america to play with seattle last year and he did have a productive year hes a little behind in his development since he missed a crucial year with the injury but he battled hard and is a talented kid so i feel hell be all right
4460719 i missed a whole year in finland so my thinking was i had to accelerate my progression and i knew i would be able to get in a lot of good games in the western hockey league and i did
4460720 i played over 40 games for the seattle thunderbirds in the regular season and that was pretty good i would have never seen that kind of action in europe so it really paid off for me in my development
4460721 after sitting out seven months with the shoulder injury i felt i really played well in seattle and it was a great year for me
4460722 i also got used to the north american game and the coaches and that was important i have every intention of earning a spot with tampa bays american hockey league affiliate norfolk this coming season
4460723 im ready for the season and ready to fight for a spot in the nhl or the ahl
4460724 it was unfortunate that he got hurt the year after we drafted him but he did come back a little bit during the whl playoffs
4460725 i feel he made a wise move coming over to north america to play with seattle last year and he did have a productive year hes a little behind in his development since he missed a crucial year with the injury but he battled hard and is a talented kid so i feel hell be all right
4460726 he already knew a lot about the north american game so he was able to help me and i feel i was able to help him as well jake showed me how to play a little deep on the bad angle shots and reminded me to be square to the puck
4460727 i had to get used to all the traffic and screens in front of the net and it was a lot harder to find the puck since guys were shooting from almost anywhere on the ice in europe players are looking for a better shooting lane or ways to pass the puck but over here theyre cutting hard for the rebounds so those were the things i had to learn
4460728 i couldnt have asked for a better goalie partner in seattle
4460729 we played together for one year and became best friends and i learned so much from him he really taught me how hard you must work in practice every single day to make an impression hes one of the hardest working players ive ever met
4460730 im the guy during a practice who will fight for every puck
4460731 that was a great experience and was maybe the biggest reason why i got drafted in the first round that summer
4460732 that team we had was together for three years so we were a really good group
4460733 when i think about being a first round pick i dont feel any added pressure but i like to think of it as a great opportunity and a great honor
4460734 its a chance for me to show this team that im capable of taking that spot in the nhl someday im a pretty laid back guy so i just try and work hard every day and hopefully thats enough to get the job done
4460735 it showed a side of her that made her very human

4460752 the book covers thoroughly all that is needed for a full understanding of reliability in terms of classical theory ross e traub manages to make clear the difference between reliability as a theoretical construct and methods of estimating it in practice in a useful chapter he proceeds to examine factors that may affect the reliability of a test including time limits test length item characteristics subjectively scored items and heterogeneity of the population taking the test the book is a useful reference for those with some understanding of reliability theory and would probably make a reasonable textbook including copious exercises for those studying the subject from scratch provided their mathematical background was adequate
4460753 there has been a huge improvement in water quality and this means we can introduce more salmon and sea trout into areas where they have not so far inhabited
4460754 these special fish are very valuable as they bring social economic and environmental benefits to local communities their sensitivity and need for a good quality environment means we need to work together with our partners to address the complex factors affecting them
4460755 the salmon and trout association very much welcomes the environment agencys new strategy especially the inclusion of sea trout we have been consulted at all stages during the evolution of the strategy which is an excellent example of the environment agency involving partners in a major project
4460756 actually i dont really know how i got the nickname

4460761 if we dont do this now carcass will be erased from the history of rock to a certain extent
4460762 theres so much access to information out there but it seems to me that the new generation of kids just really dont know sh they dont really know who black sabbath is never mind carcass theres definitely a generation of kids out there who are not aware of carcass because we havent been around for 15 years a year is a long time in metal these days
4460763 i guess over the last few years weve kind of drifted into each others circles again myself guitarist bill steer and mike and mikes kind of i dont want to over exaggerate this but hes always been the keenest to do this because since he formed arch enemy and has been out on the road again hes kind of realized what kind of phenomenon carcass is
4460764 mikes always been kind of hassling me and bill on the side about doing something and so i guess the stars aligned at some point because for years i said id never do it if drummer ken owen who suffered a brain hemorrhage in 1999 couldnt play i thought it would be a bit like led zeppelin playing without john bonham how can you kind of find a way around that
4460765 it seems to me nostalgia is the new rock and roll not to sound arrogant but im well aware of the importance of this band even if no one else is theres a generation of people who were into carcass whove grown up now that never saw the band and now they have some disposable income theyve created the demand for this reunion
4460766 never say never but i cant see it happening i cant see it working
4460767 for something like that to happen everybodys head has to be on the same continent
4460768 these bands that start playing again some of them get carried away and they write an album and they start saying its the best thing we ever done and then it just isnt we dont want to be one of those bands we dont want to be doing this next year i could maybe see us playing again in some of the countries that were not touching this year but lets see if we kill each other when were in north america on a tour bus were getting on great but we want to keep that chemistry and not get burned out we dont want to be doing it just for the money because it can turn into a chore thats what happened the first time it seemed like work and it wasnt fun anymore so i figured f this ill go get a job if youre doing something just for the money i think having a job is a bit more honest than playing in a band just for the money
4460769 its like everything just merges into one nowadays everythings sounding the same the problem with the modern metal scene is people are too busy copying bands wholesale and not actually taking an influence and doing something new with it i dont think its laziness i think it just comes down to imagination and intelligence
4460770 ozzy did it and even zakk wyldes done it playing with black label and ozzy

4460792 for years retailers have heard the frustration of their customers regarding indianas outdated alcohol laws now through the coalitions website there is a vehicle for these voices to be heard a place where everyday hoosiers can stand up to the powerful special interests that have successfully defended these self serving and archaic laws

4460808 i feel like credit card companies target us because we really have no financial awareness were barely out of our homes barely having experiences as adults and they throw these things at us and they dont make you aware of what youre signing into

4460825 i wanted to become connected with something that is well established
4460826 the way they run the business is top notch its as much about personalized service as it is about the food the staff chats with the customers and that sort of personal service goes a long way ive traveled all over the world skiing but moodys is one of my favorite hangouts its a place where you can go to decompress after a rough day
4460827 daron wanted to be part of the community hes a great role model and friend and we like the enthusiasm he brings to the table

4460831 yo personalmente culpo s lo al presidente de georgia mijail saakashvili de esta situaci n nosotros no hemos obtenido nada m s que culpas problemas y falsas acusaciones de l y de su gobierno
4460832 de alguna forma otros pa ses no escuchan lo que rusia tiene que decir rusia ha sido malinterpretada en occidente pero en alg n momento acabar n vi ndolo desde nuestro punto de vista
4460833 creo que rusia tiene raz n primero nosotros no empezamos esta guerra el mundo respeta a ee uu porque es fuerte nosotros debemos ser fuertes tambi n si queremos ganarnos el respeto por eso pienso que mi gobierno ha acertado
4460834 no es justo porque es rusia la que tuvo que lidiar con esta crisis creo que la gente en occidente deber a conocer la verdad y no sencillamente fiarse de lo que dice ee uu
4460835 sobre georgia escuchas hablar a diario en las noticias pero no estoy segura de lo que est pasando all es un tema para pol ticos
4460836 pero es obvio que me encanta putin y l sigue aqu con el presidente dmitry medvedev a n no sabemos del todo como es la situaci n parece simp tico y la vida ahora es mucho mejor para nosotros puedes venir a mosc y los salarios son buenos y es f cil encontrar trabajo
4460837 no puedo hablar en nombre de todos pero creo que luchar contra georgia es triste
4460838 en cuanto a la gente joven creo que nosotros y los estadounidenses somos muy parecidos queremos gran parte de las mismas cosas aunque quiz s nuestros pol ticos lo vean de forma distinta
4460839 rusia no plane este acto fue tomada por sorpresa y no tuvo otra opci n que intervenir en osetia del sur
4460840 el comportamiento estadounidense en georgia durante los ltimos a os y especialmente durante el ltimo mes es visto en mosc como muy provocativo ee uu anim a georgia a actuar quiz s no directamente pero as fue como lo interpret el se or saakashvili y washington ha dado ahora apoyo a los dirigentes georgianos en todos los frentes
4460841 ahora vemos las dos partes rusia y ee uu intentando demostrar que son fuertes estamos en la fase de guerra psicol gica entre washington y mosc esperemos que no crezca m s all de las palabras
4460842 no puedo creer que ee uu quiera volver a verse involucrado en un estancamiento militar con rusia con sus fuerzas bajo presi n en irak y afganist n
4460843 bush est a punto de terminar su gobierno y despu s de las elecciones tendremos la oportunidad de empezar de nuevo poco se conseguir con respeto a las discusiones con ee uu hasta entonces

4460856 each year sinn f in has published its financial statements for both the north and south
4460857 like all organisations a political party needs an income in order to cover its expenditures

4460875 people from all the countries weve looked at have increased levels of alcohol use when theyre traveling abroad theyre treating every night like a friday or saturday night the reality unfortunately is that the levels of drunkenness among britons are higher and thats led to some of the alcohol related problems were familiar with

4460878 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4460879 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4460880 this was a very big deal make no excuses for vmware it certainly had potential to completely disrupt a lot of customers at most it should have disabled vmotion and other extras but not starting a vm
4460881 when i look at aidens friends and i see some of them married and have a family i would imagine that would have been the way aiden was
4460882 life would have been very different for all of us
4460883 at the time you just couldnt sit about and feel sorry for yourself
4460884 furthermore the event will recognise the tremendous steps which have been made by individuals and by the community as a whole in rebuilding lives in our town and a key element of the ceremony will be a communal dedication to peace
4460885 these figures are likely to disproportionately represent the mood of officers who have more disposable income to spend on politics than do the lower ranks but because young people tend to be more liberal than their elders the total dollar figures could lean even more in obamas favor
4460886 ryan has worked diligently over the past two years to research proven and innovative ways to provide our employees greater balance between work and life

4460888 politics isnt jamie foxx and jennifer garner ask the kingdom stars a question
4460889 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4460890 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4460891 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4460892 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4460893 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4460894 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4460895 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4460896 im relieved that i got the grades i needed to get into durham
4460897 i can now concentrate fully on preparing myself in australia this winter for the two forthcoming world cups its a great opportunity for me and one i will relish
4460898 it was tough combining my cricket with studying for the exams but something i knew i had to do and im just pleased that all my hard work has paid off
4460899 my son was outside with the dog and saw flames coming from the bedroom
4460900 firefighters arrived on scene and found a heavy fire on the second floor
4460901 i was a 19 year old who never had a dream come true
4460902 there i was when the referee stopped the fight and declared me the winner i couldnt believe it
4460903 am i dreaming i didnt know whether to smile or cry you hear the national anthem in the background i was the happiest ive ever been as an athlete
4460904 i thought i had literally been rescued from the gutter and given a second chance with the job corps program
4460905 so when i won the olympic gold medal it was time to take out that flag hey heres where im from but a lot of people didnt like it i was patriotic at that time and it wasnt in style
4460906 anybody who had any kind of barriers or change they shook them off and threw them away especially john carlos and tommie smith all they wanted to was to be known as american athletes nothing else and not to be treated as anyone else other than american athletes that was the time to demonstrate that in america
4460907 when you came home what was the reaction to you especially in your community
4460908 but i remember one frightening day when a guy came up to me a friend of mine and said how could you do that i said what do you mean he said how could you wave that flag when the brothers were doing their thing thats when the chip developed on my shoulder the smiles went away and i became a terrifying fellow for a long time it made me angry the idea that id been rescued from the gutter by a compassionate society i didnt know anything else but to wave a flag
4460909 things turned around drastically once i got that gold medal standing on that platform representing your country hearing the national anthem in the background it changed my life forever
4460910 with a single ssd they can get rid of a hookup like this altogether replacing 10 hdds in many cases but i heard of one extreme case where one ssd replaced 38 enterprise hdds
4460911 the situation right now is weve had an overwhelming response
4460912 in years past we had three or four dozen folks that would take advantage of this to the tune of 250 to 300 cords of wood now we have a list that is probably 300 to 400 people
4460913 folks maybe had a hunting camp near the public lands or they lived nearby
4460914 we were not ready for the level of response and it will take us some time to get prepared to provide the service to all of those who want to participate
4460915 were putting them on a list and will get back in touch with people as we work our way through that list weve had hundreds in the last week were going to need time to handle that level
4460916 as companies across the wireless value chain develop their 2009 strategic plan they are facing an increasingly competitive and complex market many of the worlds leading mobile operators manufacturers and solutions providers look to strategy analytics to understand the challenges they face and identify near to mid term growth opportunities in the areas of mobile devices smartphones wireless network strategies mobile media and messaging and enterprise wireless services

4460920 it delivers leading edge storage capacity and performance with lower power consumption
4460921 we designed the latest version of the wd velociraptor due to the increasing amount of systems that require a backplane mounting system we have had overwhelming demand of our wd velociraptor as it provides enthusiasts with the computing speed and capacity they thirst for

4460925 the cea cnet indexes provide market observers a new metric on the economy and the first of its kind metric to gauge the on going health of the consumer technology sector
4460926 by eliciting subjective probabilities the indexes are better at capturing consumers attitudes and feelings about the economy
4460927 results from the cea cnet indexes are consistent with what we are seeing elsewhere spending on consumer technologies remains a priority for consumers despite the overhanging economic uncertainty
4460928 consumer electronics have become an indispensable part of peoples lives and a major factor in the health of the u s economy
4460929 were thrilled to be partnering with cea to bring these indexes to the industry for the first time we have a tool that allows economists and business leaders to track a sector that is expected to exceed 173 billion in u s factory sales this year
4460930 since 1995 weve shipped more business laptops worldwide than anyone
4460931 this and our 5 million plus conversations a day with customers gives us real insight into the needs of the digital nomad today were translating that insight into breakthrough productivity portability and design the new latitudes are breathtaking
4460932 the new latitude laptops and dell precision mobile workstations represent the largest client product development effort in the history of dell
4460933 weve invested more than 1 million engineering hours and the result is a family of head turning products that are as solid on the inside as on the outside with features that enable better security manageability and productivity
4460934 es waren bis zu 2 5 millionen datens tze ich habe sie drei mal verkauft
4460935 we provide evidence that a metabolically benign obesity can be identified and that it may
4460936 obese individuals with no metabolic abnormalities were more likely to be younger black more physically active and have smaller waists than those with metabolic risk factors the authors wrote
4460937 these exciting preliminary results come from using them to harness the bodys own immune response in a new way although the side effects need to be monitored carefully we hope that this type of treatment will prove to be active in larger trials in the future
4460938 it remains to be seen if most of the responses are longlasting certainly the results are very promising
4460939 two of the seven had a complete response and five a partial regression greater than 50 per cent reduction of tumour
4460940 it could be more deadly for people who have an unknown cardiovascular abnormality
4460941 but thats the whole thing its meant to do that
4460942 at a time when world records seemed to have hit the ceiling of whats physically possible to wrestle out of the human organism phelps has been the man who managed to push the limits with his magnificent performance
4460943 any average adult human being needs some 2 500 daily calories to live a life without excesses
4460944 of course when youre in the presence of a monster like michael phelps those parameters can go to hell
4460945 the all time no 1 olympian or just one of many such belt holders
4460946 the latter is my conclusion because numbers of golds won is only one criterion by which to weigh olympic greatness not least because of the sheer number of scarcely distinguishable events open to swimmers though phelps will move another giant step towards the all time title on sunday if he puts spitz in the shade
4460947 we couldnt care less whether hes the greatest olympian ever
4460948 the truth is hes costing us a fortune and punters bettors just love him if phelps comes to london in 2012 theres a strong chance he could clean up again frankly were already dreading it
4460949 if michael phelps were a country he would be sitting fourth on the games medal tally
4460950 every olympiad produces its own titans athletes whose performances galvanize the worlds attention and whose names become synonymous in olympic history with the cities and years of their triumphs
4460951 in that sense beijing 2008 will always belong to michael phelps
4460952 that michael phelps can take a three minute shower in 2 minutes
4460953 i thought he wanted to be part of what weve built here over the past couple of years especially with sid and malkin having two of the best players in the world
4460954 ive been cheering for the vancouver canucks for how long and they still have never won a stanley cup
4460955 i still love them and i hope canadians can still think of us the same way
4460956 pittsburgh has a great team great people great organization i had to compare the two teams and theres a little better chance to win the cup in detroit i had a great time with sid and playing on the power play with geno evgeni malkin but the team in detroit is something special i know its a short term but we never talked about a one year deal with pittsburgh we just talked about a long term deal i totally believe detroit has the kind of team that can win it again

4460959 while i was on the walkabout in second life i bumped into another avatar online persona and it was one of my lecturers he was surprised to discover his vice chancellor there
4460960 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4460961 we know when it touches us and he knew that so thats where it comes into calling it on yourself because its the right thing to do
4460962 should i expect him to do that maybe not maybe i shouldnt expect people to hold themselves to high standards sportsmanship
4460963 but yes i did expect it a little more so in the olympics when were all competing under the banner of this event being to promote sportsmanship to promote goodwill amongst countries
4460964 probably didnt want to hear an apology right away because i thought it was intentional when we changed sides he said sorry its
4460965 i said okay thats fine its part of the game youre right move on and we did
4460966 i know him very well ive played him many times on tour he does everything in his power to win
4460967 usually its within the rules sometimes its bordering on gamesmanship
4460968 but hes too good of a player to do something like that and to act like that thats why its disappointing because he is a great player
4460969 i try to do it with integrity so my parents would be proud of the way i played
4460970 from 9th august 2008 you will be able to gather your own impression of orwells face from reading his most strongly individual piece of writing his diaries
4460971 the schedule definitely was a lot tougher than i thought it was going to be doing it twice including the olympic trials in late june
4460972 im just proud of winning three medals would have hoped to do a little bit better but you cant really stick your nose up at three olympic medals
4460973 if im going to be in the sport for a while i want some fun
4460974 and this schedule you look at it and you dont go into it as excited as i feel i would have been if i was swimming two or three so i think i will evaluate and maybe focus in on three or four or two or three instead of five events
4460975 bushs problem was that people thought he was not too bright or experienced but if you could nominate a guy like dick cheney whos been in washington a lot in major positions that would fill the gaps in experience and gravity
4460976 biden is the man in the senate on foreign policy and could give obama what i think he really needs to reassure the nation by having someone by his side who is very experienced in international affairs the situation in georgia makes that even more compelling
4460977 in addition he is personable and brings a maturity that bayh wouldnt
4460978 he has to think about whether theyll make a good team does the vice president have experience running things would he be loyal and work well with others such as members of congress these are the questions
4460979 i wrote a rap about a turtle i didnt know how to end it so i just said word
4460980 had not been convicted cautioned received a final warning reprimand and had no charge pending against them
4460981 of those 264 297 87 1 had a conviction caution reprimand or had received a final warning
4460982 these startling figures show that the government is building a national dna database by stealth
4460983 there can be no excuse for storing the dna of innocent adults let alone children who are entirely blameless
4460984 this is an intrusive policy that gives far too much sensitive information to the state when we know that ministers cannot be trusted with its security
4460985 this is yet more evidence that the dna database is totally arbitrary with tens of thousands of innocent kids on it but not every offender in our prisons
4460986 we need to have a parliamentary debate on the issue and put this database on to a statutory basis
4460987 which is giving nagin the award said they didnt know the mayor was being feted
4460988 capcom im really pissed right now i want to play these games but you give us wii owners the shaft no re5 wii possibly no dead rising 2 no lost planet no flock no age of booty no street fighter 4 no devil may cry no dark void
4460989 we are contemplating versions of one or two of the cei titles youve mentioned on the wii not saying which but wed like to see how they do on their initial target systems before doubling down on additional skus
4460990 is this move going to make the game more fun to play
4460991 we would like to know whether it is humanitarian or military
4460992 no destruction the georgian side had been depicting so colorfully could be seen
4460993 we have been saying all along that gori is not a position at all at which russian troops could have fired with heavy weapons or armaments
4460994 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4460995 what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of u s russian relations
4460996 but by the same token my personal view is that there needs to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4460997 russias behavior over the past week has called into question the entire premise of that dialogue and has profound implications for our security relationship going forward both bilaterally and with nato
4460998 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4460999 the era in which the united states and russia considered one another an enemy or strategic threat has ended
4461000 will re examine the entire gamut of our military to military activities with russia and will make changes as necessary and appropriate depending on russian actions in the days ahead
4461001 my view is that the russians and i would say principally prime minister putin
4461002 interested in reasserting russias not only russias great power or superpower status but in reasserting russias traditional spheres of influence
4461003 my guess is that everyone is going to be looking at russia through a different set of lenses as we look ahead
4461004 given the situation concerning the illegal detention of a belarussian minor on the territory of the united states belarus proposes an agreement be concluded on conditions
4461005 pending conclusion of such an agreement the belarussian side regrets to say it is obliged to suspend health stays for children in the united states

4461063 they dont double back which wastes fuel or get caught in traffic we have a customer and almost every single one of his trucks has a gps device on the dashboard in an attempt for the drivers not to get lost

4461065 more and more people are going with lighter weight like aluminum racks but steel is still the workhorse in the industry right now

4461067 the average age is 9 2 years the oldest in recorded history from what i understand
4461068 the other reason is that in the past several years ford chevy and dodge are making engines that last longer with less maintenance same with the transmission with lighter weights and higher rust resistance you dont see many rust buckets anymore so you can keep it longer
4461069 diesel trucks get more torque and power and they are known for a long life

4461077 one of our vehicles can cost you less than 10 cents if you can cut your cost per mile by two thirds you can see how quickly you can recover that initial cost
4461078 we entered the market in 2007 and sold about 500 units
4461079 this year we anticipate selling about 3 000 units both here and in europe were expanding exponentially as the price of gas goes up along with the awareness of global warming an alternative vehicle makes sense a truck operates at about 3 cents a mile the overall cost of ownership is a compelling argument for fleets nationwide

4461101 it is possible to argue that a lot of broadcast news in the west is effectively propaganda even if it is more subtly done and in a way that the journalists themselves are often unconscious of
4461102 i am in much better shape than when i quit
4461103 i only survived that last season because i was having cortisone injections in my knee otherwise i could barely walk 10 yards
4461104 i now feel better than ever and i want to be a bullfighter again people tell me i am mad but surely that is what such surgery is for to allow you to continue living the life you love
4461105 yes i could stick to the golf course but anyone can play golf i love bullfighting and im good at it
4461106 the spanish come to watch me because they are curious but then they see that i dont run away from the bull and they react warmly
4461107 they are encouraging and kind to me because i dont come from a culture of bullfighting and am still prepared to give it a go
4461108 of course if it slammed me in the knee i would be destroyed but you cant think about things like that we matadors try not to dwell on possible injury
4461109 i am aware that i am by far the oldest bullfighter around
4461110 todays 65 is yesterdays 40 i dont believe too many people are fitter than i am
4461111 i love him dearly as a friend and i support him but hes crazy to get back in the ring at his age it does worry me
4461112 as a friend i think his coming out of retirement is a very bad idea but as a bullfighter i respect him for continuing to do what he loves
4461113 hes a phenomenal person and has been good for bullfighting in general
4461114 ive seen a lot worse in the slaughterhouse than in the ring
4461115 these bulls lead fantastic lives for five years all for ten minutes in front of a matador
4461116 the only regret i have is disappointing my mother she was a great mother who was made so unhappy by my choosing to become a bullfighter
4461117 im in the last 25 per cent of my life so i am going to do what i love to do i have tried retirement and it didnt suit me

4461123 and with it his ability to get his ambitious agenda through the legislature
4461124 i wonder if its a kick start to his election campaign or a strong finish to his time as governor
4461125 if john kerry were to be tapped for the vice presidency or secretary of state that would create an opportunity for deval patrick to be a strong contender for the u s senate i dont see it as a start my sense is that it may be a strong finish
4461126 its a smart move and it goes to his strengths as a speaker and someone who inspires people
4461127 hes an intelligent guy who has learned a lot and as a result he is accomplishing more and more as he becomes increasingly proficient in the job

4461131 this landmark transaction basically tripled our size scale and scope positioning lime as a leading national pure play energy efficiency solutions provider

4461155 na twee jaar kregen we al bezoek van de koningin de markt staat dus inmiddels wel op de kaart
4461156 kijk naar de slijmlaag op de huid en de kleur achter de kieuwen die moet prachtig rood zijn
4461157 kijk de vis staat nog stijf als hij gaat slappen heeft hij al een poosje het daglicht gezien in een viswinkel kun je moeilijk beoordelen wanneer iets in de vitrine is gelegd en een filet valt al helemaal niet te controleren
4461158 een heel verschil met een winkel met vitrinelicht kun je een baksteen nog laten glimmen
4461159 alleen wat de vissers deze week vangen ligt hier op zaterdag soms zetten ze zelfs de laatste trek apart voor de markt bovendien kunnen in de haven van den oever alleen maar kleine kotters aanmeren die zijn minder lang van huis waardoor de vis eerder bij de klant is
4461160 we willen de markt niet verstoren vlees is duur maar een mooie vis tegenwoordig ook
4461161 veel mensen kennen die niet en kiezen dan veiligheidshalve toch maar voor dure tong of kabeljauw we delen wel eens een onbekende vis uit om bezoekers ermee kennis te laten maken
4461162 wij bepalen echter zelf wat en van wie we kopen
4461163 dat kan maandag zo de winkel in zon vangnet hebben we ook nodig
4461164 maar het loopt vaak vast op de inzet van vrijwilligers als wij onze mensen moeten betalen kun je de tent wel sluiten
4461165 mag ik een kabeljauw niet zon grote ik ben maar alleen
4461166 iedere keer koop ik een ander visje vorige week nog een scholletje ik stoof ze een beetje roomboter erbij heerlijk bovendien is het hier gezellig
4461167 die staan te dringen voor de deur het eerste uur laten we iedereen een nummertje trekken want op is op
4461168 of dat nog duurzaam is dat is het pas als je met een hengel gaat vissen en vervolgens met de fiets naar huis rijdt klanten van ver nemen vaak wel in een keer veel mee
4461169 de echte liefhebber trekt daar nog een heerlijke soep van
4461170 net na zevenen s ochtends zetten we de kraampjes op na afloop maken we alles schoon rond twee uur s middags zijn we klaar
4461171 den oever kent nog een typische visserijgemeenschap in iedere familie werkt er wel iemand in de visserij
4461172 er is hier zon open sfeer ik ben direct blijven plakken
4461173 ik haalde schol schar en kabeljauw door elkaar nu leer ik snel bij thuis eten we twee tot drie keer in de week vis ik experimenteer regelmatig zodat ik mensen op de markt tips kan geven

4461197 the boats kind of racy but its not a racing boat
4461198 its more a cruising boat and its sort of a cruising race it sounded like a nice way to get the most out of the boat in great comfort

4461203 that boat speed at which the application of the motor penalty will have no detrimental effect on the final computed corrected time

4461378 since privatisation the railways have experienced a real renaissance with more people taking the train than since the 1940s

4461385 everyone in the region is looking to blue plains to do its part to restore the chesapeake bay after all it is the single largest source of nutrient pollution draining into the bay
4461386 sadly wasas suit threatens to delay cleanup of the potomac river and the bay to the detriment of everyone in this region

4461388 the national forests of southern california support a globally significant concentration of wildlife and plants and are a popular destination for millions of people seeking relief from the concrete jungle
4461389 yet the forest service ignores these values and treats most of this land as if it were worthy only of development for urban infrastructure or other exploitation
4461390 instead of managing these forests for the public who actually own and use this land the bush administration plans to axe protections for pristine and scenic landscapes sacrificing important wildlife habitat for the benefit of a few corporations
4461391 its sad that this administration continues to think that making big corporations rich is its first responsibility
4461392 the forest service missed an important opportunity to improve the ecological health of southern californias forest ecosystems

4461394 the federal government has just admitted that these three deadly poisons are washing off into our rivers and streams and harming west coast salmon runs and who knows what else
4461395 the government says these poisons are increasing the risk of salmon extinction substantially we need to find alternatives and act quickly to prevent these chemicals from reaching west coast rivers and streams
4461396 we got into this mess because the bush administrations epa refuses to take seriously the harm that pesticides pose to salmon the biologists at the national fisheries management service have now confirmed that epa failed to acknowledge the true danger posed by these poisons earlier this week the bush administration announced a set of proposed rules that would cut these all federal wildlife experts out of similar future decisions they must think no one is noticing

4461531 he made a mistake hes apologized for that and hes cooperated with authorities
4461532 moultrie cawood and morehead have agreed to cooperate with the united states attorneys office and the department of justice therefore commenting further on the investigation would be premature
4461533 itll depend on where she is now how important the case is how much it would cost the taxpayers and whether witnesses are still around
4461534 she was a rather bizarre character and seems to have a strange circumstance now

4461536 she must know shes a fugitive in at least one state
4461537 the governments criminal case against senator stevens is not based on his legislative activities but on his receipt of financial benefits and his need to conceal those benefits from public scrutiny

4461544 the impression given to the voters is that this is a guarantee that the eliminated local taxes will be permanently replaced by new state revenue
4461545 we are shocked that the court decided to deny property owners the ability to dramatically lower their property taxes

4461581 along the lines of how they would rather have sex with someone with downs syndrome than an advertising professional
4461582 a lot of people were offended but i decided not to delete the comment
4461583 my policy is i do delete comments where the commenter is intending to be offensive but i dont delete comments where the commenters primary intention is to be witty even if what they say ends up offending people
4461584 ive deleted all the comments on here relating to sex with people who have downs syndrome
4461585 although google havent informed me exactly which post on this blog caused the activation of their hate crimes division the strength of feeling in the comments section here leads me to believe it was this one

4461601 there are no hard and fast rules for chanting the holy name
4461602 one does not have to undergo initiation or execute the activities required before initiation one simply has to vibrate the holy name with his lips thus even a man in the lowest class candala can be delivered

4461633 if we do everything right in our towns but lose our youth for the next 20 years all of the good things that we might have done will have been for naught
4461634 weve found in our research that 50 to 60 percent of the youth at the junior high and high school level would like to come back home after college but often only 2 to 10 percent actually come home there is a real gap between what they want to do and what they can do because of economic circumstances

4461683 it needs to be a formal ceasefire which is what we are working on
4461684 but in order to get to that point there really did have to be important clarifications on a couple of these points in the ceasefire in order to make sure that georgian interests are protected
4461685 because the united states would never ask georgia to sign on to something where its interests were not protected
4461686 i think it would be major accomplishment for georgia to get the russians out of their country and back effectively to the status quo
4461687 recognize the territorial integrity of georgia and recognize that abkhazia and south ossetia are within the internationally recognized boundaries of georgia
4461688 the only thing is that im not confident with how the game ended
4461689 i lost my second baseman when the pitcher pedro luis lazo threw the ball at his head i dont see any place for that in baseball i respect the way cuba plays baseball but i dont like losing players
4461690 it takes all the work out of baseball because all you need is a base hit and youve got a good shot to win

4461702 the evidence is now in and that optimism was unwarranted this experience confirms earlier studies showing that one time tax rebates are not a cost effective way to increase economic activity
4461703 the governments recent gdp figures show that the level of consumer outlays only rose by an extra 12 billion or 15 percent of the lost revenue
4461704 the evidence of a very limited effect on spending is also clear in the monthly retail sales a measure that is narrower than total consumer outlays because it excludes things like utility bills and rent retail sales were 342 billion a month in january through april and rose to only 346 billion in may and june
4461705 little to raise consumer spending and stop the decline in employment if the past is an indicator of what would happen the 65 billion obama proposes to spend on this plan would raise consumer spending by only about 10 billion or less than one tenth of 1 percent of gdp

4461719 a lot of people were offended but i decided not to delete the comment
4461720 my policy is i do delete comments where the commenter is intending to be offensive but i dont delete comments where the commenters primary intention is to be witty even if what they say ends up offending people
4461721 ive deleted all the comments on here relating to sex with people who have downs syndrome
4461722 although google havent informed me exactly which post on this blog caused the activation of their hate crimes division the strength of feeling in the comments section here leads me to believe it was this one

4461828 it remains imperative for the city of boca raton to continue to look farther ahead than the next fiscal year when making budgetary decisions
4461829 due to escalating costs of fuel personnel disposal fee and vehicles

4461831 senator obama supports corn based ethanol and moving to other bio based ethanol products as well
4461832 has fought against and does not support corn based ethanol and has resisted it and voted against it

4461835 still opposed to the farm bill and to any kind of government support for ethanol
4461836 its a matter of what people decide to support and what their agenda is that will cause voters to decide who to vote for either in favor of the farm bill in favor of supporting agriculture or in favor of the positions of senator obamas opponent which in my opinion certainly should not be attractive to nebraskans or iowans or anybody in agriculture

4461856 you could turn the cells for example into liver cells and have them ready for when the baby is born

4461888 now we are just going to wait for the city to mediate with him and us
4461889 all that we want is for him to make an official apology to the gay community for his discriminatory actions
4461890 in mediation the respondent does not admit any wrongdoing instead the respondent agrees to perform certain actions which will help to prevent this type of complaint in the future
4461891 this happened three years ago to another transgender woman whats to say it wont start happening again once all of the attention goes away

4461949 there can be no excuse for storing the dna of innocent adults let alone children who are entirely blameless
4461950 this is an intrusive policy that gives far too much sensitive information to the state when we know that ministers cannot be trusted with its security
4461951 this is yet more evidence that the dna database is totally arbitrary with tens of thousands of innocent kids on it but not every offender in our prisons
4461952 we need to have a parliamentary debate on the issue and put this database on to a statutory basis

4461969 the key issue is that the city needs to be open to the public
4461970 its clear the ordinance is trying to get rid of unsightly homeless folks who are sitting on benches
4461971 were far more concerned about public safety and law and order than free speech
4461972 the point is you dont want anyone to hog the bench

4461985 and there were no differences on those measures in the alcohol group compared to the no alcohol group
4461986 this suggests that the effect we observed wasnt due to a general change in mood
4461987 but some of our results suggest that theres more going on than we might have thought
4461988 the main question is whether these effects are specific to faces or whether we would rate anything as more attractive after a drink
4461989 to see if alcohol has a more general effect on perceiving beauty in the environment
4461990 its also surprising to see this effect is happening at lower doses than you might think
4461991 were trying to build up a more complete picture of what happens when people go out for a drink and were interested in certain behaviors that are more common after drinking such as unsafe sex or violence if this effect is happening at lower doses than expected it might be helpful for people who are predisposed to such behaviors to anticipate those situations and prevent them
4461992 but there are practical and ethical constraints around how much alcohol we can give people in the lab

4461999 im a bit concerned that when people see me walking in the streets with my fiance they might think im a hooker or a mail order bride being asian and all
4462000 well come to think of it if others judge me without knowing my background first i cant really blame them i mean ive heard lots of stories about asian women who do marry western men purely for money they have these marriages of convenience with rich old men whom they divorce later on but im not one of them

4462014 yeah thats the whole point of it were not doing this to do a one off were definitely gonna do cr e fest 2 next year hopefully well continue it whether we play or not its kind of like ozzfest was its a lifestyle thing

4462016 furthermore humans do not perceive the passage of time in a linear way this coupled with the irregular behavior of progress bars produces a highly variable perception of how long it takes progress bars to complete an understanding of which behaviors perceptually shorten or lengthen process duration can be used to engineer a progress bar that appears faster even though the actual duration remains unchanged

4462026 they didnt explain to the parents that this was an experimental vaccine and a lot of the parents who signed consent forms were illiterate

4462028 pulmonary physicians are looking desperately for anything to improve the clinical course of patients with copd
4462029 the main finding is that all three arms of pharmacotherapy and this included inhaled corticosteroids a long acting beta agonist called salmeterol and a combination of both were effective in altering the rate of decline
4462030 so the decline was not as quick and as steep as those patients who were receiving placebo
4462031 this study is a much larger study and it does have some of the same flaws as the other studies mainly that some patients are not contributing any data on lung function in fact a large number
4462032 and because of that you cant really know thats why my editorial says theres some hopeful signs here but we cant really be conclusive
4462033 well why should we want to use all of these medications and especially the combination one
4462034 if the three drug therapies are giving exactly the same slope of decline the same improvement in slope of decline which one of the three should we choose
4462035 they should choose the safest one and thats the salmeterol by itself
4462036 it will alter my practice probably as of this afternoon when i go for a clinic to see a new copd patient
4462037 there is a slightly higher chance of pneumonia of getting an infection of the lung when you use the combination at least when you use either the inhaled corticosteroids or inhaled corticosteroids with the salmeterol
4462038 so yes there is a slight risk but it is relatively small and it does not affect mortality
4462039 the main finding is that for the first time its been shown that administering pharmacotherapy to patients with copd can change and modify the clinical course of their disease
4462040 i say saakashvili is going to restore the territorial integrity of georgia five minutes before the opening ceremony starts in beijing and dare the russians to invade while the games are on

4462103 rangkap jabatan di anak perusahaan pun hanya menimbulkan benturan kepentingan di perusahaan publik yang berdampak jalannya perusahaan tidak profesional
4462104 perusahaan bumn dituntut untuk melaksanakan prinsip prinsip pengelolaan perusahaan yang baik dan transparan good corporate governance oleh karena itu dia harus konsentrasi pada bidangnya tidak boleh bercabang kalau ada direksi bumn yang merangkap jadi pembina di anak perusahaan dapat dipastikan tidak akan bisa berperan maksimal

4462108 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4462109 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4462110 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4462111 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4462112 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4462113 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4462114 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4462115 das ist nat rlich ein schwerer schlag wir hoffen und w nschen nat rlich dass es ihm schnell wieder besser geht
4462116 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4462117 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4462118 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4462119 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4462120 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4462121 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4462122 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4462123 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4462124 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4462125 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4462126 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4462127 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4462128 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4462129 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4462130 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4462131 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4462132 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4462133 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4462134 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4462135 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4462136 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4462137 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4462138 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4462139 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4462140 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4462141 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4462142 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4462143 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4462144 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4462145 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4462146 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4462147 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4462148 theres never going to be another william petersen and there will never be another jorja fox but we are not out to just replace those actors were out to add new characters to the show and the show will change as a result but thats a good thing
4462149 he does a play i do csi i do a play he does csi it wouldve been like a professional relationship between two scientists that go off on field trips and sabbaticals and then come back but i dont know that the network would have wanted that
4462150 for years ive been styling a range of clients from real women to red carpet celebrities both on and off camera and in my experience i have never encountered a show like this which proves style is not superficial
4462151 guide to style is about complete transformations from the inside out it requires hard work total honesty and 100 percent commitment from the participants throughout the entire makeover process
4462152 i am absolutely crazy about gretta and together she and i want every woman to achieve her perfect signature look
4462153 it takes hard work and commitment to look good but it should also be fun our hope is that well inspire women everywhere to put their best foot forward and with cute shoes too
4462154 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4462155 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4462156 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4462157 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4462158 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4462159 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4462160 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4462161 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4462162 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4462163 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4462164 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4462165 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4462166 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4462167 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4462168 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4462169 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4462170 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4462171 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4462172 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4462173 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4462174 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4462175 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4462176 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4462177 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4462178 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4462179 it was really hard work but its expected its going to be tough theres a lot of guys going for this final

4462184 a very smart blog if youre trying to separate the demagogic attacks on nclb from the serious criticism this is the site to read
4462185 full of very lively short items and is always on top of the news he gets extra points for skewering my high school rating system

4462189 i check eduwonk several times a day especially since i cut back on caffeine
4462190 i have just three go to websites the texas legislature texas longhorn sports and eduwonk

4462195 mixed use developments are very important because they enable people to work and shop live and shop or live work and shop in the same location
4462196 developers want to build what they can sell or lease so we may see some shrinking of the residential component for now
4462197 pulmonary physicians are looking desperately for anything to improve the clinical course of patients with copd
4462198 the main finding is that all three arms of pharmacotherapy and this included inhaled corticosteroids a long acting beta agonist called salmeterol and a combination of both were effective in altering the rate of decline
4462199 so the decline was not as quick and as steep as those patients who were receiving placebo
4462200 this study is a much larger study and it does have some of the same flaws as the other studies mainly that some patients are not contributing any data on lung function in fact a large number
4462201 and because of that you cant really know thats why my editorial says theres some hopeful signs here but we cant really be conclusive
4462202 well why should we want to use all of these medications and especially the combination one
4462203 if the three drug therapies are giving exactly the same slope of decline the same improvement in slope of decline which one of the three should we choose
4462204 they should choose the safest one and thats the salmeterol by itself
4462205 it will alter my practice probably as of this afternoon when i go for a clinic to see a new copd patient
4462206 there is a slightly higher chance of pneumonia of getting an infection of the lung when you use the combination at least when you use either the inhaled corticosteroids or inhaled corticosteroids with the salmeterol
4462207 so yes there is a slight risk but it is relatively small and it does not affect mortality
4462208 the main finding is that for the first time its been shown that administering pharmacotherapy to patients with copd can change and modify the clinical course of their disease
4462209 we talk about it all the time but its really really true
4462210 they really think that because theyre young that they could survive anything that young people dont die in hospitals its only old people that die in hospital even if youre in an accident
4462211 they really believe because of their age and agility that that makes up for lack of experience that their reflexes are faster and theyre stronger physically
4462212 and so they believe theyre better drivers in fact than older people who have a lot more experience
4462213 it shows them first hand that this too could happen to you
4462214 with all the work that weve done with teens this is really reinforcing what they tell us anecdotally
4462215 they do have a feeling that theyre invincible its always someone else whos the bad driver not them and its really difficult to get them to understand the consequences of bad choices
4462216 you cant just have a program for the teens you cant just show it to them once
4462217 but when you look at it very carefully its usually not bad luck its usually someone has made a bad choice someone has chosen to drink and drive chosen not to wear seatbelts or to speed or be out on a lake at midnight when theres no light
4462218 so its never just one person who loses their life its the whole family losing a child losing a loved one losing a parent it is tragic and it shakes the whole family and they never ever recover
4462219 i try and read the blog everyday and have pointed it out to other faculty who have their students read it for class it is truly one of the best things in the blogosphere

4462221 why not put it to some use to create a benefit rather than just for arts sake
4462222 when i see that picture i see the soul in its eyes because ive seen that animal up close i see the people i see the jungle and i fear the end if we wait five years there arent going to be any more gorillas left it has to be done now were trying to be a voice we have aresponsibility the gorilla doesnt have a voice it cant speak for itself
4462223 the villagers had the traditional belief that the gorilla was a totem
4462224 you have to include the government you have to include the local villagers
4462225 you have to recognize the politics involved whether traditional or government politics if you work together to include all of that then you have more of a chance of success
4462226 deserve their place on this planet why should we destroy them out of greed or need when the need can be met in other ways
4462227 daniel and ginette taylor are true ambassadors for the cross river gorilla
4462228 they have understood that if we dont act now this species will disappear from our planet
4462229 particularly important given the critical state of this little known population of gorillas
4462230 the way they look at you it gave me chills its an endangered animal and to finally get to see it and go into its jungle its a privilege you cant go and see them and not want to try to help and you cant help the gorilla unless you help the people were showing people over here that something can be done
4462231 you want to know about my conclusion about 4 a gallon gas just divide eight years by two oilmen in the white house and you have your 4 a gallon
4462232 at the end of the day you have two oil men in the white house and they represent big oil the republicans are doing the bidding of big oil
4462233 represents another big giveaway to oil companies already making billions in profits
4462234 president bush and john mccain are not serious about addressing gas prices if they were they would stop offering the same old ideas meant to pad the pockets of big oil and work with democrats to reduce our dependence on oil invest in the renewable energy sources crack down on excessive speculation and stand up to countries colluding to shake down american consumers
4462235 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
4462236 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets now big oil is filling john mccains campaign with 2 million in contributions
4462237 these new instructors will allow the program to continue to expand in coming years they also bring new perspectives and talent to the instructional staff
4462238 this year a new robotics instructors activity board was added to the robotics unit and a 24 hour clock kit was added to the soldering 101 unit
4462239 we are working on robots now in my class and we will be well entrenched by the end of this school year next year promises to be fun and exciting for the students the ti was a great experience and spencers personal tutelage was responsible for making it so
4462240 wonderful doesn t begin to describe it i knew the basics of radio communications and transmission through electromagnetic waves but i now understand it better than i ever have the robot was very cool it reinvigorated my love of programming i also made many contacts that i will use to help throughout my teaching career
4462241 thanks again for arrl support in the education gift department i have new ideas on how to excite the kids as i go through the next school year
4462242 thank you to the arrl for having the vision to facilitate these offerings and support teac hers in so many tangible ways
4462243 the teachers institute was a great experience for me i learned about many new technological applications to use in my classroom for example i will be using the weather satellite downloads in my environmental science class enabling my students to compare climate observations with ideas presented by textbook authors so they will be able to have informed opinions
4462244 that sounds good just write it up and send it to me
4462245 i would like to personally thank you for your dedication and commitment to the teachers institute program teachers and amateur radio the program you have spent many years and countless hours developing circuit boards and tweaking curriculum material s has resulted is the best workshop i have attended in my 14 years as an educator

4462248 i entirely concur in the propriety of resorting to the sense in which the constitution was accepted and ratified by the nation
4462249 though faced with 20 years boxed up in a cell the more i read from this book the more the outside world recedes ive got to the place that i really dont care any more how much time i get twenty years so be it
4462250 if there is a god help me my life is over
4462251 behold i stand at the door and knock if anyone opens the door i will come in with him to fellowship with him
4462252 i am to be released this coming spring that would add up to less than a year imprisoned
4462253 remember glenn that the recitative rate is high for inmates to return behind bars i dont want that to happen to you
4462254 weve known for a long time birth control ruins marriages and leaves families emotionally devastated now we know theres apparently a biological reason for it birth control is duping women into falling for the wrong men
4462255 and we wonder why the divorce rate is so high
4462256 not only could similarity in couples lead to infertility problems but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odor perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
4462257 the entrenched political and cultural norms that perpetuate male dominated decision making bodies and constrain women
4462258 transitioning government structures which afford particular opportunity for repositioning womens role in public life and decision making
4462259 a lot of laws have not been interpreted or defined in a new country and you can assume that whatever you want the law to be it is unless it is proven otherwise so of course we put the most progressive spin on it
4462260 the more we say it the more people get to believing it were changing the norm first they laugh and then they start repeating it
4462261 in the beginning which is to say at some time after the big bang if there was a big bang god if there really is a god we grant the possibility that there might not be created the heavens and the earth
4462262 furthermore we wish to stress that by god we do not mean to specify any particular deity of any particular faith tradition all of which are equally valid and entitled to respect but rather to denote some agency such as yahweh allah vishnu the goddess or nobody at all really
4462263 thou at least individually but in some limited number of cases collectively as well shalt not except under circumstances in which the greater good is served as determined by consensus among the global communities of scientists attorneys entertainers elected representatives of the various peoples of the globe non elected representatives the general assembly of the united nations the european union and the democratic party usa forcibly transfer property or goods or services we do not intend here to imply any endorsement tacit or otherwise of the concept of private property which is poorly defined and subject to continuing debate from one individual or community of individuals except when it has been shown that said community of individuals such as big oil big tobacco or caucasian males has knowingly acted in opposition to the greater good to any individual or community of individuals including ones own self individually or collectively except in cases where such individuals have been shown to be demonstrably in need of said property goods or services by a competent spiritual authority although we do not mean to imply that there is anything that can be scientifically described as spirit except in the sense of
4462264 hey hey ho ho guilt and conscience have gotta go
4462265 when was public virtue to be found when private was not
4462266 was for his private storage and that he was not aware the images could be seen by the public
4462267 deep concern at attempts to identify islam with terrorism violence and human rights violations
4462268 to take all possible measures to promote tolerance and respect for all religions and their value systems and to complement legal systems with intellectual and moral strategies to combat religious hatred and intolerance
4462269 a new beginning for the promotion and protection of human rights
4462270 to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights in the dignity and worth of the human person in the equal rights of men and women
4462271 we have reached a point at which the commissions declining credibility has cast a shadow on the reputation of the united nations system as a whole and where piecemeal reforms will not be enough
4462272 to date there have been 12 country specific hrc resolutions nine censures of israel and three non condemnatory resolutions on sudan
4462273 we did not have sufficient confidence in this text to be able to say that the hrc would be better than its predecessor
4462274 the real test will be the quality of membership that emerges on this council and whether it takes effective action to address serious human rights abuse cases like sudan cuba iran zimbabwe belarus and burma
4462275 we havent officially heard about the plan from official israeli leaders all what sic we hear about are just media balloons to show that israel is serious in the peace process
4462276 these are half truths used by israelis as a test balloon so they can blame the palestinian authority should the negotiations fail
4462277 we are not a bazaar we want a complete israeli withdrawal from the territories it occupied in 1967 including jerusalem and agreement on all the final status questions
4462278 the israeli proposal is not acceptable the palestinian side will only accept a palestinian state with territorial continuity with holy jerusalem as its capital without settlements and with the june 4 1967 boundaries
4462279 undoubtedly the pressures and the burden of the outpouring which approaches 144 days on august 23rd have helped to create an atmosphere of fatigue and stress that has exacerbated existing issues in their relationship emphasis added we wish to stress however that the outpouring is not to blame for the current chain of events and that in effect we have no interest in blaming anyone but rather we deeply covet your prayers for todd and shonnah and for fresh fire ministries during this time
4462280 todd bentley the evangelist who has led the florida outpouring revival here in lakeland since april 2 has filed for separation from his wife and might not return to the revival according to his former local spokesperson lynne breidenbach
4462281 m arriage is a foundational cornerstone to those families called to ministry and would believe that those who have spiritual oversight for todd and shonnahs ministry will recommend a time of sabbatical for the family in order to seek reconciliation within their marriage should these reports be accurate
4462282 in one heart breaking scene a 15 year old boy with spina bifida walks without leg braces in front of bentley and the crowd he is later shown stumbling and falling outside the church the nightline reporter asked fresh fire for three people who can show medical proof they have been healed through bentley none could be provided when the province earlier asked to speak to someone who had been healed through bentley in either b c or florida fresh fire was unable to find someone citing difficulties with outdated contact information and record keeping problems
4462283 for ye are like unto whited sepulchers tombs which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead mens bones and of all uncleanness
4462284 for if he that cometh preacheth another jesus whom we have not preached or if ye receive another spirit which ye have not received or another gospel which ye have not accepted ye might well bear with him for i suppose i was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles but though i be rude in speech yet not in knowledge but we have been thoroughly made manifest among you in all things
4462285 but shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more ungodliness and their word will eat as doth a canker of whom is hymenaeus and philetus
4462286 if any man teach otherwise and consent not to wholesome words even the words of our lord jesus christ and to the doctrine which is according to godliness he is proud knowing nothing but doting about questions and strifes of words whereof cometh envy strife railings evil surmisings perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godliness from such withdraw thyself
4462287 it is sobering to realize just how easily completely and willingly we can be deceived about god and about ourselves
4462288 disciplined and disfellowshiped by three church leaders last fall after they determined he had engaged in a pattern of unbiblical behavior that included heavy drinking and homosexuality
4462289 this is a man who preyed on vulnerable frail and elderly women systematically
4462290 he sought them out followed them got on the same transport as them and went to their home addresses attacked and then robbed them
4462291 runners initial disability was 16 years later than non runners
4462292 it stops right at our corner and gives us tremendous visibility
4462293 our estimate is that one third of that development would have happened without the streetcar
4462294 were already making a profit and the growth has just begun
4462295 more and better educated engineers are needed if our nation and its auto industry are to thrive or even survive
4462296 we talk about how theres only one president at a time so the idea that you would send your own emissaries and really interfere with the process is remarkable
4462297 its very risky and can send mixed messages to foreign governments they accused obama of being presumptuous but he didnt do anything close to this
4462298 if i may be so bold there was another president
4462299 zwei nationale titel und dass wir in der champions league bis zum schluss dabei sind
4462300 wir wollen in die spitze der bundesliga f r diese saison ist es unser ziel platz f nf aus dem vorjahr zu verteidigen
4462301 wir haben zwei f hrungsspieler verloren aber ich bin zuversichtlich dass ihre nachfolger die l cken schlie en k nnen
4462302 wir werden hier die eine oder andere vollgas veranstaltung pr sentieren und die leute begeistern
4462303 der kader ist stark genug und wurde nochmals punktuell verst rkt und christoph daum ist ein gro er trainer der bisher berall erfolg hatte ich tippe dass der fc neunter oder zehnter wird
4462304 youre going to a country with 1 3 billion people
4462305 we have reached the status that minnesota has sold one dollar to each and every chinese person for three years running
4462306 when we received the order for these it was pretty exciting around here knowing we were making part of the olympics happen
4462307 i want to uphold the truth as a muslim malay and malaysian i firmly understand the consequences of my action and if it is untrue misfortune will befall me my family and my descendants
4462308 this was also the best option for me to seek justice and restore my dignity and self respect
4462309 i dont want to lie or dilly dally any longer i challenge anwar to do the same swear on the quran and deny my allegations against him
4462310 the time is right for me to face the public as a faithful muslim
4462311 when i lodged the police report on june 26 there was no news of anwar contesting in the by election
4462312 you will never be left alone we have come to reaffirm your sovereignty your independence your territorial integrity these are our values independent georgia is and independent georgia will always be
4462313 we have information confirmed by our specialists that several vessels of the black sea fleet left sevastopol and either made their way or were making their way toward the territory of georgia
4462314 obviously if this is confirmed we will have to reconsider the conditions under which these vessels would be able to be stationed on the territory of ukraine
4462315 poses a potential threat to ukraines national security particularly if parts of russias black sea fleet are used against third countries
4462316 one week before these events we send a column of humanitarian aid to ukraine to help flood victims and the next we find theyre offering military aid arms for the destruction of civilians
4462317 the appearance on our borders of a powerful military bloc will be considered by russia as a direct threat to our countrys security
4462318 undoubtedly take measures to ensure its security near the state border these will be both military and other measures
4462319 will do everything possible to prevent the accession of ukraine and georgia to nato
4462320 hey i think ill apply for a job as a physician or a chief financial officer
4462321 it doesnt matter how bad your life is because if you do what we say and believe what we tell you you will have it all in the next life oh and by the way just leave what little you have behind as a contribution to we who must be obeyed
4462322 its not so much getting the cyclists but getting the communities out there watching
4462323 the state doesnt have a named big biking event and this is what were envisioning we have a lake an icon really to stage it around
4462324 in france we lost the culture of the bike after the war when it was seen as old fashioned or for poor people
4462325 now its coming back and with the latest increase in gasoline prices we are seeing enormous interest
4462326 the chinese bikes are less than half the price of italian ones and clearly that makes a difference to a lot of people
4462327 how does it work do you need to pedal are they very expensive
4462328 i think sen gramm would be in serious consideration for ambassador to belarus although im not sure the citizens of minsk would welcome that
4462329 one of my competitors walking out said it reminded her of melbourne for the commonwealth games so there you go
4462330 i would suggest that in the long endurance outdoor sports you can see an impact these athletes are talking about seconds apart long term exposure in these conditions it can certainly take seconds off
4462331 i was expecting the worst and we put measures in place if it was necessary but it hasnt been an issue not since ive been here
4462332 its visible you can see it but it doesnt bother me
4462333 we were all going to be in the same situation so it doesnt matter at all
4462334 its the olympics its a happy day smog no problem
4462335 jesus mary and joseph i love you very much i beg you to spare the life of babys name the unborn baby that i have spiritually adopted who is in danger of abortion
4462336 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4462337 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4462338 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4462339 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4462340 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4462341 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4462342 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4462343 i think we are close to doing something with robbie
4462344 ive said all along that he has to get his fitness and sharpness and we are now seeing good signs of that
4462345 in the last three or four days in training hes been absolutely different class
4462346 hes a world class striker and if he can get fit and sharp then he will always score goals at any level ill sit down with the chairman now and discuss where we are going to go from here
4462347 youve seen all the stuff in the papers and i havent got to say what the situation is
4462348 stephen warnock has come back and said he had no intention of putting a transfer request in
4462349 as for roque he has said he wants to stay
4462350 i expect to return to the pitch soon because i can walk sprint and jump without problems i just cant shoot properly
4462351 yes im overcompensating for my insecurities and lack of masculinity but ive got a really big dog
4462352 youd think that with young players like anderson ronaldo wayne rooney nani there will be improvement there
4462353 i think thats the most natural thing you can say about this club these players have the capacity to improve so well see
4462354 wayne is fit and the good thing he has done very well this week and has been progressing really well
4462355 we had quite a few opportunities last week that has to be said
4462356 we would have liked to have taken them and put the game to bed and if you dont take these chances in games that are close you can regret it
4462357 fortunately last week we were in control of the situation when it went to penalty kicks but we never looked as though we were going to lose it
4462358 but we have a good variety of midfield players and the back four are fit so we have a good foundation if we keep creating chances then we will start taking them
4462359 its a chance to give back to help the children
4462360 weve sold plenty of cds we want to give what we can
4462361 were giving away school supplies for two reasons one to show our kids here in salisbury how important an education is and two that there are still some african american men out here who are concerned about and active in the life and growth of our community
4462362 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
4462363 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it if it had happened the other way i never would have finished the match because my father would have pulled me off the court
4462364 we know when it touches us and he knew that so thats where it comes into calling it on yourself should i expect him to do that maybe not
4462365 its a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4462366 already when we made this round it was the biggest thing that had happened to us
4462367 we come from a small village there are more cows there than people and all the farmers even came in from the fields to watch us for an hour even though they have no idea what is beach volleyball i cant imagine what they are doing now
4462368 its like he was trying to put a window down or open a door but was unable to
4462369 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4462370 we know when it touches us and he knew that so thats where it comes into calling it on yourself because its the right thing to do
4462371 should i expect him to do that maybe not maybe i shouldnt expect people to hold themselves to high standards sportsmanship
4462372 but yes i did expect it a little more so in the olympics when were all competing under the banner of this event being to promote sportsmanship to promote goodwill amongst countries
4462373 probably didnt want to hear an apology right away because i thought it was intentional when we changed sides he said sorry its
4462374 i said okay thats fine its part of the game youre right move on and we did
4462375 i know him very well ive played him many times on tour he does everything in his power to win
4462376 usually its within the rules sometimes its bordering on gamesmanship
4462377 but hes too good of a player to do something like that and to act like that thats why its disappointing because he is a great player
4462378 i try to do it with integrity so my parents would be proud of the way i played
4462379 weightlifting depends on strength and so we women weightlifters have fully understood the importance of strength and pick up gold medals
4462380 its a training method that is unique they think women can do more loading than a man
4462381 ask yourself these questions are you better off today than you were four years ago is it easier for you to buy things in the store than it was four years ago
4462382 are you and your neighbors better off today than you were four years ago can you care for the people you love as youd like to is your community a better or worse place to live
4462383 tell me what kind of help you need from government to be able to care for your family and help your neighbors
4462384 when you have a long term uptrend excesses build up along the way we are witnessing a correction
4462385 demand for commodities will remain at a high level in countries like china and india if we see a serious worldwide recession then we will see the end of the commodities boom
4462386 commodities cant be completely immune to the fact that there is a global slowdown taking place
4462387 that doesnt mean we should abandon commodities for the next 5 years there are still very strong supply demand dynamics in place for the next few years
4462388 we dont think the long term bull market is over but we have left the phase where its just a one way ride
4462389 everyone is focused on demand at the moment but we think production problems will underpin prices
4462390 we have started to see some demand for oil curtailed in oecd countries
4462391 but the economic fundamentals in china and other emerging markets support oil at more than 100 a barrel into 2009
4462392 for the last several days senator barack obama has seemed to fade from the scene while on his secluded vacation here as his opponent senator john mccain has seized nearly every opportunity to display his foreign policy credentials on the dominant issue of the week the conflict between russia and georgia
4462393 the candidates images have been reversed within a matter of a few weeks when mr obama was overseas last month mr mccains foreign policy bona fides seemed diminished if only because he could not attract the news media attention received by mr obama the presumptive democratic presidential nominee now mr obamas voice seems muted at a time when much of the world has been worriedly watching the conflict
4462394 president mccain sends secretary of state lieberman and defense secretary graham to tbilisi
4462395 standing behind a lectern in michigan this week with two trusted senators ready to do his bidding john mccain seemed to forget for a moment that he was only running for president
4462396 asked about his tough rhetoric on the ongoing conflict in georgia mccain began if i may be so bold there was another president
4462397 to kvindelige selvmordsbombere detonerede deres spr ngladning med f minutters mellemrum
4462398 if we can win against palace then it will be a fabulous start for us so far it is great but we need to build on that
4462399 someone is trying to cause trouble because nothing could be further from the truth
4462400 sure it takes a little time to settle when you move clubs and i am still living in a hotel but that is my choice because i want to find the right house for me and my family
4462401 i do not think that he is upset and i have no idea if he refused to go to valencia robinho is an intelligent lad and i do not believe that he would refuse to have gone
4462402 i am asked if robinho is happy or not but all i know is that i am pleased to have him with us every day because he is a great player and i hope he does not go
4462403 i have an ego and everyone has to defend their own interests go for what they want and the player and the club will have to reach an agreement
4462404 i am disappointed because lee is a quality player lee made it clear that he wanted to come back here and i would have been interested but it wasnt to be
4462405 i do want to bring in a real quality attacking left sided player rather than just get by i am prepared to wait until i can get him even until january if necessary
4462406 sir alex ferguson told me of forests interest after the game against juventus last week but he didnt know what to do because he had a few injuries and illness

4462408 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4462409 made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else
4462410 and then she forgave me and we went to work on it
4462411 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4462412 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4462413 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4462414 made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else
4462415 and then she forgave me and we went to work on it
4462416 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4462417 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4462418 the bottom line to it is john edwards and elizabeth edwards had no knowledge of anything i did
4462419 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4462420 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them

4462423 were responding to the desires of healthcare providers to set up their immunization clinics early
4462424 i dont think its really set in but i feel like this journey has been so long
4462425 standing on the podium and hearing olympic champion next to my name was a dream come true
4462426 i just knew that i had to give the routine of my life
4462427 i was pretty far behind but i couldnt control that i gave a great meet today that was probably my favorite moment finishing on floor because i knew i had given it my all and i couldnt change anything
4462428 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe
4462429 just to know that he was so close to the all around gold and didnt quite achieve it
4462430 and i hope you know i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him i hope that this definitely tops it i have a few more to go but it is an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him out on the floor 20 years after he competed i think it just means so much more to both of us i dont know just all the hard work paying off all the injuries tears blood rips everything
4462431 a cooling relationship could cost the administration any hope of working closely with russia on some of its topmost priorities like controlling nuclear proliferation countering terrorism or resolving the problems of the middle east
4462432 the specter of a resurgent russia helped persuade poland to agree to a long stalled deal on an american missile defense system
4462433 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4462434 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4462435 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia
4462436 it will be a major accomplishment for georgia to get the russians out of their country and back effectively to the status quo ante
4462437 any measures that they are allowed to take have got to be of a very limited nature for a very limited period of time
4462438 why do you give a crap what i have to say
4462439 i used to tell people when i first came that we considered forensic science boys town but now its more like a girls world
4462440 i have to think that theres got to be some relationship between the roles that are represented on tv and the way women see whats possible for them as a career
4462441 a lot of them do realize that riding around in the hummers and wearing prada is not the day to day things
4462442 but i tell girls that i do a lot of things in pearls and pumps you can be a part of this used to be male dominated thing but you can still be feminine you can still be who you are
4462443 i think all of us have kind of an altruist bent for the greater good because we could probably be doing research chemistry or medical and making more money but everybody seems to have a passion for the science and work and wanting to help people
4462444 looking at women actually doing what i thought i wanted to do they seemed to have to make a really difficult choice as to making sure that their career was successful and also being successful moms and they did it and they did it well but it was just a choice that i did not want to make
4462445 i just kind of meshed him coming home and telling stories at the dinner table to my love for science and that kind of morphed into wanting to do this
4462446 i used to tell people when i first came that we considered forensic science boys town but now its more like a girls world
4462447 i have to think that theres got to be some relationship between the roles that are represented on tv and the way women see whats possible for them as a career

4462450 i think all of us have kind of an altruist bent for the greater good because we could probably be doing research chemistry or medical and making more money but everybody seems to have a passion for the science and work and wanting to help people
4462451 looking at women actually doing what i thought i wanted to do they seemed to have to make a really difficult choice as to making sure that their career was successful and also being successful moms and they did it and they did it well but it was just a choice that i did not want to make
4462452 i just kind of meshed him coming home and telling stories at the dinner table to my love for science and that kind of morphed into wanting to do this

4462494 it is an effort to reclaim moscows control over its neighbours in the region cutting western access to the caspian sea and central asia nor will it be the last such effort ukraine which also has the distinction of hosting a crucial energy pipeline just as georgia is the only alternative to russia as a route for a pipeline carrying oil westward from azerbaijan ukraine is a route by which russian natural gas flows to europe is surely the more important target of this demonstration that ties to the west and the pursuit of democracy are of little help where regional matters of force come into play

4462501 three new polls released today show significant movement toward john mccain
4462502 a similar pattern manifests itself in minnesota where rasmussen has barack obamas lead eroding to 4 points obama had held a 13 point lead last month and in the critical swing state of colorado rasmussen has john mccain edging into a 1 point lead last month it had been obama by 3
4462503 no overwhelmingly strong hints about whats going in from the cross tabular results but it appears that mccain has gained ground with independents as is almost always the case when the polls move and also that some republican voters are moving from undecided to mccain

4462575 pulmonary physicians are looking desperately for anything to improve the clinical course of patients with copd
4462576 the main finding is that all three arms of pharmacotherapy and this included inhaled corticosteroids a long acting beta agonist called salmeterol and a combination of both were effective in altering the rate of decline
4462577 so the decline was not as quick and as steep as those patients who were receiving placebo
4462578 this study is a much larger study and it does have some of the same flaws as the other studies mainly that some patients are not contributing any data on lung function in fact a large number
4462579 and because of that you cant really know thats why my editorial says theres some hopeful signs here but we cant really be conclusive
4462580 well why should we want to use all of these medications and especially the combination one
4462581 if the three drug therapies are giving exactly the same slope of decline the same improvement in slope of decline which one of the three should we choose
4462582 they should choose the safest one and thats the salmeterol by itself
4462583 it will alter my practice probably as of this afternoon when i go for a clinic to see a new copd patient
4462584 there is a slightly higher chance of pneumonia of getting an infection of the lung when you use the combination at least when you use either the inhaled corticosteroids or inhaled corticosteroids with the salmeterol
4462585 so yes there is a slight risk but it is relatively small and it does not affect mortality
4462586 the main finding is that for the first time its been shown that administering pharmacotherapy to patients with copd can change and modify the clinical course of their disease
4462587 the place that has suffered most is south ossetia which is home to both ethnic ossetians and georgians the latter accounting for about a third of the population
4462588 ossetians fleeing the conflict zone talk of georgian atrocities and the indiscriminate killing of civilians
4462589 on august 7 after days of shooting incidents in the south ossetian conflict zone georgian president mikheil saakashvili made a speech in which he said that he had given the georgian villagers orders not to fire that he wanted to offer south ossetia unlimited autonomy within the georgian state with russia to be a guarantor of the arrangement
4462590 both sides said they were discussing a meeting the next day to discuss how to defuse the clashes
4462591 that evening however saakashvili went for the military option the georgian military launched a massive artillery attack on tskhinvali followed the next day by a ground assault involving tanks
4462592 this was a city with no pure military targets full of civilians who had been given no warning and were expecting peace talks at any moment
4462593 the attack looked designed to take everybody by surprise perhaps because much of the russian leadership was in beijing for the opening of the olympic games it also unilaterally destroyed the negotiating and peacekeeping arrangements under the aegis of the organization for security and cooperation in europe that have been in place for 16 years russian peacekeeping troops based in south ossetia were among those killed in the georgian assault
4462594 many had traveled in their nightclothes on rocky roads through the mountains and gave bloodcurdling accounts of georgian atrocities i came in the boot of a car georgian snipers were firing at us from the forest my brother stayed to fight our grandparents home was reduced to rubble we dont know where they are nothing is left of their village it was totally destroyed by rockets and tank fire alisa mamiyeva 26 a teacher in tskhinvali said from the safety of vladikavkaz in north ossetia
4462595 russia failed to back up its claims of georgian atrocities
4462596 coverage in the u s and europe is leaning heavily toward reports on the georgian casualties of russian bombing over the weekend few details are being given about the thousands said to have been killed when georgia attacked tskhinvali the capital of south ossetia on thursday and friday
4462597 the figure of 2 000 people killed is very doubtful our findings so far do not in any way confirm the russian statistics on the contrary they suggest the numbers are exaggerated
4462598 one woman told how a family of four including two children tried to flee from a georgian tank but it fired on their car and they were all burned to death said angela who like all the refugees only gave her first name
4462599 she saw the georgian tanks roll into tskhinvali the soldiers shouting hail saakashvili who is the president of georgia they destroyed the city added inna 33 who said she could not understand how the georgian troops could do that to civilians
4462600 you see your friends home burning and theres nothing you can do you just watch and cry its a genocide inna said an old woman among the refugees said all she had left was the dress she was wearing my house is destroyed she said

4462893 the thing is were on the warped tour now and weve never played warped before and were not like a typical warped band but i guess a lot of kids asked us to be there
4462894 so were playing the mosh set on warped because we want to make sure the kids get to beat the sh out of each other because we know thats what they like to do
4462895 when you think warped you dont think of a band like us
4462896 we wear a lot of bright clothes we shake our butts a lot were very sarcastic were electronic usually warped is about the mosh but the truth is the scene is changing a lot these days and what unites all the bands on warped isnt a specific musical sound but its more of an ethic there are so many different types of bands on warped i cant tell you how surprised i am to have made friends with some of these bands that i thought were totally going to think were pu s like story of the year i just thought theyd hate us they listen to metal they have tattoos and were best buds on this tour the common thread of warped is the ethic

4462906 he flagrantly disrespects a police officer is found guilty of disorderly conduct and never tells anyone after 10 years of scandal and embarrassing headlines we dont need more of the same we deserve a congressman who will tell the truth
4462907 at a time when hes under investigation and running from revelations of election fraud and bribery the davis campaign is practicing the lowest form of politics by distorting simple facts
4462908 jon was written a ticket for jaywalking never arrested and never showed any disrespect to law enforcement
4462909 i wonder how many people at that press conference put their lives on the line in iraq how can they criticize someone who braved the horrors of that war and then willingly returned to help the many children from families that were killed or displaced by the war

4462923 while im not going to comment about those specific allegations its my view that anyone who is illegally involved in diverting water in the murray darling system during this crisis is engaging in an act of terrorism against the people of australia
4462924 this essentially does breach that agreement because it does allow for water to be diverted out of the flood plain for irrigation
4462925 it is a criminal offence and anyone siphoning water off illegally in my view should be locked up rather than the fines that i am told are currently in place
4462926 anyone who is doing this sort of thing is unbelievably treacherous to the national interest and its an act of terrorism against the australian people
4462927 aus taktischen gr nden haben wir die m nner noch nicht mit den vorw rfen konfrontiert
4462928 o you who believe observing as sawm fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you that you may become al muttaqun the pious
4462929 o mankind worship your lord allah who created you and those who were before you so that you may become al muttaqun
4462930 allah the exalted said all the deeds of the son of adam are his except for as siyam for it is mine and i will reward for it
4462931 the sa im has two happy moments when he breaks his fast he is happy and when he meets his lord he is happy because of his fast
4462932 it means he is happy because his hunger and thirst have ended since he is allowed to break his fast
4462933 and allah has those whom he frees from the fire and this occurs every night meaning in ramadan
4462934 as siyam and the quran will intercede on behalf of the slave
4462935 the five prayers and from friday to the next friday and ramadan to the next ramadan are erasers for what occurs between them as long as major sins are avoided
4462936 whoever fasts ramadan with iman and ih tisab will have his previous sins forgiven
4462937 and also what will occur later on meaning future sins as well
4462938 voc n o pode voar como aquelas aves voc uma galinha e galinhas n o voam
4462939 the ways of allah are very difficult to understand he puts people through many changes to prepare them to play their role in life
4462940 allah the almighty creator alone is enough to bring about a change in this world we must turn to allah with our whole heart and soul seek forgiveness and come back to the fold of islam be regular in your salaah being the five times daily prayers and read holy quran be kind to your non muslim and christian brothers try to bring them back again to the fold of islam jesus is the second messenger of islam may the peace of the almighty be upon him

4462949 must be preceded by a passive affirmative nonchallenging attitude toward change among the mass of our people they must feel so frustrated so defeated so lost so futureless in the prevailing system that they are willing to let go of the past and change the future
4462950 and their arrogance is the major threat to our future as a free society

4462957 anyone who is working against the haves is always facing odds and in many cases heavy odds if he or she does not have that complete self confidence or call it ego that he can win then the battle is lost before it is even begun
4462958 ego must be so all pervading that the personality of the organizer is contagious that it converts the people from despair to defiance creating a mass ego
4462959 it is the schizophrenia of a free society that we outwardly espouse faith in the people but inwardly have strong doubts whether the people can be trusted
4462960 turn to an extreme chauvinism and become defenders of the american faith
4462961 just as you cant go through red lights every time you just feel like it or hit someone any time you just feel like it you dont just eat anything you feel like it at any time that is unhealthy some people say any denial is unhealthy that is like saying you can just wet your pants when you feel like it self control is cleaner in body and spirit

4462972 last year i wrote about pure the club in edinburgh i played at between 1990 and 2000 that rambling can be found further down this page on june 10th 2006 the venue which was pures home closed its doors as a nightclub to await conversion into yet more luxury flats for edinburghs booming property market it really feels like edinburghs cultural soul is being sucked out of it at the moment but then nothing is able to stand in the way of rampant capitalism on friday june 9th we were invited back by the venue to do one last final farewell pure this was the last ever pure no more anniversary parties no more reunions without the venue existing anymore this had to be the end all good things should go out with a bang and this last blast was no exception while perhaps not quite scaling the heights of the craziness of the early 90s the atmosphere came pretty close and a legion of old faces came out of the woodwork to say goodbye i thought i would feel quite sad that the venue was shutting but there was so much love in the air that the only thing that did make me sad was the thought that there would be a lot of people i would probably never see again around 850 people crammed themselves in for this last hurrah and amongst them were a fair few people who were having their first and last experience of pure i was asked by a few of them if pure had always been this intense both musically and atmospherically i answered in the affirmative and a couple of them then asked me if i had any mixes from the early days of pure sadly the early days of pure are very badly documented as i think we were all too busy having crazy times to think about recording very much of it for posterity both myself and my co conspirator andy brainstorm made several pure mix tapes over the years but i have long ago given them all away so i thought id do a mix to give a taste of what pure was like im not sure how well this captures the intensity but hopefully it captures some of the diversity of music and shows that the techno we played covered a very wide spectrum of sound most of the music on this mix is from the early years of pure for me 1987 1994 was a golden age of innovation in electronic dance music while many great records came out in the next few years after that by the mid to late 90s it seemed the originality and diversity in sound had more or less dissipated and a lot of the music being produced was fairly uniform and all about how hard it was thats when i decided i had to start optimo thankfully electronic dance music subsequently found its way again and today we enjoy a diversity of sound in dance music that at one time i feared would never return at 40 minutes this mix cant begin to touch on all the music that was played at pure over the years we also played lots of deep new york and chicago house detroit techno sheffield bass uk and belgian rave particularly the mighty r amp s records from ghent which on reflection it seems a bit of an oversight to not have included anything they released and countless other offshoots of house and techno music this mix concentrates more on the acid european north american techno and hardcore sides of the pure sound the sounds that we were perhaps the first in scotland to champion but does also include a couple of deep space pure moments and the odd track that on first exposure literally had some people running for the doors in fear the mix is just over 40 minutes long and is 38mb apologies for some of the records sounding a little rough but pure was a tough environment for vinyl

4462977 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4462978 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4462979 we know when it touches us and he knew that so thats where it comes into calling it on yourself because its the right thing to do
4462980 should i expect him to do that maybe not maybe i shouldnt expect people to hold themselves to high standards sportsmanship
4462981 but yes i did expect it a little more so in the olympics when were all competing under the banner of this event being to promote sportsmanship to promote goodwill amongst countries
4462982 that was heat of the moment stuff he hit it right at me
4462983 probably didnt want to hear an apology right away because i thought it was intentional when we changed sides he said sorry its part of the game you were on top of the game
4462984 i said okay thats fine its part of the game youre right move on and we did
4462985 i know him very well ive played him many times on tour he does everything in his power to win
4462986 usually its within the rules sometimes its bordering on gamesmanship
4462987 but hes too good of a player to do something like that and to act like that thats why its disappointing because he is a great player

4463075 china crescent is an early stage business and our first priority has been establishing an initial revenue footprint china is a big economy and establishing an operation of some mass is important we are on track to meet our 50 million revenue forecast remember we historically have higher revenue in the second half of the year and being on track to meet our revenue forecast we are working on our bottom line and having results earlier than expected
4463076 we are very pleased with our chinese subsidiarys continued improvement of its fundamental financials especially its increase in net income after independently listing our chinese operations less than two years ago our chinese subsidiary has matured nicely we have made it a point to improve the financial performance of all the companies in the newmarket family with a focus on both revenue growth and improved bottom line after a two year hiatus from mergers and acquisitions we know that continuing to improve our fundamental financial performance will be helpful as we seek a higher caliber of candidates for acquisition newmarkets recently announced plans to acquire everex are evidence of our increasing financial maturity
4463077 we are pleased with our performance in the second quarter of 2008 and we are particularly gratified with the significant reductions in operating expenses at each of our business units as well as at the corporate level resulting in a 67 reduction in net loss in the quarter we continue to see the positive effects of our emphasis on cost controls while at the same time focusing on sales of higher margin products and services we are especially satisfied with the significant revenue increase in the quarter at our tbs business unit which showed a 23 sales increase over the prior year period
4463078 our recent acquisition of questys solutions is in keeping with our strategy of continuing to acquire intellectual and technology assets that will enhance broaden and improve our product offerings this strategic acquisition which increases our client roster to more than 1 400 provides a critical document management component and cohesiveness to our suite of outsourced business solutions which will accelerate our growth and enable us to significantly expand sales opportunities within each of our operating business units as well as attract new business
4463079 our revenue in the second quarter was weaker than the prior year as we completed several large r amp d contracts in 2007 unfortunately 3 million department of defense and department of energy funding approved by congress for fiscal year 2008 r amp d services which we expected in the second quarter wont begin until the third quarter we were extremely disappointed that the defense logistics agency recently decided to cancel the previously announced 5 million kiowa helicopter supply contract that we had expected to begin shipping in the second quarter we are pursuing discussions with the appropriate department of defense officials to assess future battery requirements for the kiowa helicopter program as a result these delays and cancellations our order backlog has not been replenished in time to replace the revenues from the completed contracts
4463080 with the receipt of ul certification for our 2 2 ampere hour model 18650axa rechargeable lithium ion cylindrical cell we placed the assets associated with our florida facility into service on may 1 2008 and began to classify the costs of the florida operation as cost of product revenue this resulted in incremental depreciation of approximately 250 000 per month and a significant increase in the gross loss as we have not yet reached a level of manufacturing volume sufficient to absorb all the costs of the plant we expect significant losses to continue until we obtain orders sufficient to achieve high volume manufacturing
4463081 the startup of our florida facility has taken longer and cost more than originally planned to provide added focus on this critical period of the companys growth i have assumed the role as acting general manager of the facility and have hired additional key staff james manning previously chief operating officer of lithium technology corporation has joined the company as director of engineering graydon hansen previously president and general manager of electric fuel battery corporation has joined the company as director of operations both bring great depth of experience and leadership to our florida operation
4463082 we have begun aggressively marketing our manufacturing capabilities and products and have been actively supplying potential customers with sample 2 2 and 2 4 ampere hour cells the level of interest from potential customers is high and we have already received orders valued over 100 000 for these products in the past two weeks although we are confident in our ability to ramp up manufacturing and produce high quality cells and that our marketing efforts will result in a steady flow of customer orders the timing of customer commitments order volume and delivery schedules will be unpredictable until we have an established backlog and ongoing customer relationships
4463083 the company needs an immediate infusion of operating capital in order to maintain operations we believe that our ongoing capital requirements are consistent with those of companies that are in a similar early stage of development we recently completed a warrant sale to an existing investor to provide limited bridge funding and we are currently in discussions with existing investors and new investors to raise additional capital as our business develops we must continue to raise additional capital our ability to realize our business plan will depend on our future success in capital raising activities

4463170 the loans and liquidity the us government provided hasnt cured the situation we have to clear all the bad debts and silly spending no amount of government spending can hurry that process or help alleviate that
4463171 its still early to say its the end of the super cycle but if the markets continue to fall like they are doing now i am sure many people will be talking about it very soon
4463172 many of the shakier speculators and investors have probably baled out in the last few days
4463173 they will probably not be seen in the market for sometime to come
4463174 physical demand is back again and this will most likely get stronger from sept onwards the increase in net production if any at all is happening at a very slow pace and secondary supplies are reducing
4463175 our colleagues from hong kong report that after the recent price drop they have seen robust demand coming not only from the jewelry sector but also from other industrial end users

4463177 the difference in improvement between patients taking placebos and patients taking antidepressants is not very great
4463178 this means that depressed people can improve without chemical treatments
4463179 given these results there seems little reason to prescribe antidepressant medication to any but the most severely depressed patients unless alternative treatments have failed to provide a benefit
4463180 this study raises serious issues that need to be addressed surrounding drug licensing and how drug trial data is reported
4463181 extensive scientific and medical experience has demonstrated that fluoxetine is an effective antidepressant
4463182 since its discovery in 1972 fluoxetine has become one of the worlds most studied medicines
4463183 more than 40 million people suffering from depression have been treated with fluoxetine in over 100 countries around the world
4463184 the authors have failed to acknowledge the very positive benefits these treatments have provided to patients and their families dealing with depression and their conclusions are at odds with what has been seen in actual clinical practice
4463185 it is widely recognised by experts in the field that studies in depression are challenging and very difficult to conduct
4463186 this one study should not be used to cause unnecessary alarm and concern for patients
4463187 if these results were upheld in further studies they would be very disturbing
4463188 if validated this research would mean that psychological therapies would be the only available treatments for the majority of people but these do not work for everyone particularly those with severe clinical depression
4463189 these results are focused on clinical effectiveness rather than health risks
4463190 this is about very sick people theres something wrong with their brains
4463191 if you are currently taking an antidepressant drug and its working for you by no means stop
4463192 what really bothers me is that big pharma allows marketing directly to consumers
4463193 is this can we dump on the mentally ill once again
4463194 their families tell them to snap out of it and to get a grip
4463195 these slowly proceeding neurophysiological adaptions of the brain tissue are the reason why usually several weeks of continuous ssri use are necessary for the antidepressant effect to become fully manifested citation needed and why increased anxiety is a common side effect in the first few days or weeks of use
4463196 finally i quit the ssri when i thought i was clear of the panic attacks and depression 3 days after dead smack quitting the drug i got so depressed i wanted to take my own life in my car at work that shit messes with your head way more then marijuana or booze let me tell you
4463197 i quite ssri when i thought i was clear of panic attacks and depression

4463215 the administration and council has lots of thinking to do about how to proceed
4463216 personally i think we should do whats best for this neighborhood its residents and the taxpayers around the city as a whole
4463217 spending more energy time and money on defeating our own residents is to my mind a mistake
4463218 im only one vote but i would like to put aside our differences and in a public and consensually determined framework move forward with infill rebuild this neighborhood and move on
4463219 the city can put forth additional information it has that the properties are subject to blight designation and necessary for the redevelopment plan
4463220 there is significant additional information including transcripts of the planning board hearing in 1996 police records zoning department records planning department records and testimony of the planners who prepared the plan
4463221 all of the citys efforts of good faith negotiations were upheld by the court
4463222 all of the allegations of conflicts of interest of my firm my self the council were all thrown out
4463223 that part of the decision is particularly pleasing to council the mayor and all of our professionals
4463224 at this point the homeowners won and long branch lost
4463225 it is inconceivable to me that the city has any secret evidence that will make a difference
4463226 the decision of the court is that we won unless long branch can pull some ace out of its sleeve
4463227 we will ask judge lawson for a dismissal and we will also ask for counsel fees and costs
4463228 it is clear from the documents produced by long branch that this term means single family residential
4463229 the city interprets this term to mean that they could proceed to acquire these properties and build an additional 185 residential condominiums
4463230 the court will be asked to determine whether or not the mtotsa area acquisitions are necessary for the implementation of the redevelopment plan
4463231 its too late for the city to manufacture more evidence so the courts ruling is a fatal blow to the city
4463232 the victory for the long branch homeowners is a victory for property owners across the garden state sending a clear message that abusers of eminent domain will be held accountable

4463240 in the claims the kings say school and county staff members failed to enforce the middle schools dress code that put the feminine dressing king at particular risk at a time when staff members knew he had unique vulnerabilities and was susceptible to abuse because of his perceived sexual orientation the claim says the family says educators knew the boy was at risk because he had been subjected to death threats at hathaway school an elementary campus he attended in oxnard king had told friends he was gay and he wore makeup jewelry and high heeled boots with his school uniform something dannenberg said the teen had the freedom to do under his first amendment rights assistant principal joy epstein the only person named in the complaint is accused of encouraging the boy to wear womens clothing shoes and makeup she created an environment of perceived safety for king when in fact she could not and did not protect larry from the threats and ultimate death the claim says
4463241 king was a ward of the court and living at the casa pacifica shelter for abused neglected and emotionally troubled children at the time of the shooting officials should have educated him at the casa pacifica shelter where he would have been safe instead of sending him to e o green the complaint alleges casa pacifica administrator steve elson said the county had stopped offering classes on campus in the wake of a federal law aimed at keeping kids in their normal neighborhood schools still the agency would have tried to accommodate a student if school or county officials were concerned about safety he said

4463262 im going to go to austria with one intention to win the shootout
4463263 its going to be tough against the best in europe
4463264 but i feel that i have the skills and the all round package to succeed its the biggest opportunity of my career
4463265 the training this year has stepped up a huge amount and my focus in all areas has improved massively the support and structure around me has been fantastic and will play a big part in my preparations for this event
4463266 this is a fantastic initiative from pirelli and is a wonderful opportunity for the right driver unsurprisingly there were a number of names mentioned as suitable candidates but we had only one ticket to hand out
4463267 adam was repeatedly identified as one of the most exciting british talents in years and has already been nominated by pirelli uk for their own star driver award this season
4463268 despite his age and relative inexperience i feel he is best equipped not only to win the shootout but importantly to make the most of the subsequent prize drive
4463269 sir have you heard the word of obama he whose middle name shant be uttered
4463270 yes well that and hope and inhalator but mostly we just talk about the change thing

4463273 es sind nicht die treehugger die ko fundamentalisten und gr nen spinner die unsere autos kaufen

4463283 if the international community allows russia to crush our democratic independent state it will be giving carte blanche to authoritarian governments everywhere russia intends to destroy not just a country but an idea
4463284 some argue that georgia is not a primary american interest they see georgia as ultimately a place that transits oil and gas through pipelines from somewhere else to turkey or onto europe georgia is unlucky geography this is false when this crisis ends georgia will be either a model for a world that works or a world whose members do business with knives
4463285 this small democracy far away from our shores is an inspiration to all those who cherish our deepest ideals as i told president saakashvili on the day the cease fire was declared today we are all georgians we mustnt forget it
4463286 i have staked my countrys fate on the wests rhetoric about democracy and liberty as georgians come under attack we must ask if the west is not with us who is it with if the line is not drawn now when will it be drawn

4463305 standing on the podium and hearing olympic champion next to my name was a dream come true
4463306 i just knew that i had to give the routine of my life
4463307 i was pretty far behind but i couldnt control that i gave a great meet today that was probably my favorite moment finishing on floor because i knew i had given it my all and i couldnt change anything
4463308 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe
4463309 just to know that he was so close to the all around gold and didnt quite achieve it
4463310 and i hope you know i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him i hope that this definitely tops it i have a few more to go but it is an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him out on the floor 20 years after he competed i think it just means so much more to both of us i dont know just all the hard work paying off all the injuries tears blood rips everything

4463316 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4463317 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4463318 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4463319 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4463320 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4463321 when lord hanningfield talks of boosting essexs business it makes you wonder how the county ever got by before
4463322 i am sure the countys businesses were doing just fine before these trips began
4463323 i think taxpayers will be sick and tired of their council leader going overseas on what many may feel is a jolly particularly in these difficult economic times when families are struggling to make ends meet
4463324 it is wrong that they are being forced to pay for these trips
4463325 with the games in beijing it is great opportunity to build on these links and to promote essex in the run up to london 2012
4463326 essex has the potential to benefit hugely from 2012 we estimate that it will leave a legacy worth 150million so it is important that we start laying the foundations now to make sure our whole county is able to benefit through improved investment jobs and sporting facilities
4463327 as a county we have a long and successful relationship with china in particular the jiangsu province with many schools in our county teaching mandarin and this years essex jiangsu cultural festival
4463328 while i am out in china i will also be meeting with hutchison ports and will be discussing with them regeneration opportunities along with major investment and improvements in our road network
4463329 the 2012 olympics will bring fantastic opportunities for essex and it is important for us to make sure we do all we can to learn from the beijing olympics
4463330 now hadleigh has been chosen to host the mountain biking event one of the key jobs whilst we are out there is to see what lessons we can learn from this unique opportunity in order for the south of the county to benefit from the legacy suffolk homes

4463334 obama will work tirelessly to uphold this nations sacred trust with its veterans to ensure they are not forgotten after they return home and he will provide our troops with the leadership they deserve as well as the support they and their families need
4463335 john mccain has been endorsed by more retired admirals and generals than barack obama has military donors
4463336 we feel confident that many u s troops stationed overseas will support john mccain in the election this fall but we suspect most are too busy doing the important work of defending this country than to make political contributions
4463337 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4463338 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4463339 were not real big on pointing fingers or attaching blame or airing this out in public
4463340 this is for america this is for nato this is for bush
4463341 want to kill the idea of freedom and by proxy they imagine they fight a war with the united states
4463342 the government is going to help you in the best way possible by doing nothing for you by getting out of your way well i exaggerate but you understand of course we will provide you with infrastructure and help by getting rid of corruption but you have all succeeded by your own initiative and enterprise so you should congratulate yourselves
4463343 the first thing we did a few years ago when i became president we fired the entire police force of the country
4463344 when the soviet union collapsed when the cold war was over when i went to study in the u s and finally i realized my dream i never thought that this evil would come back again i never thought the kgb people would again try to run the world and thats exactly whats happening now what s at stake here is americas americas ideals if it will collapse in georgia it will collapse in other countries and in other places as well
4463345 this is for america this is for nato this is for bush
4463346 at the end of the day youre going to pay the higher cost
4463347 we must take action on this very basic social net program for the most vulnerable in our society and demonstrate that we do have the opportunity to reach across the political aisle and give the americans what they deserve

4463352 argentina es la que est peor por lejos en el sentido de que su combinaci n de pol ticas est apalancada en forma muy significativa en los precios de las materias primas
4463353 argentina los ingresos extraordinarios que tuvo por las retenciones impuestos sobre las exportaciones se los fue asignando a mayores gastos por lo tanto cuando tenga menores ingresos alg n gasto se tiene que cortar o ver c mo se renueva la deuda
4463354 la dependencia que tiene venezuela de su petr leo es una enorme vulnerabilidad
4463355 sin los ingresos del petr leo ser muy dif cil para el gobierno mantener el saldo comercial el resultado fiscal y el nivel de gasto p blico como para mantener contento al pueblo de ch vez

4463375 a m s de un tercio de las industrias valencianas bloqueadas a la espera de la autorizaci n ambiental de la generalitat
4463376 reconoce que las 593 solicitudes de autorizaci n ambientales integradas presentadas por instalaciones industriales 537 ya existentes en 2006 y 56 nuevas s lo ha resuelto 414
4463377 m s de un tercio de las industrias valencianas no est n controladas por el consell
4463378 muchas nuevas industrias no pueden iniciar su actividad porque el consell se muestra incapaz de realizar su trabajo
4463379 tambi n reconoce que 17 industrias ya existentes en 2006 han solicitado la autorizaci n as como 49 nuevas instalaciones pero solo se han resuelto nueve expedientes
4463380 evidencia que la lentitud del consell en la tramitaci n de los permisos ambientales perjudica a la actividad econ mica valenciana y a la calidad de vida de los ciudadanos
4463381 son las medidas microecon micas las que facilitan la salida r pida de la crisis no los grandes aspavientos y gestos grandilocuentes a los que nos tiene acostumbrados el consell
4463382 forman parte de estas posibilidades que tiene el consell de dinamizar la econom a con el simple hecho de que la gesti n administrativa de la generalitat no introduzca fricciones en el sistema sino al contrario lo lubrique
4463383 contrataciones a dedo que la han convertido en la conselleria con menos funcionarios de la generalitat
4463384 frente al recorte social anunciado por el presidente del gobierno jos luis rodr guez zapatero
4463385 el trabajo comprometido del gobierno valenciano en pol tica social es un aval para que estas nuevas plazas supongan un

4463387 ya son 50 074 las personas que han sido valoradas de las que 30 979 tienen reconocido el derecho a prestaci n mientras que las restantes 19 095 indic presentan un grado y nivel que no est en vigor seg n la ley y que por lo tanto no se les puede reconocer ning n derecho seg n lo previsto en el actual sistema de la dependencia
4463388 pidan a zapatero que el gobierno central se implique econ micamente en la aplicaci n de la ley cuyo cumplimiento hasta 2014 requerir m s de 6 900 millones de euros
4463389 necesita que el gobierno de zapatero aporte una media de 1 000 millones de euros anuales para que pueda atenderse las necesidades de las personas dependientes porque lo que estas personas necesitan no es una pol tica de marketing sino una pol tica con presupuesto para que puedan beneficiarse de ella
4463390 demuestra que cuando se quiere trabajar conjuntamente se puede hacer
4463391 si hay voluntad de colaborar agreg se colabora y se consiguen resultados muy importantes y positivos como ste
4463392 el control gubernamental la manipulaci n de los informativos los proyectos de privatizaci n fracasados y el incumplimiento del requisito ling stico
4463393 al fin reconozca la magnitud del problema de la financiaci n de rtvv que camps hasta ahora hab a negado en su l nea habitual de triunfalismo sin sentido
4463394 ahora bien el cambio a rtvv no se puede limitar a las cuestiones econ micas sino que debe servir por cambiar de arriba abajo el modelo de televisi n de manipulaci n de masas al servicio del partido en el poder
4463395 necesidad de cambiar el modelo actual de gesti n pero sin que esto sea aprovechado para hacer una reducci n de plantilla porque la crisis no lo deben pagar los trabajadores
4463396 son ya unas v as de tr fico urbano interno al haber dejado de ser el itinerario necesario para todos los veh culos que se ve an obligados a recorrerlas y que generaban un tr fico de paso adicional
4463397 conforme los ciudadanos conocen esta v a alternativa m s la utilizan
4463398 se debe articular en varios ejes y contar con los agentes sociales
4463399 una treintena de fundaciones y entes p blicos que se han convertido en agujeros negros donde se cuelan millones de euros en pol ticas huecas o propagand sticas como al fundaci n agua y progreso
4463400 ni existen en su cuant a y en cualquier caso se demuestran su fracaso cuando vemos como la comunitat valenciana lidera el paro la morosidad y la destrucci n de empresas
4463401 si tuvi ramos que juzgar dichas medidas con los resultados no hay duda de que el calificativo ser a de absoluto fracaso y m s cuando afirman que en apenas tres meses han ejecutado el 60 por ciento
4463402 partidas reales que permitan a las empresas su modernizaci n y una mejora en la financiaci n de las mismas por lo que solicit a las entidades financieras valencianas a que asuman su responsabilidad en tiempos dif ciles y apoyen al tejido productivo valenciano
4463403 el pacto valenciano contra la crisis debe contar con un esfuerzo que permita invertir m s en obra p blica por lo que es urgente liberar recursos que el consell pierde con su pol tica de despilfarro constante
4463404 ha reducido en un 48 por ciento la inversi n en obra p blica en el primer semestre de este a o lo que supone un recorte de casi 500 millones de euros cuando el camino a seguir es intensificar la obra publica como hacen en la mayor a de comunidades
4463405 atender las necesidades de los ciudadanos y las empresas de manera directa en tiempos de crisis
4463406 la urgente puesta en marcha del fondo de compensaci n local
4463407 es necesario fortalecer las posiciones de la comunitat mediante el consenso de las fuerzas pol ticas valencianas de cara a una negociaci n sobre el modelo de financiaci n en el que se debe contemplar el incremento de la poblaci n y tambi n los d ficits hist ricos en inversiones sufridas durante los ocho a os de gobierno de aznar
4463408 en la lealtad hacia los ciudadanos y podamos entre todos hacer frente a tiempos dif ciles e impulsar acuerdos en materias como el agua o la urgente implantaci n de la ley de dependencia en la comunitat valenciana
4463409 es hora de que camps asuma su responsabilidad y no trate de imputar sus errores a otros

4463411 en 1708 senent pl un carbonero de villalonga encontr la imagen de la virgen de la fuente flotando en una caja en el r o serpis

4463414 recuperaci n de la normalidad por la v a de dotar de m s liquidez a las econom as de los ciudadanos particulares al suprimir el impuesto sobre el patrimonio o adelantando la deducci n mensual del iva

4463418 la mejora de la seguridad vial tanto para peatones como para veh culos en los tramos de carretera
4463419 una mayor calidad de vida para los ciudadanos de estos municipios
4463420 en general las traves as agudizan los problemas planteados en los entornos urbanos al tener que compatibilizar los tr ficos de agitaci n generados en la traves a con el flujo de paso propio de la carretera y la presencia de peatones
4463421 presentan una mayor intensidad de tr fico y afectan a la calidad de vida de los ciudadanos
4463422 una reducci n del tr fico muy importante por el interior del casco urbano as como una disminuci n de la siniestralidad
4463423 una mayor fluidez en el tr nsito lo que provocar una reducci n en los tiempos de recorrido
4463424 mejora la accesibilidad con el entorno y en ocasiones facilita el desarrollo urban stico residencial e industrial de las zonas afectadas
4463425 ventajas medioambientales ya que se eliminan las molestias que pueden producir a los vecinos la poluci n atmosf rica y contaminaci n ac stica que genera el paso de veh culos
4463426 los accesos a las futuras instalaciones aeroportuarias de castell n
4463427 el importante flujo de tr fico de tipo industrial por el interior del n cleo urbano de vila real recomienda realizar una ronda urbana que discurre al sudoeste de la poblaci n
4463428 se dise a para una velocidad de 120 km h mediante un trazado variante y dejando la actual cv 50 para las conexiones de la red local
4463429 facilitar la integraci n social del colectivo inmigrante reforzando as el tejido asociativo de este colectivo y ayud ndolo a incorporarse dentro del espectro asociativo de la ciudad
4463430 es imprescindible trabajar por el di logo por la integraci n por el asociacionismo y por combatir sin cuartel la xenofobia y el racismo
4463431 la ausencia de mando que tiene el gobierno de espa a frente a las situaciones dif ciles que vive el pa s y sobre todo la comunitat valenciana
4463432 la falta de seguridad con la que diariamente se encuentran los funcionarios de la c rcel de picassent valencia
4463433 despu s de un mes y medio el gobierno socialista todav a no haya tomado medidas para atajar este gran problema como es que desde el 1 de julio se han producido 242 incidentes que no se pueden justificar con la gran saturaci n del centro penitenciario o porque en per odo estival el personal trabaja bajo m nimos
4463434 si estos son los problemas que adecuen los medios necesarios para las exigencias reales del centro
4463435 es intolerable que el trabajo se convierta en un miedo para el personal de la c rcel y que el gobierno socialista se queda de brazos cruzados mientras su presidente se regala unas vacaciones sin haber hecho los deberes puesto que los sindicatos llevan denunciando la situaci n reiteradas ocasiones
4463436 una vez m s la comunitat valenciana es ninguneada por el presidente zapatero y es la primera del ranking de sus olvidos porque ni pidi ndole el director de la c rcel de picassent que act e hace caso
4463437 ahora estoy en el villarreal y muy centrado y muy contento de seguir aqu tan contento que me gustar a quedarme mucho m s tiempo
4463438 ojal mi representante pueda negociar y llegar a un acuerdo con el club y si es posible dejar cerrada una renovaci n
4463439 es mi equipo estoy muy a gusto y es mi casa
4463440 a m no me ha llamado nadie ni me ha interesado tampoco este es un equipo que est creciendo mucho va bien en la liga esta en la liga de campeones y aspira a m s
4463441 tras la eurocopa siento el reconocimiento de la gente y eso me pone muy contento y feliz pero como ya dije yo sigo siendo el de siempre y no ha cambiado nada
4463442 reforzar la prevenci n ante el riesgo de posibles incendios forestales
4463443 de este modo tres aviones semipesados air tractor de la generalitat cargados con agua y retardante recorrer n todo el territorio de la comunitat valenciana de manera que se posibilita la actuaci n inmediata en un incendio en el momento en el que se detecta desde el aire facilitando su control debido a que se interviene en el inicio del incendio en la mayor a de las ocasiones
4463444 garantizar la seguridad y tranquilidad de los ciudadanos en estos d as festivos y vacacionales pero tambi n a adi incrementar las medidas de protecci n de los espacios naturales de la comunitat valenciana
4463445 por la gastronom a la hosteler a y el golf
4463446 poner en valor la inversi n que se hizo en el claustrillo
4463447 en ruinas y se mantendr as pero se acondicionar para tener mejor accesibilidad y poderlo visitar favoreciendo que el visitante se haga una idea de lo que era el palacio y el claustro
4463448 existe ya un anteproyecto realizado por el arquitecto salvador vila responsable tambi n del refectorio y conservador del edificio y en breve comenzar a trabajar con el proyecto definitivo
4463449 estoy muy a gusto aqu la gente me trata muy bien por eso
4463450 para m la familia es lo principal siempre me han ayudado en todo es una cosa muy importante que est n muy bien como yo

4463453 si en ese hipot tico pacto hubiera seguridad tuvi ramos garant as de que los intereses de castilla la mancha iban a estar preservados que bamos a tener asegurada todo el agua que necesitamos en aras de un pacto nacional que fuera conveniente para todos los espa oles no ser a yo el espa ol que pusiera obst culos a un acuerdo de esta naturaleza
4463454 que garantizara nuestras necesidades y nos diera garant a absoluta de que bamos a tener toda el agua necesaria para no ver comprometido ni nuestro desarrollo actual ni el venidero
4463455 s lo as lo podr amos considerar pero mientras tanto de ninguna manera
4463456 c mo vamos a negar este derecho pero no para mantener desarrollos que no son sostenibles
4463457 siempre se fijan en el tajo el tajo desemboca en el atl ntico como aprendimos de peque os no en el mediterr neo por lo tanto el tajo tiene que tener garant as de un caudal ecol gico de que va a ver agua suficiente no s lo en cantidad sino en calidad y para eso lo que no se puede hacer es estar sacando agua permanentemente del tajo
4463458 puestos a imaginar de d nde sacar el agua que se centren en una cosa que no es ciencia ficci n que es la desalaci n se desala ya con eficiencia se consiguen desaladoras muy eficaces cada vez con menos gasto energ tico
4463459 y ellos tienen esa alternativa de la que nosotros carecemos

4463472 hasta hace 40 a os los volteos de campanas en la catedral de valencia durante la fiesta de la asunci n de la virgen eran los m s prolongados del a o tanto como el de fiestas como el corpus christi
4463473 desde la d cada de los 70 muchos valencianos est n fuera de la ciudad este mes por vacaciones lo que ha propiciado que los actos en honor a la virgen el 15 de agosto se acorten y por ello tambi n son m s breves los volteos que acompa an esos momentos
4463474 hasta hace 40 a os los volteos de campanas en la catedral de valencia durante la fiesta de la asunci n de la virgen eran los m s prolongados del a o tanto como el de fiestas como el corpus christi

4463476 excesivamente alto pues supone un 30 por ciento del presupuesto total de la generalitat que es de 13 000 millones de euros por lo que al sumar la deuda el riesgo asumido es muy superior ya que el margen de movimiento en caso de impagos es muy reducido
4463477 la posibilidad de impagos por parte de las empresas y entidades p blicas es algo m s que un futurible y de hecho continu ya se ha producido en el caso de la empresa proyecto cultural castell n s a
4463478 ha dejado de pagar los intereses de un pr stamo de 12 millones de euros por importe de 717 000 euros
4463479 tiene un riesgo vivo avalado de 59 millones de euros aval sobre el que l gicamente se va a ejecutar el impago
4463480 el saldo de 2007 es negativo para la administraci n auton mica y el riesgo crece
4463481 pensar sobre el riesgo que le van a permitir las entidades financieras espa olas o extranjeras a la generalitat es infinito y una imprudencia en una situaci n de crisis salvo que el consell matiz est dispuesto a acudir a prestamistas a intereses m s altos con lo que se estar a incrementando la dependencia y reduciendo a n m s la capacidad de inversi n de la generalitat
4463482 el consell ha resuelto los problemas contables con incrementos de deuda pero el cr dito se le ha acabado y ya no puede seguir endeud ndose
4463483 a partir de ahora va a poder pagar intereses de la deuda generada que significan unos 293 millones de euros anuales
4463484 comienzan a predominar los trabajos m s modernos y minimalistas sobre los tradicionales que se presentaban en otras ediciones
4463485 los espa oles van a tener que continuar sufriendo esta crisis por culpa de un gobierno irresponsable y huidizo al que no le viene de cara adoptar ninguna iniciativa de aplicaci n inmediata para que la econom a comience a respirar desde ya que ser a lo deseable para todos
4463486 no aporta nada nuevo al desolador panorama econ mico ya que la mayor a de las medidas anunciadas este jueves no son m s que un refrito de todo lo que hab a venido anunciando en anteriores ocasiones y que no han logrado ning n efecto porque ni siquiera han comenzado a aplicarse
4463487 deber a aprender del ejecutivo de francisco camps que arropa a los valencianos en las horas m s bajas de la econom a espa ola
4463488 para actuar all donde los ciudadanos de nuestra comunitat m s lo necesiten
4463489 no son virtuales sino pr cticas y reales porque se trata de un plan que pr cticamente se ha puesto en marcha en su totalidad en un plazo brev simo de dos meses
4463490 frente al ejecutivo que llega tarde con promesas recicladas que nunca ejecuta se encuentra el gobierno auton mico que da cuenta de las medidas que ya se est n llevando a cabo
4463491 las lecciones para dinamizar la econom a no las tiene que dar al consell de francisco camps sino a sus compa eros de madrid y sobre todo al presidente zapatero porque todav a no ha asumido que espa a vive en crisis la peor en d cadas
4463492 mientras l est de vacaciones en do ana miles de espa oles viajan obligados al paro

4463495 se acaba en septiembre y no hay tiempo material para hacerlo
4463496 nos queremos sentar para hacer una televisi n de verdad
4463497 esta empresa genera m s p rdidas y cuando llegan las devoluciones no devolvemos nada de dinero
4463498 se desprende una cr tica tanto de su modelo de financiaci n
4463499 como de su evoluci n econ mica financiera que le hace estar en situaci n concursal permanente
4463500 tambi n se cuestiona el descontrol de ingresos y gastos
4463501 contratos leoninos que se firmaron con nuestros equipos de futbol
4463502 injustificadas tanto las cifras por las que se compran esos derechos como por las que se venden
4463503 debe tratar de negociar la compra de derechos deportivos y su posterior reventa a precios razonables y suficientes para obtener un beneficio de los mismos
4463504 tambi n pone en cuesti n los contratos realizados con empresas productoras que se realizan sin ning n criterio objetivo la ca da de los ingresos por publicidad y la pol tica de personal
4463505 necesidad de realizar un plan de estabilidad presupuestaria para rtvv y sus sociedades sin que ni el director general ni su equipo directivo hayan informado al consejo de administraci n ni hayan adoptado medida alguna al respecto
4463506 desconocemos como se est elaborando el anteproyecto de presupuestos para 2009 as como el desarrollo de la idea de poner en marcha el llamado contrato programa y sobre todo el cumplimiento de los objetivos marcados en nuestra ley de creaci n de ser una televisi n plural objetiva e independiente al servicio de todos los valencianos y no s lo de un partido pol tico el pp y de un presidente
4463507 se trata de un texto hilarante defendido a capa y espada por unos actores excelentes
4463508 plauto era un comedi grafo posiblemente el mejor del mundo latino
4463509 fue precursor de lo que posteriormente ser an las comedias p caras de enredo y vodeviles
4463510 todo lo que se cuenta en esta representaci n es parte del mundo y de la actualidad
4463511 no ha cambiado tanto en estos dos mil a os

4463515 no voy a hablar de plazos porque los plazos son medi ticamente muy importantes pero para la toma de decisiones lo m s importante es adecuar acertar con el modelo y dar el mejor servicio al ciudadano
4463516 respalda la reivindicaci n del consell de garantizar el mismo trato para todos los aeropuertos
4463517 se desarrolle de forma simult nea en todos los aeropuertos espa oles para evitar cualquier tipo de discriminaci n entre la comunidades aut nomas
4463518 por fin la ministra de fomento ha rectificado la medida que adoptada de restringir la participaci n de las comunidades aut nomas en la gesti n aeroportuaria
4463519 fijar un m nimo de 30 millones de pasajeros para acceder a formulas de cogesti n supone dejar fuera de juego a aeropuertos tan importantes y necesarios como l altet o manises dos aeropuertos estrat gicos que son fundamentales en el desarrollo econ mico de la comunidad valenciana y del resto del estado
4463520 por la gastronom a la hosteler a y el golf
4463521 se ha hecho una puesta en com n para alcanzar un objetivo que es prioritario poner al sector tur stico de orihuela en primer nivel porque a pesar de la crisis que sufren la mayor a de los sectores la oferta oriolana cuenta con una calidad que se va a seguir manteniendo ya que ste es el principal sector es el m s productivo y el que m s puestos de trabajo genera
4463522 si hace a os se hizo una apuesta ya consolidada por el turismo residencial ahora se quiere equilibrar la balanza con el turismo de plazas hoteleras vertebrando todo el territorio y apostando por lo que todo el sector requiere que es una oferta de calidad con establecimientos punteros
4463523 por un lado tomar el pulso y conocer de primera mano c mo afecta la poca de crisis econ mica al sector tur stico y por otro lado tras este balance buscar soluciones a corto plazo comprometi ndonos a promover actuaciones a medio y largo plazo algo que se consigue estando cerca del empresariado
4463524 de modo que su utilizaci n habitual en todo tipo de pacientes nos permite manejarlo con soltura tambi n para resolver situaciones de intubaci n dif cil
4463525 se ha mostrado especialmente til para resolver situaciones de v a a rea dif cil imprevista en los que la rapidez de resoluci n del problema puede suponer salvar una vida o evitar secuelas graves al paciente
4463526 una herramienta inform tica accesible y de f cil manejo adem s del asesoramiento del instituto de biomec nica de valencia que se ha convertido en un referente nacional en la materia
4463527 promover la aplicaci n de la ergonom a en el puesto de trabajo y fomentar la salud de los trabajadores para mejorar su calidad de vida
4463528 est n siendo las v ctimas inocentes de la guerra sucia de camps contra el presidente provincial al que no sabe como quitarse de en medio
4463529 se trata de un agravio comparativo que no se puede permitir a los habitantes de castell n
4463530 utilizar los presupuestos p blicos seg n sus intereses pol ticos personales
4463531 ya se ha encargado de paralizar sistem ticamente las inversiones previstas por el consell en castell n y de boicotear las actuaciones urban sticas reclamadas por fabra
4463532 una labor de mediaci n que ha contribuido finalmente a alcanzar un acuerdo que conjuga los intereses tanto de los pescadores como de los organizadores del gran premio
4463533 va a suponer para la proyecci n exterior de la comunitat y que a su juicio
4463534 la integraci n de los inmigrantes pasa por la extensi n de los derechos pol ticos por lo que desde el gobierno valenciano se apoya la extensi n del voto en las elecciones locales a los extranjeros residentes en los municipios
4463535 no es un tema del que se deba frivolizar hablamos de derechos pol ticos y de una legislaci n que exige reciprocidad el estado debe buscar la f rmula para no dar lugar a la discriminaci n entre inmigrantes
4463536 zapatero ha brillado por la ausencia no habiendo puesto en funcionamiento los tratados ya existentes ni tampoco ratificando el convenio sobre la participaci n de los extranjeros en la vida p blica local del consejo de europa que incluye la extensi n del sufragio
4463537 ha realizado un esfuerzo para que puedan disfrutar de m s derechos que les garantice la plena ciudadan a y su integraci n en la sociedad valenciana
4463538 a avanzar atendiendo a criterios de reciprocidad en el ejercicio de derecho de sufragio activo y pasivo de los extranjeros en espa a en los t rminos que establece el art culo 13 2 de la constituci n
4463539 puesto que la eficiencia energ tica es sin duda una de las herramientas m s eficaces que hay para luchar contra el cambio clim tico
4463540 la finalidad es disminuir la intensidad energ tica de la comunitat y actuar en la l nea de los compromisos adquiridos en relaci n a la disminuci n de gases de efecto invernadero y el desarrollo de fuentes de energ a renovables
4463541 que ofrecen la misma intensidad de luz pero consumen un 40 por ciento menos energ a
4463542 ha tenido que dar la cara ante la nueva huida del presidente de la generalitat francisco camps que tan mal est n las cosas que ha renunciado a participar a los valencianos el plan no sea que en la foto se le asocie con el fracaso
4463543 donde est n en este plan los 600 millones anunciados para inyectar liquidez a la econom a los 300 para comprar hipotecas empaquetadas a las cajas los 200 para el circulantes de las pymes y los 100 de respaldo a las empresas que licitan obra p blica
4463544 redacci n de proyectos de infraestructuras por valor de 1 000 millones
4463545 el resto de lo anunciado 132 3 millones se reparte entre el plan de competitividad que se ha visto recortado de los 30 millones anunciados hace un mes a 26 millones innovaci n recibe 3 millones vendidos ocho veces en los dos ltimos meses y formaci n personal peque o comercio recibe otros 1 2 millones
4463546 en la ltima semana la consellera del ramo ha pedido la devoluci n de ayudas por importe de tres millones
4463547 si se destina 2 1 millones el saldo neto es de menos 0 9 millones
4463548 simplemente se han reubicado de proyectos de ejercicios anteriores a la crisis y no finalizados y ahora se les asigna a la crisis
4463549 encaminados a favorecer el desarrollo y la vertebraci n territorial a trav s del ferrocarril y que contribuyen a reducir las disparidades sociales y econ micas entre los ciudadanos de la uni n
4463550 continuos e incesantes problemas que se est n registrando en los hospitales
4463551 si un d a se quedan en el hospital general sin refrigeraci n durante tres d as a la semana siguiente son los enfermos de la fe los que tienen que sufrir altas temperaturas por la falta de mantenimiento de las instalaciones
4463552 lo mismo ocurre con el sistema inform tico de la conselleria
4463553 el abucasis ha demostrado ser el gran fracaso de la gesti n del pp pues con un solo error es capaz de bloquear toda la sanidad valenciana y el fallo que se produjo este mi rcoles se une a la larga lista problemas que acumula este sistema
4463554 el consell ya se ha gastado cuatro millones de euros en mejorar sus deficiencias
4463555 la falta de previsi n unida a la pasividad y la poca capacidad de reacci n de la conselleria est n provocando el caos en los centros sanitarios de la comunitat
4463556 viva en otra realidad porque mientras cree que esto es el pa s de las maravillas la sanidad se bloquea cada dos por tres y los pacientes sufren las consecuencias de la ineficacia total y absoluta de su gesti n
4463557 exigir responsabilidades por lo ocurrido porque ante la reincidencia de estos problemas no nos cabe ninguna duda de que estamos ante un d ficit de mantenimiento de las instalaciones sanitarias
4463558 en qu se gasta la conselleria el dinero si no es en inversiones que eviten este tipo de situaciones
4463559 en la ltima d cada la ciudad ha creado m s de un mill n y medio de metros cuadrados de suelo industrial o terciario la misma cantidad que se ha creado de de suelo residencial
4463560 que supone casi dos millones de metros cuadrados m s
4463561 el compromiso del ayuntamiento de castell n en este aspecto es total ya que la principal decisi n que ha tomado la ciudad es crecer no s lo en sus habitantes que ya superan los 180 000 sino tambi n en servicios y en calidad de vida para todos y todas las castellonenses
4463562 gracias a este importante desarrollo se han creado m s de 11 000 nuevas viviendas en los ltimos a os en la ciudad y el volumen de inversi n en obra p blica ha superado los 104 millones de euros
4463563 estas cifras indican la inquietud de una ciudad por crecer pero esa inquietud no se ha reducido en los ltimos tiempos no al menos en la medida que cabr a esperar a consecuencia de la crisis econ mica
4463564 castell n en su af n de crecimiento crea puestos de trabajo riqueza y plantea un mejor futuro para los vecinos y vecinas de nuestra ciudad y sta tambi n es la filosof a del plan municipal de la vivienda que va a permitir que durante esta legislatura se superen con creces las 4 000 viviendas de protecci n oficial y as beneficiar a los que tienen menos recursos como los j venes o familias con una econom a m s modesta
4463565 esta planificaci n a la hora de afrontar el desarrollo de la ciudad coment el alcalde va a permitir la creaci n de miles de puestos de trabajos e inversiones millonarias unas medidas que paliar n en cierta medida los peores datos de desempleo de los ltimos quince a os a lo que debemos sumar el ascenso desmedido del ipc del cu l conocimos su ltima subida este mi rcoles el 5 3 por ciento que significa el peor dato desde el a o 1992
4463566 nicamente obtienen la formaci n correspondiente un total de 35 enfermeras matronas
4463567 poder atender el incremento de la demanda de servicios que implica la presencia de un mayor n mero de mujeres en edad f rtil y garantizar una asistencia sanitaria de calidad
4463568 solamente con este incremento de profesionales de enfermer a ser posible poner en marcha a partir de 2009 el protocolo publicitado recientemente por la conselleria de sanidad para impulsar el parto natural o no medicalizado
4463569 es a n mayor en la comunitat ya que la cifra de hijos por mujer pas de 1 37 en 1990 a 1 40 en 2007
4463570 hab a una intensidad media de trafico de 8 000 veh culos aproximadamente que durante estos cuatro meses se ha incrementado hasta 22 000 y que ahora retornan a su itinerario habitual
4463571 no s lo se ha cruzado el t nel del metro que viene desde la estaci n de alicante y cruzar todo el centro hist rico
4463572 se han desviado determinados colectores que estaban afectados como consecuencia de estas actuaciones
4463573 hemos aprovechado estos cuatro meses para solventar en una sola actuaci n todos los problemas y generar las m nimas molestias
4463574 tendr n una estaci n de metro a la vuelta de la esquina que los va a distribuir en muy poco espacio de tiempo por todo lo largo y ancho de la ciudad
4463575 todas las arterias principales de la ciudad est n despejadas con motivo de la celebraci n del gran premio de europa de f rmula 1
4463576 finalizar a lo largo del mes de agosto o los primeros d as de septiembre
4463577 empezar a construirse la estructura del metro el muro pantalla que vendr desde la gran v a hasta luis sant ngel a trav s de reino de valencia
4463578 una parada de metro que comenzar a construirse a partir de los primeros d as de septiembre
4463579 la semana que viene ya que la obra esta casi acabada
4463580 podr circular desde la calle x tiva hasta el paso inferior de las grandes v as
4463581 la previsi n es que la parte de superficie quede abierta en agosto de 2009
4463582 falta la obra m s compleja de realizar la tuneladora que tiene que hacer la conexi n de metro a trav s del centro hist rico
4463583 se dar servicio a velluters a mercat y al barrio del carmen
4463584 la conexi n hacia el sur est bastante avanzada desde general urrutia hasta nazaret
4463585 estar acabada en unos dos a os o dos y medio
4463586 las asociaciones de vecinos y entidades de comerciantes dieron el visto bueno
4463587 buena ubicaci n ya que est en el centro de ruzafa buena accesibilidad y las molestias ser n m nimas para los vecinos
4463588 haya desaparecido un tramo del emisario sin que nadie se haya dado cuenta
4463589 recoge las aguas residuales de las poblaciones del norte de la costa de valencia verti ndolas al mar sin tratamiento previo
4463590 la contaminaci n en esta zona de costa es preocupante
4463591 las naciones unidas la tienen declarada como punto negro de contaminaci n del mediterr neo
4463592 depuradora de canet est prevista en el primer plan de saneamiento de la generalitat que deb a haber estado ejecutado en 2002
4463593 en toda la costa de castell n se vierten las aguas residuales sin depurar
4463594 se trata de una zona con m s de 200 000 habitantes y gran afluencia tur stica
4463595 agresi n al medio ambiente y a la econom a de la comunitat valenciana
4463596 ha dado prioridad a la construcci n de puertos deportivos en estas poblaciones costeras y ha relegado los servicios b sicos como las depuradoras
4463597 la actuaci n del consell se queda en lo superficial
4463598 las reivindicaciones del presidente de la generalitat francisco camps respecto al agua deber a aplicarlas a su propia gesti n porque l es el que est quitando agua a la comunidad
4463599 toda agua no depurada es agua desperdiciada que adem s inutiliza m s agua
4463600 no se trata de una pintada que deteriore o ensucie el mobiliario urbano ni de un acto vand lico
4463601 ten a como finalidad realizar un peque o homenaje y recordatorio de lo que signific la ii rep blica espa ola coincidiendo con el triste aniversario del golpe de estado del 18 de julio de 1936 y con la inaceptable aparici n la misma ma ana del 17 de julio de 2008 de una pintada nazi en la placa conmemorativa del primer alcalde republicano de castell n francesc gonz lez cherm situada en el paseo que lleva su nombre
4463602 pretend a ser una expresi n p blica de nuestra reivindicaci n leg tima de una forma de estado republicana para espa a
4463603 donde puede constatarse que se realizan habitualmente pegadas de decenas de carteles publicitarios sin que ni el propietario del solar ni el ayuntamiento hayan realizado ninguna acci n dirigida a su limpieza y conservaci n ni se haya impedido nunca la colocaci n de dichos carteles
4463604 todas las medidas necesarias para no deteriorar el muro ni ensuciar la acera ni su entorno ni entorpecer la circulaci n de los viandantes
4463605 demostrando que no se intent ocultar la autor a de la acci n pues se trataba de una acci n totalmente leg tima y amparada en el derecho a la libertad de expresi n reconocido en el art culo 20 de la constituci n de 1978 y que no se trataba de un acto vand lico
4463606 no contiene ni expresi n ofensiva para nuestros conciudadanos ni mucho menos ilegal pues existen diversas sentencias que reconocen la plena legalidad y legitimidad de la bandera de la ii rep blica espa ola por lo que en absoluto procede la calificaci n de
4463607 era realizar una actividad art stica de car cter reivindicativo amparada por el derecho a la libertad de expresi n reconocido en el art culo 20 de la constituci n de 1978
4463608 y en ninguno de estos casos tenemos constancia de que el ayuntamiento haya realizado acci n sancionadora alguna cosa que no entendemos trat ndose stos s de actos vand licos ya que contienen im genes ilegales y ofensivas
4463609 de hecho en el decreto no existe ni siquiera un mera y sucinta explicaci n de los hechos producidos nicamente la alusi n a
4463610 las personas que el d a 17 est bamos pintando el mural no atent bamos contra nada de eso ni contra los bienes privados de nadie ni comet amos actos vand licos ni estrope bamos el mobiliario urbano
4463611 la intervenci n del concejal de seguridad ciudadana enviando a una patrulla de polic as locales excede con mucho el cumplimiento de sus funciones y atenta contra nuestro derecho a la libertad de expresi n

4463615 sea prioritario este proyecto dentro de las inversiones de espa a y se redacten los proyectos de forma prioritaria e inmediata
4463616 absoluta indiferencia por parte del gobierno de espa a ni tampoco del andaluz que en ning n momento se ha posicionado ni ha subrayado la necesidad del corredor ferroviario ni ha reivindicado para andaluc a que el gobierno de espa a se d prisa en la redacci n de proyectos tan importantes para la econom a de nuestra tierra
4463617 una vez m s chaves ha preferido el silencio y la complicidad callada con la indiferencia del gobierno central de forma que el pasado cinco de junio la ministra de fomento magdalena lvarez que parece que la pagan para ir en contra de los intereses de andaluc a dijo en el congreso que el corredor podr a llegar hasta castell n y parece que prefiere que andaluc a se quede fuera algo inusual
4463618 vertebrar y comunicar perfectamente nuestra tierra y tambi n comunicarnos con otras comunidades aut nomas espa olas con centroeuropa y con frica a trav s del paso del estrecho

4463621 est cargada de l gica y suficientemente razonada y fundamentada
4463622 el gobierno dijo tras un consejo de ministros de diciembre que se iba a incluir el corredor en el peit
4463623 debe estar finalizado en 2010 pues tiene esa fecha tope para poder ser declarado por la ue como prioritario pero para ello los pa ses deben declarar la prioridad de ese proyecto en sus propias inversiones
4463624 el gobierno central sin embargo s considera prioritario el eje barcelona pa s vasco madrid lisboa una alternativa peligrosa que significa llevarse la atracci n tur stica y de generaci n de empleo hacia la costa atl ntica
4463625 est pendiente de cambio por otra fiesta de caracter sticas semejantes
4463626 teniendo en cuenta que la lengua y las tradiciones festivas de la comunitat son parte esencial del patrimonio cultural de la comunitat
4463627 elementos b sicos y sustanciales del patrimonio cultural de los valencianos del cual la lengua es un pilar fundamental
4463628 al compromiso de la generalitat con la potenciaci n del uso del valenciano en todos los mbitos as como promover la lengua valenciana a pie de calle acerc ndola a los lugares donde transcurre la vida de los ciudadanos
4463629 el juego de palabras al que nos tienen acostumbrados desde el gobierno con temas tan fundamentales como las necesidades h dricas de la comunitat o como la galopante crisis econ mica son a todas luces indicadores de que algo no cuadra dentro de las filas socialistas
4463630 no es de extra ar que los socialistas valencianos no sepan ni c mo se llaman ni qu son ni qu buscan
4463631 la necesidad de una pol tica h drica coherente y para todos igual fuera de toda prebenda ya que las deudas pol ticas a los catalanes se las paga con agua y a los valencianos con el olvido
4463632 dejen de una vez este juego del ahora si ahora no con los trasvases porque solo hacen que retrasar una soluci n necesaria a un problema de todos los valencianos
4463633 un gobierno que deroga trasvases a placer que los denomina de mil formas y que juega al despiste no hace m s que demostrar que tiene pocas ganas de trabajar por los ciudadanos de la comunitat
4463634 el trasvase del ebro para la comunitat y ha instado al pspv que se ponga al lado de los valencianos y unifiquen una postura en materia h drica
4463635 humo al igual que toda la pol tica de la comunitat
4463636 la realidad es que el gobierno ha aumentado el 15 por ciento la licitaci n mientras que la generalitat la ha recortado las inversiones en 487 millones de euros en obra p blica en plena crisis
4463637 el verdadero problema es que han despilfarrado tanto que ahora no puede hacer nada incluso queriendo que no es el caso

4463727 we connected the dots to draw a critical conclusion and found evidence over the amazon that traces the direct path of the effect of human activity on climate change by way of human caused aerosols
4463728 scientists have observed instances where increases or decreases in the amount of these tiny particles have increased and decreased cloud cover in different places and times
4463729 we saw an example of this ourselves increased aerosols over the amazon produced less cloud cover over the atlantic ocean however increased aerosols actually produced more cloud cover
4463730 we wanted to know what the link was between these different outcomes from varying amounts and types of aerosols this paper gives us a clear picture of what is occurring

4463897 theres not a better candidate theres not a better potential coach he knows more about the game i have more respect mr anschutz has great respect for bruce so wed be honored to have him
4463898 you dont look at a guy like bruce as a contender
4463899 wed be honored and privileged if bruce was part of the organization but the conversation tonight was really geared toward his input toward and his feelings towards what weve done right and what weve done wrong with this franchise
4463900 in my opinion you have to look at bruce and believe that this is the best coach that this league has ever had
4463901 i dont think hes lost anything so it would be fantastic for this franchise if we could convince bruce to join us here but as i said we have a ways to go before were going to know whether or not thats the direction we or he are going in
4463902 we owe the team and the fans a quick conclusion to this process
4463903 i dont need no stinkin benchmark because i only use index funds so my portfolio is the benchmark
4463904 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4463905 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
4463906 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class
4463907 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4463908 t he option should exist to invest in the benchmark as an alternative to the portfolio under consideration

4463916 that problem is pretty easily solved by calculating a portfolios time weighted return rather than irr or dollar weighted return and comparing the twr to the benchmark return twr removes the impact of cash flows on portfolio performance
4463917 you bring up a major issue with performance measurement cash flows in a portfolio are handled differently than cash flows in an index so there will always be some irr tracking error in between the portfolio and the index in an index it is assumed that the dividend is paid on the ex dividend date and reinvested in the index however in a portfolio the divided does not come in until the dividend payment date and then it might take another day or so to reinvest so by default using irr the portfolio cannot match the irr of the index
4463918 for example if you start with 10 000 and then add 1 00 000 during a year there is a twr return calculation from the 10 000 contribution to the date the 1 000 000 was added then there is second calculation starting the day of the 1 000 000 contribution

4463951 one reason i refuse to bother with the whole security circus is that i think it glorifies and thus encourages the wrong behavior it makes heroes out of security people as if the people who dont just fix normal bugs arent as important in fact all the boring normal bugs are way more important just because theres a lot more of them

4463989 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor

4464001 i used to tell people when i first came that we considered forensic science boys town but now its more like a girls world
4464002 i have to think that theres got to be some relationship between the roles that are represented on tv and the way women see whats possible for them as a career
4464003 a lot of them do realize that riding around in the hummers and wearing prada is not the day to day things
4464004 but i tell girls that i do a lot of things in pearls and pumps you can be a part of this used to be male dominated thing but you can still be feminine you can still be who you are
4464005 i think all of us have kind of an altruist bent for the greater good because we could probably be doing research chemistry or medical and making more money but everybody seems to have a passion for the science and work and wanting to help people
4464006 we help automakers get there faster with more fuel efficient products
4464007 nobody can afford to pick technologies that arent the most cost effective

4464031 theyve crunched the numbers and concluded they cant head to the lake after a 20 percent loss in their net worth
4464032 many of my neighbors have also come out of retirement
4464033 besides the satisfaction we get from our jobs were all trying to make sure our nest eggs last as long as we do
4464034 this is just the beginning of a long term trend the changing nature of retirement income will make boomers more and more vulnerable to market downturns
4464035 i talked to my financial planner who thought i could afford to do those things even though im only 60
4464036 im debt free i dont even have a mortgage and ive been able to save for my retirement
4464037 im not hurting but im wondering whether the economy will deteriorate further
4464038 we look at what would happen to their nest egg if the market collapsed the day after they retired
4464039 then we see whether theyd have enough time to recover and enough money to live on throughout retirement
4464040 anyone who withdraws too much in a bear market especially early in retirement will outlive his money
4464041 a good rule is to take out no more than 4 percent a year that should keep a portfolio going for many years
4464042 if the market were better i wouldnt work at all
4464043 but my cardiologist tells me i may live to be 95 and my mutual funds certainly arent giving me the kind of returns ill need to last that long
4464044 because i dont see myself sitting at home and eating cat food i will keep chasing consulting jobs
4464045 even those who dont plan to move after retirement are still psychologically affected by falling home values
4464046 they look at their net worth on paper and feel poorer so they continue working

4464085 its a top down approach to development where the state decides what are the important projects like building railroads roads developing the oil exploitation of xinjiang
4464086 these are all major infrastructural programmes that directly benefit the urban chinese segment of the population and there is nothing done seriously on poverty alleviation rural development or minority empowerment in this programme

4464183 firm conviction of the church which found its highest expression in the dogmatic definition of the assumption proclaimed by my venerable predecessor pius xii in 1950
4464184 in the bible the last reference to her earthly life is found at the beginning of the acts of the apostles which presents mary gathered in prayer together with the disciples in the upper room waiting for the holy spirit acts
4464185 the most holy virgin mary must always be situated in the mystery of christ and of the church in this perspective just as the mother of jesus glorified in body and soul in heaven is the image and beginning of the church as it is to be perfected is the world to come so too does she shine forth on earth until the day of the lord shall come cf 2 pt 3 10 as a sign of sure hope and solace to the people of god during its sojourn on earth const lumen gentium 68 from paradise the virgin mary especially in their difficult times of trial continues always to watch over the children that jesus himself entrusted to her before dying on the cross
4464186 points out to us the ultimate destination of our earthly pilgrimage she reminds us that our entire being spirit soul and body is destined for the fullness of life that those who live and die in the love of god and of neighbor will be transfigured in the image of the glorious body of the risen christ that the lord humbles the proud and raises up the lowly cf lk 1 51 52 this is what the virgin mary proclaims eternally with the mystery of her assumption may you be always praised o virgin mary pray to the lord for us
4464187 ability to look up to heaven and to god the true reality and the bridge to a new world

4464197 given these trends risks to the outlook for the world oil market appear to be on the downside

4464207 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4464208 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4464209 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4464210 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4464211 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4464212 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4464213 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4464214 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4464215 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4464216 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4464217 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4464218 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4464219 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4464220 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4464221 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4464222 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4464223 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4464224 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4464225 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4464226 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4464227 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4464228 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4464229 looks like it is part human and part ape like
4464230 they showed me the body they took me to the area where they found it it took a day and a half to get there i got to be honest when i first saw it i hated to see it in that state it was in i wanted to capture one so the world could see it walking i guess this is the next best thing for the time being

4464278 the nation went into 2008 with a struggling economy and a continuing war in the middle east radical islamic terrorist enemies continue to plot our demise while growing numbers of largely hispanic illegal immigrants many of them still citizens of their home countries including mexico live in our midst with no firm purpose or requirement to become american citizens meanwhile urban african american poverty has become generational and persistent hardened by the continuance of an alarming rate of teenage pregnancies and abortions these problems of racial disadvantage have not been diminished by more than four decades of well intentioned but ineffective welfare state programs that many would argue have actually been counterproductive i will argue that the policies reflected in obamas legislative history or suggested in his presidential campaign are nothing more than a rerun of far leftist solutions that have been tried many times but to no avail

4464314 its a challenge to us to reach the level we did in auckland and surpass it thats what great teams do they consistently reach that level
4464315 there are a lot of doubters around who doubt the team has the heart to do it again but thats the challenge to take that level and intensity off shore and put it on the field at newlands
4464316 you cant do it for them you can draw on your own experiences and tell them what it will be like and you can try to recreate situations at training we trust these boys that they will put it all out on the park this saturday
4464317 weve had a good week done a lot of homework worked hard and the players are now preparing themselves mentally to be where they need to be
4464318 whatever they do is up to them but they have the responsibility to get there
4464319 the biggest challenge is sunday monday tuesday and the amount of preparation work
4464320 they are important days for getting the strategy right to get it across well to not overload the players
4464321 thats the biggest challenge weekly getting those days right and setting it up so the players can enter this period in the right space so they can get it right and unleash at newlands
4464322 in the past we took into account that players needed a break and weve always had a large pool of players who could all perform at a very high level
4464323 it was easy to make changes under those conditions but this team has had a weeks break so it was great that we could pick the same team
4464324 i know theres been a change in the coaching style and the up front nature that he de villiers has
4464325 whether thats one of his strategies to try to create an attitude that we the all blacks are not as good as people think im not too sure

4464361 we were unfortunate last season at the time we scored at motherwell we were in the ascendency and i did not think they would have got back into the game
4464362 if barrys goal was given along with zander diamonds disallowed effort at celtic park a few weeks earlier then who knows things could have turned out differently we could have been back into europe this season that is how close the margins are
4464363 it is a difficult game for us as motherwell were a bit of a bogey team for us last season it has always been a difficult place to go they had a wonderful season last time out and they will have to deal with higher expectation levels this time
4464364 a lot of the teams who did well last season the likes of falkirk motherwell dundee united and ourselves all lost on the opening day despite high expectations
4464365 all of the sides who are vying to force their way into the top six got beat but that is football for you
4464366 he has played at a high level in the bundesliga premier league and the american national team
4464367 he is an exciting player that i am looking forward to seeing
4464368 agf is a club on the way up where i feel i fit well in and can perform my best
4464369 i have heard very good things about the danish league which i am looking forward to playing in
4464370 im always pleased when a new race track turns up in the calendar and im particularly keen to experience valencia
4464371 it will be an authentic street circuit in the sense that it runs through the town centre unlike the melbourne or montreal tracks
4464372 in terms of its charms and challenges the valencia race will probably come closest to the monaco grand prix
4464373 the first few metres in a brand new car are always a very special experience
4464374 early this year i spent a few days in valencia with my family between the rollout and the next test we had a great time went to the beach and in town theres a dried out riverbed that has nature parks and playgrounds
4464375 that was very nice especially for the children valencia is also a great place for shopping and eating out needless to say and i love the contrast between its historic and futuristic architecture im looking forward to the weekend
4464376 i am very much looking forward to valencia as i am a big fan of street circuits in general
4464377 they are very demanding as they are often bumpy and the street surface changes when you make a mistake you easily run into barriers
4464378 anyway valencia will not be a complete street circuit there will be lots of run off areas for safety reasons the fia puts a lot of effort into safety which is good
4464379 on a street circuit it is of major importance to have a good basic set up which is easy to drive the lap time improvement has to be gained step by step you cannot drive in too wild a style setanta readers comment of the day
4464380 he has worked today and it went very well and he seems in great form
4464381 there is no decision on whether he will run at york yet
4464382 i will be speaking to john ferguson bloodstock advisor to sheikh mohammed tomorrow and we will make a decision then
4464383 he is captain of the club and deserves everything he gets
4464384 at the moment he has probably got another year to do at falkirk
4464385 if the club doesnt grow in terms of the structure the stadium and supporters i think hed like to test himself at a higher level
4464386 however i believe we are giving him everything we can here
4464387 he has the responsibility of the captains armband because i saw a young russell anderson in him
4464388 if other clubs werent looking at him id be very surprised

4464408 quando vier o jogo de volta vamos tentar reverter esse placar n o nada imposs vel fazer 2 a 0 em casa diante da nossa torcida se jogarmos bem como jogamos no primeiro tempo a gente pode fazer
4464409 claro que ainda temos chances mas temos que saber que talvez 2 a 1 para a gente era interessante porque um gol nos dava a classifica o

4464432 they were a couple before she went to las vegas then she decides to get married on a whim comes back and rings up faris as if what she has done is the most normal thing in the world
4464433 she lives in a bubble and is loving all the attention
4464434 but shes a married woman now and needs to grow up
4464435 he feels hes been made a laughing stock during all of this and is only now getting to the bottom of what happened
4464436 right now he doesnt want to see her but hes incandescent with rage and she is in for a huge talking to when they finally meet up hes worried she has made a huge mistake
4464437 she is still very young and he doesnt want her to do anything she will regret
4464438 were all wondering which will last longer bobs anger or peaches claims that she married max because he is a nice boy
4464439 she and ex boyfriend faris badwan had started regularly using drugs and she realised it was becoming a problem peaches was ashamed of the overdose and worried shed end up like amy winehouse
4464440 so when she met max again who is a nice boy and a harvard graduate she thought being alongside him would steer her life on a different path
4464441 he was the nicest boy she could find quickly enough and was the key to her escaping the drugs that have been bringing her down peaches would go so far as to think a wedding would be the best way to go about this though
4464442 when she went to la with her sister fifi she met up with max again and the pair hit the party scene
4464443 she loved being able to go out without the attention she gets in london but her father wanted her to come home

4464487 la seguridad de la naci n se fundamenta en la corresponsabilidad entre el estado y la sociedad civil
4464488 numerosas manifestaciones de inquietud sobre la indebida influencia de las fuerzas armadas en el accionar pol tico del pa s as como la existencia de un excesivo estado deliberativo
4464489 la cidh se permite recordar que de conformidad con el art culo 4 de la carta democr tica interamericana es fundamental para la democracia la subordinaci n constitucional de todas las instituciones del estado a la autoridad civil
4464490 a la par de un progresivo deterioro de la institucionalidad castrense se va sepultando el car cter civil de la presidencia de la rep blica ahora ch vez tiene poder de mando y concentra todo el poder militar a trav s del comando estrat gico operacional
4464491 recibimos al ministro izarra que encabeza el equipo t cnico de campa a que orientar la pol tica de comuinicaci n y propaganda del parido a partir del momento en el cual se inicie la campa a abierta
4464492 tambi n el equipo est integrado por directores de canales de tv oficiales y radio y expertos en materia comunicacional
4464493 esto ser a ilegal una forma de corrupci n y en las filas del psuv no lo vamos a permitir

4464495 denuncias en el exterior permitir n advertir arbitrariedad del gobierno
4464496 quien est atropellando todos estos valores y se pone al margen del estado de derecho es el r gimen y sus seguidores la asamblea nacional que ha dado una ley habilitante inconstitucional desde su inicio porque no fue el objeto correspondiente de las leyes sino un cheque en blanco para que el presidente hiciera lo que le diera la gana la asamblea de manera inconstitucional le cedi al ejecutivo todas las atribuciones legislativas en todos los mbitos
4464497 pero la asamblea en vez de cumplir con su funci n controladora pol tica del ejecutivo lo que hace es acallar las voces que defienden la constituci n como ha hecho el m 2d

4464500 proyecto personalista que vulnera el rol del militar venezolano y degrada las instituciones castrenses de la naci n
4464501 es asombroso como la carrera profesional de los militares quedar rebajada a su m nima expresi n con la instalaci n de un pensamiento pol tico que viola los preceptos democr ticos de nuestra carta magna vigente sencillamente con la lofan los efectivos estar n apegados a las decisiones de un jerarca sin valorar los m ritos obtenidos en los distintos grados militares y la preparaci n en las escuelas oficiales
4464502 si desde la llegada del presidente ch vez al poder se ha puesto en pr ctica una persecuci n indiscriminada contra los libres pensadores que se apegan a los preceptos democr ticas que siempre han prevalecido en las aulas militares ahora con la acumulaci n de todo el poder de decisi n en manos de una sola persona los funcionarios que no comparten la ideolog a chavista sufrir n las persecuciones de rigor
4464503 no resultar para nada extra o observar a los militares venezolanos haciendo campa a pol tica del partido socialista unido de venezuela psuv en pa ses vecinos con el prop sito de enaltecer los logros de la revoluci n bolivariana y llevar el mensaje militarista que emplea el gobierno nacional en el territorio nacional
4464504 la pretensi n del primer mandatario nacional con esta ley es elevar el control militar en la vida diaria de todos los venezolanos asignando cargos pol ticos en instituciones trascendentales de la sociedad local igualmente obliga categ ricamente la uni n sin preceptos de los civiles y los militares bajo un rol de ciudadanos y promueve el militarismo sin l mites en el d a a d a de los residentes del pa s

4464509 the condition of the other 23 passengers who were hospitalised was not known
4464510 it was virtually darkness at noon whatever may have been the reasons and provocations the unfortunate outcome has been that trade and tourism have suffered enormous losses
4464511 if a single event or episode can send the state into an unbridled frenzy resulting in human and economic loss and we are forced to go back in time then all of us need to get together most urgently and work collectively to restore a stable social political environment
4464512 this is a historical place from where dogra rulers waged war against britishers and we pledge today a war against kashmir centric leaders till victory
4464513 the issue today is also a war between nationalists and separatists
4464514 we experienced a slight increase in our revenue in this quarter led by our online education business
4464515 we continue to dominate the online education business in heilongjiang province and expand into surrounding provinces
4464516 in this quarter the operating results combined with first quarter results met our first half year expectations and plans and we remain confident that we can resume our growth trend in the latter half of 2008 we believe we can achieve our previously stated goals for 23 million in revenue and 8 5 to 11 0 million in net income
4464517 we will continue to provide exam oriented education by primarily targeting the 10 million students in the northeast region of china and to increase our market share in these areas we believe that our language training business will create another major platform for growth beginning in the second half of this year we will establish another ten wecl branches by the end of year 2008 we also believe our newly established educational media distribution platform will generate considerable revenues for us later this year help us to promote the china education alliance brand and facilitate our nationwide expansion with minimal advertising expenses

4464520 gained a lot of confidence after comfortably qualifying for the 1500m semi finals
4464521 gained a lot of confidence after comfortably qualifying for the 1500m semi finals on the first night of the olympic games track and field programme late last night
4464522 hopefully it wont take too much out of me for the next two races but ive got two more days before the semi on sunday
4464523 but that will give me a lot of confidence going into the semi final i beat a couple of good guys in that field who i think are sure finalists
4464524 that was the main reason i did it normally i wouldnt be taking the lead that early but to maintain that momentum you may as well keep it going i didnt do it by plan its just what turned out happening
4464525 wealthy people come to london or already exist in london they want to buy properties like we go to the shops to buy a suit or a tie and the thought of having to wait six months or three years is too much for them
4464526 time is money to most of them its find something thats ready lets go for it
4464527 when i started you counted on your fingers the number of 1m and i mean 1m properties now the market goes up to 100m
4464528 there are certainly quite a few sales that i have been involved around 50m
4464529 the apartments start at approximately 5m 2 5m and how high do they go you can use your imagination but we have had many sales over 40m
4464530 were sold out now so we sold 2bn of apartments in about two years
4464531 we have three floors of maid suites those are all about 600 sq ft 56 sq m there are some that are a 1 000 sq ft 93 sq m and those were sold out immediately
4464532 the places where we are producing best are actually in our very large units we sold a unit in trump world tower for 39m
4464533 we have an apartment in trump park avenue for 45m and those are the things that are seeing the most interest because as the economy waxes and wanes there still tend to be people in that top one percentile
4464534 for them its almost irrelevant meaning theyre not affected by the sub prime crisis they are not worried about getting a mortgage
4464535 its difficult to know for sure but probably you have more insurance if you like buying at that end of the market so its not so much of your wealth
4464536 its part of your investment portfolio but its not a huge part
4464537 i think for most people losing your job means that you struggle to meet your mortgage payments and as a result the housing market is very sensitive to the economic cycle
4464538 if its only one of your properties or only a part of your portfolio it may well be that you can get through an economic cycle without missing out on those payments that you owe
4464539 ive had interactions with tom biscardi in the past and based on that history i would say that anything he is involved in is suspect
4464540 the care should include prevention early intervention targeted treatments for particular disorders an understanding of developmental processes and continuity of care
4464541 furthermore treatments should be accessible regardless of age gender sexual orientation disability race ethnicity and culture lastly evidence based practice should be cross disciplinary and include collaborations with families schools practitioners and researchers from various health fields
4464542 this is especially true for low income youth for youth in the juvenile justice and child welfare systems ethnic minority youth and those with drug alcohol problems
4464543 the us economy is not at a very good stage whereas brazil is very hot now endeavor helped me see this
4464544 why cant the next silicon valley pop up in cairo or s o paulo or johannesburg
4464545 they complained that we were only trying to build a middle class not to help the poor despite all the academic evidence that a strong middle class is essential to prosperity
4464546 it is a lot of fun you go to all these nice places in the world find all these young enthusiastic people who you get to help sometimes you invest maybe make some money
4464547 endeavors genius has been to get the establishment in these countries together not to kill these entrepreneurial companies but to support them
4464548 was at a very interesting discount and pay it when you can
4464549 when i said i was going to start a business it was against everyones advice from my family to my university
4464550 now go to the same university and the same professors will tell you that one of their goals is to produce good entrepreneurs
4464551 discovered the new thing that it pays to have an idea not rely on land or investing
4464552 if endeavor had been an investor rather than an independent objective non profit enabler it would not have been trusted by the business elite or the entrepreneurs
4464553 ive had some of these tunes simmering in my song box since 1996 but it was the inspiration i took from my fellow band members that really brought it to life
4464554 dana and i have been jamming together since i was 8 years old in fact he was my first guitar teacher
4464555 especially the music i listened to while growing up in north wheeling the allman brothers band eric clapton santana and bob marley
4464556 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4464557 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4464558 heeey harley mamas going to take a pregnancy test now think we can fit a baby in this studio too
4464559 adalah rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam sering berpuasa hingga kami menyangka bahawa baginda berpuasa berterusan dan baginda sering berbuka sehingga kami menyangka bahawa rasulullah akan berbuka seterusnya saya tidak pernah melihat baginda berpuasa sebulan penuh kecuali pada bulan ramadhan dan saya tidak pernah melihat baginda berpuasa sunat dalam sebulan yang lebih banyak dari puasanya di bulan syaaban
4464560 pada hari ini telah kusempurnakan untuk kamu agamamu dan telah kucukupkan kepadamu nikmatku dan telah kuridloi islam sebagai agama bagimu
4464561 apakah mereka mempunyai sesembahan sesembahan selain allah yang mensyariatkan untuk mereka agama yang tidak diridloi allah sekiranya tak ada ketetapan yang menentukan dari allah tentulah mereka telah dibinasakan dan sesungguhnya orang orang yang dhalim itu akan memperoleh azab yang pedih
4464562 barang siapa yang mengada adakan sesuatu perbuatan dalam agama yang sebelumnya tidak pernah ada maka tidak akan diterima
4464563 barang siapa mengerjakan suatu perbuatan yang belum pernah kami perintahkan maka ia tertolak
4464564 amma badu sesungguhnya sebaik baik perkataan adalah kitab allah al quran dan sebaik baik petunjuk adalah petunjuk muhammad shalallahu alaihi wa sallam dan sejelek jelek perbuatan dalam agama adalah yang diada adakan dan setiap bidah yang diada adakan itu sesat
4464565 hai orang orang yang beriman taatilah allah dan taatilah rasul nya dan ulil amri pemimpin diantara kamu kemudian jika kamu berlainan pendapat tentang sesutu maka kembalikanlah ia kepada allah al quran dan rasul al hadits jika kamu benar benar beriman kepada allah dan hari kemudian yang demikian itu adalah lebih utama bagimu dan lebih baik akibatnya
4464566 tentang sesuatu apapun kamu berselisih maka putusannya terserah kepada allah yang mempunyai sifat sifat demikian itulah tuhanku kepadanya lah aku bertawakkal dan kepadanya lah aku kembali
4464567 katakanlah jika kamu benar benar mencintai allah maka ikutilah aku niscaya allah akan mengasihi dan mengampuni dosa dosamu
4464568 maka demi tuhanmu mereka pada hakekatnya tidak beriman hingga mereka menjadikan kamu sebagai hakim terhadap perkara yang mereka perselisihkan kemudian mereka tidak merasa sesuatu keberatan dalam hati mereka terhadap putusan yang kamu berikan dan mereka menerima dengan sepenuhnya
4464569 menjalankan ibadah di masjid pada malam itu secara berjamaah tidak dibidahkan
4464570 barangsiapa mengerjakan suatu perbuatan yang belum pernah kami perintahkan maka ia tertolak
4464571 pahala yang didapat dari ibadah pada malam nisfu syaban menyamai pahala lailatul qadar ibnu abi mulaikah menjawab
4464572 wahai ali barang siapa yang melakukan sholat pada malam nisfu syaban sebanyak 100 rakaat ia membaca setiap rakaat al fatihah dan qul huwallah ahad sebanyak sepuluh kali pasti allah memenuhi segala kebutuhannya dan seterusnya
4464573 seratus rakaat pada malam nisfi syaban dengan membaca surah al ikhlas sepuluh kali pada setiap rakaat bersama keutamaan keutamaan yang lain diriwayatkan oleh ad dailami dan lainya bahwa itu semua maudlu palsu dan mayoritas perowinya pada ketiga jalur sanadnya majhul tidak diketahui dan dloif lemah imam as syaukani berkata hadits yang menerangkan bahwa dua belas rakaat dengan membaca surat al ikhlas tiga puluh kali itu maudlu palsu dan hadits empat belas rakaat dan seterusnya adalah maudlu tidak bisa diamalkan dan harus ditinggalkan pent para fuqoha ahli yurisprudensi banyak yang tertipu dengan hadits hadits diatas seperti pengarang ihya ulumuddin dan lainnya juga sebagian dari para ahli tafsir karena sholat pada malam ini yakni malam nisfu syaban telah diriwayatkan melalui berbagai jalur sanad semuanya adalah bathil tidak benar dan haditsnya adalah maudlu hal ini tidak bertentangan dengan riwayat turmudzi dan hadits aisyah bahwa rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wa sallam pergi ke baqi dan tuhan turun ke langit dunia pada malam nisfu syaban untuk mengampuni dosa sebanyak jumlah bulu domba dan bulu kambing karena pembicaraan kita berkisar tentang sholat yang diadakan pada malam nisfu syaban itu tetapi hadits aisyah ini lemah dan sanadnya munqothi tidak bersambung sebagaimana hadits ali yang telah disebutkan diatas mengenai malam nisfu syaban jadi dengan jelas bahwa sholat khusus pada malam itu juga lemah dasar hukumnya al hafidz al iraqi berkata hadits yang menerangkan tentang sholat nisfi syaban itu maudlu dan pembohongan atas diri rasulallah
4464574 pada hari ini telah kusempurnakan untuk kamu agamamu dan telah kucukupkan kepadamu nimatku dan telah kuridloi islam sebagai agama bagimu
4464575 barang siapa yang mengada adakan sesuatu perbuatan dalam agama yang sebelumnya tidak pernah ada maka ia tertolak
4464576 janganlah kamu sekalian mengkhususkan malam jumat dari pada malam malam lainnya dengan sholat tertentu dan janganlah kamu sekalian mengkhususkan siang harinya dari pada hari hari lainnya dengan berpuasa tertentu kecuali jika hari bertepatan dengan hari yang ia biasa berpuasa bukan puasa khusus tadi
4464577 barang siapa yang berdiri melakukan sholat pada bulan ramadlan dengan penuh rasa iman dan harapan pahala niscaya allah subhaanahu wa taala akan mengampuni dosanya yang telah lewat dan barang siapa yang berdiri melakukan sholat pada malam lailatul qadar dengan penuh rasa iman dan harapan pahala niscaya allah akan mengampuni dosa dosanya yang telah lewat
4464578 sebaik baik perkara adalah yang telah dikerjakan oleh para salaf yang telah mendapatkan petunjuk dan sejelek jelek perkara dalam agama adalah yang diada adakan berupa bidah bidah
4464579 is that in the writing i come in touch with the spirit of god within me and experience how i am lead to new places writing is a process in which we discover what live in us the deepest satisfaction of writing is precisely that it opens up new spaces within us of which we were not aware before we started to write to write is to embark on a journey of which we do not know the final destination i do not know what i carry in my heart but i trust that it will emerge as i write writing is like giving away the few loaves and fishes we have trusting that they will multiply in the giving once we dare to give away on paper the few thoughts that come to us we started discovering how much is hidden underneath these thoughts and thus gradually come in touch with our own riches and resources i came to realize that writing was indeed a form of prayer
4464580 es en el escribir que puedo tocar el esp ritu de dios dentro de mi y experimentar como soy llevado a nuevos lugares el escribir es un proceso en donde describimos quien vive en nosotros la mayor satisfacci n del escribir es precisamente que abre nuevos espacios dentro de nosotros los cuales no conoc amos antes de empezar a escribir escribir es embarcarnos en un viaje en donde no sabemos el destino final yo no se lo que tengo en mi coraz n pero confi que saldr mientras escribo es escribir es como dar unas pocas rebanadas de pan y pescados confiando que se multiplicar n en el dar una ves que nos atrevemos a dar en papel con los pocos pensamientos que salen empezamos a descubrir cuantas de estos pensamientos estaban escondidos y entonces asi poder tocar nuestra riquezas y recursos me he dado cuenta que el escribir es en verdad una forma de oraci n
4464581 wir m chten es nicht laut herausschreien sondern bescheiden auftreten trotzdem soll unser ziel der aufstieg klar sein
4464582 wir sehen uns in der position des herausforderers andere klubs besitzen bessere wirtschaftliche voraussetzungen ich sehe uns zwischen dem 3 und 8 platz
4464583 den finanziellen rahmen so herzustellen dass wir den aufstieg fordern k nnen
4464584 this is certainly a quick way to lower the risk of information transfer
4464585 it isnt difficult especially in a windows environment a simple registry hack on each workstation easily deployed via login scripts can completely shut down usb and firewire ports
4464586 but this might cause a problem if you deploy usb or firewire devices like keyboards mice displays etc
4464587 a direct registry modification to achieve a security result is not my idea of a good time
4464588 the service providers that have been early adopters of iptv have arrived at an inflection point that is no longer driven by market share gain but by profit
4464589 the requirement to increase iptv network efficiency has become vitally important iptv equipment manufacturers that realize this shift in perspective can tailor their strategies accordingly
4464590 news reports revealed yesterday that turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdo an assured turkish cypriot officials especially the opposition during a visit to the north last month that g zelyurt would never be returned to greek cypriot control
4464591 as cypriot leaders are readying for comprehensive negotiations set for next month the town of g zelyurt in northwest cyprus will not be on the table as a bargaining chip for the turkish side
4464592 het internet heeft duidelijk een impact op de verkoop van celebrity magazines
4464593 deze gossip sites kunnen immers gratis bezocht worden bovendien zijn er diverse updates per dag waarom zou de consument op het einde van de week dan nog een celebrity magazine gaan kopen
4464594 the fact that im here just shows the evolution of public relations to more communication based marketing solutions for brands way beyond traditional pr
4464595 public improvement corporation established by the city of colorado springs
4464596 why would we get involved in that it seems to me the city would want to steer clear of that
4464597 the store is smaller more personal and right around the corner we are a family owned and operated business and we really care about the local community
4464598 i believe that our customer service is what sets us apart
4464599 we know our customers very well and we take good care of them
4464600 the caf was something that the owner always wanted to do
4464601 we put only the finest ingredients in everything we make and it shows because everything tastes really good
4464602 ive worked other places and it is nothing like working for a family business
4464603 here you know all the cousins sisters and brothers youre part of the family
4464604 raw land eats three meals a day and generates no income
4464605 we have believed in the liberty hill leander area for decades and it is just now paying off
4464606 we do land plans with urban design planners and we hire civil engineers to project costs on roads utilities and offsite costs
4464607 we also have to look at environmental impacts and the overall health of the market
4464608 developers will make everybody he can think of aware of the fact that he has this product out there
4464609 in some cases theyll require a builder to make a cash payment or purchase
4464610 the developers job is to stay out in front of demand with finished lots which take a year to deliver from conception to ready to build lot
4464611 internal vertical move up market within the community whereby folks can move up to larger homes over time without relocating the kids theres something for everyone if properly blended everyone makes money and does not step on or pirate each others product and price point
4464612 we have to pay for all kinds of things in the city
4464613 you are whipping out your wallet a lot in soft costs depending on the jurisdiction fees run approximately 2 000 to 3 000 per lot
4464614 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4464615 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4464616 we know when it touches us and he knew that so thats where it comes into calling it on yourself because its the right thing to do
4464617 should i expect him to do that maybe not maybe i shouldnt expect people to hold themselves to high standards sportsmanship
4464618 but yes i did expect it a little more so in the olympics when were all competing under the banner of this event being to promote sportsmanship to promote goodwill amongst countries
4464619 that was heat of the moment stuff he hit it right at me
4464620 probably didnt want to hear an apology right away because i thought it was intentional when we changed sides he said sorry its part of the game you were on top of the game
4464621 i said okay thats fine its part of the game youre right move on and we did
4464622 i know him very well ive played him many times on tour he does everything in his power to win
4464623 usually its within the rules sometimes its bordering on gamesmanship
4464624 but hes too good of a player to do something like that and to act like that thats why its disappointing because he is a great player
4464625 i try to do it with integrity so my parents would be proud of the way i played
4464626 if that happened the other way i never would have finished the match because my father would have pulled me off the court if i had acted that way
4464627 norbert ihr team war in silverstone hockenheim und budapest erfolgreich ist ein vierter sieg in serie m glich
4464628 lewis heikki und das gesamte team haben eine ganz hervorragende leistung gezeigt und dreimal in folge gewonnen seit beginn der vergangenen saison haben wir 13 von 28 rennen siegreich beendet und wenn m glich so wollen wir diese erfolgsrate weiter ausbauen das deb trennen in valencia ist aber ein komplett anderes spielfeld f r alle beteiligten
4464629 der grand prix in valencia ist ein stra enrennen was kann man davon erwarten
4464630 wenn man in der formel 1 ber nicht permanente stra enrennen nachdenkt dann hat man eigentlich nur monaco vor augen mit diesem klassiker hat valencia allerdings nicht viel gemein au er dass sich beide st dte an der mittelmeerk ste befinden und dass beide strecken an der hafenpromenade entlang f hren
4464631 mit durchschnittlich 156 stundenkilometern pro runde ist monte carlo der langsamste kurs des jahres und mit nur 254 kilometern auch die k rzeste renndistanz berhaupt in valencia kommen 310 kilometer auf uns zu sowie eine strecke auf der die wagen f nfmal in einem umlauf auf ber 300 stundenkilometer beschleunigen
4464632 f r die bremsen wird das enorm anspruchsvoll hnlich wie in montr al
4464633 dreimal pro runde m ssen die fahrer auf etwa tempo 80 herunterbremsen f r die bremsen wird das enorm anspruchsvoll hnlich wie in montr al am hafen entlang werden wir die l ngste vollgaspassage erleben wo die fahrer f r ungef hr 13 sekunden lang voll am gas sind
4464634 die zielgerade ist mit nur 185 metern die k rzeste im diesj hrigen formel 1 rennkalender wir rechnen mit einer durchschnittsgeschwindigkeit von 225 stundenkilometern was die strecke auf position acht der schnellsten kurse r ckt f r ein stra enrennen ist das eher untypisch das klingt vielmehr nach silverstone oder monza innerhalb einer stadt
4464635 wie bereiten sich die motorentechniker auf eine neue strecke wie valencia vor wo es bislang keine gesicherten daten gibt
4464636 unsere techniker von mercedes benz in brixworth und stuttgart erstellen gemeinsam mit mclaren eine streckensimulation und nutzen diese f r den probelauf auf dem motorenpr fstand
4464637 die arbeit auf dem pr fstand basiert auf einer vorher berechneten getriebe bersetzung sowie auf drehzahl nderungen und gangwechseln daraus k nnen wir die optimale motoreneinstellung folgern und die kalibrierung so verbessern dass das aggregat sowohl den anforderungen der valencia strecke als auch den w nschen unserer fahrer entspricht
4464638 f r eine neue strecke sind diese vorbereitungen von besonderer bedeutung denn wir haben daf r ja keine daten aus tests oder rennen letztendlich kann es aber ganz wichtig sein qualifying und rennen in der bestm glichen form anzugehen
4464639 the fans will hopefully be lifted by the last two results away from home
4464640 people will probably be interested to see for themselves what is going on
4464641 its against a team who think theyre going to be in the premier league next year
4464642 i like the place you go there and its very enclosed the supporters are as close as they can be and under lights loftus road is a fantastic place to go and play
4464643 im smart im beautiful im rich i want it all and i deserve it
4464644 if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us
4464645 die au erordentliche hohe akzeptanz im deutschen markt und das enorm positive echo in der ffentlichkeit haben uns davon berzeugt dass unser angebot auch in anderen europ ischen m rkten erfolgreich sein wird
4464646 durch die expansion in die europ ischen kernm rkte nutzen wir unseren derzeitigen vorsprung bevor unternehmen aus den usa diesen markt betreten
4464647 vi vurderer at inflationen nu har n et toppen og vil falde kraftigt i det kommende r
4464648 alene basiseffekten vil derfor tr kke inflationen i b de usa og euroland ned p 2 3 pct p 12 m neders sigt hvis de seneste ugers fald i r varepriserne holder ved vil inflationen komme endnu l ngere ned
4464649 our users can now share their recordings with the world without leaving tapedeck
4464650 our users made it clear that they wanted to email tapes to their windows using friends and family and we listened
4464651 we have a lot of musicians using tapedeck to quickly record their ideas and they want to make sure that if they catch something wonderful on tape its captured as faithfully as possible
4464652 the problem we have faced in the past is producing enough of these coiled carbon nanotubes at a reasonable cost to make a difference
4464653 because our current method produces coiled nanotubes quickly in high yield it can be readily scaled up to industrial levels after formation the coiled nanotubes can be peeled off in one piece and placed on other surfaces to form instant cushioning coatings
4464654 if you move your hand backward as you catch the egg and increase the time of contact over which the impact occurs the impact will be less forceful and the egg will not break it is the same phenomenon experienced in catching a baseball
4464655 our studies with carbon nanotubes have been ongoing for quite some time
4464656 each step along the way has led to the next breakthrough and each time weve learned more about how they grow and what their applications could be we believe that carbon nanotubes have tremendous potential for the lives of each one of us
4464657 the ocean community is on the threshold of a new era in which an ensemble of novel technologies will provide us with an increasingly powerful capacity for exploring and interacting with the global ocean system
4464658 the cruise itself is an example of the coming generation of systems where highly capable autonomous underwater vehicles like sentry will be integral components todays auvs are helping us develop the power and high speed communications network well need to explore powerful and potentially dangerous processes at underwater volcanoes within powerful tsunamis or in the wake of large storms and hurricanes
4464659 seeing the first maps pop up on our screen was a real thrill for us they represent the results of hard work by all members of our team
4464660 most developed nations have major research efforts focused on understanding and learning to use these energy rich deposits of methane
4464661 our plan is to build the infrastructure that will allow entire generations of scientists to study these deposits firsthand using robotic telepresence no other country is there yet
4464662 the key to choosing these locations is to find sites that are protected but within reach of really interesting processes that were trying to investigate
4464663 there was some interest in converting syngas into ethanol during the first oil crisis back in the 70s
4464664 the problem was that catalysis technology at that time didnt allow selectivity in the byproducts they could produce ethanol but youd also get methane aldehydes and a number of other undesirable products
4464665 if we can increase this activated co adsorption on the surface of the catalyst it improves the opportunity for the formation of ethanol molecules
4464666 and if we can increase the amount of surface area for the catalyst we can increase the amount of ethanol produced
4464667 gasification to ethanol has received increasing attention as an attractive approach to reaching the federal renewable fuel standard of 36 billion gallons of biofuel
4464668 the great thing about using syngas to produce ethanol is that it expands the kinds of materials that can be converted into fuels
4464669 you can use the waste product from the distilling process or any number of other sources of biomass such as switchgrass or wood pulp basically any carbon based material can be converted into syngas and once we have syngas we can turn that into ethanol
4464670 the idea is that we would open this convention up to the public hopefully it will be one of the things that shows were out talking and are interested in what regular people have to say and the problems in their lives right now

4464672 i think this is really about tapping into both online and offline
4464673 i think thats also a big part of what marketers want to do
4464674 they absolutely want to protect that tv audience but youve got to give them credit because they are streaming a ton of stuff online
4464675 pumping the video quality up to olympic levels is a hurdle nbc can and surely will work to overcome in time for the next olympics two years from now
4464676 we continue to maintain the same marketing presence so from a motorist or business customer perspective theyll continue to receive quality texaco branded products
4464677 the sale and associated supply agreement reinforces our strategy of focusing on our core strength of providing branding and support to our network of 1 100 independently owned texaco branded service stations in the u k as well as our authorized distributors
4464678 at a time when world records seemed to have hit the ceiling of whats physically possible to wrestle out of the human organism phelps has been the man who managed to push the limits with his magnificent performance
4464679 any average adult human being needs some 2 500 daily calories to live a life without excesses
4464680 of course when youre in the presence of a monster like michael phelps those parameters can go to hell
4464681 the all time no 1 olympian or just one of many such belt holders
4464682 the latter is my conclusion because numbers of golds won is only one criterion by which to weigh olympic greatness not least because of the sheer number of scarcely distinguishable events open to swimmers though phelps will move another giant step towards the all time title on sunday if he puts spitz in the shade
4464683 we couldnt care less whether hes the greatest olympian ever
4464684 the truth is hes costing us a fortune and punters bettors just love him if phelps comes to london in 2012 theres a strong chance he could clean up again frankly were already dreading it
4464685 if michael phelps were a country he would be sitting fourth on the games medal tally
4464686 every olympiad produces its own titans athletes whose performances galvanize the worlds attention and whose names become synonymous in olympic history with the cities and years of their triumphs
4464687 in that sense beijing 2008 will always belong to michael phelps
4464688 that michael phelps can take a three minute shower in 2 1 2 minutes
4464689 they said we didnt listen to you and if we had wed be in a much position today
4464690 we definitely have a long ways to go we havent seen the government adopt any long term plan
4464691 it gives people a glimpse into what these tailing ponds really are the bird incident is only the tip of the tarsands iceberg
4464692 there are 18 open investigations that we know of about companies illegally discharging into the water in violation of albertas environmental laws
4464693 you do have companies operating outside what the legal limits are even though the standards are very low
4464694 nobody should ever have to question the safety of their water supply
4464695 but honey i never visit those sites they must have uhhhmmmm stolen my email address from a republican mailing list
4464696 mike and chris pioneered the genre more than 18 years ago and have shaped the sports talk format into what it is today
4464697 we wish chris nothing but the best and look forward to all that mike will do in a role in which he has excelled at for years
4464698 hardly any of the old synagogues survive today to remind us of what was perhaps the most significant jewish community in american history
4464699 who ever heard of a synagogue not wanting people to join
4464700 it means that the responsibility of doing the show has grown massively
4464701 he is much more than a poet to us the whole cast feel they know him very personally through his poetry
4464702 it seems strange that at the same time as his funeral is taking place we will be on stage
4464703 in jidariyya he wrote the words the only thing that defies death is art
4464704 he has left behind a huge heritage which for us is the best way to commemorate his memory and respect him
4464705 the more clich d impression would be thats a bunch of angry young men in ramallah making public their frustrations
4464706 nothing could be further from the truth this a group of people who are incredibly lyrical incredibly poetic and rather gentle

4464714 historically there have been more issues with johns matches than the other guys but this was over the top
4464715 i guess 1992 in new haven was the last time i played john has anything changed i guess he has one of those explosive personalities you could say
4464716 there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires i said something to the official as players we are in control of the match officials are in charge of the integrity of the game
4464717 umpires tend to be intimated by john which generally means they are more lenient with him he crossed the line today
4464718 with a single ssd they can get rid of a hookup like this altogether replacing 10 hdds in many cases but i heard of one extreme case where one ssd replaced 38 enterprise hdds
4464719 thats a compliment to our program that we can lose 13 guys to the nfl and still be picked to win
4464720 i dont think therere many of us at tech that wouldnt like one quarterback when you play two its really hard we had two different systems for each quarterback last year and i thought it hurt us in the orange bowl
4464721 i think we recruited some very talented kids some great freshmen the bad part is they havent played in ball games
4464722 we lost a lot of guys and were going to miss them but we have a lot of guys that have a lot of talent and theyve got some game experience theyre ready to step in and theyre hungry
4464723 i like the kids i like their attitudes the fact that most players were here all summer says something about their intentions
4464724 all we really ask for when people send in their ideas to real travel is enthusiasm that and a unique idea that stands out from the rest the only rules we have is that youre talking about a trip taken within the last year that you have a good selection of colour photos that we can use and that youre passionate about the story youre telling start by sending us a 200 word summary of your piece giving an idea of where you went and why you want to share it with others then along with two or three photos send it in and dont forget to include your age and details of how to contact you

4464736 the use of this device in the course of the minor accompanied by fever this is a normal phenomenon
4464737 we were up in the air and two guys who were surprisingly a lot older than us started fights
4464738 then we had to be redirected to venice for a couple of hours the police came on and had to get them off
4464739 they had a couple of drinks on them they were extremely aggressive one of the guys half way through the flight stood up and started smashing the overhead compartments
4464740 the incident occurred in italian airspace at approximately 10pm irish time where a number of passengers were involved in an incident on board
4464741 the captain then made the decision for the safety of all on board to divert to venice where the aircraft was met by members of the italian police
4464742 five people were removed from the aircraft by italian police and the remaining passengers continued their flight approximately two hours later and have arrived safely in heraklion
4464743 the concern was the people who may have worked over the hours that was allocated
4464744 i have a background in human resources and i surely wouldnt have gotten myself caught up in something that wouldve been that way
4464745 so there can be some evaluation of how theyre spending the money and who theyre spending it on
4464746 can we objectively look at it and say were spending this much money are we getting what were supposed to get

4464764 if i dont know them they dont know my brother
4464765 because my friend killed somebody in a brawl about two years ago on state street
4464766 clearly the protection of witnesses is one of our foremost concerns whenever dealing with gang cases
4464767 its not unusual for witnesses who cooperate with law enforcement to be intimidated or physically harmed
4464768 the word was passed on the street that our witness had identified ricardo juarez
4464769 any attempt at dissuading a witness from testifying in a criminal case is a prosecutable offense and the penalty is severe if convicted
4464770 we want to do whatever we can to ensure that every witness that comes to court feels safe and is not threatened
4464771 we know our client has nothing to do with this
4464772 were concerned this could reflect on him and were terrified
4464773 we are intensifying enforcement during this crackdown and will be especially vigilant during the high risk nighttime hours when impaired drivers will be on the road
4464774 our message is simple if we find you driving impaired by alcohol or drugs we will arrest you
4464775 im embarrassed when we try to recruit kids to run here they feel bad because all the local high schools have new tracks
4464776 there certainly is recognition that there needs to be a track and theres certainly recognition that the track we have is not where we want it to be
4464777 it doesnt make a lot of sense to put dollars into a track that may not exist much longer
4464778 the u s has the best olympic track team in the world so i was expecting a good track
4464779 it was old and neglected its a college track so it should be good
4464780 i thought i could have made it to the next level
4464781 the busiest place in town right now is jockos and this is right across the street
4464782 maybe people will go across the street do some shopping and then go have dinner
4464783 this is a highly blighted area and has been blighted for a long time
4464784 this is the first project to come along to change that and turn the corner
4464785 the goal with this project is to create long term rentals for when people dont want to buy like now
4464786 were looking to make sure were making growth thats one of the things with the scores that were released today is that were making progress
4464787 there has been a lot of pressure for us to improve and i think that the entire district is really embracing the challenge and has stepped up to the plate in terms of doing whatever it takes to get these kids to be successful
4464788 its something that has universal appeal with this age group
4464789 what do you do if you see matches or a lighter
4464790 my favorite part of the fire station was when the firefighters give us our hats
4464791 we want to do everything we can to improve our environment and minimize our impact
4464792 free green and clean it doesnt get any better than that
4464793 customers have been very receptive to the ip physical security division and the uk market for cctv is very buoyant

4464795 its in hibernation and its been in hibernation for some time and its probably in decline
4464796 its natural for the prime minister to come here these people died for the country
4464797 the ldp realized that focusing on ideological issues is not a vote winner they saw what happened to abe
4464798 all these bread and butter issues are what they have to focus on
4464799 i am excited to join a true community bank locally owned and managed where quick and thoughtful decisions and highly personalized and responsive client service is the consistent focus

4464826 we dont feel there should be a permanent appointment to this position especially at the salary level it is at the moment of around 80 000
4464827 with the county council having to make a lot of savings at the moment they could do without recruiting for the post
4464828 it seems quite clear they are determined to press ahead with the one council for suffolk option
4464829 they are spending a lot of money promoting it and it is clear what they are doing is appointing someone who can further their case for them
4464830 councillors will be interviewing for the post of head of communications and marketing and if a suitable candidate is identified they will consider making an appointment either there and then or soon after this meeting

4464847 when something goes wrong they put someone in charge of data quality and when things get better they pull those resources away
4464848 when you say you want a data analyst theyll come back with a dba database administrator but its not the same at all
4464849 most of the divisions would have sworn they had great processes and standards and place
4464850 but when you show them they entered the customer name 17 different ways or someone had entered loading dock open 8 00 4 00 into the address field they realize its not as clean as they thought

4464852 we want to keep our top clients as clean as possible
4464853 some things youre just going to have to let go or youd have a data warehouse with only 15 to 20 records
4464854 you can pay millions of dollars a year to get it perfect but if the returns are in the hundreds of thousands is it worth it
4464855 causing them so many headaches and adding several extra steps to the process
4464856 everyone thinks theirs is the best approach and you need someone to facilitate
4464857 youre argumentative and confrontational that would indicate youre not an appropriate steward
4464858 what is becoming clearer and clearer about the san francisco network fiasco is that blame aplenty exists
4464859 its a crime against humanity whats happening to these women it needs to be addressed and brought to the forefront

4464881 our friendship has been so dominant in the last few years as part of a team you cant let anyone down
4464882 to beat them by half a second made it that exciting honestly it took every inch of effort in beating the french who have been invincible
4464883 the french have been so dominant we have really put all the pieces of the jigsaw together we really focused on the details to stick half a second into them its amazing
4464884 it hasnt sunk in yet its weird but mostly exciting
4464885 we were very disappointed after athens ive given absolutely everything i could into it and it paid off
4464886 the georgians were working for years in the field of organic warfare
4464887 it was an old program the soviets discontinued but a lot of the same scientists were drawn to tiblisi when it was taken up there
4464888 basically they realized what wouldnt work on one end of the target just might work on the other
4464889 we think the georgians actually used the guiding principals of anti air missiles where an explosive projectile homes in on the exhaust of a target and applied that to their anti personnel efforts
4464890 the weapon didnt have much effect on tanks or anything else armoured but it absolutely devastated the average soldier reducing infantry strength like not much else weve seen in the non nuclear range of weaponry
4464891 a publicist representing clooney had said offhandedly that the actor and the candidate had indeed spoken in the past
4464892 clearly anybody who didnt hedge oil a year ago at 70 couldnt possibly claim that they were on top of their game
4464893 if oil is 130 for the winter and the fares fall by 5 well be somewhere between break even and a small loss if oil is lower it will be better than that if fares rise it will be better than that
4464894 given the movements in oil theres every chance it will be better than that but were not changing our guidance
4464895 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4464896 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4464897 to begin repairing relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must respect the freedom of its neighbors
4464898 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4464899 moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4464900 in the years since its gained independence after the soviet unions collapse georgias become a courageous democracy
4464901 its people are making the tough choices that are required of free societies since the rose revolution in 2003 the georgian people have held free elections opened up their economy and built the foundations of a successful democracy
4464902 the people of georgia have cast their lot with the free world and we will not cast them aside
4464903 back at the sharp end of war providing essential support to soldiers of his battalion who are wounded in action
4464904 for many of the worlds neutral observers the deployment of clegg in afghanistan will be judged against his role in the killing of two children karen reilly and martin peake no matter how much the british spin their version
4464905 it is not at all surprising that the british army have deployed clegg in afghanistan and most likely numerous other british soldiers and former ruc personnel who were equally involvement in human rights abuses in ireland and who were given impunity
4464906 in terms of transition it is evidentially the case that the british army have not drawn any lessons from its campaign in ireland despite its numerous military failings not least the killing of hundreds of children and civilians
4464907 one would have thought that given such a legacy that clear lessons would have been learnt lets hope that the people of afghanistan are spared three and half decades of the british army
4464908 it is important to recognize the difference between tiredness and fatigue because fatigue is a marker that the body is not able to keep up

4464931 fantasy does not mean that when i desire a strawberry cake and cannot get it in reality i fantasize about eating it the problem it rather how do i know that i desire a strawberry cake in the first place this is what fantasy tells me this role of fantasy hinges on the fact that there is no sexual relationship no universal formula or matrix guaranteeing a harmonious sexual relationship with ones partner because of the lack of this universal formula every subject has to invent a fantasy of his or her own a private formula for the sexual relationship for a man the relationship with a woman is possible only inasmuch as she fits his formula
4464932 motifs of the struggle for recognition of the dialectical connection between recognition of desire and desire for recognition
4464933 and traversing the fantasy involves precisely the acceptance of the traumatic fact of radical closure there is no opening contingency as such is necessary bearing in mind that our capacity to desire involves the paradoxical structure of the forced choice one can fully appreciate the radical character of traversing the fantasy by means of this traversing the gap is closed the structure of the forced choice is suspended the closure of being is fully accepted the hysterical game of i offer you x on condition that you reject it which structures our belonging to a community is over
4464934 according to doxa fantasy stands for the moment of closure fantasy is the screen by means of which the subject avoids the radical opening of the enigma of the others desire
4464935 jouissance is thus the ontological aberration the disturbed balance which accounts for the passage from nothing to something jouissance is thus the place of the subject

4464938 hegalian totality is not an organic whole within which each element sticks to its limited place but a crazy totality in which a position reverts to its other in the very movement of its excessive exaggeration the dialectical link of partial elements emerges only through their exaggeration
4464939 the real as impossible is precisely the excess of immediacy which cannot be reified in a fetish
4464940 people use pornography or other technical sex devices not only when they lack flesh and blood partners but also to spice up their real sex life
4464941 because of its absolute immanence to the symbolic the real cannot be positively signified it can only be shown in a negative gesture as the inherent failure of symbolization if what we are talking about are the limits of a signifying system it is clear that those limits cannot themselves be signified but have to show themselves as the interruption or breakdown of the process of signification

4464943 i often tell people that if your product isnt being counterfeited then you probably have a brand that isnt worth much
4464944 but consumers are at risk of buying counterfeit products that pose a real danger

4464951 it went extremely well and we are delighted that the norwegian guard honoured nils olav with a knighthood

4464959 we had quite a few opportunities last week that has to be said
4464960 we would have liked to have taken them and put the game to bed and if you dont take these chances in games that are close you can regret it
4464961 fortunately last week we were in control of the situation when it went to

4464967 a democratic national convention that is supposed to showcase barack obama will devote a considerable amount of time to hillary rodham clinton and her family with the two campaigns announcing an agreement thursday to formally enter her name into nomination the development means that during the state by state vote on a nominee for president delegates will have the option of choosing clinton rather than obama giving supporters a chance to cheer her candidacy one last time barring an unforeseen collapse on obamas part clinton wont win
4464968 they may have it choreographed where there is some stage play

4465020 we have bills and receipts for large sums spent on brandy wine ale and meals he also spent heavily on jewellery cosmetics and tooth cleaning powder
4465021 he spent extravagantly on items such as brooches belt buckles and even a gold tooth pick his bills for clothing were immense
4465022 a scene in which lazarus criticizes speedman for going full retard in simple jack is a put down only of overweening ambitious actors who take roles as physically and mentally challenged characters because theyre proven oscar bait
4465023 tropic thunder is drawing fire from special interest groups for its frequent use of the word retard but discerning audiences will know where the humor is targeted and theyll be laughing too hard to take offense
4465024 the scripts references to retards have generated some pre release controversy but advocates for people with learning disabilities should find something worthier to protest the target here is the pretensions of movie stars who think that by adopting a stammer they can understand the problems of the people they portray

4465048 yeah way to go usa now let s go and kick the asses of those rag heads in iran
4465049 we ve seen a big increase in storage demand and want to plan for the future so that we re managing costs as well as cutting the energy and resources we re devoting to storage and backup as part of our commitment to the environment
4465050 for many years we only had tb of central storage to accommodate the requirements of both students and staff after moving to the network appliance solution two years ago this quickly expanded to 20 tb
4465051 many of our users were storing large amounts of important information on their own hard drives and other devices moving this to central storage coupled with a general increase in demand meant we had to plan ahead before our data management got out of control
4465052 we need to keep data especially research data for many years and because some of it doesn t need to be accessed frequently we saw an opportunity to archive it to lower cost disk storage over time older data will be moved off line to removable storage such as tape or optical media
4465053 reducing backup volumes was important because backup windows were already approaching twelve hours and we could see this becoming an even greater problem in the future and of course by using less spinning disk reducing backups and minimizing the data we might need to replicate we reduce the power and cooling resources we consume overall
4465054 we were very reassured by the demo which persuaded us that bh filestore could keep our data accessible and viewable once it was in the archive
4465055 we re putting in place a long term strategy so we wanted to avoid newer suppliers who we couldn t be sure would be around in years to come and it was important that they could support us from the uk because we didn t want to encounter the same issues we ve had when making technical support calls to other countries in addition the licensing model offered by bridgehead allows us to control our costs we re not charged on the basis of the number of users as some other suppliers wanted to do with over 20 000 potential users this would work out way too expensive instead we re being charged a set amount based on the volume of data we archive so not only is it one of the best products we ve seen it s also affordable

4465063 he thought nothing of this until a short time later he observed four males wearing balaclavas and dark clothing running across his garden and approaching his conservatory door
4465064 they were carrying various weapons an axe a large knife a bat a bar and a pole
4465065 they approached the conservatory and began to kick it and hit it with their weapons
4465066 one of the males approached the door and smashed its glass panels with an axe
4465067 the glass showered mr razaq causing him to back away from the door
4465068 as the intruders came through the door the victim fell and the man armed with the axe fell on top of him

4465174 the boat at hope cove is vital because it takes 25 minutes for the lifeboat to get from salcombe and a swimmer could easily drown when the mca withdrew the boat in june they said it would be for six weeks but the crew wanted it back as soon as possible so they paid for the repairs themselves
4465175 they were then told it had to stay off service until it was surveyed and that would have taken it out for the whole of the summer season anyone would have done the same thing when they saw the girl in trouble
4465176 the health and safety of the boat crews and those who they may render assistance to is of paramount importance
4465177 search and rescue effectiveness will not be compromised by the suspension of the general purpose boat
4465178 we have identified serious breaches of health and safety procedures and they are currently being investigated the boat has been stood down for a further eight weeks while we investigate the possibility of repair or replacement
4465179 discard is a terrible practice in addition to the moral aspects of this sheer waste of food discards lead to unrecorded catches which lead to incorrect fisheries statistics which again disrupt the basis for scientific assessments of stocks and scientific advice on management
4465180 the best scientific advice is that we shouldnt be fishing for cod at all because stocks have been so depleted in the north sea and yet here we have tons of fish being dumped overboard
4465181 discard is happening all the time but normally it takes place at sea where nobody can see what is happening
4465182 the fishermen would say it happens because quotas are too small and they have to throw fish back but you would have to be insane to agree with that argument
4465183 it is morally wrong and its just p ing in your own bed this has been illegal in norway since the eighties and the boat would have been arrested had it done it in the norwegian sector it is just calculated environmental criminality the whole thing is very provocative disappointing and shocking
4465184 the system forces fishermen to go to a place they are unfamiliar with to seek the fish they have quotas for
4465185 if they had dumped it there and then they would have been breaking norwegian laws and if they had landed it back in the uk they would have been fined
4465186 they did the only think they could do which was to steam 100 miles away wasting time and fuel to an area where they hoped to find the type of fish they are entitled to catch and where they could legally dump the saithe
4465187 this is a horrible indictment of the system fishermen have to operate under these are young men under massive pressures trying to make a living no fisherman wants to dump fish his job is to find fish for people to eat not to see it thrown over the side
4465188 throwing dead fish back into the sea is a waste that nobody wants to see but there is no easy answer
4465189 uk fishermen have shown that they are committed to finding new ways of protecting vulnerable stocks and the european union has backed a uk action plan designed to reduce the amount of discards
4465190 the uk is keen to ensure more effective and sustainable fisheries by reducing by catch and discards and the government is working closely with fishermen to achieve that
4465191 this is all about quota management they give us so little that we have to do crazy things just to make a living two years ago when we came with the copious the quotas were better but what they have done is whittled it away
4465192 one of the conditions that came out worst was osteoarthritis where we asked people if theyd received basic advice such as doing exercises to control the condition and whether they had effective pain relief
4465193 at the more severe end of the scale for those with severe osteoarthritis we asked if they had been given the opportunity to see a specialist to talk about joint replacement there were also issues around whether elderly patients had been asked the reason for their falls these types of areas did not fare so well in the study
4465194 these figures show that age discrimination within the nhs is still rife
4465195 the rewards system for gps to treat particular conditions has worked but this hasnt included health problems older people particularly suffer from like depression falls and vision and hearing problems the system is therefore clearly failing thousands of older people
4465196 this kind of ageist treatment is precisely why legislation against age discrimination is needed
4465197 in many cases all candidates have three as and increasingly four as
4465198 some talented pupils do more than three a levels because they enjoy the work and the challenge
4465199 in fact they might be disadvantaging themselves by taking the edge off their overall performance by doing so much
4465200 but im sure there are those who think that offering something extra will give them extra credit with universities it wont
4465201 increasingly pupils have opted for four or five as a way of distinguishing themselves from other candidates
4465202 my own feeling is that pupils should not be encouraged to do too many a levels because it eats into time that should be devoted to all those other important aspects of an education such as sport public speaking and the performing arts

4465206 a lot of people were offended but i decided not to delete the comment
4465207 my policy is i do delete comments where the commenter is intending to be offensive but i dont delete comments where the commenters primary intention is to be witty even if what they say ends up offending people
4465208 ive deleted all the comments on here relating to sex with people who have downs syndrome
4465209 although google havent informed me exactly which post on this blog caused the activation of their hate crimes division the strength of feeling in the comments section here leads me to believe it was this one

4465276 during the past six months diatect has made great strides in improving operations and increasing sales by expanding its marketing activities but there is still a considerable amount of work to be done during the second half of the year diatect will focus on designing and deploying new marketing initiatives in its three divisions of internet agricultural and retail although most of our plans are sales oriented we are also rededicating ourselves to efficiency and cost reduction on a company wide basis we are redesigning our internet marketing program to refine its focus and drive profitability the internet market has been a traditionally strong segment for diatect but there is definitely an opportunity for further growth in our agricultural division the goal is to increase market penetration and to focus on attractive niches perhaps more dramatically we will be initiating a major retail marketing effort to make diatect products widely available we feel that there is considerable opportunity for the retail division to achieve impressive gains as consumer trends favoring green and organic products are emerging and our products have been under represented in this segment

4465349 russias blitz into the former soviet republic of georgia has exposed starkly the limits of us military power and geopolitical influence in the era following the invasion of iraq
4465350 since the crisis began there has been no hint that the united states would consider any kind of military move even logistical aid for georgian forces that would bring it into direct conflict with russia
4465351 perhaps the georgian leader thought the us would come to his aid if he got in trouble if so he did not take into account the drain that iraq has been on us forces and the us standing in the world
4465352 what has become of the langobards the goths and the vandals they have disappeared plunged into the great nothing because although the power exuding germanic victors conquered a whole world they did not know how to impose their beautiful language upon the subjugated peoples

4465357 we have long warned many of our colleagues about the aggression being prepared against south ossetia and abkhazia but we were not met with understanding in the osce nor the european union and just what happened to our people to the people of south ossetia shows that georgia did not act alone and today many european countries and primarily the united states are also responsible for the genocide of the small ossetian people even the code name for the operation which took place in south ossetia free ground speaks for itself
4465358 now they u s and its allies have been forced to back down on the key issues of the mandate of russian peace keepers in south ossetia which did not previously in clude outside patrols and on the territorial integrity question which rus sia ostensibly accepted before but no longer does

4465383 basically we start with current events move on to maybe our kids our spouses and or relationships maybe throw in something about our work maybe a little gossip about someone we know or dont know somewhere in there something about sex comes up my note evidently except when luis is present and usually by or near the end of the run the topic moves on to food
4465384 talk about how were insanely obessed with running that while were running all we talk about is running or anything that has to do with running like garmin glitches pace mileage diet and of course running skirts
4465385 what is said on the run stays on the run
4465386 theoretically everyone can win the premier league realistically they cannot
4465387 i call it the tiger woods factor tiger woods winning every week does not reduce interest it creates interest
4465388 last season was fantastic everything was played out right to the end with so much was at stake then two of our clubs reached the champions league final
4465389 it will be difficult to have another season as good as that again
4465390 what we must avoid is one club winning it on a sustained basis
4465391 but i have seen manchester united win it three times on the trot and chelsea win it twice
4465392 on both occasions people said they will win it 10 years in a row even united fans were saying they would not get anywhere near chelsea but look what happened
4465393 it was an idea to look at but it was almost as if the players were boarding the plane
4465394 but we cannot just throw the concept away say no more international thoughts and just carry on
4465395 it is hard to appreciate what a phenomenon we are we are an export any country in the world knows about the premier league and we want to keep it that way
4465396 we have said we will put something together in february that will be a little bit more concrete until then nothing will be ruled out or in
4465397 there is a strategic opportunity to develop our second and third tier clubs
4465398 this idea would get them closer to the big four the way we work the money we gain internationally gets divided equally
4465399 if we can also get more global exposure they may be able to catch the big four in some small way you will never get there entirely of course but it is important to be competitive
4465400 my ear feels good my pinky is fine and my left elbow feels good too

4465410 while numerous scientists most notably francis collins and craig venter have declared that genetics and the sequence of the human genome prove that there is no such thing as race
4465411 more obviously the sales growth in the sedan segment has cooled from more than 20 percent in the first quarter 10 percent in the second quarter to the current 1 6 percent

4465414 they certainly dont want to see their dollars flowing off their fields into the bay
4465415 scientists and farmers need to continue working together to develop farming methods that minimize the transfer of nutrients from land to sea
4465416 dead zones occur when excess nutrients primarily nitrogen and phosphorus enter coastal waters and help fertilize blooms of algae when these microscopic plants die and sink to the bottom they provide a rich food source for bacteria which in the act of decomposition consume dissolved oxygen from surrounding waters

4465429 when i was at the wharton school of business id watch him every night
4465430 he is a very qualified candidate but i just dont agree with him on major essential policies like iraq and energy
4465431 i trust my parents my family is the kind of family who sat around the dinner table and talked politics
4465432 he said we were attacked in places where we werent just to make a case for the war
4465433 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states
4465434 obamas people know that they have not closed the deal with hillary voters the way they would like and they just cant afford to do anything real or perceived that upsets mrs clinton and her followers so they have more than bent over to accommodate her
4465435 you do worry and i think that was something that concerned her as well
4465436 what is the turnout going to be is anyone coming to my party
4465437 she sought to be the first woman nominated for president she came up a little short but she made it easier for the next female candidate to get the brass ring many in the democratic party would like to celebrate that i think that they should celebrate that
4465438 i think having toys and games around makes them forget where they are and more like they are at home

4465483 when you go from extreme high water to low water that has a tendency to leave behind significant sediment and it shifts channels unexpectedly
4465484 when you have a flood you get a combination of sediment and soil coming off the farm fields and golf courses and streets and yards
4465485 also the energy from the flow picks up sand off the bottom of the river it swirls it all together in this milky hazy mixture that comes down the river during flooding

4465494 dear dad i have very good news and it is we are coming home soon it might be a week or 2 so we will be back
4465495 i think the sentence is a bit light he should face a harsher sentence because he has committed a crime against a child
4465496 we are looking to the court to ultimately impose a total sentence in the case that improves on past responses to this serious national regional and international problem
4465497 prosecution of child sex offenders in the east asia pacific region continues to be low and sentences do not reflect the gravity of the crime
4465498 i guess what im trying to say is if i can change and you can change everybody can change
4465499 some sad incidents happened at a time when we had a boom in the tourism industry it is as if the sun had set at noon
4465500 my effort will be bring the leaders of the agitation to the table so that all the problems are resolved
4465501 all i can remember is going up i went up and i came down and i hit something very very hard
4465502 a soldier told me i hit the footpath but as far as i was concerned i thought i hit a telegraph pole cause all i could see was sparks and the smell of rubber
4465503 i looked down and i could see annes skirt and i thought oh poor annes been injured too
4465504 i thought wheres the rest of the girls and they werent i couldnt see anybody
4465505 i think the intelligence services have not fully cooperated with the investigation
4465506 my father said and i do believe his words theres a time for you to be born into this world and a time for you to be taken out of it
4465507 thats quite true cause its been proved cause all those people round me were all taken and i was saved but in saying that it was a hard fight a very hard fight
4465508 even in their absence the court believes it has authority to proceed with the case
4465509 its not one of our key worries for the rating at this stage
4465510 we are more worried about the current account deficit rising external debt levels and inflation
4465511 but if you had escalation or even if a small clash simply prompted capital flight then that would have a negative effect conflict would certainly be negative but that is not something we see as very likely at this stage
4465512 if inflation stays at these levels in quite high double figures then that would add to risks to the macroeconomy and possibly prompt negative ratings action
4465513 but we have a great challenge ahead of us coming up
4465514 we are pleased to list another innovative product developed by barclays global investors a proven leader in creating investment solutions for institutional and individual investors
4465515 nasdaq is committed to providing this new ishares etf with high levels of visibility and liquidity
4465516 as frivolous as this case may sound its an indicator of where the homosexual agenda is headed

4465665 this provides further support for the notion that female sexuality is relatively fluid and that the distinction between lesbian and bisexual women is not a rigid one

4465938 durante cinco a os eleva el riesgo de sufrir fractura de cadera
4465939 no existe tal asociaci n cuando se utiliza en periodos cortos
4465940 los datos del nuevo trabajo vienen a corroborar los hallados en un estudio previo amplio y muy bien realizado que se public en 2006 en una revista de impacto como es el jornal of the american medical association
4465941 la relaci n entre consumo de ibp y el mayor riesgo de fractura de cadera est clara pero lo importante es recordar que tal y como ha quedado establecido en ambos trabajos este aumento no es alarmante es decir si los usuarios de estos productos utilizan la dosis est ndar tienen entre 1 y 1 5 veces m s riesgo de padecer fractura de cadera pero esta posibilidad es la misma que tienen las personas que toman otro tipo de f rmacos como los corticosteroides o consumen alcohol
4465942 es que el riesgo se eleva dos o tres veces m s cuando la dosis es mayor de la considerada como est ndar y con el consumo de los productos es prolongado
4465943 deben valorar muy bien los riesgos y beneficios de su prescripci n en cada enfermo
4465944 algunas limitaciones en su estudio como la falta de informaci n sobre el consumo de suplementos de calcio de venta sin receta vitamina d alcohol y tabaco de los participantes lo que puede alterar los resultados as como el hecho de que la investigaci n sea observacional

4465947 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4465948 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4465949 we know when it touches us and he knew that so thats where it comes into calling it on yourself because its the right thing to do
4465950 should i expect him to do that maybe not maybe i shouldnt expect people to hold themselves to high standards sportsmanship
4465951 but yes i did expect it a little more so in the olympics when were all competing under the banner of this event being to promote sportsmanship to promote goodwill amongst countries
4465952 that was heat of the moment stuff he hit it right at me
4465953 probably didnt want to hear an apology right away because i thought it was intentional when we changed sides he said sorry its part of the game you were on top of the game
4465954 i said okay thats fine its part of the game youre right move on and we did
4465955 i know him very well ive played him many times on tour he does everything in his power to win
4465956 usually its within the rules sometimes its bordering on gamesmanship
4465957 but hes too good of a player to do something like that and to act like that thats why its disappointing because he is a great player
4465958 i try to do it with integrity so my parents would be proud of the way i played
4465959 if that happened the other way i never would have finished the match because my father would have pulled me off the court if i had acted that way
4465960 my absolute passion for music is fuelled by giving and sharing something with other people i chose songs i really love and have meaning to me in the hope that they would touch others
4465961 while these are artists who have influenced me i want to be genuine in my music and to be myself

4465965 i think if it was over today hes the greatest olympian who ever lived
4465966 i do think its difficult to compare the different sports but in terms of just sheer dominance in his events and the times hes putting up and what hes doing now in two olympics really three but two where we won medals i think its hard to argue

4465968 i hit a lot of good iron shots and i gave myself plenty of chances at birdie
4465969 ive been striking the ball well and now i am starting to score along with it
4465970 ive been feeling like for the last six or seven weeks that something good is coming
4465971 the main thing was getting off to a good start
4465972 that kind of got me going early on i was pretty solid from tee to green every facet was going good today hopefully i can keep it going
4465973 i cant control it i didnt let it bother me i just went over the range and hit a bunch of 70 yard shots and i happened to dial that one in
4465974 tee to green is perfect and if you hit a good putt you are going to make it i like golf courses that are more difficult and this is definitely one of those
4465975 i felt like i hit a lot of good putts but i couldnt make anything i didnt hurt myself but i didnt help myself hopefully i can play a little better tomorrow

4465978 the objective of 6 plus economic growth and halving unemployment and poverty by 2014 will remain a dream unless we get our education and public health right
4465979 our education system must talk to the skills needs of the economy
4465980 mathematics science ict and language competency are critical for us to develop south africa into one the fastest growing economies in the world
4465981 those intellectuals who felt isolated over the years must be given space to make their contribution
4465982 through education we will break the chain of poverty in the individual households
4465983 we are committing ourselves that educators will be in school on time use the time in school productively for the benefit of the learner and not leave earlier than expected
4465984 we are committing ourselves to ensuring that the learners will be in school on time without any weapon or drugs and subject themselves to the discipline of the school
4465985 the parents will participate actively in the learning process of a child and ensure that the schools in their communities are safe for learning and are not vandalised
4465986 this is the pledge we are making today friday in public and will live it every day in our communities
4465987 the nation must have the right to access health facilities of acceptable standards
4465988 when used as a burial marker the cross does not signify death in the abstract instead it connotes the deceaseds christian faith
4465989 the cross is the pre eminent symbol of christianity for the government to claim that the cross is a secular symbol is deeply offensive and betrays a poor understanding of religion and our constitution
4465990 when used as a burial marker the cross does not signify death in the abstract
4465991 for the government to claim that the cross is a secular symbol is deeply offensive and betrays a poor understanding of religion and our constitution
4465992 we made this sacrifice along with him and we get to have this symbol of what happened
4465993 justify sacrificing the establishment clause and its animating principle that the political and the religious are both better served when kept separate
4465994 so what did you do last night the economics of infidelity
4465995 publishes research on political economy worldwide containing contributions from scholars of international status it emphasizes contributions dealing with real world issues as well as economic policy applications and encourages unorthodox approaches with a sound analytical base
4465996 have you ever had sex with someone other than your husband or wife while you were married
4465997 on the john edwards question it is consistent with our findings in that it appears that men dont consider the potential costs of an affair at least as well as we could measure it also we find that men do respond to opportunity and the biology literature would tell us that a man like john edwards gives signals success wealth looks of having good genes and would therefore be in demand as a partner
4465998 blog as a type of template to help me out at first on her first few days she said she went on myspace and other networking sites like that to find some people so i have decided to do the same i havent found anyone yet but if i do i will tell you it sucks when youre single
4465999 hey and im alrite you and yeh last night was gd r u on msn
4466000 i know we havnt been with each other long and it might be a bit soon but i really like you so do you wana go out
4466001 yeah we havnt known each other that long but i do really like you too so yeah i will
4466002 i think i would have waited for you a lifetime in that case
4466003 and the money is spent where you live and work it handles local needs rather than national needs
4466004 how huge the strain on tremblancs social services was mental health issues everything
4466005 my kids are relatively fortunate and we live comfortably but we cant forget that there are a lot of people who arent that fortunate
4466006 its easy to forget the strain on local agencies and resources but we can be proactive we can get to kids at risk early its proactive use of money to make kids feel connected so they dont become bullies or drop out its all prevention and the payoff is high for the kids we help and the community as a whole
4466007 but its a whole new economy high tech health sciences pharma and education are driving it weve already started working to attract people and businesses in the new sectors but we need to keep working to bring young people on board
4466008 but pick a skill you want to develop and i guarantee theres a volunteer position at united way that will help you develop it
4466009 i think in the first year we really kind of established the vibe of what the symphony is going to be
4466010 im kind of a young guy so i have this idea the symphony is not just somebody playing old music for stuffy people its an environment for discovery
4466011 id never thought that id be going to harvard but i was lucky to get in so i thought i should go
4466012 it was actually at harvard that i realized i had enough talent in music to give it a shot
4466013 i think the first concert i saw was shock rocker alice cooper
4466014 i turned on to classical music at 14 it kind of opened up a world i never knew was there when i heard a bach symphony for the first time it completely blew my mind and made me feel things i never felt from music but it doesnt mean i still dont like alice cooper
4466015 it was at the time in my life i wanted to bring my own vision of what an orchestra is and be in charge
4466016 i found k w and this area is very forward thinking in a lot of ways people they try things out here i thought i could be a part of that
4466017 this has been an incredibly successful concert act around north america audiences come out of the woodwork
4466018 when they come in the hall there will be video games for them to play
4466019 the audiences are certainly growing and most people are very surprised by the average age of fans coming to our songwriters series people from teens into their 80s its quite a mix
4466020 i think edwin has great insight great vision hes fearless in what his dreams are
4466021 ive been to 20 of em canadian opens you go
4466022 the scoreboard has to tell the story of the tournament

4466025 love to see their name in print and perhaps thats why the pga tour has five full time calligraphers on staff
4466026 its just so exciting to be part of professional golf tournament
4466027 and this calligraphy is just a wonderful thing to do
4466028 deer ridge sportsworld is the healthiest office node in kitchener the low vacancy rate and strong absorption matches that of the phillip street area in waterloo
4466029 the centre of business in kitchener has been changing for a while now and its all about access
4466030 old brick and beam structures like the lang cannery in downtown kitchener those are cool and highly sought after spaces and its next to the school of pharmacy its perfect space for restaurants artisans and high tech companies
4466031 condos feed into high tech because condo buyers are often single white collar and young the people who work in high tech

4466033 and though we can look around and find exceptions that tend to
4466034 the time is ripe for new development available office space in waterloo is virtually non existent and available inventory in downtown kitchener is also approaching record high occupancy levels construction is happening because there is demand for additional space

4466046 especially in this weakening economy people need to know and hear that theres some plan for the economy
4466047 right now conservatives are very solid in a whole bunch of areas and thats almost a surrogate for leadership thats why it really will come down to the campaign
4466048 then i came out saw 20 30 people run to the school bus and they were like oh my god theres somebody over here and went to lift
4466049 about 20 of us just get underneath the bus and start lifting up the bus they pull her out from underneath there then they see that shes pregnant
4466050 the light turned red and i couldnt stop i tried to miss her
4466051 i tried to go behind her but she stopped and moved back and i hit her
4466052 its a terrible poignancy that donnettes sons birthday will now coincide with the day his mother died
4466053 i hope that as this child grows up he comes to understand that his mother gave her life in service to our city and that we are forever grateful
4466054 i work in a warehouse for a major american retailer and we were shipped 7d brochures by mistake they were quickly repossessed before i could take one there is also a product entry in our receiving system for the 7d theres no price attached to it

4466056 the d90 is purely speculation the d80 was announced in the summer of 2006 and shipped in early fall 2006 so its been two years the d90 will be announced via press release everything else youve heard is baloney since the people who know arent telling
4466057 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
4466058 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
4466059 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
4466060 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
4466061 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
4466062 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
4466063 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
4466064 did you know there are 70 million electric bikes on the road today in china and they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year
4466065 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and electric scooters will allow you to do that to get that familiarity
4466066 unlike some on wall street that see trends continuing indefinitely on their current trajectories i believe that television advertising revenues will recover in the near future and that ybi is well positioned to take advantage of this recovery
4466067 historically advertising expenditures are among the first to be cut at the start of a recession they are also among the first to return when the economy begins its recovery

4466181 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4466210 china crescent is an early stage business and our first priority has been establishing an initial revenue footprint china is a big economy and establishing an operation of some mass is important we are on track to meet our 50 million revenue forecast remember we historically have higher revenue in the second half of the year and being on track to meet our revenue forecast we are working on our bottom line and having results earlier than expected
4466211 since ishares launched the first pure mainland china etf for u s investors in 2005 investors have continued to ask for deeper access to the asian markets
4466212 the ishares msci all country asia ex japan index fund includes developed markets such as hong kong and singapore as well as emerging markets such as india and thailand without the weighted impact of japan and australia
4466213 we are pleased with our performance in the second quarter of 2008 and we are particularly gratified with the significant reductions in operating expenses at each of our business units as well as at the corporate level resulting in a 67 reduction in net loss in the quarter we continue to see the positive effects of our emphasis on cost controls while at the same time focusing on sales of higher margin products and services we are especially satisfied with the significant revenue increase in the quarter at our tbs business unit which showed a 23 sales increase over the prior year period
4466214 our recent acquisition of questys solutions is in keeping with our strategy of continuing to acquire intellectual and technology assets that will enhance broaden and improve our product offerings this strategic acquisition which increases our client roster to more than 1 400 provides a critical document management component and cohesiveness to our suite of outsourced business solutions which will accelerate our growth and enable us to significantly expand sales opportunities within each of our operating business units as well as attract new business
4466215 our revenue in the second quarter was weaker than the prior year as we completed several large r amp d contracts in 2007 unfortunately 3 million department of defense and department of energy funding approved by congress for fiscal year 2008 r amp d services which we expected in the second quarter wont begin until the third quarter we were extremely disappointed that the defense logistics agency recently decided to cancel the previously announced 5 million kiowa helicopter supply contract that we had expected to begin shipping in the second quarter we are pursuing discussions with the appropriate department of defense officials to assess future battery requirements for the kiowa helicopter program as a result these delays and cancellations our order backlog has not been replenished in time to replace the revenues from the completed contracts
4466216 with the receipt of ul certification for our 2 2 ampere hour model 18650axa rechargeable lithium ion cylindrical cell we placed the assets associated with our florida facility into service on may 1 2008 and began to classify the costs of the florida operation as cost of product revenue this resulted in incremental depreciation of approximately 250 000 per month and a significant increase in the gross loss as we have not yet reached a level of manufacturing volume sufficient to absorb all the costs of the plant we expect significant losses to continue until we obtain orders sufficient to achieve high volume manufacturing
4466217 the startup of our florida facility has taken longer and cost more than originally planned to provide added focus on this critical period of the companys growth i have assumed the role as acting general manager of the facility and have hired additional key staff james manning previously chief operating officer of lithium technology corporation has joined the company as director of engineering graydon hansen previously president and general manager of electric fuel battery corporation has joined the company as director of operations both bring great depth of experience and leadership to our florida operation
4466218 we have begun aggressively marketing our manufacturing capabilities and products and have been actively supplying potential customers with sample 2 2 and 2 4 ampere hour cells the level of interest from potential customers is high and we have already received orders valued over 100 000 for these products in the past two weeks although we are confident in our ability to ramp up manufacturing and produce high quality cells and that our marketing efforts will result in a steady flow of customer orders the timing of customer commitments order volume and delivery schedules will be unpredictable until we have an established backlog and ongoing customer relationships
4466219 the company needs an immediate infusion of operating capital in order to maintain operations we believe that our ongoing capital requirements are consistent with those of companies that are in a similar early stage of development we recently completed a warrant sale to an existing investor to provide limited bridge funding and we are currently in discussions with existing investors and new investors to raise additional capital as our business develops we must continue to raise additional capital our ability to realize our business plan will depend on our future success in capital raising activities
4466220 we are pleased with achieving the increased production and lower per barrel operating costs we are also pleased to have completed the divestiture of the onshore california resulting in a significant pay down of outstanding debt moving towards our goal of a 20 to 25 reduction by year end 2008 looking ahead we now have clear visibility on our phase 2 production target of a further increase of 1 000 barrels per day from the beta field by the end of september 2008 this forecasted increase in production will further drive down operating cost per barrel and drive revenue and ebitda higher

4466262 i think you can compare picture book structure to the structure of poetry for example sonnets have 14 lines picture books can have 14 double page spreads so taking a sonnet as an example of structure you can imitate one of these sonnet structures

4466335 later on we asked them to read and imagine short emotional scenarios for instance walking along a street bumping into a reeking drunken man who then starts to retch and realizing that some of his vomit had ended up in your own mouth finally we measured their brain activity while the participants tasted unpleasant solutions in the scanner

4466347 desperate to raise campaign cash to run more negative attack ads john mccain is cozying up to jack abramoffs cronies
4466348 on the campaign trail john mccain claims that he fought to expose jack abramoff and his corrupt cronies
4466349 it was a scandal that rocked the country linking all the way to the bush white house and republicans in congress sending two former republican congressmen to prison
4466350 but now desperate to raise campaign cash to run more negative attack ads john mccain is cozying up to jack abramoffs cronies
4466351 ralph reed a key business partner of jack abramoff helped the convicted former republican lobbyist launder 2 million dollars through a front group to finance a gambling campaign
4466352 now ralph reed has signed up to raise money for john mccain reed has even been appointed to mccains victory 2008 team
4466353 ralph reeds murky connections to jack abramoff run so deep it cost him a race for lt governor in georgia
4466354 while most people now see ralph reed as a tainted man raising tainted money john mccain sees him as a source of campaign cash

4466358 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4466359 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4466360 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now

4466366 the sentence could not be appealed guilty for converting to christianity a young saudi woman was set alight by her father who first had cut her tongue not an ordinary father but a member of the commission for the promotion of virtue and against vice a sort of police watching over the moral behaviour of the citizens of saudi arabia and the full compliance with the rules of the rigid wahabi doctrine by using whiplashes on the legs for too high heels and arresting men and women not linked by marriage or family bonds for meetings in restaurants to the injury of the conversion the woman had added also the insult of the written word by writing articles with christian religious content on blogs and regional websites the brutal news reported by the united arab emirates uae s daily gulf news reflects the reality of saudi arabia

4466372 volgens mij moet het debat over de betekenis van de jaren tachtig nog beginnen
4466373 er is een groot gebrek aan verantwoording over wat er toen is gebeurd
4466374 die commissies bieden een oplossing om er met het verleden uit te komen maar het was wel een hele andere situatie in zuid afrika
4466375 het gaat erom dat zaken niet blijven hangen die kunnen een last gaan vormen
4466376 that choice will end his bid for the presidency and spell defeat for other republican candidates
4466377 hes not even sure christian conservatives would vote for him let alone work for him if he picked a pro abortion running mate
4466378 a good portion of us were urging him to pick a pro life running mate
4466379 that choice would go a long way to solidify his credentials
4466380 wrong headed short sighted fracture the republican party and not allow us to capitalize on the democratic partys fracture right now
4466381 if he does that it makes our job 100 times harder it would dampen enthusiasm at a time when evangelicals are looking for ways to gin up enthusiasm
4466382 some people in the movement say it would be the kiss of death he heard that in the room last night
4466383 youre going to have to have a huge turnout of that base again for mccain to win
4466384 ninety percent of the workforce for bush in 04 came out of that constituency
4466385 picking a ridge or a joseph lieberman would not be helpful at all
4466386 the point that mccain was making is that people can differ on one issue and still be a vital member of our party
4466387 the fact that governor ridge is not perfectly in line with the party platform does not make him any less of a republican
4466388 the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4466389 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out for vice president
4466390 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that
4466391 this move to a pro choice running mate such as lieberman could help reshape his message to appeal to swing voters
4466392 the right wing is not going anywhere and choice is a key issue for over 40 women who voted for hillary in the primaries

4466404 no i knew i wanted to have a restaurant but that was it when i opened i thought maybe one day id have a michelin star nine out of 10 in the good food guide is amazing the fat ducks score last year i thought theyd stopped doing tens a few years ago so it was the ambition i never had in terms of ratings this is almost like the last frontier its such a special thing because it came out of the blue
4466405 i was very very excited and slightly disbelieving i found out a couple of weeks ago but i couldnt tell anyone until last night it was a kiddy thing if i told somebody maybe it wouldnt happen
4466406 most of the work we do is in development stuff that might seem really boring you cant get the more theatrical creative fun stuff which is absolutely essential for certain areas of the menu without all the tireless work at base level
4466407 ive got a team of brilliant people both in the kitchen and front of house that work their socks off
4466408 what do we want a restaurant to do feed us well memorably courteously and offer value for money the fat duck does all that and much more its great fun and it all adds up to a dining experience of the most wondrous enchantment
4466409 its extremely rare that a restaurant cooks perfectly on a consistent basis but weve had so many superlative reports that were delighted to recognise the fat duck as the best restaurant in britain
4466410 my first paid job as a chef was opening the fat duck when i look back on it i think naivety is a beautiful thing had i known what was going to come in the ensuing 5 or 6 years i wouldnt have had the guts to do it
4466411 we cant take our foot off the pedal we cant think that the fat ducks got a name and whatever we do is fine we cant ever think that way

4466432 i love my job but it sucks the life out of me sometimes digital scrapping has been a wonderful stress reliever and has allowed me to get some much needed time alone before i went digital i paper scrapped for a few months but just couldnt get into it im definitely a digi addict
4466433 i like to explore different scrapping styles but im mostly drawn to photo centric clean designs with lots of little details reminiscent of my paper pages
4466434 im also an avid cubbies fan and nature lover and love spending time outdoors
4466435 i used to have so much more time to scrap and i miss those days
4466436 i love telling our stories now since im an old mom and will most likely forget by the time the boys start asking questions about why they turned out the way they did i can just point t the scrapbooks and say i caint remember go look it up
4466437 i had seen my sister in laws albums and thought they were neat but i was sure i wouldnt get nearly as involved or wrapped up in scrapping as she was absolutely wrong i spent the next four years having three babies one after another and scrapping in any spare moment i could find simply for the sanity of it
4466438 i loved the flexibility and ease with which i could scrap while keeping an eye on my little ones another four years later and one more baby and i am 100 digital and couldnt be happier i love to scrap and still find my sanity in it hardly a week goes by that i dont scrap at least a couple pages and usually more
4466439 i have more pictures than i could probably ever get scrapped but its fun trying i love heathers kid friendly designs and had been a fan for a long time before joining her ct

4466447 this presidential election if it goes one way we could see a reimposition of the fairness doctrine i think itll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate and i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem then whoevers in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine

4466460 i think of all muslims especially in iraq as my brothers and i would never do anything to harm their blood their goods or their dignity
4466461 it is about emphasising the worship of god rather than politics the fact that the resistance does not have to end as long as there is an occupation as well as all aspects of resistance to the occupier
4466462 it is equally a call for unity for all iraqis

4466539 en democracias como la nuestra hay un grado de tolerancia pero cuando esa tolerancia se rebasa normalmente lo que se hace con esas personas es que se les declara non gratas y estas cosas hay que empezarlas a analizar y tomar esas acciones
4466540 estos diablos y estas diablas que andan aqu que se vayan a sus pa ses que se ba en con agua bendita y que se les quite eso porque aqu no tienen por qu venir con esa posici n
4466541 pero no venir y menos como diplom tico a hablar de los temas pol ticos internos del pa s

4466548 obama will work tirelessly to uphold this nations sacred trust with its veterans to ensure they are not forgotten after they return home and he will provide our troops with the leadership they deserve as well as the support they and their families need
4466549 john mccain has been endorsed by more retired admirals and generals than barack obama has military donors
4466550 we feel confident that many u s troops stationed overseas will support john mccain in the election this fall but we suspect most are too busy doing the important work of defending this country than to make political contributions
4466551 bloggers kind enough to promote us even though theres zilch in it for them
4466552 the strategy of acting on technical issues in an incremental bureaucratic way and keeping the issues away from public view has generated more suspicion than accomplishments
4466553 from the right have come attacks based on cultural anxieties of being overrun by mexican immigrants and fears that cooperation with canada and mexico could lead down a slippery slope toward a north american union
4466554 from the left came attacks based on economic fears of jobs lost due to unfair trading practices
4466555 these two sets of fears came together in a perfect storm that was pushed forward by a surplus of hot air from talk show hosts on radio and television
4466556 in the face of this criticism the bush administration was silent and the democratic candidates competed for votes in the rust belt states where unions and many working people have come to see nafta and globalization much as commentator lou dobbs does
4466557 dobbs among others viewed a report by a 2005 council on foreign relations task force which i chaired building a north american community as the manifesto of a conspiracy to subvert american sovereignty
4466558 dobbs claimed that the cfr study proposed a north american union although it did not
4466559 i do not propose a north american union i propose a north american community
4466560 three sovereign governments that seek to strengthen bonds of cooperation
4466561 i dont think a political union of north america is an inherently bad idea nor do i think it is a good idea for right now
4466562 the three heads of state must also commit to building a new consciousness a new way of thinking about ones neighbors and about the continental agenda
4466563 americans canadians and mexicans can be nationals and north americans at the same time

4466569 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
4466570 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
4466571 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
4466572 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
4466573 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

4466617 i dont feel proud if i cannot sing my songs its a different feel that it gives you than singing someone elses song how can i be touring and singing other peoples songs i supposed to be touring and singing my songs
4466618 general closing saturday was the current wave of bobo ashanti rastas headliners and great performances were turned in by turbulence sizzla and the firehouse crew
4466619 i dont know if that is a sign that google recognized me a creepy notion or just luck
4466620 their attacks on schools teachers and others working on education are systematic not random
4466621 they are part of a deliberate attack on human rights on equality for women and on any attempt by their to control their own destiny
4466622 there must be an end to impunity for those who attack schools students and educators
4466623 intensify efforts to put an end to the growing pattern of attacks
4466624 failing to enforce a dress code which allegedly spurred brandon mcinerney to shoot king in the head last february
4466625 we feel that jamaica is the gateway to the rest of the world when it comes to reggae
4466626 so thats why were here and also to obviously soak up all the other impressions if this is the home of the music then it is a great thrill just to be here and experience it first hand
4466627 we were brought here by a guy named howard hendricks and akubulan his manager because they have been fans since 2005 when i sent them a copy of the first album and they thought the time was right for us to try to make a market here in jamaica so were currently discussing a management contract with them
4466628 we are going to be producing a few rhythms one with half pint with sly and robbie and another one also produced by sly and robbie
4466629 the band is 12 people seven of us are left at home the five of us who are travelling now are the vocalists so we perform with rhythm tracks this time around
4466630 i decided to write a song for the bar thats actually how the band got started so i wrote this song and write the whole album and when the tsunami hit in 2004 the bar was destroyed so part of the proceeds from the sale of the first album went to getting it the bar back on its feet thats the story of how the band actually got started so hence bobs bar
4466631 on the cover you have two puppets fighting each other but its one hand controlling both of them i think for every conflict every war in the world there is always somebody wanting it to happen somebody making money off it and this is the real enemy thats not seen somebody who wants us to hate each other somebody who wants us to distrust each other im not stating who the enemy is im just trying to raise the question
4466632 theres no real story about the name theres not a song called roots on the album
4466633 we just thought that it was a fitting title actually the album was going to be called natural which is one of the songs on the album it turns out that our swedish label already had an album called natural in their catalogue and we thought that it the title roots was fitting because that is the type of music that we do roots music definitely strictly reggae
4466634 when i was about 10 years old i got my first bob marley and the wailers album the live album

4466636 believers to sign with their blood an oath of allegiance to the imam mahdi
4466637 take part in resistance in all the muslim countries and especially iraq militarily and ideologically to the occupiers colonisers and secular western thought
4466638 i think of all muslims especially in iraq as my brothers and i would never do anything to harm their blood their goods or their dignity
4466639 it is about emphasising the worship of god rather than politics the fact that the resistance does not have to end as long as there is an occupation as well as all aspects of resistance to the occupier
4466640 it is equally a call for unity for all iraqis
4466641 in each negotiation baxter used its market power in the sterile fluids market to achieve exclusive dealing by means of bundling to endeavour to snuff out competition as it threatened in the pd peritoneal dialysis fluids market
4466642 let me be clear it was baxters purpose and its alone to deter or prevent competitors from being competitive by its bundling strategy and to lessen competition
4466643 organisations will have to change the way they respond to government tenders which may or may not lead to price increases for vital supplies
4466644 i have never had my email working so hard in my life
4466645 i have sent this everywhere theres no consultancy budget im doing this because i care about good public policy
4466646 what weve got wont work itll either be symbolic or cost jobs
4466647 the carving out of food from the gst is nothing compared with the carving out thats going to be the result of the carbon pollution reduction scheme
4466648 at least with food you had some sort of idea of where to stop
4466649 at a certain price point all sorts of imports from countries without carbon pollution reduction schemes will become competitive
4466650 why would we adopt a policy that undermines our international competitiveness and in so doing encourages other countries not to act rendering the policy globally ineffective
4466651 if anyone thinks that this country can pay its way by people dressing in smocks and dancing around maypoles theyre barmy
4466652 we have no short term refinancing risk a well located diversified property portfolio and an experienced asset management team in tokyo
4466653 its disappointing that the strong operating performance and conservative capital structure of bjt has not been reflected in the recent unit price but we continue to hope that the fundamentals will be reflected over time
4466654 the groups philosophy of controlled profitable growth will continue and further new stores are being evaluated for all three countries as opportunities arise
4466655 but the total investment by the state in freight rail infrastructure cost is about the same as one of the outer suburban freeway bypasses deer park or craigieburn
4466656 a much higher level of investment a clearer strategic plan and new governance appear to be needed
4466657 the loss has an unlimited carry forward period and a tax benefit has been recognised for the deferred tax asset
4466658 we forecast us15 1 billion in dividends are paid out over the same three years
4466659 this results in some us37 4 billion in excess cash available for either additional growth projects in excess of that currently ratified improved capital return to shareholders and or acquisitions
4466660 bhp has one of the lowest yields among all major asx listed companies
4466661 time has come for bhp to revise its dividend policy from one of gradual incremental dividend increases to a policy that better reflects the impressive cash generation capabilities of its business
4466662 if the transaction is completed the funds will be applied to the reduction of debt
4466663 this increase is primarily a result of an improving asian wood fibre market
4466664 our financial records have just undergone a full and comprehensive audit by the victorian office and during this process there were no abnormalities detected
4466665 nor was ambulance victoria required to write down the value of any investments
4466666 councils current investment through these products has recently been independently audited with no write down of value
4466667 while there have been encouraging signs over the last two months with orders for june july and august showing improvement over the previous three months conditions within the industry remain particularly fragile and subdued
4466668 this is a good result in a tight retail environment in which the combination of record fuel prices and higher interest rates are influencing consumer sentiment
4466669 medieval england was as incentivised as thatchers england tax rates averaged 1 property rights were secure violence was limited social mobility was extensive
4466670 we are adapted to capitalism we differ culturally and genetically from our forebears of the stone age
4466671 some societies had little experience of such a pre industrial regime some even went straight from foraging to the modern economy as australian aboriginals did in 1788
4466672 these societies have historically rooted disadvantages in competing in a capitalist world their response to market incentives can be limited this may explain the extraordinary difficulty forager groups such as australian aboriginals have had in successfully incorporating into capitalism
4466673 in all these societies without any initial wealth or political advantage the chinese and indians dominated the commercial economy and became the business class
4466674 wall street provided a good lead but weve seen spot gold come off oil was a bit weaker overnight and there was a fairly sharp rally in commodity stocks yesterday
4466675 equity traders remain sceptical as overbought commodity prices tumbled through the week on slowing global growth and stronger us dollar
4466676 what we say to our investors is that 80 to 90 is in the leaders but weve got this little spicy bit that the majority of the market isnt covering which is small caps
4466677 we blend them into our fund hopefully to give us some outperformance
4466678 you can get to know the companies better you can understand the nature of the business a lot more quickly than the big companies where there are layers of people and spin doctors between you and chief executives
4466679 the thing we learnt was that it was a very simple business to understand
4466680 they made chocolate and they sold it and they were a dominant player in the marketplace
4466681 you didnt have to worry about it and at some point the parent company was going to come back and privatise it it did and everyone made money
4466682 im not a great student or a follower of his process
4466683 if i read about another fund manager that says hes a buffett ideologue well its just boring come up with your own ideas establish your own identity
4466684 we start off with whos the natural owner of the business
4466685 are the assets big enough and strong enough that somebody else could own them and do something better with them we focus on the value of the business its assets
4466686 we copped a lot of s t from people and they used to laugh about us buying king island shares
4466687 i said son you cant replicate the products that theyve got and at some point that will be recognised and it was with a very substantial takeover from national foods and they in turn were taken over
4466688 ill give you a good example of what armytage is a big shareholder in its called patties foods
4466689 they own fourn twenty pies herbert adams patties and creative gourmet and chefs pride
4466690 if you go into a supermarket he regularly checks this out in his local supermarket they have about 50 to 60 of the frozen savoury section of the shelves and about 30 to 40 of what they call the frozen dessert market nannas and all that sort of stuff
4466691 it was a stock that was right in our space we love the food sector and when they got belted around it was good news for us bad news is good news for us
4466692 a very good retailer told me once that when shoppers buy generic brands they put them at the bottom of the trolley so other people wont see them
4466693 we look to see who the natural owner is and patties is a classic stock that will be taken over by a major those sort of stocks will disappear its the law of the jungle the big keep getting bigger
4466694 no im not worried because the fundamentals are just so compelling
4466695 for example its on a forward price earnings multiple of 7 8 and fully franked yield of 8 2
4466696 the small caps traditionally cop it the hardest and theyre always the last to recover
4466697 the micro caps are worse than syphilis at the moment
4466698 its been death by a thousand cuts that weve gone through in the last six to eight months but were past the worst
4466699 i always see the glass as half full if were three to six months before the pack good luck
4466700 our view is that were well and truly past the worst the morose part of the market we took the view in may that the markets were starting to bottom out and all of the trends that we were anticipating are now well and truly evident
4466701 if that consumer economy starts to be given some positive sentiment which it hasnt had for the past six to seven years because of the fellow thats there at the moment that economy is going to turn
4466702 you cant have the biggest economy in the world floundering the way it is
4466703 bij het huidige grote media aanbod hebben mensen behoefte aan een gids die het kaf van het koren scheidt we willen nog duidelijker een selectie bieden zonder aan diepgang in te boeten

4466706 its cool to not give a shit about anything in your music
4466707 ive spoken all week about how much ive enjoyed the olympic experience how much i love the spirit of it
4466708 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4466709 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
4466710 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4466711 i mean its just one point there is an umpire if im 100 percent sure about it i mean i will give it but im not sure
4466712 whatever is going to get him to have some sleep tonight then thats fine
4466713 it was really one or two points and who played those one or two points better

4466717 the primary focus of armadillocon is literary science fiction but thats not all we do we also pay attention to art animation science media and gaming every year dozens of professional writers artists and editors attend the convention we invite you to attend the convention especially if you are a fan of reading writing meeting sighting feeding knighting and all the other things folks do at a sci f fantasy convention
4466718 definitely dont forget that professional part and that goes for every single thing you post online whether its a blog blog comment or twitter
4466719 a girl had been harassed because her boyfriend came out i couldnt understand it she says of the hate crime and adding that writing the book helped her figure out how it could have happened
4466720 i think we are taught to assume oh well guys when you write them you have to use terse sentence structure and keep things really tight and minimal but i dont think all guys sound a particular way and its crucial to keep assumptions and stereotyping out of writing at least thats important to me
4466721 began as a fun little photo essay on a thursday night while working at skylight books in los angeles
4466722 i needed my critiques handy but organized i opted to invest in binders of various sizes and colors a good quality three hole punch and lots of sheet tab dividers i love office supplies
4466723 i then pointed out that i was the only kid in my high school performing arts program who hadnt been allowed to see the r rated movie fame and that i was still traumatized by that she alexs mother said well you didnt get pregnant in high school and i said you think i would have if id been allowed to see r rated movies unlikely i didnt date in high school
4466724 i think you can compare picture book structure to the structure of poetry for example sonnets have 14 lines picture books can have 14 double page spreads so taking a sonnet as an example of structure you can imitate one of these sonnet structures
4466725 i havent experienced any of this stigma in recent years
4466726 the adult and childrens divisions of publishing houses dont seem to be down the corridor theyre in different buildings and the publishers dont seem to know each other very well
4466727 with the rate were going every single member of the adult literary community will be writing for young adults in a matter of time
4466728 i cant think of another ya book offhand that would fit as an adult book
4466729 a reader recently emailed to ask if leaving an agent makes it more difficult to find another agent and if it labels her as high maintenance and difficult to work with
4466730 i think teens have read and seen so many happy ending stories that some of them just expected these two would end up together no matter how unlikely that scenario was and when it didnt happen they were upset with the character instead of me i dont like to tie up my books with pretty ribbons at the end i like them to be hopeful but not unrealistically happy
4466731 this years hugo awards and the john w campbell award for best new writer were announced at denvention 3 the 66th world science fiction convention in denver

4466735 be very very wary when comparing an author to other authors or a book to other books ive lost count of the authors who have been proclaimed the next tolkien or the next robert jordan

4466742 more than a thousand books have been challenged since 1982 the challenges have occurred in every state and in hundreds of communities
4466743 see ive wanted to be a writer since i was about eight years old when you spend the bulk of your life fantasizing about something and when youre blessed with a good imagination it takes on a ridiculously inflated position in your mind

4466755 we are confident that jackson browne will prevail in this lawsuit not only have senator mccain and his agents plainly infringed mr brownes copyright in running on empty but the federal courts have long held that the unauthorized use of a famous singers voice in a commercial constitutes a false endorsement and a violation of the singers right of publicity
4466756 in light of jackson brownes lifelong commitment to democratic ideals and political candidates the misappropriation of jackson brownes endorsement is entirely reprehensible and i have no doubt that a jury will agree

4466856 operation warrior wake up is about how local hawaiian businesses support the troops get through the everyday grind
4466857 so here we are all these years later and im sending coffee to the soldiers of the 14th cav regt the successors of the very men that stood fast and protected my own father all those years ago
4466858 last summer in june our goe hawaii group turned out to give an aloha greeting to members of 2nd sbct 25th inf div who were coming to the big island to pta to train and whom were traveling up saddle road in a convoy
4466859 as they passed us and our troops appreciation sign and many u s flags one soldier tossed me his own tropic lightning division shoulder patch and at that moment or shortly thereafter the idea began to gel that perhaps there was a way i could offer to support these u s army troops our own 2nd sbct 25th inf div soldiers based right here in hawaii
4466860 the patch went with me the day i decided to approach my own immediate neighbors here in the heart of americas only coffee country with the idea to start sending fresh roasted kona coffee which they themselves have grown and freely donated
4466861 they were amazingly receptive more than being receptive within days they had come thru with over 30 pounds of coffee which i quickly put in the mail to addresses that id been given by rear detachment commanders and it was on its way to iraq
4466862 it really means a lot to the soldiers in the squadron to have someone support them from state of hawaii since at one point we didnt even know if the stryker brigade was ever going back there
4466863 it is good to know that no matter what the political pressures were there are people from hawaii that care about the soldiers it is also good to have something shipped to you to remind you of home
4466864 lets give the kids a break so that they come back recharged

4466867 i grew up playing in what was a field right here but its not the same its very different and it happened so fast that the people in the rest of virginia are kind of shell shocked
4466868 ill vote for anybody who can get more than half the vote
4466869 its upsetting to me that the country is 50 50 im sick of it and i think a lot of people that lean more conservative feel the same way
4466870 i was going to do it simply as a spoiler with no idea in the world of voting for him later on
4466871 he said were not red states or blue states we are the united states and i thought finally somebody said it it literally made me cry then again im menopausal
4466872 the tv was turned this way i wasnt watching it i was just listening all of a sudden i just got chills all over me and i started laughing because it was so unexpected i dont even remember what it was he said
4466873 dyed in the wool republicans are saying obama is not that awfully bad
4466874 he appeals to me at some level that even though i cant account for it in terms of issues im going to listen to my gut and support a candidate that is just appealing to me for whatever reason whether thats shallow or because hes marketed well im not sure
4466875 if mccain had stood up and given the best speech of his life and had people electrified to vote for him then id vote for him
4466876 but it just so happens that it was obama he has touched something in me and in a whole lot of friends of mine that have never voted for a democrat and in a lot of people who honestly would never consider voting for a black man we all feel that something has to change and now for the first time theres the possibility that something can be different
4466877 in presidential elections you have between 4 and 11 percent of each party regularly defecting to the other side think of it the other way that means 90 percent or more of partisans vote for the candidate of their party
4466878 we will be very strong in the rural areas for a long time
4466879 it was a perfect storm of things that went wrong that night

4466881 was an unlicensed driver and was driving while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage
4466882 we pried the toilet seat off with a pry bar and the seat went with her to the hospital
4466883 she was not glued she was not tied she was just physically stuck by her body
4466884 it is hard to imagine i still have a hard time imagining it myself
4466885 according to him she did not want to leave the bathroom
4466886 she said that she didnt need any help that she was ok and did not want to leave
4466887 i dont think anybody can make any sense out of it
4466888 what surprises me is somebody wasnt called in a bit earlier
4466889 ive tried to do good while im alive and i liked the idea that i could do something good after death
4466890 i never minded having my brain checked out it kept me out of trouble
4466891 well continue to learn from the sisters for many many years to come
4466892 at that time it was hard enough just to get families of alzheimers patients to agree to donate the brain of a loved one with the disease
4466893 what we found is that because the sisters had been teachers they looked at this as a way to keep teaching even after they die
4466894 its such a cool study people who study aging love to have these longitudinal perspectives because we think the early life experiences probably do have an impact on exceptional longevity
4466895 i think of the overall picture of what good could come out of it
4466896 if it happens it happens its part of gods plan
4466897 its difficult to immediately name a specific reason behind the problem we need to do an in depth analysis
4466898 this is a very momentous and historic occasion for malaysia

4466900 the charges are very bad news to nikki and alan as they are both very ambitious

4466934 i just dont think christianity is true what proof is there
4466935 but one of the most powerful testimonies to the truth of christianity is that early christians were willing to die horrible deaths and undergo torture for their beliefs why would they be willing to do that if their beliefs were not true
4466936 i think apple needs to address this to really get the iphone into the corporate market
4466937 but the problem is apple has left off the on device encryption so if the device is lost yes we can remote wipe it but there is that moment in time between when the device is lost and when it gets reported and when it gets wiped and were just not comfortable with that
4466938 but in general apple is still concentrating on the consumer business and will eventually update the sdk to accommodate more serious enterprise adoption
4466939 apple thinks that if i have activesync and can sync with exchange im done and yes thats a small part of the problem very few users can get by without having connectivity to email but beyond that its security and access
4466940 its a big deal especially in regulated industries like banking
4466941 and it has to be enforceable the it guy needs to be able to say you cant get around an encryption policy you have to do it today that is impossible on the iphone
4466942 but id rather have it and force someone to hack me than not have it at all and give sensitive data away for free
4466943 in this day and age thats how encryption should be
4466944 we should not have to add on a piece of third party software that should be something thats native to the device
4466945 i think it shows a disconnect between whoever was designing the software for the iphone and the corporate market
4466946 were seeing more and more apple products in the enterprise but they havent yet made the commitment to make an enterprise phone or an enterprise desktop its a shame
4466947 im not the most popular guy at my company right now for saying no you cant use it
4466948 we purchase only fish that are harvested or farmed in a way that doesnt impact the environment other species or their habitats

4467025 i am appalled at the ongoing human rights abuses in palestine this project has been running since january 2007 and has provided palestinian people the means to record for the world to see the shocking abuses they have to live with at the hands of settlers and the israeli armed forces
4467026 this recent footage is particularly interesting exposing the israeli actively assisting in these abuses the most recent footage shows the israeli army shooting a civilian protestor in the foot at point blank range as many of us already know the israeli army is actively engaged in these human rights abuses

4467054 he is captain of the club and deserves everything he gets
4467055 at the moment he has probably got another year to do at falkirk
4467056 if the club doesnt grow in terms of the structure the stadium and supporters i think hed like to test himself at a higher level
4467057 however i believe we are giving him everything we can here
4467058 he has the responsibility of the captains armband because i saw a young russell anderson in him
4467059 if other clubs werent looking at him id be very surprised
4467060 pedro is an experienced player an all round midfielder who can bring a lot to our team
4467061 one of the big things we want to improve on above anything else is our possession of the ball and he will certainly help in this aspect
4467062 he is very good technically can do a bit defensively and can also get goals as well as create them so we hope and believe he will be a very good acquisition for the club
4467063 we were unfortunate last season at the time we scored at motherwell we were in the ascendency and i did not think they would have got back into the game
4467064 if barrys goal was given along with zander diamonds disallowed effort at celtic park a few weeks earlier then who knows things could have turned out differently we could have been back into europe this season that is how close the margins are
4467065 it is a difficult game for us as motherwell were a bit of a bogey team for us last season it has always been a difficult place to go they had a wonderful season last time out and they will have to deal with higher expectation levels this time
4467066 a lot of the teams who did well last season the likes of falkirk motherwell dundee united and ourselves all lost on the opening day despite high expectations
4467067 all of the sides who are vying to force their way into the top six got beat but that is football for you
4467068 we launched the mclaren mercedes team in valencia at the start of 2007 and ive tested at the ricardo tormo circuit so the city isnt unfamiliar to me

4467071 i enjoy visiting new racetracks and im looking forward to getting into the cockpit on friday morning it looks like being an amazing track
4467072 you get used to street circuits being quite slow with lots of slow to medium speed corners and very short straights but this is almost the opposite

4467083 s estamos muy indignados de una situaci n muy injusta realizada el 1 de marzo en angostura por parte del ej rcito colombiano es por eso que rompimos las relaciones y sabemos que esas relaciones no fueron rotas por el pueblo colombiano ni por el pueblo ecuatoriano sino por la actitud del gobierno colombiano
4467084 nosotros no somos sujetos de burla y por eso hemos decidido mantener indefinidamente suspendidas las relaciones diplom ticas con colombia

4467098 es ist etwas sch nes dabei zu sein ich versuche gas zu geben und zu zeigen was ich drauf habe
4467099 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
4467100 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
4467101 i am a lot more comfortable with the momentum we have going right now
4467102 i think the last two weeks has shown how focused our team is at the job at hand it makes me proud of our guys and proud of our whole organization
4467103 you still have to keep in mind that if you take a chance and dont finish a race that youll lose a lot of points and the 10 bonus points for a win you thought you might gain for the chase wont happen either
4467104 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
4467105 i still cant believe were sixth in points right now
4467106 we know we need to be performing better but i also think its a testament to this team that we havent run well and were still in contention for a chase spot
4467107 at the end of the day results speak louder than words
4467108 we need to post good finishes in the next four races to earn a chase spot and then its a whole new game
4467109 ive always enjoyed racing here and i hope its fun again on sunday
4467110 we were decent here in june but we lost track position during one exchange of pit stops and were fighting traffic the rest of the race staying in the lead group is a good way to stay out of traffic
4467111 this dupont team is capable of winning the championship this year thanks to the chase structure
4467112 a lot can happen in 10 races and we need to make sure were running consistently up front
4467113 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
4467114 i am a lot more comfortable with the momentum we have going right now
4467115 i think the last two weeks has shown how focused our team is at the job at hand it makes me proud of our guys and proud of our whole organization
4467116 you still have to keep in mind that if you take a chance and dont finish a race that youll lose a lot of points and the 10 bonus points you thought you might gain for the chase wont happen either you have to do the same things that have gotten you to victory lane in the past
4467117 you cant afford to take too many unnecessary chances the main thing for us is to do the things weve been doing to keep us in position where we can win races each week and get those bonus points for the chase
4467118 weve got a couple of weeks here where we can try things and have that flexibility
4467119 but the good thing is that were not struggling and having to try new things we have the ability to do that if we want to because of where we are in the points but regardless were in a good spot
4467120 chicago is so pristine and then you cross the border and think these people need some help here

4467124 all midlers remarks does basically is show those of us who live here what someone who comes from outside the area sees the first time they come here thats something we need to look at
4467125 i expect it will involve sore feet blisters dehydration being on the receiving end of sun stroke or being soaked with rain and living in hostel accommodation which will be pretty basic
4467126 it will be exhausting but it will all be worth it to have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all in a good cause

4467130 he turns one on tuesday and were going to have a birthday cake for him at the wedding
4467131 i went to hospital and doctors told me my blood pressure was dangerously high and the babys heart was dangerously low
4467132 they said it pre eclampsia and told me they would have to deliver the baby
4467133 he was smaller than the palm of my hand and looked like a doll we were worried sick
4467134 doctors told us if he had been born five years ago he might not have made it
4467135 hes a little bit smaller than other babies and has to wear glasses but hell catch up
4467136 they advertised as a customer friendly company this is hardly what id call good customer service
4467137 the cheque was cashed on july 9 but when no workmen arrived to continue the job over the next five days the alarm bells started ringing
4467138 i phoned and was told there was a problem with the materials and that they would be out as soon as they arrived
4467139 i still hadnt heard anything a week later and continued to phone them again and again leaving messages but no one got back to me eventually i went up to the office and it was all closed up
4467140 i later phoned and spoke to the man who sold me the conservatory and he told me cameron had gone into liquidation i knew then id had it
4467141 they pulled up my decking part of my neighbours fence and left material all over my garden ill never have the money to fix the mess theyve left
4467142 we are currently dealing with a number of customers who have the same problem with cameron conservatories
4467143 customers with the network veka deposit protection scheme that we run will be able to claim
4467144 police spoke to the accused who admitted he had been shouting and swearing and had broken the guitar
4467145 the relationship is over but he has taken steps to maintain contact with his children without contact with the complainer and there is little likelihood that this will ever happen again

4467161 ive enjoyed playing and training with the vale over the last couple of weeks although they lost 2 1 on saturday there wasnt much in it

4467163 mum used to be an international level flatwater paddler and used to train on loch lomond

4467165 the world championships in prague in 2006 has been my best result yet when i won the silver medal
4467166 last year in 2007 i together with my two team mates won a bronze medal in both the european championships and the world championships
4467167 i also won a bronze medal in the first world cup race last year in prague but my eyes are set on the biggest race of my life
4467168 over the winter the goal of reaching the olympics was what pushed me through the sub zero days on the water
4467169 ten to 13 sessions a week consisting of whitewater technical sessions flatwater endurance sessions weights in the gym and more endurance sessions on the canoeing ergo was hard work but what it takes to be at the top
4467170 in the end the selection races went quite easily for me and i beat my closest rival laura by some seven seconds or so on each day in holland which in our sport is a huge margin
4467171 as the results of the best two races from the three are taken this automatically selected me as the olympic boat and i didnt have to race in nottingham
4467172 im confident that i will get through qualification but anything can happen and it will be all about who can put down two solid runs on the day
4467173 the free time that i have up until my racing will be spent in the gb athlete lounge watching the bbc feed that we have of all the other olympic events its really inspirational

4467191 top social conservative leaders in key battleground states are urging john mccain not to pick a running mate who supports abortion rights warning of dire consequences from a republican base already unenthused about their nominee
4467192 that choice will end his bid for the presidency and spell defeat for other republican candidates
4467193 hes not even sure christian conservatives would vote for him let alone work for him if he picked a pro abortion running mate
4467194 a good portion of us were urging him to pick a pro life running mate
4467195 that choice would go a long way to solidify his credentials
4467196 wrong headed short sighted fracture the republican party and not allow us to capitalize on the democratic partys fracture right now
4467197 if he does that it makes our job 100 times harder it would dampen enthusiasm at a time when evangelicals are looking for ways to gin up enthusiasm
4467198 some people in the movement say it would be the kiss of death he heard that in the room last night
4467199 youre going to have to have a huge turnout of that base again for mccain to win
4467200 ninety percent of the workforce for bush in 04 came out of that constituency
4467201 picking a ridge or a joseph lieberman would not be helpful at all
4467202 the point that mccain was making is that people can differ on one issue and still be a vital member of our party
4467203 the fact that governor ridge is not perfectly in line with the party platform does not make him any less of a republican
4467204 the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4467205 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out for vice president
4467206 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that
4467207 this move to a pro choice running mate such as lieberman could help reshape his message to appeal to swing voters
4467208 the right wing is not going anywhere and choice is a key issue for over 40 women who voted for hillary in the primaries
4467209 a lot of the troops here are on the fence or disappointed
4467210 from original reviewers down to contemporary student audiences most viewers moan at the revelation that it was all a dream
4467211 if i get the reward i will send my brother to a good college and i will go to harvard

4467213 im against the lottery but if one of my members won the lottery i wish and i hope he would give 10 to the church we could do a lot of things with that money
4467214 i dont agree with gambling but the money could do good
4467215 renowned physicist bassist banj foxx has perfected his practical application of the theory of gravitational time dilation and special relativity to build a time portal to 1959 in his basement having pinpointed the exact space time coordinates of the june 7 1959 amazing half off sale at ralphs guitar emporium in massapequa he has made plans to travel back in time in order to expand his collection of vintage gibson es 335s his historic journey has been temporarily postponed however because he has been having difficulty in todays depressed economic climate in obtaining a line of credit that extends beyond the normal boundaries of space time erica catspaws drummer meanwhile has traveled to the middle east to bail out frontwoman jasmine who reportedly was deported to syria after an incident that may have involved inappropriate political humor the joke in question has since been classified and there is no official word on whether or not it was funny

4467217 i was not interested in making a record about the d word i got all that stuff out of my system on the last record 2005s pensive songs for silverman which was deliberately stoic this new album is really about me being free which is why it feels cathartic and expressive its about me coming back to being myself
4467218 i came out of the courthouse kissed the ground and walked straight into the studio i felt like a bottle of champagne that had been shaken for 18 months and popped open in the studio thats why this record has so much energy
4467219 in the past 20 to 30 years researchers have been able to shrink the size of devices and the size of the patterns that you need to make those devices following the use of the same types of lithographic materials tools and strategies only getting better and better at it
4467220 theres information encoded in the molecules that results in getting certain size and spacing of features with certain desirable properties
4467221 thermodynamic driving forces make the structures more uniform in size and higher density than you can obtain with the traditional materials
4467222 if you only have to pattern every fourth spot you can write those patterns at a fraction of the time and expense
4467223 this research addresses one of the most significant challenges to delivering patterned media the mass production of patterned disks in high volume at a reasonable cost
4467224 the large potential gains in density offered by patterned media make it one of the most promising new technologies on the horizon for future hard disk drives
4467225 these results have profound implications for advancing the performance and capabilities of lithographic materials and processes beyond current limits

4467276 the thing is that theyre both so stupidly beautiful and good looking and attractive that their children are born looking gorgeous its unsettling

4467278 zac is thinking in the 8 million to 10 million range but it depends on how the movie opens and how desperately they want him back

4467280 there is the emotional aspect to it i want him to come home

4467290 gold should settle into the cyclical and seasonal lows due in early august although you will hear plenty of bearish arguments as gold prices pull back weakness will be a buying opportunity
4467291 i dont think there is much left on downside for the mining shares we will likely see the miners firm up and begin to rally before the bullion my adice is to hold tight and exploit the fear
4467292 this weakness presents a final opportunity before the late summer and early fall strength returns to precious metals the coast is clearing for gold to advance to new highs by october when its next seasonal high is due

4467294 critical quality attributes are the foundation of quality by design
4467295 factoring in those two often meant taking things off the list too early when not that much data was available
4467296 that scale has changed numerous times since we started working on it
4467297 once you set aside the quality attributes which are clearly critical you can focus your efforts on gaining a deeper understanding of attributes whose impact on bioactivity is unknown or not fully quantified
4467298 early on we will depend on prior knowledge from other products to come up with a list of potential cqas
4467299 we might even want to say that we consider them guilty until proven innocent its an evolving and ongoing process
4467300 you need a system that allows you to go back and reevaluate the original parameters you thought were important
4467301 we cannot forget that the variability around multiple noncritical attributes might impact cqas or taken together might have a direct impact on efficacy or safety

4467337 such psychosocial problems that are not attended to eventually result into brutal murders because of delusion but sometimes it may be due to mental illness or frustration after realising one has contracted hiv

4467365 we are concerned that incumbent wireless carriers are seeking unnecessary and unprecedented testing delays to prevent new innovative competitors from entering the market
4467366 we are concerned that unnecessary interference testing would needlessly delay this auction and that this constitutes the very rationale to kill this effort totally we urge you to carefully consider the existing precedent before making your determination
4467367 for consumers the interference will be extensive widespread and unpredictable significantly degrading their service
4467368 in essence theyre gaming the system to make rules so that a new broadband competitor doesnt appear
4467369 any new entrant especially one that appeals to consumers because the price is disruptive is something they want to kill or delay
4467370 to have any relevance they have to stick to this
4467371 at minimum ce interconnection standards should rely on a low cost widely adopted and universally implementable interface ethernet over rj45 being the obvious choice
4467372 the commission should urge ce manufacturers even as they implement the mou to take steps now to future proof their devices and ensure compatibility with video providers
4467373 this is essentially in order to ensure that the technological shift towards ip does not end before it reaches the television set
4467374 to make mandatory the availability of set top boxes using an ip based interface that facilitates home networking such as ethernet

4467382 the quality of these sites as an advertising medium is substantially lower than sites on the rest of googles network

4467396 quiere que mandemos m s d lares pues que l nos mande trabajo
4467397 en principio creo que es bueno que el gobierno mexicano reconozca que los migrantes podemos ser parte de la soluci n y part cipes del desarrollo mexicano y de la generaci n de empleos pero necesitamos no nada m s que lo reconozcan sino que tomen acci n de manera efectiva y constante para hacer pol ticas p blicas encaminadas a considerar la inversi n de los migrantes en proyectos productivos
4467398 por un lado nos piden apoyo y por otro no nos dan las herramientas para poder invertir
4467399 hoy en d a en estados unidos exigimos que los gobiernos estatales y las ciudades nos reconozcan la matr cula consular como identificaci n oficial pero en m xico no lo es no existe congruencia
4467400 quieren que los migrantes inviertan en m xico pero no nos pueden dar identidad jur dica
4467401 el apoyo no puede ser s lo de un lado tiene que haber apoyo mutuo el tipo de apoyo que nosotros visualizamos es en materia t cnica de capacitaci n de desarrollo organizacional eso ayudar a a que se pudieran hacer m s proyectos de liderazgo y de entendimiento con el pa s

4467403 pone al descubierto el por qu en el ltimo par de a os el pan partido acci n nacional en el gobierno ha estado poco a poco apoder ndose de las dirigencias migrantes yo creo que la visita de mouri o a los ngeles se inscribe dentro de esta l gica
4467404 aqu hay millones de migrantes que est n lejos de su familia y no para desempe ar un cargo del que se van a beneficiar sino para poder llevar algo de comida a la mesa
4467405 we think this is unlikely to happen for timing reasons
4467406 money has divided us as a country politics are there but they are just a distraction to it she wrote this week in her notebook she reads this as

4467408 we have been under siege for the last two years
4467409 the only thing left is for them to invade and kill us
4467410 the cease fire that was negotiated through egypt was very specific that the hamas movement and the other terrorist groups cant use it as a period to import more weapons more explosives more rockets into the gaza strip
4467411 the right to act if need be to protect ourselves we dont want this current quiet just to be the quiet before the storm
4467412 we have been under siege for the last two years
4467413 the only thing left is for them to invade and kill us
4467414 i am so so sorry my punishment is nothing compared to the pain and suffering i have caused i hope someday you can find peace
4467415 moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4467416 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4467417 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interests
4467418 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4467419 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4467420 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4467421 we know when it touches us and he knew that so thats where it comes into calling it on yourself because its the right thing to do
4467422 should i expect him to do that maybe not maybe i shouldnt expect people to hold themselves to high standards sportsmanship
4467423 but yes i did expect it a little more so in the olympics when were all competing under the banner of this event being to promote sportsmanship to promote goodwill amongst countries
4467424 that was heat of the moment stuff he hit it right at me
4467425 probably didnt want to hear an apology right away because i thought it was intentional when we changed sides he said sorry its part of the game you were on top of the game
4467426 i said okay thats fine its part of the game youre right move on and we did
4467427 i know him very well ive played him many times on tour he does everything in his power to win
4467428 usually its within the rules sometimes its bordering on gamesmanship
4467429 but hes too good of a player to do something like that and to act like that thats why its disappointing because he is a great player
4467430 i try to do it with integrity so my parents would be proud of the way i played
4467431 we are pleased to add people of franks and johns caliber to our board
4467432 franks extensive experience in the entertainment and media industries combined with johns deep management experience in telecommunications will provide valuable perspectives to our already diverse board
4467433 i would attribute this to the amount of coverage of the olympics and the fact that foreign affairs generally isnt of much interest to americans except under very unusual circumstances like the war in iraq
4467434 so it just isnt registering and if obama can frame the election about the economy then he should do ok
4467435 he has a built in advantage but the deal just isnt closed
4467436 hes on third base but so far he cant seem to find a way to get home
4467437 look at the underlying trends the economy is a huge issue president george w bushs ratings are terrible
4467438 but too many voters are concerned about obamas experience and dont yet have enough confidence in his ability to lead
4467439 i think i have had enough i wrote about soccer because it brought me some fun but now what i got from chinese soccer was sheer hurt and disappointment so i decided to call it quits
4467440 it should have been a chance for chinese soccer to be honored but in the end it was dishonored n ow chinese soccer is confronted with the biggest ever crisis our grassroots is withering our professional league is also spiraling downward and can produce few quality players who should be responsible for all these mess ups

4467501 every day shelter is seeing more and more ordinary hardworking people who are terrified of losing their homes
4467502 tens of thousands are living with the fear of having the home theyve worked so hard for being repossessed by lenders with little compassion
4467503 while we are not seeing repossessions on the same scale as the early 1990s we are making sure the right advice and support is available for the minority of borrowers who may need it at the moment because of global economic pressures
4467504 for many a repossession order is a wake up call to make them sort out the situation and avoid actually the finality of actually losing their home
4467505 as the credit crunch continues we expect more people to get into difficulty over their mortgage payments

4467532 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4467533 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry

4467653 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4467654 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4467655 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4467656 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4467657 as far as we can tell from our conversations with the book industry people there has never been a trailer that did this
4467658 i have no idea how many copies we may sell when this is all said and done i have hopes but were already achieving some of what our hopes were before so we just keep lifting the goal numbers
4467659 oh we knew that was going to happen or hes no good
4467660 what happen yo let me get the whole story from both sides instead my stupid ass assuming shit
4467661 sams family is jewish lindsay has learned a lot about judaism from sam and admires its beliefs
4467662 two years ago it was kabbalah last year it was alcoholics anonymous she was into peace for a while whatever is of the moment thats lindsay but the one thing it does show is her commitment to sam she could be any religion and lindsay would be open to it
4467663 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4467664 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

4467678 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4467679 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4467680 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4467681 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4467682 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4467683 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4467684 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4467685 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4467686 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4467687 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4467688 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4467689 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4467690 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4467691 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4467692 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4467693 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4467694 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4467695 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4467696 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4467697 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4467698 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4467699 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4467700 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4467701 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4467702 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4467703 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4467704 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4467705 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4467706 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4467707 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4467708 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4467709 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4467710 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4467711 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4467712 who are open to doing something on the production side
4467713 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4467714 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4467715 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4467716 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4467717 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4467718 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4467719 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4467720 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4467721 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4467722 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4467723 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4467724 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4467725 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4467726 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4467727 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4467728 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4467729 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4467730 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4467731 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4467732 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4467733 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4467734 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4467735 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4467736 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4467737 the opportunity to be the featured marque at the pebble beach concours delegance is a great tribute to the lamborghini brand
4467738 since its inception lamborghini has been a creator of trends in the world of super sports cars we take great pride in showcasing our vehicles amongst the worlds most passionate enthusiasts
4467739 it was good i got a good start and there is lots more left in the tank
4467740 i felt good and relaxed i just wanted to make it through
4467741 ive never seen anything like that before at this stage were pretty much guaranteed to have a world record in the 100m and usain is pretty much guaranteed a gold medal
4467742 this year his start has improved and everything is just flawless with him at this point its amazing to watch i dont think he will feel the pressure and he is running away so easily from the rest of the field
4467743 i thought asafa powell looked better than he did in the first round and that run will give him confidence going into the semi finals and finals i dont think he can beat bolt but i think he will live up to his expectations and win silver
4467744 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4467745 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4467746 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4467747 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4467748 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4467749 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4467750 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4467751 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4467752 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4467753 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4467754 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4467755 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

4467762 ill let all of you speculate on the ups and downs of our vice presidential pick
4467763 we opened up a front against the obama campaign over the course of the last 60 days and i think thats gotten our base excited
4467764 its reminded people that this election will have significant consequences
4467765 the horrible track record that obama has on life issues on judges they get more excited about the need to win in the general

4467772 he is captain of the club and deserves everything he gets
4467773 at the moment he has probably got another year to do at falkirk
4467774 if the club doesnt grow in terms of the structure the stadium and supporters i think hed like to test himself at a higher level
4467775 however i believe we are giving him everything we can here
4467776 he has the responsibility of the captains armband because i saw a young russell anderson in him
4467777 if other clubs werent looking at him id be very surprised
4467778 we launched the mclaren mercedes team in valencia at the start of 2007 and ive tested at the ricardo tormo circuit so the city isnt unfamiliar to me
4467779 anyway going to a new circuit doesnt really change my preparations everybodys in the same situation so i dont treat things very differently
4467780 ill be working closely with my engineers to make sure we start the weekend with a good baseline and work hard to strengthen it as we go through the weekend
4467781 i enjoy visiting new racetracks and im looking forward to getting into the cockpit on friday morning it looks like being an amazing track
4467782 you get used to street circuits being quite slow with lots of slow to medium speed corners and very short straights but this is almost the opposite
4467783 there are a lot of fast kinks and esses a couple of decent straights and lots of high speed stuff setanta readers comment of the day
4467784 pedro is an experienced player an all round midfielder who can bring a lot to our team
4467785 one of the big things we want to improve on above anything else is our possession of the ball and he will certainly help in this aspect
4467786 he is very good technically can do a bit defensively and can also get goals as well as create them so we hope and believe he will be a very good acquisition for the club
4467787 we were unfortunate last season at the time we scored at motherwell we were in the ascendency and i did not think they would have got back into the game
4467788 if barrys goal was given along with zander diamonds disallowed effort at celtic park a few weeks earlier then who knows things could have turned out differently we could have been back into europe this season that is how close the margins are
4467789 it is a difficult game for us as motherwell were a bit of a bogey team for us last season it has always been a difficult place to go they had a wonderful season last time out and they will have to deal with higher expectation levels this time
4467790 a lot of the teams who did well last season the likes of falkirk motherwell dundee united and ourselves all lost on the opening day despite high expectations
4467791 all of the sides who are vying to force their way into the top six got beat but that is football for you
4467792 i commend you especially for your close cooperation with state organs which have enhanced the growth of democracy in our country
4467793 this high representation has enabled women to attain self confidence and should set an example to other parliaments in the world
4467794 notes that while corn prices have indeed nearly doubled in the past year according to the u s commerce departments consumer price index cpi food costs have increased within their historical annual average of 2 9 however fuel prices have risen 82 since 2006 and according to the u s department of agriculture have had a much greater impact on food prices due to higher costs of bringing products to market and food processing
4467795 ethanol demand has accounted for 20 percent of the increase in demand for grain with considerably less when the distillers grains are returned to the feed supply the other 80 percent is due to global demand from other countries that are increasing their quality of life and diet more people wanting more meat and more dairy products will continue to drive the market much more than biofuels

4467804 in the provincial decaying norwegian town of odda journalist robert bell is a cynical observer relishing his self chosen role of outsider constantly sizing up and judging his fellow citizens he enjoys his lonely job at an outpost for a big newspaper though has been regularly frustrated at the papers refusal to publish what he regards as serious investigation instead having to write frothy pieces as the story opens a nineteen year old teenager has driven into the local river and although no body has been discovered presumably drowned robert is told by his manager a delightfully accurate portrait of a voice down the phone a politically correct bland and smug woman whose composure robert can never seem to ruffle however hard he tries to follow the case he does so efficiently but upholds his journalistic integrity by refusing to take part in either exploiting the boys family however much they may seem to welcome it or to join in the general condemnation of the serbian asylum seekers who live in a local hostel and are considered by all to be the obvious culprits journalists from other papers and media turn up including an unpleasant hotshot from roberts own publication who muscles in on roberts area and patronisingly sets out to show robert how it is done

4467807 a greater evil is the eighth trish maguire book but my first i enjoyed it a lot and it didnt matter that i hadnt read the earlier titles although the murder near the start of the book is of the grimmest variety a heavily pregnant woman is bludgeoned to death the story is told briskly and in an upbeat manner yet acknowledging head on the tragedies of fact and emotion uncovered by this event trish maguire is a successful lawyer representing the loss adjusters for a dispute over a prestigious new london building the arrow which has developed structural cracks before the insurance company will pay out it has to be determined how the error arose was it due to the architects who designed the building to the construction engineers or some other cause
4467808 ive read many crime fiction stories set in remote spots in order for the authors to conveniently isolate a small group of suspects from the rest of society and where the reader can have fun trying to stay a step ahead of the detective written in bone is extremely effective in this regard david brody and fraser find themselves increasingly isolated and in danger as more people are killed buildings are set on fire and the storm as well as a human hand wrecks communication channels the suspects include a young south african millionaire and his stunning wife a childless couple who spend their time doing good works and stimulating the islands economy other characters include maggie a keen but green young journalist ellen the supportive owner of the hotel who has her own worries and various suspicious inward looking locals who dont take kindly to what they see as outside interference an atmosphere of unease and seething resentment is ably conveyed in which brody and david struggle to keep the investigation on an even keel not helped by frasers drinking and habit of blurting out confidential information to the wrong people written in bone is superbly and tightly plotted and proceeds at a thrilling pace it really is a page turner
4467809 its one of the few companies in retail generating extremely strong growth at high quality margins

4467811 in response to the death of donda west kanye wests mother the california state senate on wednesday approved a requirement that patients be given a physical exam before elective surgery according to the los angeles times

4467814 if i had to go through this i could at least be an example of trying to live out whats right trying to stand strong and trying to just keep my faith intact
4467815 we gave the truth to the jury we are happy we had an opportunity to try our case
4467816 this lawsuit in my opinion should not have been filed because nothing happened

4467825 gold should settle into the cyclical and seasonal lows due in early august although you will hear plenty of bearish arguments as gold prices pull back weakness will be a buying opportunity
4467826 i dont think there is much left on downside for the mining shares we will likely see the miners firm up and begin to rally before the bullion my adice is to hold tight and exploit the fear
4467827 this weakness presents a final opportunity before the late summer and early fall strength returns to precious metals the coast is clearing for gold to advance to new highs by october when its next seasonal high is due
4467828 longer term i cant help but wonder if gold isnt anticipating the next break in the dollar
4467829 the outright taboo subject of racism in the fashion industry
4467830 i am virtually never allowed to photograph black models for the magazines fashion houses cosmetic brands perfume companies and advertising clients i work for whenever i ask to use a black model i am given excuses such as black models are not aspirational in some markets or they do not reflect the brands values normally however no reason is given
4467831 if i judge by my own feelings i can only guess the indignation anger rage and fury that black models must feel

4467850 an old house like this with all the roof being straw it would have soon gone up
4467851 it was so great to come home and turn the lights i could not speak i was completely speechless

4467853 i have got a toaster and an iron which i was given and i have bought an electric mixer
4467854 although polling suggests voters view faith as an essential ingredient in a president mccain has never been a candidate to invoke god or dwell on religion
4467855 we knew we had to have some belief greater than ourselves
4467856 we decided we needed to be all on the same sheet of music at least one time during the week
4467857 yea though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death we will fear no evil
4467858 we agreed that we were going to have a church service and told the vietnamese and they said no
4467859 the vietnamese broke in and seized the people who were standing against the wall doing the service
4467860 they marched them out of the room at gunpoint so i stood up and started singing the star spangled banner god bless america my country tis of thee and every song we could think of
4467861 we wanted to actually just have a chance to do what we felt was a fundamental human right and we got spiritual comfort from being able to worship together
4467862 we thought look if were going to be together then were going to stand up theyd done so many bad things that we werent nearly as afraid of them as maybe we would have been if a lot of us hadnt gone through what wed gone through
4467863 render unto caesar what is caesars and render unto god what is gods
4467864 what i was trying to tell my fellow prisoners is that we were doing caesars work when we got into prison so we should ask for gods help to do the right thing and for us to get out of prison if it be gods will for us to do so
4467865 the god we had come to know wasnt going to wave a magic wand and poof we would all be free the god we knew would give us the strength to endure what we had to do and it was up to us to take that strength and knowledge and do what we had to do
4467866 i recall it as if it happened an hour ago
4467867 it was cold the guards were looking through the windows at us the room was dimly lit because of the light bulbs that were in each corner these guys had beautiful voices im telling you one was a bass one was a tenor it was one of the most beautiful experiences i ever had
4467868 it was because they were so happy to be able to celebrate christmas with fellow americans
4467869 just had a short email transaction with nintendos offices in new york in which i got a confirmation of a nintendo showing at pax 2008 i had previously said that nintendo was done with large public gaming presentations for 2008 but i stand corrected the lady is double checking whether or not they will be at leipzig but things look doubtful

4467873 its not just a question of finding techniques that can prevent environmental harms even if its important to find alternative sources of energy and so on
4467874 all this wont be enough if we ourselves dont find a new style of life a discipline which is made up in part of renunciations
4467875 the world may be slipping away because we ourselves are driving it away
4467876 a discipline of responsibility to the future and to others
4467877 duty to intervene in a clear and decisive manner in public opinion
4467878 honesty joy openness to listening to ones neighbor the capacity to forgive generosity goodness and cordiality
4467879 are indicative of the fact that faith is truly present
4467880 this is better than the discoth que here its truly beautiful because i can do something for others
4467881 without our having to think about it too much without adopting a way of acting thats to put it this way propagandistic it will happen on its own because it reflects our soul
4467882 dialogue among ourselves a responsible dialogue of the faith in order to find the right path
4467883 in the course of time i have realized that we have to follow the example of the lord who was very open with people who were at the margins of israel
4467884 if we can see even a tiny flame of desire for communion in the church it seems right to me to be rather generous
4467885 where there is no element of faith first communion would just be a party with a big lunch nice clothes and nice gifts

4467900 ich habe meinem trainer versprochen ihm bevor er jetzt in rente geht eine medaille mitzubringen
4467901 ich hab zu fr h zu viel druck auf die pedale gegeben da hat dann das rad durchgedreht

4467903 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4467904 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4467905 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4467906 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4467907 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4467908 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4467909 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4467910 weder die gr nen noch wir lassen uns auf etwas ein das nicht auf dauer angelegt ist
4467911 wir sagen nicht zu allem ja und amen und werden klarmachen was wir nicht mittragen
4467912 meine pr ferenz liegt klar bei einer kooperation mit der fdp und den gr nen
4467913 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4467914 at least al gore may have something to be happy about
4467915 wir k nnen nicht mehr mit bestimmtheit sagen wer angreifer war
4467916 ever since barack obama first ascended the national stage at the 2004 democratic convention pundits have been tripping over themselves to point out the difference between him and the average joe from the south side
4467917 he has no past he simply appears one day to help the white protagonist
4467918 colorblind barack obama would be the great black hope in the next presidential race if he were actually black
4467919 just as the negro friendly bill clinton had to gamble on retaining that base while reassuring whites that he knew how to keep blacks in line so mr obama has to reassure blacks he is unafraid to tell whites things that whites decidedly do not want to hear he didnt attain power through traditional black channels thats partially why whites can embrace him but blacks fear that one day hell go tiger woods on us and get all race transcendent
4467920 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4467921 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4467922 in the fast fuel episode ludacris and lees biodiesel tour buses are running on empty in the middle of the texas panhandle
4467923 they must roll into a fast food restaurant and look for fast food grease to turn into eco friendly fuel will this battle include discussion of the efficacy of biofuels as a long term petroleum substitute or the possible argument that biofuels are a crime against humanity
4467924 the reality is americans still take their cues from high profile people
4467925 have got golden opportunity to use their public profile to shine a light on these issues and get people to engage in their everyday lifestyle
4467926 the idea is if they can do it so can we
4467927 to see that celebrities and directors were driving the car that gave the car a cool vibe instead of a nerdy little weird car vibe
4467928 people take their fashion and style messages from celebrities why wont they also take their environmental messages
4467929 i dont know if theres time to go door to door and show people
4467930 thats why its good to have this celebrity platform anyone who uses their celebrity this podium responsibly im all for it
4467931 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4467932 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4467933 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4467934 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4467935 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4467936 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4467937 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4467938 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4467939 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4467940 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4467941 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4467942 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4467943 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4467944 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4467945 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4467946 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4467947 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4467948 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4467949 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4467950 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4467951 just so you all know we did set a record
4467952 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4467953 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4467954 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4467955 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4467956 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4467957 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4467958 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4467959 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4467960 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4467961 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4467962 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4467963 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4467964 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4467965 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4467966 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4467967 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4467968 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4467969 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4467970 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4467971 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4467972 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4467973 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4467974 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4467975 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4467976 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4467977 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4467978 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4467979 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4467980 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4467981 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4467982 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4467983 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4467984 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4467985 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4467986 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4467987 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4467988 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4467989 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4467990 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4467991 umgehend dazu kommen dass der sechs punkte plan verwirklicht wird und dass sich die russischen truppen aus dem kerngebiet georgiens wieder zur ckziehen
4467992 georgiens souver nit t und territoriale integrit t m ssen respektiert werden

4467994 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4467995 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4467996 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4467997 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4467998 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4467999 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4468000 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4468001 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4468002 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4468003 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4468004 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4468005 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4468006 with the people of georgia and their democratically elected government
4468007 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4468008 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4468009 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4468010 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4468011 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4468012 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4468013 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4468014 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4468015 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4468016 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
4468017 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
4468018 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
4468019 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
4468020 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4468021 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4468022 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4468023 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4468024 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
4468025 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
4468026 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4468027 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4468028 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4468029 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
4468030 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
4468031 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
4468032 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4468033 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4468034 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4468035 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4468036 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4468037 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4468038 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4468039 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4468040 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4468041 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4468042 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4468043 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4468044 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4468045 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4468046 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4468047 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4468048 republican presidential candidate john mccain now enjoys a healthy 88 7 percent lead over barack obama among republicans
4468049 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4468050 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4468051 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4468052 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4468053 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4468054 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4468055 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4468056 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4468057 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4468058 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4468059 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4468060 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4468061 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4468062 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4468063 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4468064 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4468065 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4468066 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4468067 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4468068 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4468069 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
4468070 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4468071 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4468072 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4468073 oh golly a cock in my mouth ill take two
4468074 you realize youre gonna end up being name redacteds bitch
4468075 i completely understand to get where i want in this town thats something im more than willing to be
4468076 i really need to impress upon you that youre really gonna be his bitch youre gonna do bitch work like making copies setting appointments emailing scripts its a lot of bitch work
4468077 im eager to learn and this is a great environment to do it name redacted is a legend i cant think of a place id rather work
4468078 do you know how to roll calls are you good with computers
4468079 yeah both mac and pc im a pro at rolling calls
4468080 great oh and it pays 400 per week well i gotta get back to the desk well be in touch
4468081 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4468082 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4468083 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4468084 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4468085 hed be a good man on a boat during a storm
4468086 obama does better against mccain with hunters and especially fisherpeople than did his two democratic predecessors vis a vis bush
4468087 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4468088 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4468089 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4468090 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4468091 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4468092 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4468093 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4468094 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4468095 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4468096 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4468097 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4468098 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4468099 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4468100 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4468101 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4468102 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4468103 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4468104 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4468105 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4468106 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4468107 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4468108 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4468109 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4468110 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4468111 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4468112 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4468113 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4468114 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4468115 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4468116 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4468117 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4468118 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4468119 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4468120 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4468121 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4468122 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4468123 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
4468124 ora samuel tinha morrido e todo israel o tinha pranteado ent o os filisteus se reuniram e avan aram mas quando saul avistou os filisteus foi tomado de medo e seu cora o tremeu saul consultou ao senhor mas ele n o lhe deu resposta nem por sonhos nem pela sorte e tampouco atrav s dos profetas ent o saul ordenou aos seus servos procurai me uma mulher entendida em evocar os mortos pois quero ir a ela e consult la saul se p s a caminho com dois homens chegaram casa da mulher de noite ent o ele disse por favor adivinha para mim por meio da necromancia e evoca me aquele que eu te disser ent o a mulher perguntou a quem devo evocar e ele respondeu evoca me a samuel vamos o que est s vendo a mulher respondeu a saul estou vendo um deus subindo das profundezas da terra ele lhe disse qual a sua apar ncia ela respondeu um homem velho que est subindo envolto num manto ent o saul reconheceu que era realmente samuel e caiu com o rosto por terra prostrando se para ele samuel por m disse a saul por que perturbas o meu repouso evocando me saul respondeu vejo me numa situa o desesperada que os filisteus me fazem guerra e deus se retirou de mim n o me tendo respondido nem por boca dos profetas nem por sonhos por isso te chamei para me indicares o que devo fazer samuel replicou por que ainda me consultas quando o senhor se retirou de ti tornando se teu advers rio o senhor cumpriu o que tinha falado por meu interm dio o senhor arrancou da tua m o a realeza e a deu ao teu companheiro davi j que n o obedeceste ao senhor e n o levaste a cabo a sua c lera ardente contra amalec por isso o senhor hoje te fez isto o senhor entregar contigo tamb m a israel nas m os dos filisteus e amanh tu e teus filhos estareis comigo o senhor entregar nas m os dos filisteus tamb m o ex rcito de israel ao ouvir isto saul caiu como fulminado estatelando se no ch o que estava profundamente apavorado com as palavras de samuel
4468125 n o vos dirijais aos esp ritas nem aos adivinhos n o os consulteis para que n o sejais contaminados por eles
4468126 the wachovia securities stock ticker board at the corner of college amp mlk could have been a minor landmark but its in such a dead zone practically no one sees it
4468127 pedestrian friendly my neighborhood of spring valley is very pedestrian friendly where you could walk continuously for several miles without the bother of busy intersections plenty of sidewalk and wide streets for bikes jogging strollers etc
4468128 well this is just a danger of a war zone
4468129 ive been working hard on my mechanics i kept my fastball down and the curve was working
4468130 he rivers is as good as weve got coming out of the bullpen right now
4468131 if a knife is to be re used on another person it first has to be sterilized
4468132 we have also discouraged the traditional practice of forcing the circumcised males into sexual intercourse to prove their manhood after the wound heals to avoid the spread of
4468133 why didnt you say that your server had already been here
4468134 the measure in south dakota would allow politicians to interfere with personal decisions best made by women and families
4468135 they are being deceptive by characterizing this proposed law as more reasonable and less restrictive
4468136 truth is that this ban would be the most rigid and inflexible ban on abortion in the united states
4468137 we are letting people know there are exceptions and i think we will have a healthy majority on election day because of that
4468138 m ost of america understands that the competence bar is set so low for gov george w bush of texas that its practically lying on the ground
4468139 doesnt seem to realize that in the real world people hate eddie haskell
4468140 for every complex problem there is a solution that is simple neat and wrong
4468141 de facto slogan has become real men dont think things through
4468142 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
4468143 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4468144 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
4468145 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
4468146 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
4468147 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
4468148 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
4468149 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
4468150 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
4468151 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4468152 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
4468153 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4468154 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4468155 the first thing they said was aw man we have to sell some more tickets
4468156 it reminds us of where were all coming from and the guys were following behind when people think of poly they think of a tradition of champions its a motivation type thing its like wow
4468157 whats so funny is that when the committee started announcing there would be a hall of fame we had a lot of letters that came back to us that said what about this guy and what about that guy
4468158 theres a lot of pride that came out of this the guys that were inducted they were shocked when they got their lettermans jacket when you win the masters you get a green jacket now these guys are bragging about their hall of fame jackets now everybody wants one
4468159 its going to be something that will go on for a long time we did something here that was really good not only does it recognize our past players but it helps our program in the future
4468160 we want to take a load off our defenses back
4468161 we want to share the load you put points on the board you win games
4468162 last year in the playoffs the defense shut down teams all these big strong teams we just didnt help out when games are 2 0 that wasnt a game we didnt know what that was we made it harder on ourselves there were times when we just didnt execute thats what it comes down to we got down the field but we didnt finish we get down to the 20 yard line and then mistakes would happen
4468163 on paper you think the offense is going to do better than last year
4468164 but you never know in high school until you put the pads on i hope the offense does a lot better but defensively were going to be very good again are we going to be as good i dont see vaughn telemaque and jurrell casey out there these new guys have to prove it to themselves
4468165 youve got a guy whos 210 pounds that runs a 10 5 or 10 4 100 meter dash hes physically gifted hes a first down back a third down back hes an every down back
4468166 were one of the rarest duos that youll ever find based on russells athleticism and my speed and quickness we give defenses so many problems because you cant focus on one
4468167 you focus on one and the other gets right past you
4468168 the last few years weve been kind of a run oriented team but this year were going to be passing the ball much more
4468169 i worked with joe montana some this summer i worked with jeff blake and i worked with steve clarkson those are three quarterback coaches that have top level nfl experience i was invited to the elite 11 but i had to deny it because i was taking classes
4468170 russsell has been working his butt off going to camps and working so hard this summer
4468171 hes so mature as a person and as a player
4468172 the minute russell slips up i tap him and say lets get it right
4468173 he watches everthing i do so anytime anything happens he comes and stays on me we just have so much chemistry on and off the field
4468174 especially the last few years weve been kind of a run oriented team so we competed in practice
4468175 weve been competing since freshman year we run track together we do all kinds of things together we push each other
4468176 i would have loved to have gone to lsu with him but god had other plans for me
4468177 im glad they just got the other running back eric stephens committed
4468178 i know hes fired up and wants to be the feature back we want to come in and get the whole team turned around if you have two very good running backs that you have to worry about that just drives a defense crazy whenever he needs a break youve got the next guy coming in those defenses will have their tongues hanging out
4468179 you cant understand how a woman seeing a man who has been separated from his wife rosetta getty for months can cause such a scandal
4468180 its awful i cant tell you you wonder when its all going to stop
4468181 any implication otherwise is an absolute lie balthazars affair has been utterly devastating to rosetta and her family
4468182 if the american president can take baghdad then why cant the russians take tbilisi
4468183 i am interested in good relations between the united states and russia but in the 21st century nations dont invade other nations
4468184 garrett is an excellent athlete who is really disciplined and driven and he holds himself to a pretty high standard
4468185 he was good for us at quarterback but garretts at his best when he has the ball in his hands and can get into the open field so we are going to put him at running back and see how many different ways we can dream up to get him the ball
4468186 chris is going to do a good job and we should have pretty good balance on offense
4468187 last year the offense just never did really fit our personnel and so we didnt have the sort of year 4 4 no playoffs that we are used to around here
4468188 i am so looking forward to having the chance to light somebody up
4468189 its sort of a family affair because my family goes with me to all the meets and its a great way to compete
4468190 it was a really tough decision to skip basketball but i wanted to use that time to get ready for track season
4468191 ill play that game with my girl friend and sometimes with a couple of guys who come over and try to beat me and fail
4468192 that was pretty cool scoring the first time i touched the ball in a varsity game i was running for my life out there scared to death
4468193 thats a pretty intense game anyway and we know that a win there would put us on the right path our team has some potential we just need to have everybody do their job
4468194 faisant fi des r alit s agropastorales et met en garde contre le danger des
4468195 motta has the athleticism to play safety but the body structure to play linebacker
4468196 his frame will allow him to add at least 25 more pounds and he is one of the hardest hitters in the country
4468197 but i dont really get into all of that stuff i dont really follow rankings but its pretty cool to be the no 143 player in the nation
4468198 wherever they tell me to play thats where ill play
4468199 i dont care if its safety or linebacker or whatever ill just do my best and give it 100 percent
4468200 he showed surprisingly good accuracy and excellent foot quickness he also has good height and a nice frame even though hes a tad thin at this time
4468201 bridgford has excellent mechanics and very good accuracy on short to mid range passes
4468202 maxwell possesses a very quick release and really good footwork he just needs to fill out
4468203 hot topic neutrality agreements card checks and voluntary recognition after dana
4468204 he really knows how to use his body to create space
4468205 he may be the most muscular back i have ever seen that has excellent agility
4468206 he demonstrated excellent power speed and change of direction all three days at fbu
4468207 he also gives each practice rep 110 percent similar to what i saw in when he was at the georgia rising senior camp two years ago
4468208 thomas might not look fast when hes lined up man to man against a cornerback but when he gets going he can blow past defensive backs with his long strides
4468209 he also carries his weight well and still is lean when he fills out and hits the weight room he should be able to develop into one of the most athletic tight ends around
4468210 brown is extremely quick for a back his size 6 0 215 and also has nice hands coming out of the backfield
4468211 he is one back who is physically ready to compete at the next level right now richardson is probably the most physically impressive athlete i have seen he has soft hands out of the backfield and really knows how to use his muscular frame to get open most backs this thick are not as nimble
4468212 wood once he starts heading vertical his acceleration is off the chart his running style is reminiscent of darren mcfadden he also will be a threat catching passes out of the backfield but he just needs to add some size to his lean frame 6 0 192
4468213 he is what i call a five tool back he is fast has a great change of direction good hands great physique and is a real leader
4468214 i came in with a lot more confidence and i came to compete
4468215 thats awesome coaches can go their whole career without an all american player and ive had two former arizona state and current nfl tight end zach miller and now devon
4468216 key requirements articulated in the directive are inconsistent with current california law
4468217 mrmib is constitutionally obligated to follow state law and cannot unilaterally change hfp operating rules that are embodied in state law
4468218 at present california will continue to operate the hfp including eligibility benefits and cost sharing in conformance with cms approved title xxi state plan and will continue to claim federal funds accordingly
4468219 if other complex program changes are any indication there is every reason to suspect that the states will be able to continue to claim federal dollars for covered children while efforts to achieve compliance are negotiated
4468220 we are determining whether the relevant states are in compliance with the existing requirements as also clarified in the aug 17 2007 letter moreover we will continue to assist the states in developing policies that will ensure that the most vulnerable low income children are covered first without moving them from private to public coverage
4468221 the assumption of mary into heaven is also taught by the eastern orthodox church and the oriental and coptic orthodox churches where it is known as the dormition of the theotokos
4468222 breakthrough welcomes any research which investigates new uses for existing treatments to help benefit people with breast cancer
4468223 however its important to remember that this research is at a very early stage and further studies are needed before we will know whether this type of approach will be an effective treatment for women with breast cancer we await further developments in this area with interest
4468224 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century

4468226 very limited to a light patrolling ability such as a few kilometers outside of south ossetia not the right to maintain a presence inside georgia

4468228 students need to comprehend that it is lack of judgment not only lack of skill that increases the risk of injury to oneself and others not wanting something bad to happen is simply not enough
4468229 in addition to giving teens the knowledge and teaching them the technical skills injury prevention programs must also address teens attitudes about being immune to illness and death as a means of changing high risk behaviors such as driving while impaired

4468253 the chinese economy isn t going to suddenly grind to a halt when the olympic flame is snuffed out
4468254 in fact i believe the olympics are china s springboard to even more impressive growth with the nation of 1 3 billion at center stage look for the world to fall even more in love with the opportunity
4468255 still not convinced then ask yourself this simple question would global giants like yum brands mcdonald s and nike among countless others invest so heavily in a country whose growth could potentially dry up overnight absolutely not
4468256 in fact roughly 450 companies recently told the american chamber of commerce in beijing that china was among their top three global investment priorities many regard china as their top priority and you can bet the conclusions were based on mountains of favorable data
4468257 as incomes started to rise the chinese consumer started well buying
4468258 to play the imminent boom go with the century 21 of china e house it s china s largest real estate agency services firm with 1 800 professionals in more than 20 cities
4468259 most important to us however is that it s grossly undervalued in october shares traded for an eye popping price to earnings ratio of 91 today e house trades for less than 19 times historical earnings and roughly nine times forward earnings
4468260 that s a steal considering earnings should rise by 50 or more for the next five years indeed not too many opportunities come along to buy growth this cheaply
4468261 e house has been battling the misperception of getting lumped together with the withering u s real estate market
4468262 however a recent proposal by the chinese government to levy a new tax based on property values rather than just on transactions as it does now is the real culprit behind the decline
4468263 while the chinese government wants to cool excessive speculation there is no way that it will do anything to deepen the slide of its stock market
4468264 and get this e house has a peg price earnings to growth ratio of only 0 32 any peg below 1 0 means that you are getting a ton of profits for peanuts
4468265 we are going to use this opportunity to average down and lower our cost basis in one of our holdings e house china holdings ltd
4468266 e house is china s largest real estate company it s been an extremely volatile stock since going public just about a year ago
4468267 it hit a high of 36 45 on 10 31 07 and has been as low as 9 40 the company is supposed to earn 0 82 per share this year and 1 11 per share next year they are growing extremely fast and the stock is cheap
4468268 every month that goes by without tax reform america is a relatively less attractive place to do business over the past 18 months nine of the 30 most developed nations and 20 countries world wide from israel to germany to turkey have cut their corporate tax rates nations are slashing rates to attract capital and jobs from the u s and the tragedy is that our politicians keep making it easy for them

4468271 around the globe wind generating capacity has been expanding at a rapid 30 clip in recent years
4468272 its most promising division is the production of structural wind towers
4468273 led by states such as texas and california wind farms around the country will generate almost 50 billion kilowatt hours of electricity this year of course the u s is still playing catch up with many other regions
4468274 in fact countries such as spain portugal and denmark all rely on wind farms for as much as one quarter of their total power needs
4468275 across europe wind turbines will account for roughly one third of all new generating capacity installed over the next few years and could provide electricity for 90 million people by 2010
4468276 the outlook is even brighter in many booming energy hungry asian markets in china installed wind power capacity surged 130 last year and will reportedly supply a great deal of the electricity needed for the upcoming 2008 beijing olympic games
4468277 thanks to the great strides in engineering wind turbine output has increased by a factor of ten or higher in some cases over the past decade
4468278 the power generating potential of wind is enormous the wind resources in north dakota alone are enough to power a staggering one third of the countrys total power needs
4468279 it comes as no surprise to hear that 36 billion will be spent on wind generating equipment this year i see trinity as a great way to participate
4468280 trinity is a top supplier of several different industrial product lines including railroad cars highway girders inland cargo barges and propane tanks all of which happen to be doing pretty well at the moment
4468281 however the firm has a large and growing stake in wind towers the company is among a handful of recognized leaders in the market for these giant tubes
4468282 this facet of the firms business is growing rapidly amid heated demand wind tower revenues have spiked 35 fold over the past four years soaring from just 11 million in 2004 to an expected 390 million this year
4468283 better still order backlog over the past 12 months has surged from 200 million to 1 6 billion representing a highly visible stream of future business within the next five years management is forecasting that wind tower revenues could double again to 800 million
4468284 even without energy equipment the firms other business segments alone merit a closer look
4468285 the firms fleet of 41 000 railroad cars available for lease is 99 6 utilized and the average lease has over five years remaining
4468286 these revenues are locked in and will provide some stability regardless of what happen on the product sales side but future orders should remain robust considering 700 000 of the nations 1 6 million railcars are more than 25 years old and the replacement cycle has already begun

4468308 we are in court again next week on other matters and my hope is we can get the warrant resolved by then and get back on track
4468309 we have some things in the works to get the warrant taken care of my hope is that we can resolve it without an arrest but hes been arrested at the airport before so they obviously have an eye out for him so im not sure

4468320 our second quarter financial results reflect difficult macroeconomic conditions and a significant slowdown in consumer spending
4468321 however we see these challenging times as a great opportunity to place more distance between us and the rest of specialty retail
4468322 the commitment we made during the second quarter of this year slowed down the production and therefore the revenue growth that i expected to realize during the quarter and as a result the company will not reach some of the revenue targets that i anticipated we would reach during 2008
4468323 however i feel the changes provide the company with a much more realistic opportunity to achieve profitable near term growth earlier than expected

4468329 do you think homosexuals who do publicly disclose their sexual orientation should be allowed to serve in the military or not
4468330 hes obviously got some experience on soft turf he didnt run terrible on it last year whether thats his favorite surface is debatable
4468331 he does have the ability to be up on it
4468332 its not like some european horses where if they are in front they dont run the same
4468333 he didnt run too hard he came out of it better than he went into it i would have liked to have won but he had a terrible trip so what can you do
4468334 i feel as good about him entering this race as i have in any of his races
4468335 it was a thrill to see him run that way be able to step up
4468336 until then i was just feeling my way along with him to see where he was going to level off he was dropping back off a mile and a half to a mile and a quarter and i think hes better going a mile and a half than he is going a mile and a quarter
4468337 for me it was a good opportunity and maybe when i look back after a few years i will be proud of it
4468338 not everybody can go on the cover of playboy i did it because i am confident of my body and myself

4468342 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4468343 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4468344 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4468345 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4468346 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4468347 we would like to settle it thats where it needs to be settled is on the track
4468348 im afraid if we dont meet her then i think its going to be left up to a lot of opinions
4468349 we kind of stuck her in there at the end when it wasnt a big field we were kind of pleasantly surprised she was able to get the mile and a quarter so well off the preparation she had shes a one paced grind it out filly in her own right we feel shes going forward off that race
4468350 she did that on pure guts and determination and class of horse
4468351 it would take her completely out of her game plan however the only time we laid really close to the front recently was chasing indian blessing and it worked shell do whatever we want to do

4468361 one of the awards staff asked zac who the straighteners were for and he said vanessa hudgens but it was really for him
4468362 its okay i guess but the other one was better
4468363 there is not a single redeeming feature about this one from the odious skanking rhythm to the barely registering vocal performance its a song which should have been aborted when it was just a mere twinkle in the eye of
4468364 the thing is that theyre both so stupidly beautiful and good looking and attractive that their children are born looking gorgeous its unsettling
4468365 i think their adoption policy is probably better because when their genes come together it creates a storm of attractiveness so potent that it could one day bring down the planet
4468366 i dont think they should breed those two people no one needs a baby with eight inch long eyelashes

4468372 if we dont do this now carcass will be erased from the history of rock to a certain extent
4468373 theres so much access to information out there but it seems to me that the new generation of kids just really dont know sh they dont really know who black sabbath is never mind carcass theres definitely a generation of kids out there who are not aware of carcass because we havent been around for 15 years a year is a long time in metal these days
4468374 i guess over the last few years weve kind of drifted into each others circles again myself guitarist bill steer and mike and mikes kind of i dont want to over exaggerate this but hes always been the keenest to do this because since he formed arch enemy and has been out on the road again hes kind of realized what kind of phenomenon carcass is
4468375 mikes always been kind of hassling me and bill on the side about doing something and so i guess the stars aligned at some point because for years i said id never do it if drummer ken owen who suffered a brain hemorrhage in 1999 couldnt play i thought it would be a bit like led zeppelin playing without john bonham how can you kind of find a way around that
4468376 it seems to me nostalgia is the new rock and roll not to sound arrogant but im well aware of the importance of this band even if no one else is theres a generation of people who were into carcass whove grown up now that never saw the band and now they have some disposable income theyve created the demand for this reunion
4468377 never say never but i cant see it happening i cant see it working
4468378 for something like that to happen everybodys head has to be on the same continent
4468379 these bands that start playing again some of them get carried away and they write an album and they start saying its the best thing we ever done and then it just isnt we dont want to be one of those bands we dont want to be doing this next year i could maybe see us playing again in some of the countries that were not touching this year but lets see if we kill each other when were in north america on a tour bus were getting on great but we want to keep that chemistry and not get burned out we dont want to be doing it just for the money because it can turn into a chore thats what happened the first time it seemed like work and it wasnt fun anymore so i figured f this ill go get a job if youre doing something just for the money i think having a job is a bit more honest than playing in a band just for the money
4468380 its like everything just merges into one nowadays everythings sounding the same the problem with the modern metal scene is people are too busy copying bands wholesale and not actually taking an influence and doing something new with it i dont think its laziness i think it just comes down to imagination and intelligence
4468381 ozzy did it and even zakk wyldes done it playing with black label and ozzy
4468382 other people have done it but as far as vocally its just me and ozzy its good company to be in hes the dude that basically created this niche i think it would be pretty grueling to do it for a full tour
4468383 he kept on beating us up making us do all these painful things
4468384 i thought raymond was going home and i said yeah because id fallen in love with him already
4468385 if she would have never adopted me i would have probably been in another home saying lord get me out of this world
4468386 after youre 2 years old in america its very tough to get adopted out of the foster care system
4468387 after youre 5 years old its extremely difficult and after youre 8 10 or 12 its almost impossible
4468388 shes also helped me out in a lot of ways
4468389 were still in counseling at different ages different issues reoccur
4468390 one of the most profound needs is to adopt more than one child a sibling set
4468391 brothers and sisters lose each other in the system and thats part of the pain
4468392 they disciplined me and actually gave me rules to follow other houses that id been to really didnt do that
4468393 i was thinking like it would be scary if i was all by myself and luis left
4468394 a lot of people tell you how lucky the kids are to come to your house or to have you as parents believe me were the lucky ones the blessed ones to have them come in our life
4468395 its just like a beautiful gift being given to you getting a new family being able to have someone who can love you and trust and you do the same to them
4468396 its been the best thing thats happened in my life to adopt him
4468397 the whole ritual of adoption is part of the healing
4468398 if anything ever happens to you or your mom your whole family will be there right behind you holding you back up and saying youre going to be all right
4468399 actually i dont really know how i got the nickname
4468400 it just came up and people started talking to me and going hey bonus jonas and i was like hey whatever

4468415 the war i witnessed for more than five years in iraq
4468416 were playing kent again and they are an excellent team
4468417 they have great depth in their bowling and batting and are also a great fielding unit
4468418 were going to have to play exceptionally well to win but we think we have the players here able to do that
4468419 the measure of all seasons is how many trophies you win weve missed out on the twenty20 so this is the next one to tick off
4468420 one day cricket means a lot to essex and their supporters so it will be important for us to bring this one home
4468421 at headingley he bowled quite well and didnt let himself down at all perhaps there were a few nerves on day one as you might expect from a man making his test debut but on day two he was probably englands best bowler
4468422 hes been doing well since he was left out and his performances would certainly merit the selectors taking another look at him
4468423 we didnt really know anything about pattinson but we made a few phone calls to some of our contacts on the county circuit and got some information from them pretty quickly
4468424 when it came to our first innings we all studied him closely to find out what his bowling was like
4468425 at the time we felt he had bowled quite steadily and then after the match we noticed how much stick he had been getting
4468426 most of it was a bit harsh and im sure that if england had won the test it wouldnt have been an issue at all
4468427 he didnt ask to be selected and every player wants to represent their country he was hardly going to turn them down
4468428 its the goal of the team to be number one in the world in both forms of the game

4468438 im suggesting that the data be subjected to legitimate scientific inquiry to establish what if anything it signifies
4468439 there is absolutely no clinical nor other valid research establishing any therapeutic benefit nor other value to these techniques

4468468 brno is one of my favourites and in 2003 i won the 250 race after the race in laguna i feel very confident for the rest of the season i think we found the right set up to develop the bike on each racetrack the good place we gained in the us gave us more incentives to be more competitive in the last weeks i enjoyed my vacation but i also trained a lot to be physically fit for the heat at brno and at misano after the race we will also have two days of testing
4468469 after laguna seca where we conquered the best result of the season with elias we are ready to start again and try to improve even more the hardest period has now passed and both riders have found a good method of work for each racing weekend surely this break has brought some time to relax to both riders and i am sure they are ready to begin in the best way possible this final part of the season
4468470 from when i joined motogp i never made it to conquer great results in brno the moment to do well here has come also because i find this track really fascinating during the break i always trained and now i really feel in good form i also spent sometime with my family and it has been really important to find back the best serenity and concentration
4468471 i raced here in 2002 as a wild card but last year it was the first time as a full time rider last year i couldnt do an excellent race but this year both me and toni have all the conditions to compete with the fastest riders the bike has reached a great level i am still a bid sad for how the american race went without that mistake at the beginning of the race i could have done surely a positive race i will try to do better in brno for me and for all my crew that has been putting me in the best conditions to give the maximum

4468546 the earths solid inner core started to form over a billion years ago when the liquid iron core that surrounds it became cool enough to begin solidifying it has now grown to a radius of around 1200 km but the difficulty in studying it is the thousands of kilometres of rock in the way as a result we know more about the surfaces of other planets than we do about the deep interior of our own however we have a powerful tool for studying the inner architecture of the earth

4468650 but it would be nice to understand the psyche of the fan and to find those great fans and see not necessarily how committed they are but what impact an nfl team has on its surrounding community
4468651 i remember playing it as a kid i just didnt enjoy it
4468652 in england if youre not good at soccer thats it your high school social life is out of the picture
4468653 what struck me about american football nfl is the celebrating and the fun of it not the arrogance and the show boating
4468654 theres a strong family and community element people say that soccer is a gentlemens game played by hooligans and rugby is a hooligans game played by gentlemen and i think football is just like that

4468665 brian mildenberg is being vilified when he should be applauded for courageously taking on a difficult case out of a sense of professional responsibility
4468666 one of the most insane obscene and disgusting things ive heard in all my public life
4468667 my primary concern is to get the record straight and try to communicate the facts of this case
4468668 and understand they may not recover money damages in the end
4468669 yes we have plenty of money we have enough money to spend but were not going to splash out stupidly we could spend more but were not going to pay silly money for a player that is only going to strengthen the squad a bit if they might win you the champions league thats a different matter but no one is a better judge than arsene

4468673 nothing will happen before the game apart from justin hoyte may complete a move to middlesbrough
4468674 i think we can do more and we should do more
4468675 these results are going to move their country forward and we have to learn how better to provide support for our athletes
4468676 we have to have a good hard look at how we fund our athletes our coaches our nutritionists lets get on with doing something its critical
4468677 who knows how many youngsters will start swimming because of michael phelps or 2007 world champion from b c brent hayden
4468678 yes you need to fund the foundation and you need to build from the ground up but you need to fund worthwhile elite athletes as well we have to invest in the athlete
4468679 but we can do more to help them attain their absolute best
4468680 i wasnt that good at any of them but i played

4468700 this team of marines is responsible to react in the event of a hazardous materials situation and determine whether the situation is an accident or incident
4468701 the new class gets in depth with the new state of the art detection equipment a variety of gas masks and plenty of practical application
4468702 because of the class i feel very confident in using this new equipment in a real scenario
4468703 all the gear and personal protection equipment the students are learning about and using could really help them if they decided to pursue a civilian career in the hazardous materials field
4468704 the certifications these students are earning is recognized as a major accomplishment in the civilian sector
4468705 all the marines enrolled in the course seem to be grasping everything quite well
4468706 they should be ready for any mission scenario we throw their way and eventually be ready to use there skills down range in potential real world missions
4468707 me ha gustado el proyecto que me present el dinamo tengo que admitir que no soy imparcial con el rojo y el blanco lo viste el dinamo y dos de mis antiguos equipos el olympiacos y el benfica
4468708 the main purpose of the ecc is to search and clear the evacuees process and transport them to a safe destination
4468709 after the infantry marines escort the evacuees to the ecc we take over the process to ensure the evacuees get out of the area safely
4468710 the training was very important because it gave all the marines and sailors a chance to see the elements of an ecc and how it operates
4468711 from classroom training you can only grasp so much but being out here and having to set up the tents and actually evacuate people really helps you understand the details and what must be done for an ecc to function properly
4468712 first off we want to get the marines comfortable with the basics of what an ecc consists of and how it operates
4468713 we wanted to get a feel for the situation at hand so everyone would understand their individual job in a real life scenario
4468714 at the end of this training everyone must be fast and proficient when it comes to rendering aid searching or just setting up the tents everything needs to be second nature
4468715 during a medical emergency the main responsibility of a corpsman on site is to sort and triage evacuees
4468716 we have a corpsman at the entrance of the ecc screening people for illness and if something is detected they are escorted to the medical tent for further medical assistance or first aid
4468717 it was fast paced but the best way to work with the situation at hand was to practice like you play
4468718 we trained as if it was real we performed exactly how we would during a real neo and i feel confident now
4468719 this is by far one of the most dangerous things we do
4468720 its an invaluable asset especially when you are out there
4468721 youll get your f ing paycheck whenever i decide to give it to you you f ing monkey
4468722 in the weeks and months following huntsmans announcement that it had signed a definitive merger agreement with hexion and with the companys securities trading at artificially inflated prices company insiders sold 57 082 420 shares of the companys stock for gross proceeds of over 1 3 billion
4468723 then on june 19 2008 the company shocked investors when it announced that hexion had filed a lawsuit against huntsman seeking to terminate the merger agreement
4468724 huntsman disclosed the hexion lawsuit to investors on june 19 2008 on this news the companys shares fell 8 per share or 38 35 percent to close on june 19 2008 at 12 86 on unusually heavy trading volume
4468725 as influential and enduring as his music is brownes legacy as an advocate for social and environmental justice throughout brownes career he has closely associated himself with liberal causes and democratic political candidates indeed browne has spent significant time throughout his career raising public awareness for such causes browne brings this action in order to vindicate an egregious intentional false associated created by agents of the presumptive republican candidate for president of the united states senator john mccain suggesting that browne sponsors and endorses mccain a false association that directly conflicts with the political and social values that browne has espoused and supported throughout his career
4468726 in his second lap jeffrey eventually fell to the ground the first coach to arrive yelled at jeffrey to get up and get going as he did so he reached out and grabbed jeffrey by the shirt then another coach came over reached down grabbed the inside of the waistline on jeffreys pants lifted him off the ground and then dropped him onto the ground

4468737 i respect spiders and i feel bad that i dislike them so much in fact i kinda feel sorry for them with all the antipathy most people feel towards them
4468738 yes its a pity because if you ask people why they are afraid of spiders theyll say oh they bite if you ask them how many times theyve been bitten by a spider theyll say uh never or once yet they get bitten by midges and mosquitoes thousands of times and they arent afraid of midges and mosquitoes
4468739 totally harmless and good for you for your change of heart
4468740 anyone familiar with jumping spiders has probably marveled at their perceptual abilities which include watching and reacting to us as if a tiny spider and a medium sized mammal are on the same scale
4468741 i am mature youre the one who will rot in hell
4468742 whatever will we do now that our house has flooded i know plug in the tv

4468744 with biotech corn farming families without a carabao and other farm implements can now cultivate their grasslands which were converted into corn lands
4468745 the families can now send their children to school and provide well for their needs
4468746 we pour house legislation into the senatorial saucer to cool it
4468747 i wanted to do a relatable grounded character comedy about marriage and the lengths we go to preserve the spark
4468748 tina and steve are smart and relatable and the tone of their comedy perfectly fits this film
4468749 mitigation efforts against climate change require activities that contribute towards restoration of vegetation control of floods and siltation of water bodies and soil fertility restoration to absorb carbondioxide reduce droughts and control disease
4468750 when you are poor you use firewood engage in traditional agriculture that causes soil erosion and environmental degradation through over grazing
4468751 that is why the government is building dams in bujagali and others at karuma and hoima to get rid of using firewood and resort to electricity
4468752 we must also modernise agriculture to avoid degradation of the environment
4468753 i stopped the capture until we have conducted an inspection on the farm to see if the fences of the farm are without holes that allow game to go in and out
4468754 i am trying to tap young and fresh talent the other thing is that the young ones can easily concentrate on a production because they always give in their all they love what they are doing
4468755 i used girls in higher classes depending on ones personality apart from the props and costumes we have also trained them on how to change voices
4468756 i think that liberal leader stephane dion will have to make up his mind and i think quite frankly im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively
4468757 i do think its fair to say that in the past few months and particularly over the summer we have seen increasing signs that this parliament is really not working very well anymore its becoming increasingly dysfunctional
4468758 we have important legislation that is stalled in the senate by the liberal party we have other legislation that is obstructed in the house of commons principally by dion we have a committee system that is increasingly in chaos and we have mr dion regularly threatening to force an election so i think you have to make up your mind pretty soon
4468759 the conservatives antics are just dragging this committee into the gutter
4468760 its mr harper and his house leader and his whip who have been orchestrating the dysfunctionality of this particular parliament
4468761 a major part of whatever is dysfunctional is coming from the government side he is choosing to cover over that which is another reason why people dont trust mr harper
4468762 what we are saying to stephane dion is make up your mind for once and stick to it either force that election or co operate and allow us to govern stop the delaying and obstruction tactics
4468763 this is the prime minister who made a virtue of passing fixed election date legislation and now hes threatening to cross sussex drive and go see his neighbour the governor general and ask for an election because hes fabricating a crisis where none exists
4468764 either let the current parliament work and let us get on with our mandate or the voters themselves will decide
4468765 we have important legislation that is stalled in the senate by the liberal party we have other legislation that is obstructed in the house of commons principally by liberal leader stephane dion
4468766 i cant wait to see how he explains why sweden can have a comparable standard of living and unemployment rate to us with a 150 tonne carbon tax and insist that a 40 tonne carbon tax will destroy canada
4468767 since 2002 notre dame has had a commitment to executive education in chicago
4468768 with this new facility weve expanded our capacity to offer values based programs to executives who are seeking new pathways for ongoing leadership in this increasingly complex global economy
4468769 the reception room needed to hearken back to the notre dame campus through the use of wood and its traditional design and detailing
4468770 we took advantage of the large windows and transomed doorways along the storefront to connect visually to the historic lobby and grant park to the east
4468771 we planned the renovation to reflect an appreciation for the santa fes historic architecture while augmenting it with a first rate learning environment that meets the unique needs of executive students
4468772 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the field guides
4468773 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special you of course have to be cautious but i was still very excited at the prospect of possibly having found a new species of bird
4468774 finding the olive backed forest robin strongly underscores the importance of our research this helps us show the conservation importance of the area
4468775 what do i do with this expanded consciousness created from this new found or remembered as is the case in the theta healing class knowledge
4468776 yeast express a protein called hsp104 which is able to reverse protein aggregation
4468777 however for reasons that are unclear hsp104 is not found in mammals we wondered if introducing hsp104 into mammals could help with diseases connected with protein aggregation
4468778 one thing wed like to do next is to treat an animal model which already has considerable quantities of alpha synuclein aggregates to see if hsp104 can actually reverse the process in the rat brain
4468779 im righteously ticked off but as long as you keep singing i suppose itll be alright but dont you dare stop
4468780 everybody stepped up and showed a lot of guts and we couldnt have wished for anything more out of the heat swim
4468781 we wanted to make the final and to be the first team to do it is unbelievable
4468782 a medals never out of the question if we all step up who knows what could happen but were just all happy that we made the final and well just take it from there

4468787 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization
4468788 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security

4468803 it is a double delight for us we are released on the same day when india got freedom
4468804 there are around 400 fishermen in the landi jail many of them were sick and under nourished due to unhygienic condition of jail many fishermen occasional fall ill and were admitted to hospital but the mediocre medical treatment fail to prevent them from falling sick again he added
4468805 when i was arrested by pak coastal guards i was told that i was being sentenced to three months but i had to spend 18 months in jail
4468806 the government could save fishermen from passing through this agony by demarking the boundary in the sea he said his boat was also seized and now he would have to find some other job
4468807 we have arrived after our release but there are many like us who are still languishing in the jail they are given little food to eat and are forced to live in inhumane conditions which have also posed a threat of outbreak of some epidemic
4468808 i imagine that if lord byron was alive today he would be a rock star
4468809 he was probably the first celebrity known across europe as well as britain he got lots of fan mail from women desperate to meet him some were essentially stalkers
4468810 we have bills and receipts for large sums spent on brandy wine ale and meals he also spent heavily on jewellery cosmetics and tooth cleaning powder
4468811 he spent extravagantly on items such as brooches belt buckles and even a gold tooth pick his bills for clothing were immense
4468812 it limits the speed of the whole process to the speed of your electronics
4468813 the light and the fibres can quite cheerfully sustain a couple of terahertz but your electronics cant do more than a few gigahertz
4468814 the ability to slow the light could be a tremendous force for telecoms that is sure to enhance speed and efficiency
4468815 with these materials you could imagine something more like a single chip with the metamaterial handling the routing all the capability of one of these big filtering systems but the size of your fingernail
4468816 the idea is to tell moms who are breastfeeding to take it a step forward to help other moms who cannot immediately breastfeed
4468817 we are confident that jackson browne will prevail in this lawsuit not only have senator mccain and his agents plainly infringed mr brownes copyright in running on empty but the federal courts have long held that the unauthorized use of a famous singers voice in a commercial constitutes a false endorsement and a violation of the singers right of publicity
4468818 in light of jackson brownes lifelong commitment to democratic ideals and political candidates the misappropriation of jackson brownes endorsement is entirely reprehensible and i have no doubt that a jury will agree
4468819 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4468820 bangabandhu was uncompromising in realising self rights by enduring oppression and torture his political farsightedness valour oration and robust leadership had inspired the nation during the war of independence

4468832 it is precisely the litvinenko case or primarily londons efforts to politicize it that have resulted in a visible aggravation of russian british relations meanwhile there is a practical way out of the present situation that has been tested in international legal practices
4468833 if british law enforcement produces relevant documents to the russian prosecutor generals office the possibility of conducting a corresponding probe in russia could be considered
4468834 we have experience of conducting such investigations meanwhile britain continues to insist that russia expel its citizen thus pushing us to directly break the constitution

4468857 it was really the amateur radio operators that were able to link those systems and provide communication back to shearwater for pretty close to a week

4468915 students need to comprehend that it is lack of judgment not only lack of skill that increases the risk of injury to oneself and others not wanting something bad to happen is simply not enough
4468916 in addition to giving teens the knowledge and teaching them the technical skills injury prevention programs must also address teens attitudes about being immune to illness and death as a means of changing high risk behaviors such as driving while impaired

4468940 there is a presidential decree and it will naturally be implemented
4468941 i guarantee that we will do everything to ensure the presidents decree is carried out
4468942 we have one general commander for the black sea fleet it is the president of russia
4468943 i said i imagine yall are here to watch drew right
4468944 they kind of laughed and felt bad that they werent there to watch me i relayed to them that one of my career goals was to get where im good enough where someone might actually go to a golf course pick up a pairing sheet and say ill follow bob heintzs group today
4468945 thats kind of a vague career goal but they started to tease me about that as the day went on i guess ill follow you now id rather have attention than you know have nobody know who i was
4468946 if i was to point to something and say this could be stressful for me right now it would not be whether i get into the fedex cup
4468947 it would be you know am i going to be able to finish this year in the top 125
4468948 am i going to be able to finish in the top 150
4468949 i can prove it with the international organisations already bringing testimony to what im saying
4468950 if tomorrow mr saakashvili signs the document that we have negotiated with russian president mr medvedev then the withdrawal of russian troops can begin
4468951 we can forget about talks on georgias territorial integrity because its impossible to force south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be returned into georgias fold by force
4468952 this is going to be a defining crisis in the united states russian relationship the danger is that neither side feels it can back down
4468953 we may only be at the beginning of this crisis rather than at the end of it
4468954 we have no idea what they are doing there why such a heavy force
4468955 one explanation could be that they are just trying to battle the civilian population
4468956 we have information that american military transport aviation say they are delivering a certain humanitarian cargo to tbilisi airport though they said we had bombed the airport two days ago
4468957 lets ask them will they invite you the media to check whether it is humanitarian or not what is in it the cargo in reality it is of major concern to russians
4468958 youve got to be careful off the tee to hit the fairways thats going to be the key all week
4468959 i got off to a great start and made tons of putts
4468960 i missed a few opportunities on the second nine but i made a birdie to finish on a high note so im very pleased

4468968 they are very happy i have played with them for the delhi team they are very helpful its great fun to be with them in the indian team
4468969 he is a different bowler he is a very good bowler i have seen videos of his bowling i have been asking my teammates as well who have played him
4468970 when you are playing in a match it is all about my mental set up about how i face him but obviously i am getting a lot of help from my teammates as well i will try to do well if i get a chance to play
4468971 aplaudo que el ministro santos se interese por la seguridad
4468972 i havent lost a beef i killed a whole group limb by limb see what happened to g unit
4468973 i believe that there is a market in our community for a new diverse network that provides a new brand of superior programming that caters to all aspects of television from reality to original programming
4468974 will continue to do work with them and support their networks
4468975 i didnt have the best row i had no wind in the last 500m and this has been my downfall these games im now going to go and enjoy the rest of the games and when i get home take it easy and have some downtime i had higher expectations for the olympics but i guess for your first games it doesnt always go to plan i am going to get stronger for the next four years
4468976 winning the b final is a small comfort after yesterday i would have preferred to have had the same race in the final it was not the best feeling race ive had the quarterfinal was my best race ive got no holiday as im going to the swedish national championships and racing the single quad and eight ive really enjoyed the games even if its not the result i wanted its been a great summer vacation im definitely going to watch lassi karonnen in the final tomorrow i am moving into the olympic village tomorrow and am looking forward to spending time with the swedish team
4468977 after the semifinal we felt kind of stupid we hit a buoy with 750m to go and lost speed maybe it was only 1 second but that was enough to make us fourth today we won so easily we should have been in the final a but we still have the european championships where we will defend our title we are staying here one more week and will try to watch other sports in sydney and athens we could only watch the womens marathon but here i want to see serbia in water polo and volleyball
4468978 we are not satisfied with our performance we should have been at least first in the final b we are so sorry because we had chances but our performance was only mediocre we were still tired after our last race the climate gives us problems and we couldnt give our best performances the chinese are marvellous after this we plan a long vacation maybe a year and well think about the future
4468979 our office is concerned about people incurring large expenses for data downloads
4468980 its been a concern of ours for some time in a sense the iphone is the latest in a series of 3g capable handsets which people are able to download data on and our office has seen many complaints where consumers have incurred unexpectedly high bills as a result of the data they have downloaded
4468981 you can download so much data so quickly at considerable cost if you are not on the right plan
4468982 there is no doubt that people are still getting to grips with that
4468983 people have already got their first pro rata iphone bills and many of them are shocked according to reports on iphone forums particularly those on the lower volume plans
4468984 that giant secret payment to his mistress was for unfinished video work yeah thats the ticket
4468985 practically everyone on earth can relate to it and yet it appeared within the last 20 years its an archival object that marks our place in history
4468986 obviously the sculptures are made of a lot of phones on an individual basis but 5000 phones is just a fraction of the number of phones that go into landfill every day whole villages and forests are torn down in africa for the mining of the metals needed to make smaller batteries and lcd screens these tiny objects have changed the landscape dramatically in the last 20years
4468987 i like my phone camera because its always on and its light to carry around
4468988 and i like the way the photos have that second generation degraded quality so they look like surveillance photos or photos of a crime scene
4468989 my phone is quite old i dont know what the model is called
4468990 im not really a phone person but i like this one its probably redundant technology now but i dont want to give it up because i might not get the same results on a newer phone
4468991 i like to think of the world as a collection and my phone is a collection device
4468992 i stand on the first tee and i just feel comfortable
4468993 everybody has golf courses where you just look down there and you cant see anything the comfort zone is the most important thing
4468994 i played nice and steady and had a good front nine to start
4468995 thats what you want when you come back to defend a title
4468996 i looked at the turn and saw stads was at 7 under
4468997 then i didnt see a board again until 15 and i saw the lead was five i thought they just hadnt updated that board yet
4468998 it is hard to play safe out here and if you do that you are going to give yourself some tough putts and you will start aiming shots and not hitting fairways
4468999 being aggressive has always been my game plan and yesterday i got away from that i will not do that anymore this week
4469000 i played a bogey free round today which i can not complain about but it could have been better
4469001 my ball striking was definitely better of the tee yesterday and it has to be for the rest of the week for me to win this championship
4469002 whether youre a reader swept away by a story or a writer creating those sweeping stories in todays busy world more than ever before we all need stories that strike deep chords i help others write the stories they need to tell
4469003 i guess it was a good race because we qualified for the a final and you are never sure in this tough field the cheering from the grandstands helps a lot although its a bit misleading normally you can only hear the crowd in the last 250m but here the grandstands are much nearer the start too before the race we agreed lets do it for our coach who is sick with flu and not here today
4469004 we were the outsiders in this race our heat wasnt so good but weve gradually found it in our boat we willed ourselves to have enough strength to do it and we gave everything in that race it was better to race today than yesterday we had more time to recover from the repechage
4469005 im really disappointed that we were 5th because we truly believed that we could make an impact and reach the a final we have been sculling well hester goodsell always calls a good race but we just didnt have the legs for it the netherlands were amazing and you always get a surprise from the finns
4469006 the race was very businesslike and task orientated in the heats we were too external but after we watched the video we found key points that we could concentrate on during the race we rowed within ourselves and the chips fell into place our fast start wasnt exactly intentional but we wont change it
4469007 we want medals for ourselves so the media doesnt add to the pressure were not in the olympic village so feel a bit like in a bubble isolated from the hubbub this is good but we look forward to experiencing the excitement next week we were successful in poznan but didnt sit on our laurels here after the days racing we do everyday stuff and we dont talk about rowing
4469008 the race went mostly as we had thought we rowed like madmen to try to get in front but felt in control and it was a well planned race we didnt need a big sprint in the last 500m well have to see the other semifinal times but our performance gives us hope for the final we didnt beat great britain but maintained contact with them throughout
4469009 its good to get into the final with a win in the semi
4469010 our goal was to get to the final we didnt mind which position in the first three we pushed and pulled to 1500m then didnt have to work so hard just keep the distance we were confident we had good signs in training and we feel good inside my wife is the bow of the greek lw2x i won bronze in 2006 she got silver in 2007 weve never medalled together before so hope to achieve that this time
4469011 there was not much thinking at the end of that race just concentrating on giving it all we had it wasnt a big deal to have to postpone our race until today we just had to switch off mentally yesterday and on again today the cheering from the crowd was awesome it made me think of my family im doing this for them and everyone i know its sad that the germans couldnt compete they are good but we always believed we could qualify at the start i said guys we rowed well in the warm up we are good we can do it
4469012 we didnt expect to win just hoped to be in the first three this is our best result in four years we didnt know what was happening it was like we had wings
4469013 we went out pretty hard particularly from 250m to 750m we knew it was going to be tough it was get out early and get out of trouble for which we paid the price later in the race but it worked our goal has always been to get into the final and its a relief because we knew we should be there this semifinal was more aggressive and less comfortable than the heat but we reminded ourselves of how we like to row in a headwind which we may have on sunday by the time we found out that racing was cancelled yesterday it was a relief because the energy kind of goes out of us weighing in twice in one day is difficult were the last ones from great britain to qualify for the a final thats 10 boats which is a massive step up from four in athens
4469014 we are satisfied because we are in the final but not so satisfied because we hoped to be closer to the first two today the wind made conditions more difficult yesterday we were tense and ready to race but the waiting has made us tired so we were not as ready today to win a medal is the dream of us all but it will be hard
4469015 the plan was to get in front early and we knew we had to get out hard we had something to prove estonia also performed well and we have 47 hours left before the final

4469029 i really think the pair of 66s by harrington on the weekend are the unbelievable story for this pga only andres romero beat him on saturday third round sunday and boo weekley tied him on sunday even with that his was really 132 strokes in one day on what many players said was the toughest course of the majors this year it maybe some time before we see that again the americans are going to have their hands full again for the ryder cup when they get here in louisville next month we can only hope that the four players azinger picks are playing red hot these next four to six weeks
4469030 i understand you accumulate points in order to qualify for the ryder cup having said that however having kenny perry on the u s ryder cup team is dead wrong he refused to go compete at the open championship and did not want to compete at the u s open in order to build his u s ryder cup points this guy does not deserve to be on the u s ryder cup team we can debate this for months but the facts speak for themselves paul azingers hands are tied too bad
4469031 i find it interesting that in tigers absence golf writers and anti tiger fans are constantly proclaiming that golf is fine without him it might be fine but for me it just isnt as much fun to watch although i will admit if it were tiger and not harrington that had pulled off the quad 6s in the final two rounds to win the tournament i probably would be saying how great it was myself unfortunately ive decided that sundays are now a golfing day and not a golf watching day kudos to harrington although it is very interesting that in both tournaments the leaders went backwards except harrington this is really where tiger separates himself from the rest of the golfers on tour he rarely goes backwards on sunday maybe its not just the tiger pressure that gets to guys like sergio and phil maybe theyre just not clutch players
4469032 i just had a comment on you not being sure if tiger will play in the olympics you should know better than that tiger will not allow someone else to win the first golf gold medal once thats done youre right he may never play again tiger is all about goals and records just like i knew he would win the u s open i knew he would have to win the first open on fathers day as a father there is no way tiger will not grab that first gold we just have to hope he doesnt play for the taiwanese team out of respect for his mom
4469033 let me get this right nancy lopez has to stop taking a physician prescribed blood pressure medication to avoid being in violation of the lpgas drug policy how stupid is that i suppose if you are on a drug that keeps you alive when you would otherwise be dead that constitutes a performance enhancing effect it is absurd than any player would have to put their health at risk to play in a tournament
4469034 it is hard for me to believe that no writer is directing scrutiny towards phils caddie bones he was the only person on earth that could and should have slapped phil silly over club selection at winged foot and we just witnessed nearly the same thing again it should never have happened in new york bones should have made the highlight films instead of phil by refusing to hand over the driver

4469037 the irony is that the subject of their veneration is a thorn in the side of the open source community stallman has long spread firefox or shred firefox

4469044 our results from a community practice setting serve to support although at a diminished levels the tvr benefits reported for clinical trials of des vs bare metal stents but also suggest a higher risk of death for both types of stents than found in clinical trials
4469045 our two year follow up period extends well beyond the time horizon of most clinical trials and our results demonstrate the sustainability of the reduction in tvr
4469046 although the current fda approved indication for des is limited to discrete de novo lesions in native vessels with reference vessel diameters of 2 5 to 3 5 mm our results indicate that the target vessel revascularization benefits associated with des vs bare metal stent occur in patients with one two and three vessel coronary artery disease and are greater in patients with multivessel disease vs those with single vessel disease

4469053 the internet opens up creativity past one size fits all mass measurements and priestly definitions and lets us not only find what we like but find people who like what we do
4469054 so lets assume that instead of a scarcity there is an abundance of talent and a limitless will to create
4469055 but it has been tamped down by an educational system that insists on sameness starved by a mass economic system that rewarded only a few giants and discouraged by a critical system that anointed a closed small creative class now talent of many descriptions and levels can express itself and grow
4469056 although we have also been affected by the global economy we are optimistic because our economy is still growing over 6 percent per year for the last eight quarters and the first quarter of this year we still grow at 6 4 percent and so we are cautious but we are optimistic about the situation
4469057 we are upbeat that our records show that we have been able to go after the terrorist activities terrorist cells and etcetera
4469058 the president also warns that there is always a possibility of attack from terrorist but we are determined to make sure that any terrorism based on whatever reason they may be we will go after them we will destroy them

4469060 ive been aware of mercy ships for many years but when i spent time in liberia and onboard the africa mercy i experienced for the first time the amazing difference they are making in the lives of suffering people in addition to performing free life changing surgeries on board they are also actively involved in creating a better society for the liberians through building clinics connecting with churches and teaching occupational skills to the people there are many organizations that are helping the poor of this world but i dont know of another group who is having the depth of impact that mercy ships is having in our world
4469061 what makes it even more amazing is that the fact that everyone on board the ship are volunteers people come from all over the world to serve help and bring hope to those who need it most some are there for a few weeks while others have been there for 20 plus years i watched surgeons and medical personnel change the world one life at a time i watched other volunteer crew members serve in housekeeping food services deck hands mechanical engineers etc each person had a passion about their work because of their love for christ and their love for others even those they had never met

4469083 the book is a compilation of all the innuendo and false rumors against obama
4469084 he accuses obama of wanting to weaken the military even though obamas campaign calls for adding 65 000 soldiers and 27 000 marines
4469085 corsi catalogs various allegations that have haunted obama on right wing blogs and anonymous e mails
4469086 corsi writes for world net daily a conservative web site whose lead headline thursday was astonishing photo claims dead bigfoot stored on ice

4469088 im putting this question forward im putting the evidence forward voters can make up their own minds
4469089 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4469090 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4469091 corsis book is off to a swift start and is no 1 on the new york times hardcover nonfiction best seller list even though obamas campaign would argue the book should be listed as fiction

4469095 the way the attack was conducted is very much similar to previous attacks throughout the years at el al counters therefore unfortunately given this history we presume that it may and would appear to be a terrorist attack
4469096 the terrorists deliberately chose the fourth of july to carry out their crime on the soil of the united states
4469097 there is no indication of any terrorism connection in this matter
4469098 i am not nor have i ever been a muslim especially an anti american one
4469099 does that mean that obama does not as emphatically deny that he was some other kind of muslim
4469100 i am not nor have i ever been a muslim particularly an anti american one
4469101 my father never went to prayer services except for big communal events i am absolutely certain that he did not go to services every friday
4469102 my whole family was muslim and most of the people i knew were muslim
4469103 sometimes lolo went to the mosque to pray but he rarely socialized with people rarely barry went to the mosque with lolo
4469104 senator obama has never been a muslim was not raised a muslim and is a committed christian who attends church in chicago
4469105 my grandfather who was kenyan converted to christianity then converted to islam my father never practiced he was basically agnostic and so other than my name and the fact that i lived in a populous muslim country for 4 years when i was a child i have very little connection to the islamic religion
4469106 when my mother remarried it was to an indonesian with an equally skeptical bent a man who saw religion as not particularly useful in the practical business of making ones way in the world and who had grown up in a country that easily blended its islamic faith with remnants of hinduism buddhism and ancient animist traditions
4469107 like many indonesians lolo followed a brand of islam that could make room for the remnants of more ancient animist and hindu faiths
4469108 obamas campaign aides have emphasized his strong christian beliefs and downplayed any islamic connection the illinois senator was raised in a secular household in indonesia by his stepfather and mother his chief spokesman robert gibbs said in a statement in january after false reports began circulating that obama had attended a radical madrasa or koranic school as a child to be clear senator obama has never been a muslim was not raised a muslim and is a committed christian who attends the united church of christ in chicago gibbs jan 24 statement said
4469109 i should have mentioned the koran mom didnt really emphasize the koran but we read little parts of it we did listen to morning prayers in indonesia
4469110 im not worried i dont want to deny islam i think its obviously very important that we have an understanding of islam a better understanding at the same time it has been erroneously attached to my brother the man has been a christian for 20 years
4469111 as the son of the muslim father senator obama was born a muslim under muslim law as it is universally understood it makes no difference that as senator obama has written his father said he renounced his religion likewise under muslim law based on the koran his mothers christian background is irrelevant
4469112 would compromise the ability of governments in muslim nations to cooperate with the united states in the fight against terrorism as well as american efforts to export democracy and human rights abroad
4469113 summarized available evidence suggests obama was born a muslim to a non practicing muslim father and for some years had a reasonably muslim upbringing under the auspices of his indonesian step father
4469114 the only connection ive had to islam is that my grandfather on my fathers side came from that country kenya but ive never practiced islam
4469115 i have never been a muslim other than my name and the fact that i lived in a populous muslim country for 4 years when i was a child indonesia 1967 71 i have very little connection to the islamic religion

4469151 the construction users roundtable curt has characterized the difficulties experienced in typical projects as artifacts of a construction process fraught by lack of cooperation and poor information integration the historical reasons for this dysfunctionality are many including a multiplicity of participants with conflicting interests incompatible cultures and limited access to necessary information
4469152 information is simply lost because of the nature of the handoffs between phases the design work gets dumbed down over a set of documents and handed out to the marketplace for bidding and there is a big drop off as that information becomes extracted and handed off then a whole new set of people work very hard to understand the project as theyre bidding it out yet only a small subset of those actually end up working on it and by the time it gets turned over to the people who have to build it in the field the trade contractors the fabricators the suppliers and the contractors who put it together theres another big drop off that group then builds an enormous amount of valuable information about every small detail of that building as they actually put it together but then a huge amount of that drops off again when it gets handed over in a simple set of as builts and some operations manuals to an owner
4469153 in theory an ipd project is carried out by a collaborative team of owner architect constructor and major consultants who share goals liabilities and rewards
4469154 key to ipd is the use of building information modeling bim software which enables a building to be constructed digitally and conflicts to be found and resolved well before construction begins but constructors must be involved early in design and traditional notions of design phasing change all parties must forego a certain degree of self interest in deference to project goals and create a new system of rewards and liabilities
4469155 integrated project delivery uses business structures practices and processes to collaboratively use the talents and insights of all participants in the design construction and fabrication process beginning when the project is first conceptualized the integrated process continues throughout the full life cycle of the facilities

4469158 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4469159 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
4469160 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4469161 i mean its just one point there is an umpire if im 100 percent sure about it i mean i will give it but im not sure
4469162 whatever is going to get him to have some sleep tonight then thats fine

4469167 we didnt have accurate values before the new database effort
4469168 thats been a big issue for years and years we dont have the resources to get accurate valuation on all these properties
4469169 why would they just get around to compiling the database now
4469170 telling the council twice a year for the last 20 years that we dont have that info
4469171 there is a filing requirement a local tax return basically theyre supposed to declare the valuation of their property
4469172 we did have similar findings where not all the nonprofits were submitting information
4469173 in the last 12 months ive personally given data to city council at least 20 times about what pilot payments are
4469174 to the extent we have good information that really helps everyone
4469175 i think it will make that whole pilot process more transparent
4469176 but if you are the director of assessing isnt it your responsibility already
4469177 we were going to file this as legislation and legislative aides came back and said its already on the books
4469178 for each assessable parcel the fair market value of such properties and the percentage of value received in lieu of taxes
4469179 the gist of the conversation was provide us with whats supposed to be provided
4469180 the services must be over and above what wentworth was providing prior to signing this agreement
4469181 a lot of institutions prefer doing something more visible in the community
4469182 the city wants these services the community wants these services but we need a balance to be struck

4469191 there are 2 300 families that are in the state shelter system
4469192 there are over 400 that are living in motels these are the highest most unprecedented numbers ever
4469193 the resources for the family are just catching up now but at the same time the economy with the food prices the heating prices the energy prices foreclosures its making it harder and harder for families
4469194 once they are working the doors are shut and youre not eligible for any type of assistance and thats not the way to go
4469195 with all the foreclosures the price and cost of food gas you have a lot of families that are working but are unable to feed their children theyre basically working paycheck to paycheck
4469196 fourteen dollars an hour is nothing it wont support your children
4469197 and they wont qualify for food stamps for child care for anything not even insurance what would you rather do work try to make ends meet and not have anything left over or stay in public assistance and take all the advantages
4469198 there are a lot of programs but they dont seem to be working ive been doing this for a long time and i havent seen any changes
4469199 they need to keep the people at the jobs theyre already at

4469428 it is a double delight for us we are released on the same day when india got freedom
4469429 there are around 400 fishermen in the landi jail many of them were sick and under nourished due to unhygienic condition of jail many fishermen occasional fall ill and were admitted to hospital but the mediocre medical treatment fail to prevent them from falling sick again he added
4469430 when i was arrested by pak coastal guards i was told that i was being sentenced to three months but i had to spend 18 months in jail
4469431 the government could save fishermen from passing through this agony by demarking the boundary in the sea he said his boat was also seized and now he would have to find some other job
4469432 we have arrived after our release but there are many like us who are still languishing in the jail they are given little food to eat and are forced to live in inhumane conditions which have also posed a threat of outbreak of some epidemic

4469436 this was a must win game for china an emotional game
4469437 i know that not many people will come so the chinese team needs my support
4469438 taiwan says this is purely a taiwanese team it has nothing to do with china but the chinese audience surely considers taiwan as part of china you can see the emotional frustrations
4469439 were here to back the taiwan team but there are some things that seem political
4469440 we had good directions and i know the area so we found it ok but you definitely couldnt ask a chinese how to get here
4469441 he come home with a ton of stuff so he told us how to get here so we could find our own things
4469442 at every games there is a bilateral agreement with the host and the deal we were able to strike with bocog was just our marks at just this venue and just to our invited guests
4469443 its opened to licensees donors the reason this place exists is for the people we serve
4469444 we cant sell their marks and they cant sell ours
4469445 its kind of a territory thing if you go to the superstore you wont see any
4469446 so this store is almost like a free trade zone its common were not allowed to sell in any of our other venues it would be disrespectful to our host but were comfortable with the deal we struck
4469447 be honest do you think its too big to wear around my neck
4469448 so for torino we doubled our space to 400 square feet then we doubled our sales from athens and actually sold out early and i vowed it would never happen again
4469449 we want people who come in wave one to have the same experience as people in wave four whatever you want after you journey all the way over here we want to have it on hand for you which is why weve gone to pretty great expense to air freight items over that we were running low on
4469450 i feel very honoured ive been in singapore for just over two years and can help it get an olympic medal at least a silver for the first time in 48 years
4469451 in a battle like that everyone is nervous so if you can just keep it cool youve got an advantage
4469452 all the pins are manufactured in china but no one understood youre supposed to trade them
4469453 my prediction is by the end of the games itll be a frenzy
4469454 they may not have a strong idea of how to do it yet
4469455 i buy pins myself and then trade them with foreigners
4469456 i like the ones with chinese themes that embody chinese culture i trade the pins i dont like
4469457 what is most enjoyable for me is meeting people especially natives
4469458 sometimes i can remember the story of who i traded with
4469459 it has played a great role whether its about banning disposable chopsticks or sorting trash everyone at the mention of the olympics said they should do a better job
4469460 it is very difficult to say at this point whether after the olympics chinese society will become more open
4469461 there is always back and forth struggles between the authorities and the grass roots and citizens
4469462 theres still a lot of tension and the grass roots need to push their work forward its never easy
4469463 many people including politicians and celebrities used to know little about the paralympics
4469464 there would be policies to even out the difference between economic development and environmental protection gradually but since the olympics is already here the government had no choice but to move the agenda ahead
4469465 the government has its usual practice whose nature wont be changed because of the olympics

4469667 duyvendak was hoofdredacteur van het krakersblad bluf in dat blad werd opgeroepen tot brandstichting en het maken van bommen er werd ook uitgelegd hoe je moest inbreken proletarisch winkelen en kraken duyvendak is in mijn ogen medeverantwoordelijk voor de zaken die vanuit die kleine bluf kern zijn gepleegd
4469668 ik heb veel te maken met collegas in het buitenland die zeer deskundig zijn in het bestrijden van terrorisme
4469669 het grote verschil met wijnand duyvendak is dat krista altijd met open vizier heeft gehandeld wij als sp en ook de kiezers hebben altijd geweten van haar acties we hebben er nooit geheimzinnig over gedaan bij wijnand duyvendak ligt dit anders ten eerste vind ik inbraak en intimidatie van mensen van een andere orde dan de protestacties van mijn partijgenote bovendien kende de kiezer zijn verleden niet groenlinks wist het wel maar de partij heeft ervoor gekozen om dit nu pas openbaar te maken dat vind ik een groot verschil met de sp
4469670 ik was verbaasd want ik had het niet verwacht geschrokken ook omdat hij in het verleden had gezegd dat hij daar absoluut niet bij betrokken was
4469671 ik ben zelf in de jaren tachtig net als veel andere groenlinksers betrokken geweest bij de kraakbeweging kraken is ook inbreken maar betekent dat vervolgens dat alles wat buiten de wet is ook onacceptabel is ik vind van niet
4469672 wij zijn natuurlijk een activistische partij maar bij acties moet je je gewoon aan de wet houden wil dat nou zeggen dat je bij een actie nooit de wet kan overtreden nee dat is niet waar een paar maanden geleden hebben wij als sp door het hele land gemeentehuizen bezet om de misstanden in de thuiszorg aan te kaarten dat is vreedzaam gegaan en met open vizier dat is belangrijk want daarmee erken je de democratische rechtsstaat maar feitelijk is het wel een overtreding van de wet

4469676 though mortgage mail volume remains far lower than a year ago this is the first uptick weve seen in two years

4469685 dupa cele intamplate in italia romanii in frunte cu basescu si organizatiile de romi nu au luat nicio pozitie este adevarat ca tiganii sunt diferiti cultural educational comportamental dar nu este normal sa fie renegati romanii au vrut sa arate ca sunt ei buni iar tiganii sunt rai dar sunt tigani si in germania si in spania dar nu sunt tratati ca la noi si apoi tiganii au doar o imagine proasta ei sunt gainarii romaniei insa faptele grave le fac tot romanii
4469686 este surpinzator ca a crescut numarul intolerantilor insa s ar putea explica prin faptul ca tinerii chiar si cei educati nu sunt suficient de informati si nici nu vor sa stie nimic despre o boala contagioasa cum ar fi sida nu vor sa stie cum se transmite sau daca stiu nu vor sa si faca griji

4469781 the two countries turkey and iran are culturally close and the two peoples share many similarities
4469782 you will be meeting with turkish president abdullah gul and prime minister erdogan tomorrow in istanbul what are your expectations and with what files are you going to turkey
4469783 salutations to you and to the great believing and patriotic people of turkey there are historical and cultural ties between the great faithful and patriotic turkish and iranian people you can find turkish and iranian relations in the depth of their history and in their sacred ties
4469784 at the invitation of my dear friend and brother abdullah gul i will be visiting turkey our sister and we will have discussions on many issues such as bilateral matters the cooperation between our two countries agreements the old ones that we signed and new ones that we will sign and on developing our relations
4469785 we will discuss terrorism and our joint effort to fight it we will talk about cooperation between iran and turkey as well as cooperation between us iraq and syria we are talking about global issues and we have dialogue as two influential countries we will have intense work to do with our brothers the turkish president and prime minister
4469786 iran s nuclear work is legal and legitimate there has been no deviation from legitimacy
4469787 both turkey and iran have a problem with terrorist organizations such as pkk and pjak and there is cooperation against terrorism will this visit lead to a military cooperation and possibly to an agreement between the two countries
4469788 unfortunately groups in all sorts of places in the world create security problems in our region too there are groups that want to advance their own goals we have for a long time successfully cooperated against those and as iran turkey and iraq we will have trilateral cooperation on these issues and we will make efforts to establish peace and stability in our region
4469789 there is a crisis on nuclear issues you are saying that you are enriching uranium for peaceful purposes and the u s and others have concerns that this might turn into a program for nuclear weapons in this crisis turkey attempted to facilitate a dialogue between iran and the u s and the west how do you see turkeys role in this matter turkey wants dialogue and peace yet does not want nuclear weapons how do you see that
4469790 our nuclear work is legal and legitimate and there has been no deviation from its legitimacy
4469791 i am pleased to say that the negotiations are going in a constructive manner therefore we dont have a nuclear problem right now but naturally turkey the turkish people and government our brothers are acting with sensitivity to iran and they have rightfully emphasized irans legitimate right to nuclear technology and this attitude stems from the friendship and brotherhood between our two peoples it is not that turkey is a mediator this would be a legal process but her efforts and recognition of iranian peoples rights as well as other peoples and turkeys rights to nuclear energy are important turkeys efforts to reduce tensions and for dialogue and for the dialogue to be constructive are something that we value of course
4469792 the best way is for the israelis to free and return all the palestinian lands and go away
4469793 another field or area where turkey is mediating or rather facilitating is between israel and syria what are your thoughts about this and if peace can be achieved between israel and syria would iran support such a peace
4469794 with syria we have good relations mr assad came to tehran and provided clarifications and information to us there are no conflict in the views between iran turkey and syria
4469795 it is tradition that heads of states who visit turkey visit ankara the capital and anitkabir ataturks mausoleum you will come to istanbul and anitkabir is not in your program is there any special reason why you would not visit anitkabir the turkish public is waiting to hear your reply on this matter
4469796 this visit is a working visit and istanbul is designated for it turkish authorities at this time are in istanbul and the timing was done with that in mind we the iranian people love the turkish people and i am certain that the turkish people love the iranian people very much
4469797 i want to stay on this subject a little more you are talking about the warmth and love between iranian and turkish peoples why is it that you would not make a short a half day visit in ankara and become the first iranian leader to visit anitkabir to show respect to ataturks resting place wouldnt this draw the two countries even closer and also i am curious to learn what does mustafa kemal ataturk mean for you
4469798 we have programmed this earlier turkey is a big country and it has a great people there are many places a president should go to and visit but our visit is a working visit we will have intense work to do and istanbul was offered we are coming to you as guests
4469799 so are you saying that had this been not a working visit and you had come to ankara you would visit anitkabir
4469800 you keep insisting on this but these are side issues and not important ones do not forget that the main purpose of this visit is talks analyses and the pursuit for the rights of our two peoples we will spend all our time on this
4469801 iranian culture and turkish culture is the culture of friendship and justice love of allah peace and brotherhood
4469802 mr president you said that turkey is a facilitating country even if not a true mediator both iran and turkey are important countries in the region in such crisis situations do you expect turkey to play more of a role like this and secondly before tomorrows visit what message would you like to convey to turkish people
4469803 my trip to turkey is a message of friendship to the turkish people
4469804 the progress and the dignity of turkish people as well as the progress and dignity of the iranian people is not a threat to anyone it is in the interest of everyone it means peace and security for the region iranian culture and turkish culture is the culture of friendship and justice love of allah peace and brotherhood and it is good of everyone
4469805 again on the israeli palestinian issue we know your stand very well today i researched a little your statements related to israel two things stand out to wipe israel out of the map and your repeated mention of pushing the jews into the sea you have a very harsh attitude im curious to know how will the peace come to the region with this harsh attitude or through some other initiatives what do you think what is the solution for the region
4469806 as i said earlier the zionist regime is based on lies there was no regime like this in our region the people of this regime are brought to this region and the people of this region have been exported out of there this is a great cruelty
4469807 if in europe some wrong has been done against the jews it does not mean that muslim palestinians or christians should be made to pay this was exploitation a way of putting pressure on the people of this region
4469808 our solution is a referendum on israel let the palestinian people make its choices whoever is palestinian should have a say
4469809 since this israeli regime came here it is killing murdering people
4469810 as you know the soviet regime was eliminated from the map how was it eliminated because the people wanted this with the vote of the people and it must be accepted that the vote of the people votes should rule
4469811 i am really amazed that the big powers that always talk about human rights and democracy when it comes to palestine they side with dictatorship they side with murder
4469812 because this regime is dishonorable and every day that this regime lives it increases the weight of the files of the big powers naturally the murders of this regime are being added on the accounts of the western nations
4469813 therefore these western nations must separate from this zionist regime they have nothing to gain nothing to benefit the expense is more than its worth
4469814 therefore these western nations must separate their accounts from this zionist regime
4469815 they have to resolve this problem and the way to do it to ask for the free opinion of the people let them prepare a referendum this is not a difficult task we can help the u n let them prepare a referendum everybody will be happy and this situation wars and oppression will be eliminated our method for resolution is very clear
4469816 in turkey people love nasrallah everybody loves him people who love freedom love him he destroyed the myth of the zionist regime
4469817 there is talk recently about the rise of iran in the middle east and some countries in the region are concerned about this rise about this power it is said that you have influence over hizbullah in lebanon hamas in palestine some countries consider these terrorist organizations posters of nasrallah posters are seen in the streets of tehran how do you view these two organizations what do they mean to you and are you really supporting them
4469818 seyyid hassan is a hero today for he destroyed the myth of the zionist regime of course we know that the zionists dont like hassan nasrallah and those who support them do not like him they are disturbed by him
4469819 but we and all the countries in the region support the territorial integrity of lebanon we are in contact with all the lebanese groups we encourage them all to unity and to cooperation iran had an input in their reaching an agreement any fragmentation in the countries of the region benefits only the enemy we are making every effort to maintain unity
4469820 iran is a big power so is turkey but our power is for peace and friendship we never want to attack others or occupy lands of others we respect all peoples
4469821 their security makes us happy our strength gives a message of peace and friendship and justice iran is historically a great country so is turkey irans and turkeys power is for the good of everyone of course the zionists do not want that but this is not important
4469822 the zionist regime cannot challenge iran even in their wildest imagination the sooner they leave the region the better it is for them the longer they stay the worse it is for their supporters
4469823 i would like to expand to the global perspective irans nuclear program created problems with the u s things are tense and we saw that the geneva talks did not bear fruit at that time israel conducted an exercise with 100 fighter planes following that you conducted an exercise in iran with shahab 3s what does this mean are tensions rising is diplomacy failing and you are showing each other your muscles how should we read all this
4469824 your question has several parts one is the nuclear issue we think that the nuclear issue is on the right path the talks were good and they will continue we think of them as a good beginning and now it is being followed up we are not thinking that it was a failure nobody thinks that
4469825 naturally the negotiations were intense they have been trying to solve this for the past 30 years it cant be resolved in one session everybody knows that this nuclear issue is an excuse the real issue is that these big powers do not want our people to advance this is the real matter
4469826 but now negotiations have begun and it is good we are not going towards a worse situation this was one part of your question
4469827 as for the zionists if they have carried out exercises it is their business
4469828 as you also know the zionist regime is breaking apart
4469829 had they realized their dream their existence could have been of value then great powers would have supported them but in what shape is this regime now it is building a wall around itself in order to survive this means their devastation this means their annihilation
4469830 it israel has no existence their existence is about frightening attacking occupation and exploitation now they cannot do this they must examine themselves they do not exist
4469831 the sooner they leave the region the better it is for them the longer they stay the worse it is for their supporters the western countries should not support them israel that much
4469832 the life of this regime has come to an end they brought some pitiful people wanderers to there and gave them the palestinians homes and these people are now hostages of that regime open the doors and they will all run away they the zionists shut the doors
4469833 should not damage the character of the great american people by supporting a murderous regime
4469834 what about american support when it is about israel america gets involved what do you think about that
4469835 america gives support and will continue to do so america does all sorts of things that are not honest generally it does not get any results from what it does we advise them not to do this it is against the good of the american people they should not damage the personality and character of the great american people for a murderous regime our advice to them is not to support them israel for the good of everybody america europe and the middle east of course this way friendships will be built
4469836 elections in the u s are near do you think americas attitude will change with a new president do you prefer obama or mccain
4469837 for me it doesnt matter it is the americans right it is their elections i wish they had free elections in america then many different people would come forth and americans would have choices other than the two parties
4469838 what is important is what kind of attitude the new administration will demonstrate
4469839 i think that wise persons in america are well aware of this need for change
4469840 whatever government comes it must leave the middle east china asia or africa and look to its own states if it takes pity on the american people if it really wants to work for the american people wise people in america have already come to this conclusion it does not matter who will come but what he will do
4469841 i once again realized that in essence there is not much difference between ahmadinejad former israeli prime minister benjamin natanyahu and u s president george bush it seems as if all the hawks in the world have united
4469842 the best way is for them the israelis to free and return all the palestinian lands and go away
4469843 iran s nuclear work is legal and legitimate there has been no deviation from legitimacy
4469844 as i said earlier the zionist regime is based on lies

4469869 when you have a long term uptrend excesses build up along the way we are witnessing a correction
4469870 demand for commodities will remain at a high level in countries like china and india if we see a serious worldwide recession then we will see the end of the commodities boom
4469871 commodities cant be completely immune to the fact that there is a global slowdown taking place

4469874 the idea is to tell moms who are breastfeeding to take it a step forward to help other moms who cannot immediately breastfeed
4469875 sometimes they pixilated olympias face as if to protect her identity at other times it was her bottom and other times there was a great big black square over her front so there was automatically a kind of criminality imputed to the image that this image is so dreadful that the public must not be allowed to see it in its nakedness
4469876 to the monthly it seemed that the matter of bill henson hadnt really been resolved the art community needed to inspect itself and consider the weight of the charges against it it also seemed that in an edition devoted to this subject it would be inappropriate not to have it illustrated in some way
4469877 but we adopted the position that the image was good enough to be seen in 2003 and if we gave in to this we would be saying from now on there will be no more pictures of naked children we would have to take down the baptismal image from the mantelpiece in orthodox families for instance we would have to do a purge
4469878 so she went out and she said exactly that incidentally her sound bites were the really priceless ones that went all over the world this so called naked child berating the australian prime minister for the narrowness of his mind made international headlines
4469879 people need to do their homework especially if they are national leaders the first bit of homework is to discover that the overwhelming proportion of sexual crimes against children is perpetrated by people known to the family these are people who have no need for pictures and it seems to me that if artists cant provide some kind of leadership in making distinctions about pictures artists are irrelevant in our community
4469880 people are somehow being censored and the government is engaged in keeping people from expressing themselves outside of governmentally approved structures such as my work
4469881 he felt threatened and went to the police twice and when i made it public that i was the creator i was arrested for two days and have been prosecuted since for threatening a dutch politician with death
4469882 i will never talk about my work as being part of my freedom of expression because i think this whole term and concept has been befouled by politicians who have very different aims in using this term than i do as an artist
4469883 they claim this space to be a freethinkers space and find it necessary to have this space in parliament what they are basically saying is that it doesnt exist anywhere else anymore they are the ones who should assure that these spaces exist not the ones who should declare the last space where freedom of expression can happen is within their own parliament in the backroom of their office this is very contradictory wilders supports all kinds of artists if they are linked to his message because theyve been censored and attacked by muslims but the moment i actually attack his movement he feels threatened and wont even acknowledge the works being art
4469884 you can never trust the government to take care of the space you can use as a civilian we can claim this space anytime we want but we have to continue to confront to claim and mark our own territories
4469885 i would say there are of course a lot of art works that dont address their issue well by abusing or taking on an opportunist stance towards other living creatures there can be boundaries theres a chinese artist for example who cooked and ate a baby human foetus a few years ago as a private performance in his apartment and there was a lot of controversy about this for him it was about the moral code in the official code theres no official boundary on eating other people just on killing or hurting other people but not eating so he was saying this was not included in a governmental framework but for me the discussion was befouled by the question whether he was eating a real baby or not the point hes trying to make is interesting but the form the way he formulated it as private snuff movie like material did not do it properly and didnt create a context in which people could go beyond their anger and emotions
4469886 you do not name the dalai lama number one state terrorist especially as a foreign artist and you do not talk about mao on any level but on a positive one and as a foreign visitor not at all
