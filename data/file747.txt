7470000 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7470001 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7470002 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7470003 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7470004 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7470005 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7470006 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7470007 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
7470008 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
7470009 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7470010 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7470011 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7470012 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7470013 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7470014 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7470015 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7470016 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7470017 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7470018 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7470019 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7470020 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7470021 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7470022 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7470023 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7470024 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7470025 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7470026 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7470027 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7470028 information architecture is not about surface glamor its about mission critical infrastructure and infrastructure has widespread and long term impact the ripples of our designs spread outwards affecting the work of interface designers programmers authors and eventually users as we design the legacy information architectures of tomorrow we should consider our responsibility to the big here and the long now
7470029 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7470030 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7470031 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7470032 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7470033 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7470034 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7470035 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7470036 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7470037 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
7470038 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7470039 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7470040 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7470041 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7470042 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7470043 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7470044 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7470045 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7470046 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7470047 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7470048 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7470049 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7470050 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7470051 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7470052 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7470053 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7470054 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7470055 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7470056 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7470057 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7470058 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7470059 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7470060 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7470061 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7470062 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7470063 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7470064 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7470065 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7470066 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7470067 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7470068 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7470069 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7470070 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7470071 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7470072 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7470073 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7470074 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7470075 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7470076 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7470077 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7470078 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7470079 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7470080 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7470081 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7470082 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7470083 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7470084 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7470085 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7470086 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7470087 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7470088 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7470089 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government

7470126 my job is if the city council comes to us with a piece of legislation we will look at it we will consider it and well make what i hope is an informed judgment into what is in the best interest in the city
7470127 the city council has the right to change term limits if they want to
7470128 i sense movement on both the speakers side and the mayors side
7470129 the thawing however has begun one insider who spoke with her said quinn is already speculating about how to round up enough council votes to extend term limits with a simple resolution
7470130 i will not support the repeal or change of term limits through any mechanism and i will oppose aggressively any attempt by anyone to make any changes in the term limits law
7470131 that would be a tough hurdle for quinn who announced last year it wouldnt be fair to overturn term limits through legislation
7470132 i believe that overruling the will of new yorkers would be anti democratic and anti reform

7470144 it is more about him mendis if he bowls a bad ball then punish him and build up pressure on him if you continue to defend him then you know he will also be on top
7470145 it is very important that whenever he bowled a bad bowl we will get runs out of them so that you know he mendis gets under a bit of pressure
7470146 i think s badrinaths effort was great he took on mendis he went for a big shot but that is what you need to do at times to put some pressure on the bowler till now he mendis was never under any sort of pressure so he was bowling at his best
7470147 it is better to have a contributory effort while winning a match but we are not relying on one individual
7470148 if you will have the privilege of getting individual performances like zaheer played well in the last match in this match also he has bowled well but it is always better to win in the sense when it is a team effort and every one enjoys no body had a bad day it is good overall if we can continue to do this way
7470149 when you are playing with a extra batsman you need to score over 250 runs to put pressure on the opposition team
7470150 so we have to see which bowler is bowling well on a particular day and use him hopefully we will not have a day when all our part time bowlers of them bowl badly and then there is pressure on the skipper
7470151 on these sort of wickets we need to click especially the top order batsmen one out of the three or four batmen has to carry the innings and others can rotate around him then only we can achieve big scores in games like this
7470152 well that was the thought but nothing could be done about it when we could score only 237 runs
7470153 there was a bit of worry for us in the middle because we had to use the 5th bowler which was a part time bowler but yuvraj singh bowled well he was turning the ball and that really worked for us
7470154 of course as we saw in this game that if you have a partnership going and then it becomes very difficult to contain the batsmen the outfields are fast
7470155 the ball comes on even if it turns later you can go after the fast bowlers and the spinners so it is very important to have partnership in the middle and save wickets for the death over
7470156 i personally feel that to have a fifth specialist bowler is a luxury
7470157 we have more than 400 bird species in the country so we have decided to come out with this new package for foreign tourists

7470160 they are likely the ones to create problems even after a final agreement would be forged between the government and the milf so the campaign against them is intended to remove the obstacles to the peace process
7470161 we wish for all insurgents to turn their swords into ploughshares their arms to farms we ask all sectors to be with us including our brothers in the oic

7470212 they said bishop is going be the starter and he is the future of their franchise
7470213 everyone who plays pro sports gets to a point where they say okay im not going back
7470214 so yes it did enter my mind there were a lot of times i sat around thinking about different things but kept those things to myself
7470215 theres just too much talk around it people started taking sides and when they do that its not good for team play so we decided we had to make a choice
7470216 my vision of how it would work didnt work so well
7470217 we need to solidify and say this is our starting quarterback
7470218 i know i was a true idealist when i talked about having two quarterbacks im more of a realist at this point
7470219 nothing against kerry but i wasnt calling plays for kerry or throwing passes for kerry
7470220 everyone on this high a level of football knows what they have to do if im on the sideline thats part of sports and thats not a good reason why toronto is 3 5
7470221 as a quarterback you know youre one play away from being in there but that turned into three or four games away there were opportunities for me to play but they gave kerry money up front and they felt he was the answer but you get what you pay for and toronto is 3 5 right now
7470222 i think rich is a hell of a defensive co ordinator a job stubler held from 2003 to 2207
7470223 hes placed in a situation where i dont know if those were all his calls

7470255 ich hatte heuten einen sehr guten start und konnte mich so gleich zu beginn absetzen mit dem fahrzeug das mir mein team zur verf gung gestellt hat ging das auch problemlos der wagen war konstant bis zum ende des rennens dass wir hier in valencia schnell unterwegs sind haben wir gestern schon gemerkt wir haben wirklich eine sehr gute abstimmung gefunden die meisterschaft habe ich heute um lediglich einen punkt verpasst das ist schade aber ich denke dass wir nun in spa einen grund haben werden um zu feiern
7470256 mein team hat heute einen fantastischen job gemacht ich hatte eines der am besten abgestimmten fahrzeuge die ich je in einem rennen gefahren bin im letzten drittel ging es dann auch richtig gut nach vorne das war ein traum das einzige problem war dass es extrem hei war ich bin einfach nur gl cklich ber den zweiten platz ein gro es dankesch n an meine mannschaft
7470257 das rennen war heute extrem hart die bedingungen hier sind burtal besonders die hitze macht einem zu schaffen zudem musste ich richtig k mpfen um stefan zu berholen als ich vorbei war hatte jeroen schon einen enormen vorsprung es gab keine chance mehr an ihn heran zu fahren schlie lich musste ich noch j rg vorbeilassen er war einfach viel schneller als ich ein weiterer podiumserfolg im supercup ist jedoch eine tolle sache es w re sch n wenn mir dies auch in spa gelingt
7470258 wir haben alle an den fernsehschirmen mitgefiebert und waren sicherlich entt uscht dass unsere hammerwerferinnen nicht an die zu anfang der saison gezeigten leistungen ankn pfen konnten kamghe gaba ist ein sensationelles rennen gelaufen schade dass es mit der staffel nicht zum erreichen des finals gereicht hat trotzdem geb hrt unseren athleten gro er respekt und anerkennung f r ihre leistungen alleine die teilnahme an den olympischen spielen ist doch mit das gr te was ein sportler in seiner laufbahn erreichen kann
7470259 kamghe ist derzeit in bestechender form und wird die gelegenheit nutzen sich nochmals auf internationalem parkett zu pr sentieren mit seiner zeit aus dem staffelvorlauf h tte er vermutlich die olympianorm f r den einzelstart in peking geknackt

7470296 prior research has suggested that the trend in strokes was increasing but our study shows declining incidence in stroke for non diabetic men both for first and recurrent stroke and in recurrent strokes in non diabetic women
7470297 the impressive decline in smoking and large decreases in cholesterol levels and to a lesser degree blood pressure levels in the population of northern sweden may have contributed to the declining incidence in both diabetic and non diabetic subjects over the study period
7470298 on the other hand we found more recurrent events among diabetic subjects than non diabetic subjects indicating a need for even more intensive secondary prevention among diabetic patients
7470299 the fact that patients with diabetes to a great extent had favorable time trends similar to those of non diabetics is particularly interesting considering that diabetic patients with heart attack from the same population did not show any positive trends over the 19 year study
7470300 even if there is the necessary chasm between the media and government in the perennial debate about what constitute the public or national interest and so on at least the debate must proceed in openness and fairness
7470301 we do believe that both government and media are called to act responsibly in a well run state this also applies to public relations marketing and advertising interests that can have such a powerful influence in society
7470302 it is i would suggest important for the media to do various things to professionalize and perfect their craft such as improving training methods broadening the scope of specialist and in depth writing and research and retaining skilled and experienced practitioners within the profession
7470303 and physically get around the continent identifying the successes and reverses so as to reflect what is really happening on the ground
7470304 there is particular anger around what is seen as the impunity enjoyed by some governments in their perceived or actual actions against journalists and editors i am also aware of the feeling among african editors that libel and similar laws are used to deal with a media that is seen as uncomplimentary to the authorities

7470312 my team certainly is in fact most of the american reality shows are dancing with the stars survivor the apprentice its basically because we had such little budgets back in britain that weve done everything and we do it all for next to nothing so they let us bring our people over here
7470313 for the first season of american idol we used american producers they gave us i came in one day and the three judges
7470314 well that monkey and that producer left the production that morning they just didnt get it we just believe were gonna make a good show or were not bring in my brits we brought in our supervising producer from pop idol hes got our humour we send ourselves up all the time its the only way we know we never take it seriously
7470315 i wasnt involved in the us pitch process simon fuller lythgoes partner at 19tv came out here and did every single major broadcaster and some wouldnt even take his meetings but think about what it was its a talent show it hadnt already been made in the uk there werent any figures for it the idea is were gonna go round the country and find a pop singer i would have turned it down myself if i hadnt known any better if i hadnt seen popstars
7470316 a shrimp yes but with an enormous talent very creative especially for an executive dangerously creative almost a real maverick but give me that every time if youre willing to accept failure in order to achieve success then mikes your man
7470317 the backers all said oh i dont think americans are gonna wanna see bad singers we couldnt persuade anyone for ages
7470318 we love to watch people like that in england we make them stars because weve always supported losers like frank bruno when he won his championship we dumped him when he was running about dressed up like juliet or bashing a giant hp sauce bottle we loved him or eddie the eagle its hard to explain that over here but we were right
7470319 im very passionate about so you think you can dance its how i started after all you can go through all the moral side of it its great to see all the kids putting all their energy into fighting each other with dancing instead of with their fists anything that brings dance back into the culture and that doesnt make dancers automatically look gay and effeminate
7470320 its funny i said on so you think you can dance that i really liked dancing with the stars and andrea wong over at abc was all suspicious why did he say that about our show why and theyre like no i think he genuinely likes it but i genuinely like the show well im not knocked out with heather mills taking off her leg she had a sneaker on one leg a ballroom shoe on the other and she took the whole leg off rather than swapping the shoes and they they used the leg as the foreground for her rehearsal shots
7470321 we wanted for the better but it turned out to be like always
7470322 there is a good deal of anecdotal evidence that behaviour particularly that of children and young people is being criminalised which arguably would be better dealt with informally school related misbehaviour for example and in previous times was
7470323 the increased use of pre court summary justice is one of the most important elements in the governments strategy for modernising the criminal justice system
7470324 the implementation of the strategy has received virtually no research inspectoral or parliamentary scrutiny
7470325 the trend towards pre court summary justice should more incisively be scrutinised to ensure that justice is being meted out fairly and effectively
7470326 not only are serious offenders escaping real justice due to the reliance on spot fines but as this report shows many people who should be dealt with informally are being criminalised

7470350 wir m chten die materialien auch in der f rdertechnik anwenden der unterschied zum klassischen faserseil besteht darin dass die seile nicht nur hohe statische belastungen ertragen sondern kontinuierlich gebogen und umgelenkt werden
7470351 wir verwenden vor allem materialien wie dyneema vectran und technora das sind hochmodulare faserwerkstoffe mit gestreckten molek lketten die nach dem strecken thermisch fixiert werden diese sind teilweise deutlich fester als stahl und haben viele positive eigenschaften
7470352 mit der entwicklung hochmodularer faserwerkstoffe ende des 20 jahrhunderts er ffneten sich viele neue anwendungsm glichkeiten denen jedoch aufgrund des neuheitsgrades ein gro es forschungsdefizit gegen bersteht deshalb gibt es keine geeignete pr ftechnik zu kaufen so dass wir das meiste selber konstruieren mussten und auch kaum auf erfahrungswerte zur ckgreifen konnten
7470353 nur wenn wir selber seile produzieren wissen wir genau was wir untersuchen au erdem werden f r tests nur kurze seilst cke ben tigt jedoch produziert uns kein unternehmen nur 50 meter eines seiles
7470354 mit dieser ausstattung k nnen wir alle wesentlichen eigenschaften von faserseilen untersuchen
7470355 die seile sind schon mal mehrere wochen im pr fstand bis sich etwas zeigt aber der durchlauf hinsichtlich materialverbrauch und zeit ist sehr gut optimiert
7470356 die bisherigen ergebnisse zeigen dass die seile so wie sie jetzt sind nur wenig f r den einsatz in der f rdertechnik geeignet sind trotzdem stimmen uns die ergebnisse optimistischer als wir es erwartet h tten denn es muss bedacht werden dass die materialien aus einem ganz anderen einsatzgebiet kommen mit der richtigen modifizierung haben sie ein gro es potenzial f r unsere anwendungen
7470357 in einem ersten anwendungsbezogenen projekt arbeiten wir beispielsweise an einer gewichtsreduzierten seilwinde f r hubschrauber au erdem planen wir in kooperation mit einem anderen unternehmen faserseile in krananlagen zu testen
7470358 i came on for harry at half time and bobby murdoch played a pass to give me an early touch to calm any nerves but i allowed the ball to run under my foot and it went out for a throw in
7470359 but thankfully bobby didnt give me a hard time he could see i was nervous and told me it was ok his encouragement boosted my confidence
7470360 football was the easy option kenny and i thought the real world was too hard
7470361 mr stein was an imposing figure i was in awe when i first met mr stein and i thought i was all through my playing career
7470362 he meant something to every player whether or not they liked him as a person he was loved for what he did for their careers
7470363 how big an influence was he how long is a piece of string he was a nice man a nice nice man you dont remember the things your dad did to you that were bad you remember the nice things like christmas or your birthday maybe mr stein could give you stick but it was forgotten outside the dressing room he taught me so much he hurried things up for me
7470364 but it was sean who wanted to sign me and kenny and i owe him a lot to this day whenever i meet sean i want to thank him
7470365 at the start of the season it looked as if i didnt have a football future i suffered an ankle injury which kept me out of the world cup and i was told i wouldnt play again now i was the skipper of the title winners it was some turn around
7470366 my bottle just went in the box i just couldnt score
7470367 i was late for the second one unfortunately i only realised that when i was in mid air its always like that when you are late
7470368 you cant tackle now and i do see more young guys copying professional players by feigning injury we used to laugh at the italians for doing it now we copy them
7470369 my tackling was good because my timing was good okay not every tackle was inch perfect but i never went in to hurt anybody
7470370 wee louie macari didnt want to go on because it was a cold day at brockville but i said i felt okay and then i collapsed as i tried to leave the dressing room i woke up in an ambulance on my way to hospital
7470371 you would be allowed one hard tackle at the start of the game but arthur could take it and when you had the ball he would tackle you davie cooper was tough to pin down but if you tackled him hard he would drift back deeper where he was less dangerous arthur just kept coming
7470372 he came through you like a ton of bricks there was never any going through the motions for danny he was consistently phenomenal the greatest player i played with
7470373 a lot of players at international level do have big egos but dannys reaction that day was the act of a true professional
7470374 he must have been shattered when jock announced the starting 11 in a team meeting a few hours before the game
7470375 but as soon as jock finished listing the team and addressing the squad danny was the first player on his feet to roar encouragement to the others
7470376 id never seen that side of danny he was not an out and out motivator because he preferred to set his examples quietly and was enormously respected by the rest of the players as a result
7470377 football is a team game but were still all selfish at times and in that situation every player was sitting nervously hoping hed be picked
7470378 danny was a fixture in the side and must have been so disappointed not to be listed
7470379 but his first thought was for the team and i will never forget his reaction

7470457 we took him in for x rays and the x rays were negative so were optimistic
7470458 id hesitate to day because i havent talked to bud carpenter or the doctors but we know nothing was broken
7470459 he got wacked by something and it was either one of them or one of us that hit him
7470460 i think it might have been one of us which is nobodys fault it happens

7470467 its true in london and in the big cities of the north it is connected to the new poverty
7470468 england is one of the richest countries in the world the people im talking about have enormous televisions a lot bigger than my own the latest in mobile phones cars and they go and get drunk in pubs at the weekend
7470469 i found the cooking of people living in the slums of soweto more diverse than ours
7470470 the only people who drink more than us are the irish and the scottish
7470471 in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote london
7470472 this is a general three minute video of london in which an artwork by marcus harvey very fleetingly appears
7470473 the video is not for general public use and has been used many times over the last few years to show to the tourism trade
7470474 there has never been a complaint made about the video up until this point
7470475 however if any offence has been caused we will withdraw it from use with immediate effect
7470476 in my opinion the benchmark shanghai composite index could realistically hit 6 000 points in 2008
7470477 the value of the a share market would then be 24 trillion yuan 3 17 trillion u s dollars equivalent to 96 percent of chinas gross domestic product
7470478 we can achieve more profit from wiser investments of the reserves
7470479 we are now in the stage of forming this new company
7470480 i travel around the country and around the world and find that you can change the name of the organization the location and the type of structure and you will still have the same issues leaders not leading effectively
7470481 i call the training building high performance teams but no one can produce effective teams without fine tuned leadership skills i teach business executives how an orchestra conductor brings out the best skill of the players that have been hired the conductor is a dictator however if the conductor hires a good oboe player then its best to let that oboe player use his or her skill rather than tell then how to play the oboe

7470485 there is no way of knowing today what effect this review will have on the codes and what bee requirements if any will be enacted in response to the outcome of the review
7470486 as a result some corporates have been reluctant to rely on the continuing consequences principle as such reliance may put them at a disadvantage if new bee requirements are enacted in 2017
7470487 if companies had more confidence that they would get credit for deals already done they might have concluded shorter term transactions which is ultimately better for bee investors as it could allow them to realise benefits sooner
7470488 the once empowered always empowered principle appears to have been very pro investee company as their bee status would not be lost in spite of an actual change in their ownership structure
7470489 what bullshit this bee story has turned into there are too few black diamonds to go round all the same couple of names they sell shares when they are high then buy shares with the money in another prospective bee target sa business becomes like carry trade just as easy to lose bee status as to obtain it bee creates an enormous deal of confusion and instability and is yet another reason for professional whites to emigrate its simply impossible to deal with greedy dumb unscrupulous blacks did no one see this coming
7470490 so as long as its good who really cares how many there are besides most of those good fps are on the ps3 too like cod4 and that doesnt take away from my enjoyment of it
7470491 that seems to be trend these days isnt it mate
7470492 if it was me obviously id like every game to be on all platforms so id only have to buy one perhaps that could happened in the future but right now it doesnt
7470493 i see where you misunderstood me here im not advocating one platform there could be multiple platforms with all these unique features but games in generation would work or even just be released on all of them as an example say i wanted to buy the wii for its control and price id buy that and be able to get the whole library of games on it obviously the problem would be hardware but if there was a standard much like with the dvd i think it could work out fine i dont know could happened probably wont id like it to because i own the 360 and the ps3 and i desperately want to get rid of one but there are like three exclusives on each that pull me towards keeping them
7470494 so as long as its good who really cares how many there are besides most of those good fps are on the ps3 too like cod4 and that doesnt take away from my enjoyment of it

7470519 the world food programme was issuing rice flour dhal sugar and oil but now that the number of displaced has risen we are only distributing rice as the stocks supplied to us are insufficient
7470520 we are expecting more supplies within the coming weeks but we are not sure when exactly the food convoys would come
7470521 the world food programme was issuing rice flour dhal sugar and oil but now that the number of displaced has risen we are only distributing rice as the stocks supplied to us are insufficient
7470522 we are expecting more supplies within the coming weeks but we are not sure when exactly the food convoys would come
7470523 after extensive discussions and a frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan to take part in the icc champions trophy
7470524 we are ready to hold the champions trophy as we are the alternative venue for the tournament
7470525 we wanted the selection panel to be completely transparent and unbiased
7470526 thats like leaving the tap running and pouring 40 trillion litres of water into the garbage can enough water to meet the household needs of 500 million people
7470527 i was very surprised with the high numbers but it catches everybodys attention
7470528 so there is a distribution problem but this also reflects the maldistribution of water
7470529 curbing these losses and improving water productivity provides win win opportunities for farmers business ecosystems and the global hungry
7470530 we have avoided the worst and a ceasefire has been effected as well as a pull out by russian troops from georgia
7470531 one must deal with the issue politically as the moment demands
7470532 indians played a major role in the last general election hindraf played a major role but these heroes of hindraf were not recognised they should be honoured we dont expect victory but 15 per cent of the votes is like total rejection we must send a strong signal to the party that it has to be racially representative
7470533 part of the problem could be financial promoters have been charging as much as 250 for a ticket and with credit crunch sliding towards recession on both sides of the atlantic its not surprising only the most die hard fans are prepared to fork out
7470534 doing it with the love of my life wonderful to have pa my father in law and my mother in law with us its a real honor

7470537 my personal view is that a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in this is very much a personal view at this stage if we want to retain our position as a constructive eu member state we cannot simply sit on our hands as some would have us do and keep saying that no means no
7470538 minister roche is not calling for a second referendum to be put that would not be a fair reflection the government is instead following the steps it said it would take in the wake of the referendum outcome
7470539 we now need to take a hard look at our situation within the eu
7470540 we have to recognise however that all other member states 26 sovereign democratic parliaments are likely to have ratified the treaty by the end of the year this will leave ireland in an isolated position
7470541 in the view of the other member states we will be preventing the eu from equipping itself to deal with the many political and economic challenges facing todays europe
7470542 not an inch is not a policy that has much to commend it in a dynamic europe that wants to move forward
7470543 we need to deal with the referendum result step by step we should not jump to hasty conclusions or exclude any options
7470544 we have to explore all possible solutions we cannot exclude the possibility that at some stage and in the right circumstances it may be necessary to consult the people once again
7470545 we had lunch with him yesterday he went to the markets did a bit of shopping and was in great form hes the team captain first into the ring and last out and hell do the business dont you worry
7470546 its a fine line between winning and losing in this game
7470547 i thought it would have been a bit fairer today with the olympics but thats the nature of the beast but were all so proud of him
7470548 he never looked down he was positive we saw him kissing the gold medal going ching ching with the silver medal on it and thats kenneth for you he is a fantastic young man

7470552 consumers were offered a deal that appeared too good to be true because it was
7470553 the defendants advertisements specifically neglected to mention that the terms of the promotion as sweet as they may have sounded were good for only a short period after which consumers may or may not have been eligible for those similar terms upon reapplication
7470554 if pollen is a trigger for your asthma or allergies festival goers are advised to check pollen counts of the region of any outdoor events they are attending and also to ask someone else to pitch their tent as pollen levels may be distributed by this action
7470555 it was almost a no win situation for obama in some ways
7470556 by putting clintons name into nomination it seems to many people that theres still a split in the campaign on the other hand so many of clintons supporters want her name placed in nomination because of the historic nature of her campaign so if it didnt happen then those women would have another reason to not support barack obama
7470557 many people i know feel that this is going to be another hillary and bill clinton dog and pony show and i agree with them
7470558 we know that the clintons believe the candidacy actually was theirs and obama took it away with such things as race letting john edwards hide his secret affair through iowa and playing a sexist campaign obama had no choice but the clintons should have more class than to butt in on him when ted kennedy did that at a democratic convention jimmy carter the incumbent lost the election
7470559 i think he obama needs to reassure a lot of americans who dont pay much attention to politics that hes up for the job that hes ready to take over as hillary used to say on day one
7470560 and his choice of a running mate will help to some extent im sure
7470561 for him to win hes really got to reach out to social conservatives but still yet remain that maverick
7470562 i think its more of an advantage than a lot of the political operatives claim to go second in the conventions
7470563 its a great advantage the party in the white house has the opportunity to see what that challenger party is going to do in terms of running mate in terms of platform and the way theyre positioning themselves
7470564 theres a lot of people already speaking on behalf of consumers and what they may or may not do
7470565 when it comes to food consumers vote with their wallets at checkout not on public opinion surveys id really like to see someone step up and offer consumers the choice there have been enough serious outbreaks of foodborne illness in fresh produce that the interest in irradiated spinach and lettuce should be strong
7470566 the goal of this nation wide challenge is to inspire students to succeed in the critical areas of science technology engineering and mathematics
7470567 these areas will play a critical part in preparing the next generation of kansas workers for twenty first century jobs
7470568 noaa is committed to providing the public accurate real time ocean and coastal water and weather data to support public safety navigation and commerce
7470569 these new noaa sentinels will ensure that critical water and wind information is available during severe storms when its needed most
7470570 this technology will deliver real time storm tide data during severe coastal events that will allow emergency managers to take appropriate action and will provide information to help protect life and property
7470571 i am pleased noaa has worked to install these sentinels at locations off the coast of mississippi and louisiana
7470572 these partner organizations are committed to managing prairie dogs in an ecologically and economically responsible manner that considers the well being of other species that depend on prairie dog habitats
7470573 management methods will be those best supported by existing research as ecologically sound and effective the partner organizations would prefer using non lethal prairie dog management methods if effective ones can be identified and were all sensitive to the concerns some landowners have about the impact of prairie dogs on livestock forage
7470574 we do not believe that the semiconductor industry can remain completely immune to the macroeconomic environment
7470575 we expect business and consumer spending on electronics to slow in coming quarters and semiconductor market growth to remain muted
7470576 almost half of the journalists reported they were not familiar with the concept of health literacy but said that their readers ability to understand health information was very important to consider when writing health stories
7470577 increasing knowledge of health literacy could help journalists clarify medical information to readers
7470578 health journalists play an important role in helping people effectively manage their health
7470579 however we found that many journalists find it difficult to explain health information to their readers while maintaining the informations scientific credibility they have to resist bogging down the story with too much technical science data and dumbing down the story with overly simplistic recommendations
7470580 a large percentage of americans are not health literate which is related to significant health problems including medication errors failing to seek treatment and an inability to understand directions about proper health behavior
7470581 the role of a health journalist includes translating medical information and acting as a liaison responsible for providing quality information we need to actively find ways to improve health coverage and recognize the importance of the medias role in improving the publics quality of life

7470595 they gotta put your face on a 5 000 bill
7470596 childrens rejection of unpalatable medications and bitter tasting foods is a complex product of maturing sensory systems genetic variation experiences and culture
7470597 a better understanding of the sensory world of the child and the scientific basis for distaste and how to ameliorate it is a public health priority
7470598 the number one reason for non compliance among children when taking medicine or eating vegetables is that they dont like the taste
7470599 just look at a childs face when theyre eating some of these things
7470600 bitter taste is a sensation that evolved to make you not want to ingest something
7470601 it is interesting because it may suggest that children have heightened bitter sensitivity compared to adults
7470602 we find that the more a mother eats fruits when shes pregnant the more a child will accept fruits and vegetables
7470603 in england there is a lot of lemon flavor added to childrens medicine its a cultural phenomenon bubblegum and cherry are popular in the united states

7470605 in addition to finding and indexing the textual content in flash files were also discovering urls that appear in flash files and feeding them into our crawling pipeline just like we do with urls that appear in non flash webpages for example if your flash application contains links to pages inside your website google may now be better able to discover and crawl more of your website
7470606 weve developed an algorithm that explores flash files in the same way that a person would by clicking buttons entering input and so on our algorithm remembers all of the text that it encounters along the way and that content is then available to be indexed we cant tell you all of the proprietary details but we can tell you that the algorithms effectiveness was improved by utilizing adobes new searchable swf library

7470610 they are the ones that have been creating trouble before and during the proceedings of the peace process and they are likely the ones to create problems even after a final agreement would be forged between the government and the milf
7470611 so the campaign against them is intended to remove the obstacles to the peace process
7470612 we have observed that resistance from the milf has lessened very much less than the resistance that we encountered in the first two days
7470613 there are sporadic harassments but these are very much less than before

7470617 gt b gt african american history exhibit slated for stop at museum center
7470618 st peter and the vatican the legacy of the popes
7470619 we managed the artifacts process secured their loan handled documentation and took a curatorial role as well
7470620 right now there are about 150 artifacts from citizens museums and other organizations but 150 isnt a final number there will probably be closer to 200 by the time we open
7470621 theres no question that this exhibit and its four years on the road will extend the efforts of the museum center to play a much larger role on the national stage
7470622 ive been working on it since the summer of 2007 and i can tell you that its one of the biggest shows the museum center has been involved with just organizing the artifacts has been a massive job
7470623 the most iconic piece i think are the doors of no return
7470624 theyre the doors to facilities that housed slaves before they were loaded on ships to be sent to america theyre from the personal collection of chief gyieti of ghana
7470625 we also have shackles used on the ships and other shackles used in this country when slaves were transported between states
7470626 the documents section is missing one thing we wanted but couldnt get the original emancipation proclamation
7470627 we tried but the national archive only lets it go on rare occasions
7470628 and it will change through the tour because everythings on loan from a variety of sources some things will be there only for two or three cities then returned to owners and replaced by something else that will certainly keep it fresh

7470680 there is a good deal of anecdotal evidence that behaviour particularly that of children and young people is being criminalised which arguably would be better dealt with informally school related misbehaviour for example and in previous times was
7470681 the increased use of pre court summary justice is one of the most important elements in the
7470682 the implementation of the strategy has received virtually no research inspectoral or parliamentary scrutiny
7470683 the trend towards pre court summary justice should more incisively be scrutinised to ensure that justice is being meted out fairly and effectively
7470684 labours ad hoc and distorted approach has created the worst of both worlds
7470685 not only are serious offenders escaping real justice due to the reliance on spot fines but as this report shows many people who should be dealt with informally are being criminalised
7470686 the best way to avoid a criminal record is not to break the law the law abiding majority want to see crimes dealt with effectively and fixed penalty notices and cautions are part of this process

7470956 theres no unity at all within europe the newer eu countries are far more anti russian than the older ones

7470973 burden the original decision of the woman and the physician
7470974 would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute
7470975 as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved
7470976 if this is a child then this would be an antiabortion statute

7470981 earlier the casualty ward received between 100 to 150 patients only today the number has increased to 800 the challenge is greater but resources insufficient
7470982 i had always been passionate about giving something back to my society which is why i chose to do medicine when i joined as a medical officer in 1989 and witnessed the poor condition of state run hospitals i decided to work towards a change i wanted to uplift the ward i was given charge of and prove that the government sector can also deliver if provided with the funds and opportunity this i was able to do over the years
7470983 the emergency ward at the jpmc karachi is possibly the only ward in the country where doctors are constantly busy if there is no political clash or bomb blast we are dealing with deaths from epidemics rain and what not
7470984 there were about 250 injured brought to the hospital and the chaos was unimaginable
7470985 in an urban city like karachi where suicide bombings clashes and political killings are common it is difficult to remain stress free but with time we learnt to handle one difficult situation after another
7470986 my official timings are from 8 00 am to 2 00 pm but i never return home on time and am unable to have lunch with my children it would always take me another three hours to wrap up
7470987 the world would be a poorer place without doctor who
7470988 that bore in the pub who delivers the punchline of a joke a second before it is delivered
7470989 for doctor who to turn into an old man youd be pissed off

7471000 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7471001 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7471002 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7471003 we have provided daleks and components for the tardis in the past and i think a one off move to the big screen would be amazing
7471004 it would take doctor who to the next level the show has a worldwide appeal so should be very successful
7471005 i think david tenant is an excellent doctor who is perfect for the part because he is eccentric and a nice guy too

7471018 the nhs was built on the foundation of caring for the community it was designed to help those who needed help care for those who needed care and treat those who needed treatment
7471019 those basic principles have been lost as the government takes us down a dangerous path that can only be a catastrophic meltdown of the system
7471020 ten years ago waits of 18 months were not uncommon but by the end of this year no one should wait longer than 18 weeks none of this would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of everyone working into he nhs
7471021 we have taken various measures to utilize plant waste effectively to achieve our goal of becoming a zero waste company
7471022 it is our endeavour to make the world class plant into a green plant
7471023 we intend to seek patent for these two technologies and give it to entrepreneurs who could use them for comemrcial purposes
7471024 it is more about him mendis if he bowls a bad ball then punish him and build up pressure on him if you continue to defend him then you know he will also be on top
7471025 it is very important that whenever he bowled a bad bowl we will get runs out of them so that you know he mendis gets under a bit of pressure
7471026 i think s badri nath s effort was great he took on mendis he went for a big shot but that is what you need to do at times to put some pressure on the bowler till now he mendis was never under any sort of pressure so he was bowling at his best
7471027 it is better to have a contributory effort while winning a match but we are not relying on one individual
7471028 if you will have the privilege of getting individual performances like zaheer played well in the last match in this match also he has bowled well but it is always better to win in the sense when it is a team effort and every one enjoys no body had a bad day it is good overall if we can continue to do this way
7471029 when you are playing with a extra batsman you need to score over 250 runs to put pressure on the opposition team
7471030 so we have to see which bowler is bowling well on a particular day and use him hopefully we will not have a day when all our part time bowlers of them bowl badly and then there is pressure on the skipper
7471031 on these sort of wickets we need to click especially the top order batsmen one out of the three or four batmen has to carry the innings and others can rotate around him then only we can achieve big scores in games like this
7471032 well that was the thought but nothing could be done about it when we could score only 237 runs
7471033 there was a bit of worry for us in the middle because we had to use the 5th bowler which was a part time bowler but yuvraj singh bowled well he was turning the ball and that really worked for us
7471034 of course as we saw in this game that if you have a partnership going and then it becomes very difficult to contain the batsmen
7471035 the students would be insured round the clock throughout the year
7471036 the period of insurance has been fixed between 21 august 2008 to 20 august 2009

7471040 the incident took place at around 10 p m sunday the accused sanjay 30 reached his house at sunlight colony and told his mother in law that he had come to meet his wife meenu

7471060 the handover took place on sunday at the verkhny lars checkpoint between georgia and russia
7471061 definitively deprived the georgian leadership of the right to push for the south ossetian and abkhazian peoples dependence on their adventurist polices which have led to a humanitarian catastrophe
7471062 in view of the repeated requests from south ossetia and abkhazia to recognize their independence including those made on august 22 and 24 the federation council proposes that russia support their independence
7471063 i am asking russia to recognize south ossetia as an independent and sovereign state
7471064 what the georgian leadership has done in south ossetia can only be described as a caucasus stalingrad
7471065 it is hard to say what decision russias political leaders will make on our republics but i can say for certain that abkhazia and south ossetia will never be part of georgia
7471066 we are requesting that you overcome this barrier which has for a long time been a difficult thing to do and recognize our republics as independent states
7471067 the greatest thing in this world is not so much where we stand as in what direction we are moving

7471098 no team has actually played at noon since we started this tournament
7471099 it affected both countries and most players didnt perform to their level because of the heat
7471100 but we didnt make the rules they said play the game at noon which i dont think was a good idea

7471106 we are studying this issue so we can put an end to this phenomenon

7471132 another one of our members of parliament eliah jembere has been arrested at parliament

7471179 the higher guarantees are simply part of running an athletics department no different than higher travel costs tuition increases and facilities improvement

7471184 in keeping with his abiding belief in due process president yaradua has directed that the army council as well as the navy and air force boards should meet early next week to ratify the promotions of the chief of defence staff and service chiefs to their new ranks
7471185 he will decorate them with the insignias of their new ranks thereafter
7471186 in view of comments and speculations in the media concerning the recent changes in the command structure of the armed forces the presidency wishes to affirm that the changes were made in the normal course of affairs and were not a reaction to any particular occurrence
7471187 the changes announced on wednesday were certainly not made in response to any perceived threat to government and the stability of the nation attempts to tie the changes to statements by some politicians should therefore be disregarded as mere mischief
7471188 the fact is that a change of guards in the armed forces had been on the cards for sometime since both the former chief of defence staff general andrew azazi and the former chief of naval staff admiral ganiyu adekeye became due for retirement several months ago

7471192 on the negative side is the euro zone economy slowing more than expected but overall things are slightly more positive for equities
7471193 some of them may be seeing a buying opportunity at these price levels

7471218 staying afloat in tough times what states are and arent doing to promote family economic security
7471219 these are challenging economic times for americas families low and moderate income workers have seen their wages stagnate or decline while the cost of basic necessities continues to rise
7471220 we are particularly concerned about the profound effect economic hardship can have on children so we wanted to know what states are doing about it
7471221 states have really taken the lead over the last decade in policy efforts to help low income families but it means that assistance is much more uneven across the states

7471247 any series we have with new york is going to be a big series but when we come off of a win like this i feel like everyone will show up and just have a little more energy and be able to feed off this game
7471248 one of the funnest games ive been a part of in a long time
7471249 weve got a day to regroup and we probably need to
7471250 a few of us were talking that its probably a lot bigger than just a regular win given the way the blue jays are playing and that theyre trying to catch up to us
7471251 he continues to impact the game and well take it we need it
7471252 hes stepped in and been a valuable member of our ballclub
7471253 the minute you make a mistake vernon wells hits it 400 feet
7471254 looked like he just got done with a 15 round fight
7471255 the fact that ellsbury stayed in and played that game it might be a little over dramatic but i thought he grew up a little bit today
7471256 he understood where we were physically with the rest of our team and what he can do by staying in the game i thought that was huge
7471257 i got up on the wall there and got up as high as i could and made the catch
7471258 saakashvili should be tried for the stupidity that he has committed here
7471259 but any trial should only happen after the barbarians have left our country
7471260 id rather be in my home than in a destroyed building
7471261 but im sure the country will be reunited again im 100 percent sure
7471262 the last thing im worried about is about my political future right now
7471263 it will be a difficult autumn and it will be a difficult winter
7471264 we wanted to get an idea of if a new company is looking to the territories what kind of information do they need and whats the cutting edge right now
7471265 the reason for this is that i have received since my last term complaints of discourtesy to the riders
7471266 talkin bout my generation getting new hampshires multi generational work force to work for you
7471267 her dilemma is the olympian dilemma now where borders are not worth the ink it takes to print them on a map where the republic of georgia strikes back at the russian invasion with imported brazilians in beach volleyball where many table tennis competitions come down to whoever has the best former chinese player and where an american woman with no grandmother back in moscow or any other family lineage plays for the russians because they need a guard and are willing to fast track a passport for her plus get her a nice contract on a russian club team the olympics are now like major league baseball they have gone free agency
7471268 olympic players have to chase down their errant balls just like we do in the basement
7471269 back home in iraq where the athletes have died like everyone else there are two running tracks dana abdul razak can use to make herself a sprinter one requires ignoring the scars from the mortar shells the other is two hours away this is the route a woman must take dashing through a war to get to the olympics
7471270 we could not be more proud of our athletes for everything they accomplished here in beijing both on and off the field of play
7471271 our first priority going into these games was to compete clean and we are extremely proud that our athletes are sharing our commitment to this principle they represented our country with pride and honor and with one of the best u s olympic performances in history
7471272 i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7471273 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7471274 i had to take a step out and collect my thoughts and collect my emotions and come back out its a very meaningful moment
7471275 in kenya we have many medals but im glad i have this one
7471276 its the most glorious day for rhythmic gymnastics in china
7471277 he told us he was looking for a metal art foundry in maine
7471278 this is not like producing a sink this is a well known artist theres a social political aspect to it too
7471279 it was really amazing here we are a small company from maine and our work was going to be at the democratic convention
7471280 its thin enough to work with and thick enough so it so it doesnt bend like a pretzel
7471281 we wanted to find someone nearby and the fact that they were from maine was a bonus
7471282 sure were artists first but its great its going to be supporting barack obama
7471283 this feels sort of surreal for me were a little cog in a wheel and were thrust in this larger machinery but all the pieces of the machinery are needed you know
7471284 you cant expect people to cover you if you dont show up
7471285 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for

7471288 do they want to stay in the executive if they do lets meet and address these issues
7471289 there is now widespread and growing concern among republicans at the failure to transfer policing and justice powers from london to belfast in due time
7471290 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year
7471291 it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable
7471292 bearing in mind the statement went through their official press office one is left with the impression its a bit of kite flying by sinn f in
7471293 these comments were not off the cuff or out of the blue
7471294 i call upon the deputy first minister martin mcguinness to say whether or not mr o caolain was speaking for sinn f in ministers
7471295 if martin mcguinness does not distance himself from this statement then a full blown crisis is facing the executive next month
7471296 i love singing and hopefully i can make a career out of it
7471297 i made up a song called happy retirement to you
7471298 i get very nervous and get blotches all over me but once i get up there i just have a fun time and try to do my best
7471299 i would like to emulate someone like kelly clarkson or carrie underwood
7471300 i wish i could have given away five more awards because i thought it was that strong
7471301 i have never been to an assembly like that just to hear a pin drop in an auditorium filled with 1 000 students was just amazing
7471302 the important thing is to keep that going its human nature that it can wear off after a while thats why we wanted to keep doing this and move it forward
7471303 just a simple teenage girl that believed in one word very strongly and that word was compassion

7471305 this way the picture is your dog taken by you so you can pick the picture that really shows what your dog is about
7471306 when i tell people about it the first thing people say is you have to meet my so and so and they take a picture out to show me
7471307 its amazing how much people love their dogs if i had a book about dogs and a book about kids i bet you theyd take the book about dogs
7471308 the sports super powers with a little olympic medal tally of my own its time for the smaller nations with less money muscle and guns to get some glory

7471310 we are naturally disappointed but in a way the postponement is a victory for us under these circumstances there were only two solutions either to relocate the event to sri lanka or postpone it
7471311 had it been relocated it would have deprived us of the hosting rights
7471312 we are sure that the event will be held in pakistan next year
7471313 i think it the game had been played in another part of the day it would have been very different
7471314 we tried to make sure that we didnt get uptight just to play our own game we wanted to play with intelligence and move the ball around and not run around so much we wanted the ball to do the work
7471315 no team has actually played at noon since we started this tournament
7471316 it affected both countries and most players didnt perform to their level because of the heat
7471317 but we didnt make the rules they said play the game at noon which i dont think was a good idea
7471318 we had a lot of chances on goal but you have to score goals to win gold medals after gold i think silver is not bad look at brazil they came third

7471337 repaso hoy las p ginas de los diarios y no encuentro en ninguna de ellas ni la mitad de la mitad de sangre de la que sale un d a normalito en la secci n de informaci n internacional de cualquier diario
7471338 sabemos que la prensa pasa por la peor poca ser periodista es dedicarse a un empleo m s que precario los becarios mal pagados son m s rentables que los profesionales con experiencia y en el caso de quienes trabajan para la televisi n la informaci n dej de ser un derecho ciudadano para ser la b squeda de la noticia que venda a cualquier precio pues los ndices de audiencia marcan y determinan la tica

7471340 my personal view is that a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in this is very much a personal view at this stage
7471341 if we want to retain our position as a constructive eu member state we cannot simply sit on our hands as some would have us do and keep saying that no means no
7471342 mr roche is not calling for a second referendum to be put that would not be a fair reflection the government is instead following the steps it said it would take in the wake of the referendum outcome
7471343 we now need to take a hard look at our situation within the eu
7471344 we have to recognise however that all other member states 26 sovereign democratic parliaments are likely to have ratified the treaty by the end of the year this will leave ireland in an isolated position
7471345 in the view of the other member states we will be preventing the eu from equipping itself to deal with the many political and economic challenges facing todays europe
7471346 not an inch is not a policy that has much to commend it in a dynamic europe that wants to move forward
7471347 we have to explore all possible solutions we cannot exclude the possibility that at some stage and in the right circumstances it may be necessary to consult the people once again my personal view is that a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in this is very much a personal view at this stage

7471350 more than 12 million americans have food allergies and diagnoses are on the rise eight foods including wheat dairy peanuts tree nuts egg soy fish and shellfish account for 90 percent of all food allergic reactions in the u s
7471351 approximately 3 3 million americans are allergic to peanuts or tree nuts and another 30 to 50 million are lactose intolerant safety concerns around cross contamination or the use of dairy based ingredients cause people with these conditions to avoid most mass produced chocolate
7471352 until now most packaged chocolate bars were strictly off limits to anyone with food allergies because of the ingredients used and or the prevalence of nut warnings

7471375 resto convinta che la questione dei diritti umani in cina sia un tema che non pu essere derubricato ad elemento di curioso folklore nel contesto dellimminente olimpiade
7471376 protestare pacificamente contro questo stato di cose continua meloni non solo un mio personale diritto ma un dovere che grava sulla mia coscienza di cittadina prima che di rappresentante delle istituzioni italiane
7471377 anche io sottolinea il ministro credo che il regime cinese possa finalmente aprirsi ai diritti umani grazie allopportunit offerta dallolimpiade ma non sono convinta che questo possa avvenire senza le pressioni della comunit internazionale semplicemente fidandosi delle promesse del governo di pechino da quando sono stati assegnati i giochi alla cina tutti gli impegni contratti in questo senso sono stati disattesi
7471378 gli atleti hanno un impatto mediatico senza eguali sono soddisfatta il segnale che avevo chiesto a poche ore dalla cerimonia di inaugurazione delle olimpiadi la prima riflessione che mi viene da fare chiedermi perch lo fanno adesso e non lhanno fatto prima avranno visto qualcosa che non gli piaciuto
7471379 sono convinta che il mio messaggio di inizio agosto gli si arrivato distorto leggendo le sue parole mi sono po sorpresa ma non avevo dubbi sul fatto che venti giorni fa si fosse ribellato un ragazzo sensibile uno che non dimentica la sua storia il suo passato vuole incontrarmi lo aspetto
7471380 hanno ragione chi ha il compito di fare politica deve intervenire senza delegare ma il mio auspicio perch gli atleti facessero qualcosa di significativo sul tema dei diritti umani era volutamente rivolto a chi ha la fortuna di avere un impatto immediato sui giovani non dimentichiamoci che i grandi movimenti per la tutela dei diritti civili sono sempre nati dalla gente
7471381 senza lentusiasmo che mi ha sempre accompagnato quanto mi mettevo davanti alla tv per guardare le olimpiadi sul podio si festeggiava fuori i fuochi dartificio ma sullo sfondo un grande equivoco adesso arrivato quel tempo delle riflessioni che io avevo sollecitato prima che iniziassero i giochi
7471382 litalia da sempre sensibile a certe tematiche che mettono al centro battaglie per la difesa dellumanit una posizione bipartisan che va oltre al colore di chi governa adesso mi aspetto la stessa forza che la politica ha assunto ad esempio per la campagna contro la pena di morte cosa ci hanno lasciato i giochi di pechino dobbiamo dare risposte immediate altrimenti il grande equivoco delle olimpiadi rester senza soluzione
7471383 e una questione di coscienza io oggi provo una profonda soddisfazione perch senza alcuna presunzione mi fa piacere capire che il mio pensiero ha trovato qualche risposta forse hanno parlato cos perch si tratta di ragazzi arrivati da realt difficili come russo o di atleti non pi giovanissimi e quindi magari pi attenti a certe tematiche i giochi sono finiti adesso la politica faccia quello che non ha fatto prima perch non mi risulta che in cina sia in atto un cambiamento radicale

7471407 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by the time of christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7471408 its fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7471409 some people have said its as big a financial shock as the great depression and as far as the oil shock goes the rise in oil prices is in the same order of magnitude that we had to deal in the 1970s

7471419 titan has got support between rs 1 125 and rs 1 175 if it comes at its support of rs 1 125 one can buy it with a stoploss of rs 1 080 if it closes above its resistance zone of rs 1 325 it is going to become very good and the fresh investors can buy over there with a stoploss of rs 1 175 the target they can maintain as rs 1 500 plus also
7471420 if someone wants to invest in zee entertainment let it close above rs 200 for at least two days then only buy it because rs 220 is a very strong resistance which if it breaks it can shoot up again because if it clears its resistance zone people can buy with a stoploss of rs 200 and stay invested in it but it has to close above its resistance of rs 220
7471421 denso india primarily is a 63 indian subsidiary of denso corporation of japan who is world leaders in electrical parts basically in electrical parts being a very import substitute item there is a lot of technology involved and the products like alternators starter motors generators primarily these are ignition products which go into the automobile industry denso india incidentally is a tier i supplier to maruti suzuki as well as the hero honda group the fact that despite operating in a highly competitive industry where there are a lot of pricing pressures the fact that the have grown their net profits at a compounded growth rate of about 45 over the last 10 years goes to prove the fact that technology of course is their core strength and they have been able to grow their revenues at a cagr of 15 over these 10 years
7471422 it is a full tax paying company they have about rs 100 crore of cash on their books primarily is a debt free company so net of cash you are actually getting auto ancillary company at a price to earnings multiple of three times with three times ev ebidta and if you compare the revenues to the market capitalisation the revenues are more than three times its present market capitalisation so we do believe that there is lot of deep value in the stock for investors who are essentially long term investors

7471545 after a review of its economic projection the policy committee has decided to keep fijis economic growth for 2008 unchanged at 1 7 per cent
7471546 all sectors are expected to grow with the exception of the community social amp personal services and finance insurance real estate amp business services sectors while the overall forecast remained unchanged mining sector output was revised down while an improvement was projected for the manufacturing sector
7471547 the growth in exports is anticipated to moderate in 2009 as further sugar price reduction kicks in
7471548 at the same time the rate of growth in imports is beginning to rise again imports are projected to grow by 14 8 per cent led by higher imports of mineral fuels food machinery amp transport equipment and manufactured goods
7471549 imports of oil and food are being driven primarily by high international prices of these commodities in dollar terms growth in imports is envisaged to outpace that of exports resulting in a wider trade deficit for 2008 this will continue to exert pressure on the balance of payments
7471550 given the projections of a wider trade deficit into the medium term it is imperative for us to continue to put more effort in raising the good growth we have seen in exports so far
7471551 at the same time we have to consider how we can effectively raise domestic production of food in order to mitigate the impact of soaring international food prices

7471712 the information is clearly presented current and easy to read the book contains information not available in other texts of this type and would be a valuable addition to any personal or institutional library
7471713 this book is very well written and reflects the enthusiasm of the distinguished authors for the subject matter the text is directed primarily at veterinary students and is entirely appropriate for this readership this reviewer has regularly recommended the previous edition to veterinary undergraduates at the ontario veterinary college and will continue to recommend the second edition
7471714 veterinary virology is a well worked text coming as close as any available to the task of reconciling the enormous advances in basic virology with the needs of those interested in the associated animal diseases
7471715 this book is a necessary addition to the conservation biology library to round out the story of efforts and problems involved in saving the giant panda

7471774 they have different starting points and they differ in the questions they ask theres no attempt at a quick synthesis but its not really about belief at all its about practice
7471775 when you look at a particular religious belief through the lens of orthodoxy its either going to measure up to that religions tradition or diverge from it with orthopraxy what one believes is far less important as what one does
7471776 both promote being mindful of who the self is and not who society pretends the self is and being mindful of the intimate connections the self has to nature and other selves
7471777 theres an awareness of the divine and that creation is shot through with the divine and of course theres the morality of loving your enemies as yourselves its those attitudes that are shared
7471778 certainly through orthopraxy we can practice the rights of other faiths
7471779 this does not deny our orthodoxy it just doesnt deal with it its not an issue

7471841 tom blumer is doing stuff that msnbc and ap should have done before providing the teenager farris hassan a national international forum and 15 minutes of fame
7471842 guys like tom blumer cover what really matters and theyre independent enough to tell the truth without fear of aggravating corporate media owners
7471843 bizzyblog made my point with numbers and facts and stuff
7471844 this is why i read bizzy blog he catches the stuff that i manage to miss

7471854 non esiste la modica quantita spiega garattini chi usa sostanze stupefacenti lo fa per avere certe sensazioni e non e comunque nelle condizioni di guidare in modo corretto non avendo risposte rapide e riflessi pronti
7471855 e giusto precisa garattini fare controlli come si fanno per lalcool ma mirati e selettivi per chi commette infrazioni e soprattutto di notte e negli week end non e possibile farli su tutti
7471856 le forze dellordine sapranno utilizzare i test in modo flessibile intelligente ed appropriato
7471857 nellimmediato subito nota falconi qualcosa nella situazione di emergenza in cui siamo andava fatto ci voleva un segnale forte che funzionasse pure da deterrente da usare con flessibilita ed intelligenza da parte delle forze dellordine verso cui non nutro dubbi
7471858 due istituzioni purtroppo in forte crisi conclude falconi e allora si investa di piu e meglio nella scuola pubblica e nella famiglia i risultati pero verranno nel tempo ed oggi bisognava rispondere allemergenza sociale per cui i test sono un segnale giusto e forte oltre che credo utile
7471859 i test antidroga su strada come gia in uso per lalcool vanno benissimo aggiunge la poretti sono una buona iniziativa per la prevenzione ma a patto che le verifiche le facciano i medici e che non si criminalizzino i ragazzi che vanno in discoteca gli incidenti non sono infatti causati solo da costoro
7471860 a seconda dellesame impiegato si rischia di negare la patente ad una persona che ha fumato un solo spinello un mese prima dandola invece allalcolizzato che cessa di bere qualche ora prima dellesame spiega la poretti con lesame del sangue infatti le tracce di alcool spariscono in poche ore mentre quelle della cannabis rimangono fino a 30 giorni tutto questo a fronte del fatto che il 30 50 degli incidenti stradali e causato proprio dallalcool
7471861 per allinearci ai paesi europei su controlli stradali con etilometro e test tossicologici che sono il migliore strumento conclude la poretti di prevenzione e riduzione degli incidenti
7471862 si perche non mi convince il modo di affrontare e risolvere le tragedie che quotidiamente si consumano sulle strade risponde lo psichiatra non si risolve cio con test e controlli e poi non vorrei che cio diventasse un sistema
7471863 anche chi usa sostanze o alcool ed il loro effetto di alterazione lo producono a seconda della quantita introdotta non e detto che procuri un danno a se stesso o agli altri dipende da quanto il soggetto e consapevole del proprio stato ed e la consapevolezza che lo rendera prudente spiega riggio se la consapevolezza viene meno e aggiunge scatta lindifferenza allora si che il soggetto diventa pericoloso per se e per gli altri
7471864 senzaltro e direi meglio e lanaffettivita che conclude lo psichiatra fa perdere lamore il senso per la vita per se stessi e per gli altri ecco fare una campagna sullinteresse per la realta umana sarebbe una svolta e una vera rivoluzione

7471890 we have banned tehreek e taleban pakistan because of their involvement in a series of suicide attacks
7471891 they themselves have claimed responsibility of several suicide attacks and the government cannot engage in a dialogue with such people
7471892 some who are really innocent and some who get acquitted despite the fact that they actually committed the offence but the prosecution is unable to prove it
7471893 what the parties certainly do not want is a flippant prosecution which will result in great costs to the defendant to have to defend his good name
7471894 whatever our prosecution is accused of its usually not accused of flippant prosecution there is provision in our law which provides for compensation should there be malicious prosecution
7471895 could i ask whether the minister is prepared to consider a system of compensation for defendants who are in fact acquitted and whom they consider factually innocent
7471896 it raises a number of difficult complex public policy issues because each time you talk about compensation its really the state the public prosecutor making careful considerations whether to proceed with a case
7471897 do you want to add a further layer of checks on his decision making the public policy perspective has been not to impose this burden on the attorney general it would be too high a burden
7471898 if you study to remember you will forget but if you study to understand you will remember

7471910 i saw a wall of ice coming towards us and then we were carried 200 metres
7471911 there was absolutely no noise it was very disturbing we only had time to swerve to the right before being mowed down
7471912 if the snow melts and this might not happen because were close to the end of the summer its possible that the bodies will come to the surface if that happens well go and get them
7471913 it was a very very fine morning i went outside to see what the weather was like and i saw a line of lights moving up the mountain
7471914 i put on my harness i was ready to go i looked again and i asked myself am i dreaming then i understood
7471915 when i say scene from the apocalypse its because there were a lot of injured it was cold it was dark it was stressful
7471916 we found the first casualty who had a broken leg and after that we found a guide who had three broken vertebrae people with hypothermia people in panic people who had been through something horrific
7471917 they were white from head to foot but they were okay they went back to the shelter

7471919 i found the cooking of the inhabitants of the slum in soweto in south africa a lot more diverse than ours

7471923 the people im telling you about have huge tv sets a lot bigger than mine they have state of the art mobile phones cars and they go and get drunk in pubs at the weekend their poverty shows in the way they feed themselves

7471927 in most capital cities petrol prices crept higher in the latest week after falling sharply over the past month mr james said
7471928 based on trends in the wholesale market the average pump price looks set to consolidate near 1 50 a litre
7471929 the average motorist is now forking out around 209 a month on petrol a saving of around 20 from the highs in mid july but still up 40 a month on a year ago mr james said
7471930 fuelwatch wont work wont give the benefits to consumers that its meant to senator xenophon told abc radio today
7471931 if the wholesale price is determined by the big oil companies and they also control many of the outlets its not a level playing field for those small operators those independent operators in the retail sector
7471932 central to our concerns is the fact that the proposal forces retail prices to be locked in for a 24 hour period association spokesman matthew hanton said
7471933 by banning the intra day price movements of fuel retailers motorists will ultimately pay more at the pump particularly those thousands of motorists that already shop smart and take advantage of the weekly discount cycle

7471940 emergency situations ministry spokesman ramis satybekov said the crash was likely caused by either an engine failure or a malfunction in the planes flight control system government spokeswoman roza daudova however said the cause of the crash was decompression of the jet
7471941 a woman was flying from seattle to san francisco unexpectedly the plane was diverted to sacramento along the way the flight attendant explained that there would be a delay and if the passengers wanted to get off the aircraft the plane would re board in 50 minutes
7471942 kathy we are in sacramento for almost an hour would you like to get off and stretch your legs
7471943 no thanks but maybe buddy would like to stretch his legs
7471944 only the ones who can sense the changes and respond to them can survive
7471945 i myself have personally been agonising what to do to navigate the company our true self shows in tough times i think it is a good opportunity to sharpen our human resources
7471946 it may perhaps allow them to express their views on the proposed takeover a little bit more loudly given that they are a major shareholder
7471947 but as it stands their stake isnt big enough to influence the outcome and i dont think the government is going to allow them to raise their stake from here
7471948 we suspect the government is probably not that keen on it either
7471949 so in essence by allowing chinalco to lift their stake to round about 11 percent of the combined group its basically providing the opportunity that tom albanese of rio can defend any hostile bid
7471950 it looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7471951 weve got our fingers crossed that things will improve but there is the recognition that there is still a long way to go yet
7471952 running against john mccains policies in 2008 is like running against bourbon at a temperance convention
7471953 sometimes your friends are dead wrong and on the big issues this november john mccain is as dead wrong as you can be joe biden thinks the war in iraq has been a huge mistake while john mccain would do it all over again
7471954 he recognizes that the power of our example is as important as the example of our power that allies we respect not disdain can advance our interests he is especially eloquent about his abhorrence for war as john is uniquely placed to be
7471955 john mccain and joe biden said send more troops we need more troops
7471956 was going to start to listen to john mccain instead of the secretary of defense because they have totally different no i shouldnt say totally many have very different views of how to proceed
7471957 i believe that there is no separation between middle east policy and i think their policy has failed
7471958 i dont care what john mccain says he is not going to push that agenda hard
7471959 would not be happening without leadership from both parties over the years senator mccain joined senator lieberman in introducing the first senate cap and trade legislation
7471960 i believe if neither he nor i were senators and i picked up a phone and called him and said i need you to show up at such and such a place i cant tell you why he would be there
7471961 would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
7471962 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off

7471966 tens of thousands of people could be in line for a refund
7471967 it wasnt a huge amount of money but it was ours
7471968 the genesis for this was chucks real feeling that this was an unfair position
7471969 we should have had a boston tea party over this
7471970 clearly they have chosen the path of arrogance unilateralism thats a serious blow to confidence building in the talks
7471971 we are not going to allow the election to go ahead without our members even a single one we will not allow them to rig this process

7471974 we want to show them how blessed they are being raised and living here in the united states and how probably this can open their hearts
7471975 my character can be a little bratty you know as all teenagers we have the tendency to act up a little bit my character does a little bit of acting up but its not too bad i hope im not like that in the real life
7471976 we want to make sure people know exactly who sen obama is and where he wants to take the country and two that voters know their choice in this election between barack obama who wants to fundamentally change the way business is done in washington and john mccain who is just more of the same of what we have had over the course of the last eight years
7471977 hes got to be focused simple and clear rather than elegiac this is not a great novel this is a short clear focused discussion unless it is clear and real simple he has failed
7471978 obama certainly hasnt opened up any huge lead over john mccain in a year that should be an easy year for a democratic candidate
7471979 i think the country still wants to know who barack obama is and where he wants to take the country in a more specific direction than he has given
7471980 you cant lose the change mantra but youve got to continue to indict mccain
7471981 the bottom line is do you want four more years when they leave the convention they need to have fairly vetted that and answered that question
7471982 the guys got a great story and people dont know it
7471983 but i tell you what i dont want my grandson or my granddaughters going back in 15 years and so how we leave makes a big difference
7471984 is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7471985 he appeals to blue collar democrats because hes an unpretentious guy
7471986 sticks and stones will break your bones but names will never hurt you
7471987 there was an enormous amount of hope after the anjouan assault
7471988 the truth is that the situation is maybe even worse today and that there is a general malaise across the country the situation is severe and we fear that if it persists it could bring the country back to political instability we fear social unrest
7471989 everything is affected transport electricity and food food has become so expensive that nobody can afford to buy anything we are in a situation of permanent crisis here people are really angry and disappointed
7471990 street demonstrations protesting the lack of fuel have occurred in moroni the comoran capital situated on grand comore island and on the island of anjouan

7471995 this is the best record i have listened to from beginning to end the calls into the station have all been basically gushing
7471996 we are very pleased to offer numerous types of classes for our employees to improve their job skills and job search skills while helping them find new employment
7471997 helping all of our employees find new employers is our main priority and focus in northern indiana
7471998 our hope is that the vast majority of our employees will be able to find employment through the contacts that they make at one of our job fairs or through the ongoing support that we will be providing at our job and resource centers

7472056 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
7472057 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
7472058 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

7472080 these are challenging economic times for americas families low and moderate income workers have seen their wages stagnate or decline while the cost of basic necessities continues to rise
7472081 we are particularly concerned about the profound effect economic hardship can have on children so we wanted to know what states are doing about it
7472082 states have really taken the lead over the last decade in policy efforts to help low income families but it means that assistance is much more uneven across the states

7472107 theres been this trend of banks saying they want to offer a better retail environment we wanted to see how they were doing with it
7472108 overlooking these simple gestures conveys a lack of respect for the customer or disinterest in their business and can destroy the foundation of a relationship before its even started
7472109 to get people to walk in the door is brutal in this banking environment how much are banks leaving on the table due to missing the basics
7472110 for the customer opening an account is not a trivial task the ability to turn it into a great experience can make the difference
7472111 weve got our fingers crossed that things will improve but there is the recognition that there is still a long way to go yet
7472112 it looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet

7472132 they are each charged a minimum of 100 as recruitment fee in the philippines and given roundtrip tickets where the return ticket is oftentimes fake a fake invitation letter and

7472135 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by the time of christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7472136 some people have said its as big a financial shock as the great depression and as far as the oil shock goes the rise in oil prices is in the same order of magnitude that we had to deal in the 1970s
7472137 there are periods when markets look like they are getting better then another grenade explodes another bout of fear of sustainability of some financial institutions maybe intervention by the authorities
7472138 on the assumption commodity prices remain stable and if anything fall back then inflation should drop back as we go through next year

7472272 this should be a pretty good year for leaf color change
7472273 although there was enough rainfall this spring to keep the trees healthy we are still in drought conditions in the western part of the state which surprisingly is good for fall color fortunately the summer temperatures have not been as consistently hot as we had last year so we should not experience the early leaf drop we had last fall it all adds up to a nice long progression of fall color
7472274 if the temperatures in september and october cooperate and cool down contributing to the breakdown of chlorophyll we should expect to see some brilliant fall colors this year
7472275 last year there was not much of a peak although we did see some brilliant color this year the trees should be on a more typical color schedule peaking in mid october in the mountains
7472276 and a sharp cooling of temperatures in september and october would really cause the colors to burst as this stimulates the production of anthocyanin or red pigments
7472277 d rften dem laien allerdings nicht viel sagen g steht f r die erdbeschleunigung sie gibt an welcher beschleunigung ein k rper im freien fall unterliegt und welche belastung auf ihn einwirkt zum vergleich bei einem raketenstart wirken 5 g die 1 7 g unseres simulators entsprechen etwa der beschleunigung eines vollbeladenen jumbo jets beim start
7472278 mit dem neuen roboter k nnen wir nun nicht nur visuelle eindr cke simulieren sondern zus tzlich auch die auf den fahrgast einwirkende beschleunigung
7472279 auch wenn viele ltere frauen die hpv impfung f r sich selbst nicht in betracht ziehen w rden zwei drittel aller befragten ihre t chter auf jeden fall gegen hpv impfen lassen das spricht daf r dass sie von dem nutzen dieser impfung berzeugt sind zudem bef rwortet eine gro e mehrheit der frauen das anbieten der hpv impfung in schulen und durch gesundheits mter
7472280 geb rmutterhalskrebs stellt f r eine studie ber gesundheitspr vention einen besonders interessanten fall dar denn er ist eine bei frauen relativ h ufig vorkommende krebserkrankung die aber zugleich durch konsequente vorsorge gut vermeidbar ist entscheidend ist sowohl bei der krebsfr herkennung als auch bei der impfung das individuelle verhalten das durch eine aktive gestaltung g nstiger gesundheits und gesellschaftspolitischer rahmenbedingungen optimiert werden kann
7472281 we know that the atlantic basin hurricane season peaks from august to october but long term prediction of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes is still a developing science
7472282 these events all point out the urgent need to better understand earths natural processes and how to live with them
7472283 iype recognizes that earth can be a dangerous place as our growing world population tends to settle along the coastal and mountainous areas of the continents our communities become more vulnerable to the risks of multiple hazards
7472284 we have made important strides in hazard science and reducing risk using scientific knowledge coupled with monitoring and warning systems there is however much still to learn
7472285 it is critical to partner with communities engineers government officials and emergency preparedness personnel to successfully prepare for disasters and build resilient communities
7472286 let us stop this action halt it arrest hold it
7472287 then you say now what has just happen in this game had this effect let us see how we achieve this effect let us replay that action and observe how this particular effect was attained
7472288 pedro is experienced enough hes a european cup winner and nothing will phase him
7472289 you could see from pedros touches against aberdeen and his class on the ball that hes brilliant and can really help us next week
7472290 we can just give him the ball and let him calm the game down
7472291 in the middle steven davis was running the show along with pedro mendes and kevin thomson they are three good players and it was difficult for us
7472292 i did not think we were playing that badly in the first half but mendes was wonderful
7472293 he has terrific range in his passing and he has great patience and decision making on the ball
7472294 they may have been missing barry ferguson but they still have great players and gave us a bit of a lesson in the first half
7472295 hopefully its not as bad this time but theyre not going to give any medals out in august or september
7472296 everybody wishes are that you win every game and it doesnt happen and everybody wishes that you dont get injuries but it happens
7472297 we dont want a massive gap to open up between ourselves and the other teams who are going to be up there
7472298 the newcastle result was disappointing but that has gone were looking at portsmouth and then the super cup then weve got a two week break before facing liverpool away we want to make sure we go into that break with two wins under our belt
7472299 im open minded to talk about it but im not real excited about it
7472300 think back to that one debate when joe bi said rudy giuliani only says three things when he opens his yap i saw that shit and i went oh snap that shit was the nastiest burn i done heard since lloyd bentsen told dan quayle that he was no jack kennedy
7472301 so youre saying that joe biden was selected by obama to be his vice prez candidate just because biden delivered the biggest political yo mama snap since 1988
7472302 a snap like that only comes once every like ten years or so and when it does you give that man the best job you can
7472303 so giving bush the authority to start the iraq war and being a whore for the credit card companies doesnt matter as much as being the man who delivered the best verbal bitchslap of the decade
7472304 look obama aint bush hes not going to let his vp just do whatever he wants all hes gonna do is sit around and wait to break ties in the senate so if thats all hes gonna do you might as well get someone who knows how to verbally throw down
7472305 none of the other candidates had any good snaps during the primaries
7472306 and none of the other people floated for the vp spot were known for laying down the burns either
7472307 i know the game i seen it played for years
7472308 you think shit in government is decided by thinking hard about shit
7472309 in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote london
7472310 this is a general three minute video of london in which an artwork by very fleetingly appears
7472311 the video is not for general public use and has been used many times over the last few years to show to the tourism trade
7472312 there has never been a complaint made about the video up until this point
7472313 however if any offence has been caused we will withdraw it from use with immediate effect
7472314 i saw a wall of ice coming towards us and then we were carried 200 metres yards
7472315 there was absolutely no noise it was very disturbing we only had time to swerve to the right before being mowed down
7472316 if the snow melts and this might not happen because were close to the end of the summer its possible that the bodies will come to the surface if that happens well go and get them
7472317 it was a very very fine morning i went outside to see what the weather was like and i saw a line of lights moving up the mountain
7472318 i put on my harness i was ready to go i looked again and i asked myself am i dreaming then i understood
7472319 when i say scene from the apocalypse its because there were a lot of injured it was cold it was dark it was stressful
7472320 we found the first casualty who had a broken leg and after that we found a guide who had three broken vertebrae people with people in panic people who had been through something horrific
7472321 it looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7472322 weve got our fingers crossed that things will improve but there is the recognition that there is still a long way to go yet
7472323 oh you know the chan who sends you all those emails

7472327 you dont want to clean the toilet then end up having to bite the glove ends to get them off
7472328 you can use it to clean the tracks of a sliding glass door scour around the base of faucets and remove baked on matter from toaster racks
7472329 wipe the squeegee after every pass with a microfiber cloth
7472330 store the canister upside down so that the wipes dont dry out
7472331 a label that says its chlorine free and wont scratch
7472332 arrests and violations of the nfl conduct code have become an unfortunate trend amongst the leagues players
7472333 and its an excellent way for us to make some money
7472334 kelly shoppach and ryan garko will likely be the odd men out
7472335 my guess is that sal fasano and andy gonzalez will be the odd men out
7472336 i feel like i was extremely justified to do what i did
7472337 i needed to do it and thats the way it went
7472338 lets make it real clear im not apologizing for it and thats it i feel like the score is even and it just cost him more than it cost me at the time and thats the way it is
7472339 kyle had the fastest car on the long runs all night
7472340 my only chance to get him was on the restarts
7472341 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was real mad
7472342 he said i just had to look at your rear bumper and decide would you do this to me
7472343 just smoked the back bumper of my car and sent me up the race track
7472344 afterward he said sorry man my car was just faster
7472345 so in my mind i had to ask myself when i went down there in the corner should i lift and brake early and do the best i can or should i just kind of give him a little tap and see what happens thats the way it went and thats the decision i made
7472346 he does that and hell always come back and say hes sorry
7472347 its just his normal fashion thats fine ive grown to know that now
7472348 but we cant give up points when theyre right there for us to take
7472349 he just explained to me that you reap what you sow which i believe
7472350 i explained to him that thats why it happened that way
7472351 why did the browns fall short of the playoffs last season

7472391 clearly the budget intention was to ensure that people on lower incomes were able to access the rebate and thats precisely whats happening so were thrilled with the uptake of the rebates and the publicity that the announcement in the budget has generated
7472392 this is obviously an enormous problem for the industry its an enormous problem for taxpayers because it means were getting much less bang for our buck
7472393 were now getting smaller systems installed with the same amount of taxpayer dollars
7472394 that means less renewable energy more carbon emissions for the same amount of money were spending its an absolute farce

7472401 in most capital cities petrol prices crept higher in the latest week after falling sharply over the past month mr james said
7472402 based on trends in the wholesale market the average pump price looks set to consolidate near 1 50 a litre
7472403 the average motorist is now forking out around 209 a month on petrol a saving of around 20 from the highs in mid july but still up 40 a month on a year ago mr james said
7472404 fuelwatch wont work wont give the benefits to consumers that its meant to senator xenophon told abc radio today
7472405 if the wholesale price is determined by the big oil companies and they also control many of the outlets its not a level playing field for those small operators those independent operators in the retail sector
7472406 central to our concerns is the fact that the proposal forces retail prices to be locked in for a 24 hour period association spokesman matthew hanton said
7472407 i found the cooking of the inhabitants of the slum in soweto in south africa a lot more diverse than ours
7472408 its true im going to be harsh but i think a lot of english peoples food lacks heart its bland
7472409 its true in the centre of london and in the big northern cities
7472410 its nothing to do with famine or war quite the opposite england is one of the richest countries in the world
7472411 the people im telling you about have huge tv sets a lot bigger than mine they have state of the art mobile phones cars and they go and get drunk in pubs at the weekend their poverty shows in the way they feed themselves

7472416 this organization is a terrorist organization and created mayhem against public life
7472417 pakistans leadership has clearly stated their commitment to pursuing and eliminating terrorism and securing pakistans borders for the benefit of its own citizens
7472418 our organization is neither registered nor do we have any bank accounts
7472419 i think its far too early to be speculating about that and i think it would be wrong of me given the very complex human issues at heart involved in this

7472434 i grew up around sets but i wasnt necessarily in the movies
7472435 basically id just sit in the trailer and hang out
7472436 now im just at the beginning of my acting career i might have this exposure in the media but ive done little work ive been to press junkets but ive never been the one who was talking
7472437 i felt pretty lucky to be cast in this movie
7472438 it has been the biggest learning experience of my life and its very different from being the accessory on a movie
7472439 now all the responsibility is on me its up to me to get to the set on time its up to me to act even what food i eat on a set is up to me im grateful to be given this chance
7472440 im slightly a computer nerd i grew up with braces and glasses and i had this big curly fro
7472441 i never hung out with the so called social crowd
7472442 so i definitely understand not fitting in i think in this movie we show its all right if youre the nerdy one you just need to feel comfortable sitting where you are and making it your own
7472443 its really difficult to wear one for more than five minutes i have a lot of respect for girls who have to wear them
7472444 now i find myself telling people to sit up perfectly straight
7472445 the hard thing in the brace was standing up from a sitting position i felt like a turtle i couldnt get up
7472446 so i want young girls to watch this film and think ok the girl who isnt the ideal still feels confident and beautiful
7472447 im one of the luckiest girls around i get to share holidays with my dad and my other dad and my mom and sisters to be able to set an example the way my family has done makes me proud i hope this gives hope to other divorced families
7472448 i know i wouldnt be the same person without this family and this experience
7472449 him and i will be linked forever because of that one play and now theres two plays

7472455 maligning and defaming others and counter actions through the blogs have become an unhealthy culture so i think the ulama should come forward to explain and advise those responsible as they are in a position to do this
7472456 this is because not all ulama are really well versed in religious matters because today there are many types of ulama some hide behind politics or the corporate world while there are also ulama who are civil servants engineers and so on
7472457 i am concerned about the situation maligning and defaming others through the blogs so i am asking the ulama and islamic intellectuals to use a new approach to stop the unhealthy practice
7472458 honestly i cant remember its bl y name it keeps changing but i will certainly end up making a kids movie at some point
7472459 if you have kids you end up watching lots of kids movies and you often find some of their movies are infinitely more sophisticated than adult ones the incredibles was smart filmmaking and ratatouille was excellent
7472460 i once had the degree of my deviated septum operated on since then i can breathe much better and sleep nights like a baby
7472461 the rest of my body is all mine and absolutely natural and its going to stay that way i am very satisfied with what god gave me
7472462 i do the best i can to keep myself fit both in body and mind i also draw a lot of strength and energy from yoga new age and cosmic energies
7472463 it is good to praise the lord and make music
7472464 i will sing and make music with all my soul
7472465 sing and make music in your heart to the lord
7472466 another one of our members of parliament eliah jembere has been arrested at parliament
7472467 its clearly a strategy to eliminate our members and reverse our majority in parliament
7472468 we have been informed they want to arrest 15 mps its all about the vote for the speaker nothing to do with the law

7472480 last week red hat detected an intrusion on certain of its computer systems and took immediate action while the investigation into the intrusion is on going our initial focus was to review and test the distribution channel we use with our customers red hat network rhn and its associated security measures based on these efforts we remain highly confident that our systems and processes prevented the intrusion from compromising rhn or the content distributed via rhn and accordingly believe that customers who keep their systems updated using red hat network are not at risk we are issuing this alert primarily for those who may obtain red hat binary packages via channels other than those of official red hat subscribers
7472481 we could not be more proud of our athletes for everything they accomplished here in beijing both on and off the field of play
7472482 our first priority going into these games was to compete clean and we are extremely proud that our athletes are sharing our commitment to this principle they represented our country with pride and honor and with one of the best u s olympic performances in history
7472483 i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7472484 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7472485 i had to take a step out and collect my thoughts and collect my emotions and come back out its a very meaningful moment
7472486 in kenya we have many medals but im glad i have this one
7472487 its the most glorious day for rhythmic gymnastics in china
7472488 any series we have with new york is going to be a big series but when we come off of a win like this i feel like everyone will show up and just have a little more energy and be able to feed off this game
7472489 one of the funnest games ive been a part of in a long time
7472490 weve got a day to regroup and we probably need to
7472491 a few of us were talking that its probably a lot bigger than just a regular win given the way the blue jays are playing and that theyre trying to catch up to us
7472492 he continues to impact the game and well take it we need it
7472493 hes stepped in and been a valuable member of our ballclub
7472494 the minute you make a mistake vernon wells hits it 400 feet
7472495 looked like he just got done with a 15 round fight
7472496 the fact that ellsbury stayed in and played that game it might be a little over dramatic but i thought he grew up a little bit today
7472497 he understood where we were physically with the rest of our team and what he can do by staying in the game i thought that was huge
7472498 i got up on the wall there and got up as high as i could and made the catch
7472499 the philosophy seems so counter intuitive at first blush surely todays digital devices demand the swiss army knife approach
7472500 well we humans can be so ornery a simple pocket knife can be more appealing and usable than a bristling victorinox and a dedicated little games machine like the ds can engage us far more than the sleek power of the psp

7472505 its an area known for avalanches it the ice regularly breaks off here
7472506 they were in the trail but problem was that the avalanche swept away the trail
7472507 the guide shouted run fast run fast it didnt make any noise it really was impressive
7472508 we had just enough time to move away to the right before getting hit we were really lucky
7472509 from the moment we could locate them with radar echo and surface analyses it was already five hours after the avalanche so theres no more hope
7472510 they skidded between 1 000 and 1 500 meters yards
7472511 the opinion of the security forces is that the risk resulting from their release is low
7472512 the israeli government is making a big mistake by releasing now terrorists now with blood on their hands the first time for many years
7472513 and the lesson to the region is that terror pay s off
7472514 you are now putting him in a situation that he is the same like hamas both of them want terrorists back in the yard
7472515 these 200 it takes israel one week to 10 days to re arrest them
7472516 can in fact deliver much more for their own people than the extremists than the terrorists ever can
7472517 i dont know exactly why it is but i always feel comfortable here
7472518 i love new york as a city when i missed wimbledon last year i realised how much it meant to me
7472519 i always want to play great at wimbledon and do well there but just for my personality i think the us open and new york suits me better
7472520 and nobody had a two shot lead at any point it was either seven under or eight under or six under
7472521 it wasnt easy to get close to the hole so birdie was difficult to come by it was drying out a lot and youve got to play conservative on some holes
7472522 it was a tough day but it was a great play off i enjoyed that
7472523 javier will be back with us soon but i do not think he will be in contention to play in europe
7472524 he has spent too much time travelling and playing that makes it difficult to be at your best
7472525 weve been linked with quite a few but we have shown an interest in bullard indeed in quite a few other players
7472526 whether hes actually for sale im not so sure so thats not the only iron weve got in the fire
7472527 my mind was focused to the start of the league season with golden arrows but god has decided otherwise and wanted to give me this chance of playing in england
7472528 yes we are looking at him but there is no deal yet
7472529 my general manager is out there at the moment having a look
7472530 this is an effort on our part to tie the three events together the world trade center the pentagon and shanksville
7472531 i couldnt have dreamed this would turn out any better all the brotherhood coming down from new york and new jersey and showing up here today to pay their respect to this piece of steel
7472532 i was very happy that everyone was able to get together
7472533 this is why barack obama is a twisted megalomaniac warning this will shock you
7472534 whilst pictures speak louder than words its always great ridiculing a ridiculous white man the criss cross of tribal paint looks like the decorations on a childrens project about new zealand the nepalese text potentially reads bench warmer and the wolf represents one of the few nba franchises where swift would get more than fifteen minutes floor time per game
7472535 play nintendo games like joe montana football all the time john mayer was pretty good but i played a bit more than he did
7472536 for the betterment of the olympic games we should have replaced that with either dodge ball or olympic horseshoes or maybe even a game of olympic tag with teams of 5 people
7472537 if we look at how much more water we will need for food and how much more for biomass for energy going forward it is quite worrying
7472538 almost every increase in water used in agriculture will affect water availability for other uses including that needed to keep ecosystems healthy and resilient in the face of change and perturbation
7472539 it might be environmentally reasonable to withdraw maybe 6 000 cubic kilometers but if we withdraw more water it would be at a very high environmental cost because we need water to flush the system and for different ecosystem services
7472540 by 2030 the same amount of energy that we produce today with fossil fuels will have to come from biomass
7472541 walter benjamin hat in seinem fragment kapitalismus als religion 1921 die marxschen religionsanalogien beim wort genommen und betont da der kapitalismus nicht nur religi s bedingt sei wie max weber in der protestantischen ethik meinte sondern selbst eine kultreligion ohne speziel le dogmatik und theologie ein permanenter sich gnaden und trostlos vollziehender kult der nicht ents hnt sondern universell verschuldet benjamin s 100
7472542 cisse has got that physical presence and the pace and we had a feeling amongst the staff that if he got on he could do a bit of damage to tottenham and he certainly did
7472543 the players showed great character because its always disappointing when you concede but daryl murphy has put in a great ball and its great to win the game particularly because last year our away form was so poor
7472544 tottenham had a right go at us as youd expect in the second half but we maybe just about edged it the good sign is i think theres a lot more to come from this team

7472546 we plan to adopt an appeal to the president at an emergency session on the recognition of abkhazia and south ossetias independence
7472547 we must encourage south ossetias and abkhazias seek for stability independence and peace
7472548 we have more political legal grounds than kosovo to have our independence recognized
7472549 when i say we i mean both south ossetia and abkhazia

7472552 will highlight barack obamas life story his commitment to change and the voices of americans calling for a new direction for this country
7472553 we are looking for him in the area he was last seen its an area that is devoid of dangerous wild animals due to the high altitude
7472554 we have been notified of the missing chinese national police and national park officials are still looking for him in a joint operation i have no further information to give you
7472555 this is a rather rare and mysterious case if he has died then we were supposed to have found his body by now
7472556 i have not selected him as i do not think he is focused enough and i do not feel that he will be good for the dressing room and the team effort
7472557 it doesnt matter how good a player is if he is not in the right frame of mind then he will not perform well
7472558 we have to wait and see in the next few days after the meeting and make a decision to see if he is in a right state of mind for the next game or whether we have to find other solutions
7472559 the system will also be used to alert customers to avoid disconnection a day or two before their bills payment deadline among other uses

7472562 i have made several appeals to the government to uphold the rule of law but it seems as if all that is landing on deaf ears and the only way is to lay off the workers
7472563 we agree that they applied for 2 000 acres to sft but since then the land has not been allocated to anyone they should stop operating as if there is no law
7472564 i discovered that the file is missing after my lawyers applied for a search so as to proceed to seek approval from the district land control board
7472565 we cannot allow such a process to be left in the hands of a person who has held the community to ransom for many years
7472566 i have reported the invasion to the local administration but they have not taken any action to protect my property despite a court order issued in 2005 to do so

7472613 ireland is a race with real potential it is well organized well marketed and has a large television commitment in place it is part of our mission to support promising races down under eroica georgia missouri ireland britain these races are good for our young team and we can help make the sport more diverse and therefore economically more healthy and stable
7472614 the last stage into cork will be really hard so i am definitely thinking about that one
7472615 there will be an incredible atmosphere up on st patricks hill and we are hoping that we can do something on the stage and in the overall classification
7472616 i just cant wait to get back to racing on irish roads again
7472617 i know that a really hard course has been announced but the team is really motivated to do well there was a real fight to get into the team for this one but obviously being irish champion helped me get in the guys are excited to be coming to ireland to race we should be one of the strongest teams
7472618 we spent a lot of time travelling and racing in the great britain national team and we road the junior tour of ireland together it will be good to see him again but obviously this time we are hoping that he will be a little bit tired he is on is incredible form at the moment but julian dean is a really fast sprinter as well and we expect to be there in the sprints we have got a really fast lead out train and it should be really exciting
7472619 my mind was focused to the start of the league season with golden arrows but god has decided otherwise and wanted to give me this chance of playing in england
7472620 weve been linked with quite a few but we have shown an interest in bullard indeed in quite a few other players
7472621 whether hes actually for sale im not so sure so thats not the only iron weve got in the fire
7472622 my mind was focused to the start of the league season with golden arrows but god has decided otherwise and wanted to give me this chance of playing in england
7472623 yes we are looking at him but there is no deal yet
7472624 my general manager is out there at the moment having a look
7472625 i dont know exactly why it is but i always feel comfortable here
7472626 i love new york as a city when i missed wimbledon last year i realised how much it meant to me
7472627 i always want to play great at wimbledon and do well there but just for my personality i think the us open and new york suits me better
7472628 javier will be back with us soon but i do not think he will be in contention to play in europe
7472629 he has spent too much time travelling and playing that makes it difficult to be at your best
7472630 lattice structures are actually any porous geometry or what we call nonstochastic foam
7472631 in 2003 nc state became the first institution in the u s to purchase an e beam machine we started experimenting with metals as a natural extension of having worked with rapid plastic prototyping methods since 1996
7472632 the melt goes fairly quickly because there is no optical reflectivity melting aluminum with other methods for instance would make a mirror that reflects a lot of the energy back this is not the case with an electron beam
7472633 sintering is about 70 to 75 of the materials melting temperature
7472634 here is a good way to compare sintering and melting imagine mud after it dries it is a cake of dirt scratch the surface with a fingernail and particles fall off this is like sintering but had the mud melted though it would have turned into solid rock this of course is melting
7472635 fortunately e machines melt parts in a vacuum exposed to oxygen fine metal and even plastic powders are explosive in fact aluminum powder is actually used as a rocket propellant thus should a little bit of material spill on the floor never use an ordinary vacuum cleaner it is necessary to use a special explosionproof vacuum cleaner to sweep the material up
7472636 of course arcam prefers users purchase materials from it because the company has established the best settings to run each alloy
7472637 but there are no objections to your working with another powder provided you let the company know it must service the machines and does not want to expose maintenance personnel to potentially dangerous materials
7472638 the direction has to do with how uniformly the heat is distributed
7472639 think of ebm in terms of a wave when the beam scans from left to right say it generates a little wave of molten titanium always scanning in that one direction might produce a little lip on the right hand side of the part but scanning from one side to other and then stepping over a little bit and scanning in reverse pumps a lot of heat into both sides of the scan bed and less in the middle uniformity of heat is important in the scan bed so the e machine software randomizes direction using a proprietary method
7472640 such organizations want to move away from rapid prototyping and instead directly build functional structural parts
7472641 nasa for example developed an exotic material called grcop 84 a copper alloy with a high thermal conductivity well suited as a catalytic support structure on space shuttle liftoffs the material was difficult to process with other techniques such as casting but it proved to work well with ebm
7472642 nasa has an interest in building a habitat on the moon and possibly even mars
7472643 the current cost of rocket fuel is around 25 000 per pound of payload to lift off from earth needless to say engineers are counting fractions of payload ounces because its not practical to envision sending spare parts to the moon one idea is to send an e machine to the lunar surface and dig up soil to use as feedstock
7472644 although metal oxides are a challenging material for ebm because they lack good electrical conductivity initial results show the powder actually melts and does not just blow away researchers are devising a method to get oxygen out of lunar soil so astronauts could breathe on the moon without extra equipment once oxygen is removed the waste product is a good feedstock for the e beam machine because the materials electrical conductivity is then quite good
7472645 there are two issues with bone and metal says cormier
7472646 one is the fit or shape the other is the load bearing the human bone is not as rigid or as stiff as titanium this can lead to a lot of problems with implants to illustrate astronauts on a space station for a long duration in microgravity lose quite a bit of bone mass because their bones are not subjected to loading when individuals walk around on earth theyre loading their bones which respond by getting stronger but were an individual to constantly lie around his body concludes it doesnt need that much bone and so it atrophies away
7472647 the bone therefore starts changing shape and atrophying away on the biomedical side we design lattice structures with specific geometries so that the stiffness of the implant closely matches the stiffness of the human bone and because ebm is free form it produces the shape needed for a good fit
7472648 because metal is harder than bone implants are not designed one to one size wise but rather strength wise
7472649 solid and lattice parts work well for hip knee and shoulder joints cranial implants and spinal applications using lattice cages structures that go where the spinal disk used to be
7472650 take a hip joint for example it has a ball and socket typically the socket is made from an ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene cup and the head of the femur is made from cobalt chrome because it wears well and has a low coefficient of friction this arrangement is also used in the knee
7472651 today metal beads get sintered onto solid metal parts and the bone grows into the spaces between the beads other methods are to spray on flakes of titanium for a roughened surface lattices will provide a better mechanical lock between the bone and the implant
7472652 the fda does not approve a material or a process per se
7472653 rather it approves each individual product to my knowledge the organization has not yet cleared an ebm made implant yet the process is relatively new and there are only about 50 machines in the world but still ebm has made the design world a lot bigger previously designers might have left a lot of extra material in a certain region of a part because otherwise it was impossible to get the part out of a mold today engineers can perform a fea of the part to make sure it would remain strong and stiff enough were the solid material replaced with a lattice structure
7472654 we use stl files of shapes and fill them with repeating patterns using a voxelization procedure in our software
7472655 the basic idea is that instead of designing the whole structure just start with the single unit cell to be repeated the point is to create a 3d array using that one element the algorithm in our code makes copies of the element and checks whether or not its inside or outside the solid or if it is straddling the surface cells completely inside the part are deemed fine those outside the part get tossed cells trapped in the surface get trimmed
7472656 and nobody had a two shot lead at any point it was either seven under or eight under or six under
7472657 it wasnt easy to get close to the hole so birdie was difficult to come by it was drying out a lot and youve got to play conservative on some holes
7472658 it was a tough day but it was a great play off i enjoyed that

7472670 under behandlingen i folketinget hvor landsdommer niels larsen beretning fra september 1984 ofte blev fremdraget fik fremskridtspartiet en tydelig fornemmelse af at alle de implicerede partier faktisk kun var interesserede i n eneste ting nemlig at forhale sagen mest muligt s ledes at den gik i glemmebogen

7472701 this added period of one year makes the move to sap enterprise support cost neutral as customers plan their transition to sap erp from sap r 3
7472702 may appear cost neutral from saps point of view but when you include the relicensing fee to go from r 3 4 x to erp 6 0 it is definitely not cost neutral for those customers happy with their existing version having one extra year is nice for some clients who do not want to make the move yet
7472703 increased sap support charges can be offset by eliminating all unnecessary custom code support costs
7472704 the results indicate that over 90 percent of sap systems have the potential to make major support cost savings by eliminating or replacing custom code
7472705 its his right i think in a sense its also good that he resigned as chair of the house appropriations committee so that he could see what the grassroots think about the rh bill its a good thing

7472712 one of the major challenges is in providing adequate health care facilities for the growing population of our country there is a shortage of both trained doctors and nurses
7472713 this needs to be addressed at the national and regional levels i am happy that the assam government is taking major steps to overcome the shortage in health care
7472714 five of the southern states have more than 60 per cent of the medical colleges in the country this uneven distribution of medical facility is the root cause of the problem
7472715 there is a need to amend the charter of the medical council of india incorporating spread of medical education as a major objective change is needed in the mindset of all the authorities to bring a vital promotional growth in the health care sector
7472716 institutional excellence can only thrive when creative energy flows between teachers and students
7472717 the planning commission has projected a shortage of nearly one million nurses in the next five years in the country
7472718 nursing has become a source of job opportunities and a means for empowerment of women in some parts of our country with the right opportunities we hope to see more lady doctors from the northeast

7472731 es spricht f r die glaubw rdigkeit und seriosit t des instituts dass sich die umfrage nicht nur mit der systemfrage besch ftigt sondern f r f nf zentrale bereiche reformbedarf anmahnt
7472732 diese f nf forderungen decken sich mit dem 2007 vom bllv beschlossenen leitantrag

7472736 wenn fast die h lfte der deutschen das bildungssystem f r ungerecht h lt wenn dreiviertel der bev lkerung und fast 86 der eltern der ansicht sind dass jugendlichen aus allen schichten bzw aus allen kulturkreisen die gleichen chancen einger umt werden m ssen dann muss dieses ergebnis auch von der schul und bildungspolitik in bayern ernst genommen werden
7472737 ich freue mich ber den erkl rten reformwillen der befragten und ber ihren ausdr cklichen wunsch nach einem integrativen bildungssystem einer reform des gegliederten schulsystems mit dem ziel kinder m glichst lan ge gemeinsam zu unterrichten
7472738 die forderung nach einer ver n derten ressourcensteuerung ist absolut berechtigt nur mit einer kompensatori schen mittelzuweisung k nnen schulen in benachteiligten stadtvierteln besser ausgestattet werden
7472739 insgesamt l sst die studie erkennen dass eltern nicht nur die probleme an den schulen kennen sondern dass sie auch l sungen sehen verantwortungsvolle politiker sollten sich ber dieses hohe ma an engagement freuen und sich stark machen f r eine rasche umsetzung
7472740 sie haben ein anstrengendes schuljahr hinter sich gebracht und nun ein recht auf ferien und erholung
7472741 es ist schon erstaunlich wie konsequent die massiven probleme an den
7472742 es sind nicht die kinder welche probleme bereiten es sind die alten welche nie gelernt haben was freude am lernen und lebenslanges lernen bedeutet
7472743 it is this kind of gross and flaunting misconduct no matter how nominal the amount involved on the part of those who are charged with the responsibility of administering the law and rendering justice quickly which erodes the respect for law and the courts
7472744 as a clerk of court it is not respondents function or any of his staff to prepare documents for the accuseds application for probation
7472745 respondent is a court employee hence he is not allowed to act as the accuseds counsel the initiative to apply for probation should have come from the accused assisted by his counsel
7472746 one big step for the automakers came friday afternoon when mccain said he would support funding some of the loans the detroit automakers and their suppliers seek noting that congress had approved 25 billion in such loans last year but failed to fund them the arizona senator said the automakers deserved some of the same support that the government had offered to wall street

7472795 i fell in love with the west from our baby blue station wagon
7472796 i was thinking i wanted to go to a big firm initially but wasnt sure if i was going to stay in virginia long term or move i chose a large well respected firm that people had heard of outside of virginia
7472797 i love the work and the people i work with
7472798 the law changes constantly and is new you have to make choices about policy arguments as part of your legal arguments it is also varied in the environmental practice area you advise and counsel clients on the status of the law do regulatory work and litigate
7472799 it was an immersion course and a fantastic experience for a new lawyer
7472800 it was like having a couple of years of experience condensed into each single year
7472801 some of my work in new york became more transaction driven as you would expect
7472802 litigation and regulatory work have a longer time frame transactions have a beginning middle and end date its a different way of practicing and i enjoy both
7472803 global and local at the same time everyone has views about water people experience it every day and its a requirement for life in the us we take access to it for granted but that is not so in many places around the world and is changing here even in places where water was previously abundant
7472804 much of what i do outside of work has turned out to be related to environmental law in some way
7472805 make sure thats what you want if it is then go for it do excellent high quality meticulous work work hard practice in an area that really interests you so that you can wholeheartedly throw yourself into it and enjoy it
7472806 attorneys are a self selecting group of energized driven people so work life balance will naturally sometimes be difficult in a field full of goal oriented career driven people regardless of their gender
7472807 is that it sets you up the idea that there is this perfect state you will reach where your home life and work life will be in equipoise and everything will be the way you want it is unrealistic it is more likely that some days your priority is going to be work and work will need your complete undivided attention other days it may not
7472808 being able to just through caution to the wind and work for 24 hours
7472809 the most important thing for everyone is to find own way for some people a commute works great for me it was better if i came home early and came back to work after putting my daughter to bed if necessary its best to do it your own way rather than search for a perfect formula that may not work for you and your family
7472810 he set the example of hard work taught me about setting big goals not just small ones and the value of not letting anyone tell you that you cant do things

7472818 unfortunately the expenses associated with medical treatment along with loss of income during that period of time are simply too much of a financial hurdle at this point liquidating the domain name portfolio and using the proceeds to pay for medical and living expenses is the most responsible way for us to manage an unfortunate set of circumstances
7472819 our strategy combines the use of youtube style videos audio testimonials and blogging tools as a more effective way to communicate with prospective clients and customers
7472820 one problem with most of todays industry standard websites is that theyre static and provide text based content with a photo or two prospective buyers want more than whats written about a dentist or attorney on their website they want to see and hear them in action they want to hear what other patients and clients have to say about their experiences most people are using the internet to do initial research before they take the time to meet face to face with a service professional and online audio video is one of the best ways for a service provider to make that initial connection
7472821 we are on the leading edge of changes in the industry unfortunately you dont get to choose when something like this is going to happen

7472841 transit passengers often have no contact at all with our officers
7472842 while we do have the legal authority to interact with transit passengers we would normally only do so where there was intelligence to indicate a threat was present
7472843 we share intelligence with agencies all around the world but we do not get every drug smuggler or every shipment of contraband that comes our way
7472844 that is a sad fact of life for customs agencies everywhere

7472853 i want to find out if it is possible for humans to live outside planet earth
7472854 it doesnt matter how to live out there as the most important thing is to try to find other lifeform on other planets
7472855 in this sense i want to explore planet mercury and to see if it is possible to inhabit the planet

7472913 this should be one of the most competitive groups ive ever had because were going to have so much depth at each position
7472914 i think that will bring out the best in all our players competition day in and day out on the court makes everyone better
7472915 even though the number of wins werent what we wanted a year ago i thought we were exciting to watch and competed really well
7472916 with the experience our freshman from a year ago gained we have the chance to be more successful
7472917 the fun part for her is that she can do it again if we need her to but shes going to have a lot of help this season
7472918 gena played quite a bit for us before getting hurt last year
7472919 she came back healthy this spring and has been working very hard in preparation for this fall
7472920 elise and kelsey are both very talented players who should contribute right away for us
7472921 the skills they bring to the table are going to make it difficult to keep them off the court if they perform to their abilities
7472922 val had a very good first year blocking for us last season but she needs to continue to grow on offense in order to become an impact player
7472923 she worked on some things this spring that i think will help her in that area
7472924 briana has really grown as a player in a little over a year
7472925 we had planned to redshirt her last fall but she was forced into action because of injuries she came out this spring and was outstanding her hard work in both the gym and weight room are starting to pay off
7472926 she is a hard worker comes from a winning program and knows what it takes to be successful thats why she was our mvp this spring
7472927 jordan was the leader of this group by the end of last fall but she missed the entire spring following surgery
7472928 rebecca ran the team during that time and will have an opportunity to do so this season based on how she performs in preseason camp our plan is to redshirt amber but we are not going to make that decision right away if she can help us we will give her the chance to play

7472931 a legislative judgment has been made at the federal and local level that full access for people with disabilities is a fundamental civil right
7472932 but for far too long enforcement has lagged for anyone who can even imagine being a prisoner in ones own apartment that is just an intolerable situation

7472943 where the elevators are fine and where they even have the right kinds of levers on the doors
7472944 but of course it was the unluckiest thing ever too because of 9 11 and the displacement that was a nightmare
7472945 trying to find a more accessible space is really difficult
7472946 when you talk to them on the phone they seem interested and say come on over

7472975 the clearly positive sign is that the raw material oil and food prices are on the decline and the inflation outlook is more favourable
7472976 on the negative side is the euro zone economy slowing more than expected but overall things are slightly more positive for equities
7472977 some of them may be seeing a buying opportunity at these price levels
7472978 lingering concerns about russia and georgia are also giving some support
7472979 while the commodity markets are still volatile they are no longer going through a one way decline dollar buying momentum seems to be slowing under such conditions
7472980 we as a society do not understand or know how to deal with speculative bubbles
7472981 is a historic turning point in our economy and our culture the forces unleashed by the subprime crisis will probably run rampant for years threatening more and more collateral damage
7472982 see once trusted economic institutions collapsing around them once again they feel that they were lied to fed overly optimistic stories that encouraged them to take excessive risks
7472983 the social fabric is indeed at risk and should be central to our attention as we respond to the subprime crisis

7472989 growing up in high school i wasnt hanging out with friends every day or on the weekends
7472990 phelps pursued his dreams to become an olympian in order to excel in his field he was willing to give up his time with friends and spent most of his time training which he felt was a right decision made many bloggers might have mistaken how
7472991 you could have full control over your environment by just being able to move your tongue

7473006 mir ist es wichtig dass unsere br der und schwestern in tibet wissen dass wir sie unterst tzen sagte der deutsch tibeter
7473007 das traumziel dass tibet frei wird und die menschenrechte geachtet werden haben wir nat rlich nicht erreicht
7473008 das realistische ziel war dass die olympischen spiele nicht von der chinesischen regierung genutzt werden ihre ungerechtfertigte herrschaft ber tibet zu legitimieren das ist uns gelungen
7473009 die chinesische regierung will mit der freilassung negative berichterstattung vermeiden die einen schatten ber die abschlussfeier geworfen h tte

7473018 wir hatten die post schon mehrfach auf diese sensiblen punkte hingewiesen es hie immer jaja wissen wir l ngst wir f hlten uns ver ppelt
7473019 gut ich fand schon spannend dass man online nachrichten austauschen konnte
7473020 aber die ger te waren eben auch unheimlich teuer von 3000 mark aufw rts
7473021 ein paar seiten waren kostenlos nutzbar auf der startseite war ein katalog funktionierte hnlich wie google heute da habe ich telefonnummern oder abfahrtszeiten rausgesucht
7473022 ein bewusstsein da gewesen dass die entwicklung von technik ein wichtiges gesellschaftliches projekt ist

7473028 i havent signed anything yet or even though about my future
7473029 im just looking forward to getting home for a bit of time out
7473030 it has been a long five weeks between training camps and the olympic games themselves
7473031 it has been very mentally draining but im proud of the way i performed
7473032 im captain of the irish team and im proud to be in four years time i could still be captain
7473033 i love the amateur game thats what i am all about there are younger lads on the team who will hopefully stay amateur and could be there in 2012 also
7473034 theres nothing i can do about it a scores a score and i just have to settle for silver im disgusted but thats how things go thats sport there has to be a loser
7473035 he threw a few shots there where he hit my elbow and i could hear the chinese going bananas i obviously knew he was getting a score i knew myself it was going to be a hard fight after that
7473036 its ridiculous over the last two weeks weve known body shots havent been scoring
7473037 he was throwing shots and getting scores fair play to him
7473038 i knew it was going to be hard if he got a lead or if it was in any way close even the countback he won in the previous fight that was close
7473039 i was chasing a little bit in the end but i had to i wasnt going to sit back and let the clock tick away
7473040 when these things get thrown at you you actually try that much harder
7473041 he thaksin is even more adamant now because this is his love and he wants to show people he is really committed
7473042 i asked the question as well as everyone else is the club for sale and he is quite adamant this club is not for sale and he is here for the long haul
7473043 i asked why did you buy it he said he bought it because there is a 10 year plan
7473044 the academy is currently touring australia and new zealand with will hit the road again in the u
7473045 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7473046 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7473047 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7473048 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7473049 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7473050 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7473051 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7473052 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7473053 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7473054 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7473055 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7473056 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7473057 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7473058 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7473059 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7473060 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7473061 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7473062 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7473063 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7473064 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7473065 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7473066 this is a planning took where all things are going
7473067 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7473068 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7473069 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7473070 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7473071 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7473072 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7473073 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7473074 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7473075 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7473076 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7473077 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7473078 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7473079 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7473080 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7473081 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7473082 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7473083 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7473084 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7473085 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7473086 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7473087 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7473088 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7473089 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7473090 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7473091 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7473092 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7473093 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7473094 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7473095 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7473096 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7473097 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7473098 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7473099 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7473100 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7473101 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7473102 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7473103 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7473104 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7473105 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7473106 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7473107 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7473108 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7473109 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7473110 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7473111 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7473112 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7473113 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7473114 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7473115 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7473116 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7473117 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7473118 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7473119 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7473120 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7473121 make sport for my neighbors and laugh at them in my turn
7473122 oprah will do a special show that week just on the jane austen phenomenon and have an audience full of jasna people and give out cars and ipods to everyone and first editions of p amp p to a special audience member with the winning ticket under her seat and have matthew macfadyen the two mr darcys from the last two film versions of pride and prejudice and rupert penry jones captain wentworth from the latest persuasion movie alas i will bitterly watch it all on tv green with caroline bingleyesque envy

7473152 the average motorist is now forking out around 209 a month on petrol a saving of around 20 from the highs in mid july but still up 40 a month on a year ago mr james said
7473153 fuelwatch wont work wont give the benefits to consumers that its meant to senator xenophon told abc radio today
7473154 if the wholesale price is determined by the big oil companies and they also control many of the outlets its not a level playing field for those small operators those independent operators in the retail sector
7473155 central to our concerns is the fact that the proposal forces retail prices to be locked in for a 24 hour period association spokesman matthew hanton said
7473156 by banning the intra day price movements of fuel retailers motorists will ultimately pay more at the pump particularly those thousands of motorists that already shop smart and take advantage of the weekly discount cycle

7473211 it looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7473212 weve got our fingers crossed that things will improve but there is the recognition that there is still a long way to go yet
7473213 look at the us in iraq everybody was opposed even their allies but they did not listen and what happened they do not know how to get out of it now now we understand that we are all linked to the us and if it falls apart it would be a real collapse we have to help them to get out of there that means that cooperation is needed a new world order is necessary and global mechanisms to manage it
7473214 this league of democracies would not supplant the united nations or other international organizations it would complement them but it would be the one organization where the worlds democracies could come together to discuss problems and solutions on the basis of shared principles and a common vision of the future if i am elected president i will call a summit of the worlds democracies in my first year to seek the views of my democratic counterparts and begin exploring the practical steps necessary to realize this vision
7473215 yes there have been differences between america and europe no doubt there will be differences in the future but the burdens of global citizenship continue to bind us together a change of leadership in washington will not lift this burden in this new century americans and europeans alike will be required to do more not less partnership and cooperation among nations is not a choice it is the one way the only way to protect our common security and advance our common humanity
7473216 in this new world such dangerous currents have swept along faster than our efforts to contain them that is why we cannot afford to be divided no one nation no matter how large or powerful can defeat such challenges alone

7473246 of course if you dont mind and you can drop the doctor if that pleases you hilton will do
7473247 now prunella i think it would be positive during this session to try a different tack in our explorations to possibly break down a few barriers if we are to move forward as it were in other words to gain progress through retreating

7473291 we need to address these issues both at the national and the regional levels to ensure that there are no shortage of doctors and nurses it is heartening that assam is taking the lead in setting up medical colleges

7473314 after every game that he has played he has had a little muscle niggle one or the other and thats because he just hasnt trained
7473315 so what im trying to do two things at once get him some time on the field get him up to speed in training if we can and then you will see him starting games
7473316 that will help him hes getting better you can see it in training and it wont be too long im pretty sure of it
7473317 when these things get thrown at you you actually try that much harder
7473318 he thaksin is even more adamant now because this is his love and he wants to show people he is really committed

7473328 he threw a few shots there where he hit my elbow and i could hear the chinese going bananas i obviously knew he was getting a score i knew myself it was going to be a hard fight after that
7473329 its ridiculous over the last two weeks weve known body shots havent been scoring
7473330 he was throwing shots and getting scores fair play to him
7473331 i knew it was going to be hard if he got a lead or if it was in any way close even the countback he won in the previous fight that was close
7473332 i was chasing a little bit in the end but i had to i wasnt going to sit back and let the clock tick away

7473588 i just really like to give it to my friends and family
7473589 we have 8 000 light bulbs that are burning out every two and a half years and were sending out union labor to go and change them
7473590 and while the bulb doesnt cost very much the labor does
7473591 the police are really excited because theyll be able to i d cars now
7473592 they can see what color jacket people are really wearing rather than blue looking like some sort of beige
7473593 they could save more than 500 000 a year and it would pay for itself in three years
7473594 my wife bought me a moose call and a moose calling cassette tape and three or four dvds when i was deployed last time and i practiced in iraq
7473595 we ended up calling in six different bulls on our moose hunt
7473596 i called one bull in from a mile and a half away he came at a dead run to 10 yards from us he was too small though so we let him go
7473597 im from mississippi and id never heard a moose before
7473598 he started doing it before i saw any of the videos and i said what are you doing trying to imitate a cow and he said thats exactly what he was doing trying to imitate a cow moose call
7473599 ever since i was little my dad and i talked about coming to alaska to hunt together
7473600 i belted out a cow call and here comes a cow moose tearing across the yard right at me
7473601 we watched seven bulls on the side of a mountain for five days
7473602 when we called to them theyd get up and push each other around and start thrashing brush
7473603 i bellow as long as my lungs will let me go
7473604 you want to have a wavering tone to it so it goes up and down
7473605 basically thats what it sounds like someone having a hard time on the commode
7473606 i was chatting with him and he said i ought to give it a try
7473607 he knew what he wanted to do and he was going to do it
7473608 japanese soldiers in the south pacific still fighting after the war is over
7473609 and he has not demonstrated that he accepts the clintons and the clinton wing of the party
7473610 this is the sort of story cooked up just to feed cable producers not an issue
7473611 looks forward to making the case that is the best candidate to restore americas standing in the world
7473612 that puts him in a terrible bind because you cant give a ringing endorsement when youre talking about foreign policy
7473613 obviously the hard thing to talk about with obama is commander in chief of all his many talents
7473614 you dont rah rah about commander in chief you rah rah about hope and change and a new party and all that so no matter what he does somebody will find fault with it
7473615 i think hes got a high bar because he needs to show enthusiasm and the press will be looking for any stray remark as a sign that he doesnt fully support
7473616 running against john mccains policies in 2008 is like running against bourbon at a temperance convention
7473617 sometimes your friends are dead wrong and on the big issues this november john mccain is as dead wrong as you can be joe biden thinks the war in iraq has been a huge mistake while john mccain would do it all over again
7473618 he recognizes that the power of our example is as important as the example of our power that allies we respect not disdain can advance our interests he is especially eloquent about his abhorrence for war as john is uniquely placed to be
7473619 john mccain and joe biden said send more troops we need more troops
7473620 was going to start to listen to john mccain instead of the secretary of defense because they have totally different no i shouldnt say totally many have very different views of how to proceed
7473621 i believe that there is no separation between middle east policy and i think their policy has failed
7473622 i dont care what john mccain says he is not going to push that agenda hard
7473623 would not be happening without leadership from both parties over the years senator mccain joined senator lieberman in introducing the first senate cap and trade legislation
7473624 i believe if neither he nor i were senators and i picked up a phone and called him and said i need you to show up at such and such a place i cant tell you why he would be there
7473625 would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
7473626 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off
7473627 will highlight barack obamas life story his commitment to change and the voices of americans calling for a new direction for this country
7473628 the parliament is working the parliament is not dysfunctional this is full improvisation and it shows panic from the prime minister
7473629 the leader of the opposition started his press conference by responding indirectly to the prime ministers ultimatum given at the conservative caucus retreat in l vis quebec when the pm said that mr dion has to
7473630 dion made reference to fishing cutting the fish eating the fish and fishing for victory or something
7473631 trouble with this pussy is that he always gets fucked but never gets paid
7473632 you done fucked me a couple of times and you know it you knew all i wanted to do was write and you said you were going to get me places but all you did was try sell my arse to tabloids
7473633 writing is writing and some of us see those of us from where we coming from have to work a little harder than them others start at the lowest rungs and work our way up
7473634 but this guy could not think out of the mainstream think about something like a blog anything that would put my work out there
7473635 my blog oh my blog oh negro please that blog potash is nothing but a crutch it is like all that napshizzle you ass holes used to drink and whatever you drink these days oops sorry i forgot you have no money now dinda we need to take this fucker out for a drink who knows maybe even buy him a pussy so he can see and smell himself
7473636 but do cut the brother some slack though i agree that that blog has in the broader scheme of things not done anyone any good there have been wars that neednt have occurred animosity where goodwill would have profited all and alliances smashed where unity would have kept this city safe from snitches
7473637 the world out there can take it for entertainment or whatever they fucking feel like but down here down here it makes all the difference between living or dying everything

7473646 there will also be a loss of mid level skilled plumbers technicians and electricians among others that these colleges offered
7473647 during the current financial year the college was allocated a recurrent budget of only sh118 million which is a far cry from other constituent colleges that have not even admitted any degree students and have fewer staff members
7473648 the programme is a big plus for kenya but individual universities should look for ways of entrenching pro poor policies into it
7473649 the entry grade is a c this means that any student who gets this grade and above qualifies to get into university therefore the issue of the privately sponsored students programme compromising education standards should not arise since they also qualify
7473650 poor pay had forced most of our qualified lecturers to leave the country in search of greener pasture in south africa botswana usa and australia the introduction of parallel programmes added another workload to lecturers the lecturers are overstretched to the point of fatigue
7473651 we want a situation where more lecturers are recruited to ensure they commit their time to research and teaching
7473652 the mission of a university which is training research dissemination of knowledge and national service should be enhanced as our public universities expand their programmes and admit more students
7473653 but this is not true as no one has ever stated how much money is generated from the programmes

7473657 but we were surprised to see how many hollywood films actually featured us artworks specially those made in the last 20 years
7473658 a year ago approximately 28 of our weekly sales were paid for with euro
7473659 now we are seeing this figure regularly rise to 40 customers from the republic tell us that prices there are too high and given how close strabane is to the border it makes a lot more sense to make the short trip across to make their budget stretch further
7473660 we have always had a high republic of ireland footfall but we have been overwhelmed by how popular the new store has become with shoppers on both sides of the border
7473661 as families struggle with rising costs we are seeing even more customers than usual coming across the border to do their weekly or monthly shop and save money doing so
7473662 its nice to win knowing that i had to play well and then actually doing it
7473663 i had two weeks to try to impress nick and the first is out of the way and i seem to have done that i dont know if i have done enough but im going to gleneagles in better shape and hopefully he will take notice
7473664 well its only money and you cant take it with you
7473665 i came to do a job and i didnt do it this week so ill do it next week my missus will be upset with me though i told her id play well and see her tomorrow

7473668 the best in corporate marketing is celebrated with awards that honour the achievement of marketing teams while the diversity of the economy is recognised with a number of sectoral marketing excellence awards for the manufacturing services information property and construction social and public economy sectors
7473669 fundamental role in driving business performance through creativity and imagination
7473670 the cim awards recognise companies who are making the most effective use of marketing to contribute to the effectiveness of their businesses serving customers here in ireland and in international markets
7473671 these awards will be a celebration of what has been accomplished by many organisations from young start up enterprises to mature global players
7473672 i call on all businesses large and small to enter nominations in the wide range of awards that celebrate top class marketing to the best international standards
7473673 im one who tries to talk the economy up instead of all the doom and gloom were hearing at the moment
7473674 the old positive attitude of a cup being half full instead of half empty is what its all about as we need more can do approaches to work
7473675 i now employ 43 people including myself when just eight years ago there was only me
7473676 polish immigrants are very good because of the traditional training that still exists in that country and i have two polish foremen
7473677 i invest a lot in their training and even help them get on language courses as well as assisting with their housing and i have helped with bringing their wives over
7473678 i help them get accommodation and to integrate into the community
7473679 very often even on paper people who have completed training appear fully qualified but they lack the skills that come with actually doing the job
7473680 by comparison you know from someones skills in welding and in fabrication how they handle their equipment and the confidence and abilities that they show and that they know what they are doing
7473681 i pay tribute to all my workforce but theres no doubt the polish people i employee have helped me considerably
7473682 in kenya this year we had a problem about the election
7473683 now we have a good peace in kenya today i am very happy to be the winner from 1968 kenya could not get the gold medal in the marathon in 2008 it is history for my country in the marathon
7473684 all the doctors tell me natures a wonderful thing and that once i get back shell probably have it straight away
7473685 and i know that i will have to come here to play bolton manchester united manchester city here in the north i understand that now
7473686 you always say that first placed team playing against the last is not easy
7473687 chelsea didnt look at any stage like they would rip us apart like they did with portsmouth
7473688 chelsea have had a bad day but a piece of brilliance from deco has saved them thats why they are at the highest level if it hadnt been him they have others who can do that
7473689 it doesnt mean that much to be top after just two games
7473690 but its good for the group to have six points
7473691 but when i am in the club i will discuss this its impossible before an important game with so many problems

7473693 it would become a powerful symbol of unity a statement like the opening of croke park that we are an inclusive open and mature society and that the hatchet of the civil war which has pierced the heart of this nation and almost all its citizens for generations has been buried forever
7473694 a gesture like this from the gaa would do far more than all the talk in the world to advance the cause of ireland for which collins and dev fought to achieve
7473695 at the end of the day though we are different sports
7473696 there were 200 nations competing in athletics here and 40 different countries won medals from china down to the dutch antilles this is a genuine world sport
7473697 we cant sit back and say were the top european nation theres still a lot of hard work to do to ensure were competitive again in 2012
7473698 after the world championships in palma in 2007 people asked how we could go out and win more medals but thats exactly what we did in the worlds at manchester this year
7473699 then people said wed peaked too early and wondered how we would be able to step up again at the olympics
7473700 weve got plans that weve put in place for london but its going to be a really hard task to catch the brits in four years lets not kid ourselves
7473701 h kan has many years and international experience of heading growth companies this means that in partnership with other members of inwidos management he will be well placed to continue to develop inwido
7473702 ive had no calls about kevin doyle for probably about two weeks plus now
7473703 they cant make bids unless they call and i havent had a call so i havent had a bid
7473704 when these things get thrown at you you actually try that much harder
7473705 he thaksin is even more adamant now because this is his love and he wants to show people he is really committed
7473706 i asked the question as well as everyone else is the club for sale and he is quite adamant this club is not for sale and he is here for the long haul
7473707 i asked why did you buy it he said he bought it because there is a 10 year plan
7473708 no lo pod a creer ten a ya 75 a os pero para m era alguien sin edad
7473709 steve played in them last year while pedro is experienced enough hes a european cup winner and nothing will faze him
7473710 you could see from pedros touches against aberdeen and his class on the ball that he is brilliant and can really help us next week
7473711 we can just give him the ball and let him calm the game down
7473712 madjid will also make a debut but he played for a big club at charlton so i have no worries about him coping with it
7473713 you could say it was an injustice but there is nothing we can do about it now
7473714 we only went down the road with a point and i think if i am being honest we deserved more over the 90 minutes but thats football and we need to pick ourselves up
7473715 its not for me to talk about referees they are under a lot of pressure and i am not going to comment
7473716 the clearly positive sign is that the raw material oil and food prices are on the decline and the inflation outlook is more favourable
7473717 on the negative side is the euro zone economy slowing more than expected but overall things are slightly more positive for equities
7473718 some of them may be seeing a buying opportunity at these price levels
7473719 while the commodity markets are still volatile they are no longer going through a one way decline dollar buying momentum seems to be slowing under such conditions
7473720 whether they exist or not is largely irrelevant in a world dominated by sound bite driven perceptions
7473721 of course whos going to let a few facts stand in the way of contrary opinion and litigation eh
7473722 nat rlich sind die bonusr ckstellungen geringer als vor einem jahr allerdings haben wir auch die verbuchung der aktien ge ndert die als teil des bonus zugeteilt werden
7473723 unsere kapitalerh hung war eine klare botschaft mit der alles gesagt ist
7473724 i havent signed anything yet or even though about my future
7473725 im just looking forward to getting home for a bit of time out
7473726 it has been a long five weeks between training camps and the olympic games themselves
7473727 it has been very mentally draining but im proud of the way i performed
7473728 im captain of the irish team and im proud to be in four years time i could still be captain
7473729 i love the amateur game thats what i am all about there are younger lads on the team who will hopefully stay amateur and could be there in 2012 also
7473730 theres nothing i can do about it a scores a score and i just have to settle for silver im disgusted but thats how things go thats sport there has to be a loser
7473731 he threw a few shots there where he hit my elbow and i could hear the chinese going bananas i obviously knew he was getting a score i knew myself it was going to be a hard fight after that
7473732 its ridiculous over the last two weeks weve known body shots havent been scoring
7473733 he was throwing shots and getting scores fair play to him
7473734 i knew it was going to be hard if he got a lead or if it was in any way close even the countback he won in the previous fight that was close
7473735 i was chasing a little bit in the end but i had to i wasnt going to sit back and let the clock tick away

7473740 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7473741 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7473742 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7473743 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7473744 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7473745 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7473746 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7473747 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

7473760 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7473761 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7473762 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7473763 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7473764 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7473765 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7473766 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7473767 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7473768 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7473769 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s

7473771 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7473772 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7473773 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7473774 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7473775 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7473776 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
7473777 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
7473778 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
7473779 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie

7473782 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
7473783 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7473784 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7473785 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
7473786 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
7473787 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7473788 no nos cargen a nosotros que somos los mapuches buenos acciones de otros que son los mapuche malos
7473789 salvar la honra e imagen de mapuches buenos de nuestras comunidades
7473790 la gran mayor a de las comunidades desea el d alogo
7473791 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7473792 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7473793 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
7473794 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7473795 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7473796 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7473797 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7473798 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7473799 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7473800 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

7473841 valuing these properties at a conservative average of 200 000 each indicates that local authority housing stock to a total value of more than 1 billion was vacant across the country in 2005
7473842 dublin city council compares poorly with other local authorities throughout the country
7473843 while it has approximately 23 per cent of housing stock throughout the country figures indicate that in 2006 it had 47 per cent of the vacancies
7473844 the percentage quoted were for 2007 and included both cavan county council and cavan town council in the first six months of this year a high percentage of vacant houses included in the figure had been included in a major refurbishment scheme they had to ensure they met housing standard before they were re allocated
7473845 the minister for education has refused point blank to even consider building a secondary school for the grange and donnybrook area when questioned on the matter she said that traditionally pupils from this area go to school elsewhere
7473846 the ministers response shows the same lack of vision that has held up the building of a primary school in rochestown for almost two decades and passage west since 1998 the need for a secondary school for grange amp donnybrook is obvious to every parent in the area but the attitude of the minister is not to plan for the future but to wait for the crisis that is sure to come

7473849 past two days have shown a 65 decrease in traffic we have around 250 pages last week i went through about 60 of them and adjusted the title tags to something i thought would be more appropriate e g from
7473850 thats the impression im getting the theory being that only an seo would be making changes to the title alt etc tags 6 months after the site has been launched indexed ranked such would seem to be a direct penalty for performing seo work rather than any actual search relevancy filter though change occurs to correct errors and direct targeting better thats good for search engine results isnt it ah never thought of that of course that means a second change and so far in this thread the concensus is that the first change was bad enough if they didnt like the title tag change theyre going to hate the huge sitewide design overhaul thats going to occur next week that will make the site much better too for our users so google will probably drop us another 100 places because of course everything we do is all about google right not our users
7473851 hello all for what its worth my site has been up for about a year and a half very competitive category and i have not been doing full optimization until the last two months or so im seeing decent results as ive been adding pages lately i added about twenty pages for long tail keywords along the same seo theory and didnt get the best placement i then went in and adjusted my title tags and noticed a drop on my next spidering which has been about once a week i left it alone and added more pages i noticed last night my rankings have rebounded for the better now these are not that competitive terms but may provide a little insight
7473852 i dont consider removing 2 3 words or re arranging the order slightly to be

7473869 there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis
7473870 if martin mcguinness does not distance himself from this statement then a full blown crisis is facing the executive next month
7473871 i think there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis policing and justice devolution can only occur if there is sufficient public confidence in the ability of politicians to handle such a sensitive matter i think the question is this will these remarks by sinn fein convince anyone out there that this is mature politics when people are threatening to pull the whole thing down
7473872 bearing in mind the statement went through their official press office one is left with the impression its a bit of kite flying by sinn f in these comments were not off the cuff or out of the blue

7473879 last saturday night there was a rocket attack in the middle of lisnaskea co fermanagh in which several police officers were nearly murdered there was no coordinated political response an emergency executive meeting was convened to address floods while the attempted murder of police went unmentioned if there was a rocket attack on garda in dublin city centre on saturday night brian cowen would call an emergency meeting of political and security figures to agree a strategy to deal with the threat while i dont want to over emphasise the dissident threat they are intent on killing police and there could be civilian deaths too

7473908 there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis
7473909 if martin mcguinness does not distance himself from this statement then a full blown crisis is facing the executive next month
7473910 i think there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis policing and justice devolution can only occur if there is sufficient public confidence in the ability of politicians to handle such a sensitive matter i think the question is this will these remarks by sinn fein convince anyone out there that this is mature politics when people are threatening to pull the whole thing down
7473911 bearing in mind the statement went through their official press office one is left with the impression its a bit of kite flying by sinn f in these comments were not off the cuff or out of the blue

7474002 a collection of poorly chosen photos from real estate listings
7474003 listen to the patient he will tell you the diagnosis
7474004 the importance and challenge of paying for quality nursing care
7474005 historically the economic value that nursing brings to the patient care process has not been recognized or quantified
7474006 improving the quality of nursing care through work environment changes or increases in staffing is viewed by many as an added cost but the benefits in terms of money saved through improved nursing satisfaction and patient outcomes are not considered
7474007 our goal is to make discoveries that will ultimately allow us to intervene with the most effective early therapy before a mild traumatic brain injury results in a chronic problem
7474008 there is a high prevalence of mild traumatic brain injury in soldiers and the consortiums work is driven by that we believe the conclusions of our research also will benefit civilians including athletes who have suffered concussions
7474009 the award of this grant confirms the collaborative platform of mission connect is a powerful and pivotal force in research
7474010 uniting these premier scientists in this shared research effort will accelerate the pace of discovery and provide the courageous men and women in our military with the best possible medical care for the brain injuries they have sustained
7474011 this grant is a huge boost to research in traumatic brain injury and will allow investigators to work together through mission connect
7474012 for baylor college of medicine it will help fund 10 investigators in neurology neuroscience neurosurgery and pain management and physical rehabilitation
7474013 only through collaboration can we make great strides in restoring function for our young brave men and women in the armed forces
7474014 we in the medical field must serve these men and women by moving the frontiers of treatment faster to provide state of the art interventions now
7474015 an effort led by drs doug dewitt and donald prough of the moody center for brain and spinal cord injury mission connect at utmb is a pivotal component of the department of defense project leading the field with a new blast injury model that simulates the exposure to improvised explosive devices additionally innovative therapies using stem cells anti inflammatory agents growth hormones and the expertise of aggressive rehabilitation at the transitional learning center round out the critical components of utmbs efforts
7474016 oxidative stress is a prominent feature of traumatic brain injury
7474017 we have developed a new antioxidant agent based on carbon nanotubes and in collaboration with dr thomas kent of the baylor college of medicine we will examine the therapeutic potential of the agent to treat mild tbi
7474018 our ability to apply novel intervention strategies to nervous system trauma based on the cellular and molecular biology observations made over the years would suggest that we will be able to make an impact on the treatment modalities to be developed over the next five years
7474019 at utmb the neuroscience research community has a long tradition of excellence dedicated to the understanding of trauma to the nervous system we are very happy to be able to make a contribution to this joint texas effort in what is an exemplary example of translational efforts at utmb
7474020 the institutions that make up mission connect have a long history of working together successfully this significant grant is testament to the fact that our collaboration makes us more competitive for funding than any one of our schools would have been alone and more importantly it strengthens our ability to improve the lives of those affected by traumatic brain injury
7474021 the award is very forward thinking since in addition to clinicians it includes neuroscientists working to elucidate the very basic and fundamental causes of nervous system injury all the way down at the molecular and cellular level
7474022 at present we know very little about how brain injury disrupts the connections and communication among neurons the neuroscientists participating will fill this huge gap in our knowledge armed with this information and working together in a collaborative environment clinicians and neuroscientists stand a much better chance of designing new and innovative treatments for traumatic brain injury
7474023 congratulations to dr valadka and the team for receiving this very prestigious and competitive funding which will improve our knowledge of the complex mechanisms involved in traumatic brain injury the awarding of this grant validates our national stature in the neurosciences and will improve patient care and clinical outcomes for many patients
7474024 a model of innovative thinking and close collaboration between multiple institutions to understand and to advance the care of patients with mild traumatic brain injury
7474025 mild traumatic brain injury is a tremendous problem and there is an outstanding team in place ready to tackle it
7474026 we found that eventually they senesced and were cleared from the liver to protect it from an excessive fibrogenic response to acute injury
7474027 cell cycle arrest in the cells that generate the fibrosis places a kind of brake on the process limiting how far it can go
7474028 we hypothesize that hscs when they senesce secret less fibrogenic protein and also stimulate a process that tends to degrade proteins that are still present in a lesion
7474029 senescence is a kind of homeostatic mechanism that enables the tissue to return to its pre damaged state
7474030 this may prove to be broadly relevant to other wound healing processes
7474031 the research raises the perception both of how common these events are and specifically where they may occur
7474032 today with so many more buildings and people a magnitude 5 centered below the city would be extremely attention getting
7474033 wed see billions in damage with some brick buildings falling people would probably be killed
7474034 we need to step backward from the simple old model where you worry about one large obvious fault like they do in california
7474035 the problem here comes from many subtle faults we now see there is earthquake activity on them each one is small but when you add them up they are probably more dangerous than we thought we need to take a very close look
7474036 the probability is not zero and the damage could be great
7474037 it could be like something out of a greek myth
7474038 indian point is situated at the intersection of the two most striking linear features marking the seismicity and also in the midst of a large population that is at risk in case of an accident
7474039 this is clearly one of the least favorable sites in our study area from an earthquake hazard and risk perspective
7474040 new data developed in the last 20 years disclose a substantially higher likelihood of significant earthquake activity in the vicinity of indian point that could exceed the earthquake design for the facility
7474041 nothing happens for a while then it goes with a bang
7474042 is a major substantiation of a feature that bears on the long term earthquake risk of the northeastern united states
7474043 it gives us the best possible evidence that we have an earthquake hazard here that should be a factor in any planning decision it crystallizes the argument that this hazard is not random there is a structure to the location and timing of the earthquakes this enables us to contemplate risk in an entirely different way and since we are able to do that we should be required to do that
7474044 new york is not as prone to earthquakes as california and japan but they do happen this study takes a more realistic look at the possibility of larger ones and why earthquakes concentrate in certain places to understand risk you have to multiply hazard by assets and vulnerability when you factor that in our risk is high too much attention has been paid to the level of hazard and not enough to the risk earthquake hazard is about the same today as in 1609 when henry hudson sailed up the river but earthquake risk is much much higher today since the number of people assets and their vulnerability are so much greater
7474045 we think that the intersection of these two features being so close to indian point makes it a place of greater risk than most other points on the map
7474046 most people underestimate the hazard here any conservative approach will look at geologically similar environments if you do that we are similar to bhuj india where a 2001 magnitude 7 quake killed over 15 000 people there was no obvious sign of strain there there is a mystery here to be solved and we better step back and do our homework
7474047 once you accept that one fault in a family is active you better consider that all the faults in that family could be active we need to adapt our structures with that in mind
7474048 you could debate whether a magnitude 6 or 7 is possible but weve already had three magnitude fives so that is very realistic there is no one now alive now to remember that last one so people tend to forget and having only a partial 300 year history we may not have seen everything we could see there could be surprises things bigger than we have ever seen
7474049 these reports show the most comprehensive picture of nhs dentistry to date under the new contractual arrangements as a qualified dentist myself it is interesting to see how a typical course of dental treatment is changing
7474050 these new figures are tragic and frightening and represent a wake up call for the nation they show that previous estimates of the epidemics size and cost were very much understated the obesity epidemic in australia is having a direct and catastrophic influence on increasing the incidence of type 2 diabetes we know that obesity and type 2 diabetes can be prevented and we need to make fundamental changes in the way we live to arrest the escalating crisis the report underlines the need to shift our focus on health and wellbeing and make prevention our priority
7474051 the fight against obesity requires a new approach that considers the economic and social conditions under which we live and how this is impacting on our health long term policy planning is needed on issues such as urban design food labelling workplace initiatives lifestyle education and making healthy choices easier for australians and their families governments must act outside of concern for their current electoral cycle to address the explosion of obesity and diabetes
7474052 we have known for some time that young and middle aged adults who are overweight run a higher risk of death and it was presumed that this held true for older people in fact our results show that the risk of dying is higher only for the most severely obese but that all older people who are overweight are at significantly increased risk of developing problems with mobility and carrying out everyday tasks
7474053 this research is important because a growing proportion of the population is aged 65 or over and more and more of these older people are overweight in fact in most developed countries middle aged and elderly adults are more likely to be obese than people in any other age group these findings have huge significance for the delivery of health care both now and in the future increasing numbers of older people and higher levels of overweight and obesity will lead to a greater burden of disability and ill health and place an immense strain on health and social services the issue is likely to get worse as time goes on and represents a ticking time bomb for health services around the world
7474054 staying a healthy weight can be a fun and relatively easy thing to do even as people get older
7474055 our experience of running supported walking and cycling groups has shown that older people benefit in many ways from regular physical activity
7474056 people are living longer but this study shows that excess weight can have a real impact on the quality of peoples lives which can reduce the benefit of those extra years
7474057 this report highlights the problem of obesity in an increasingly ageing population
7474058 is a joint entity of the university of exeter the university of plymouth and the nhs in the south west of england and a partner of the combined universities in cornwall
7474059 half of the children whose parents had difficulties in reading and writing found learning to read more challenging than children in the control group the atypical characteristics of these childrens linguistic development indicated the risk at a very early stage and we were also able to draw a clearer picture of the typical progression of a development that indicates reading and writing difficulties
7474060 acquiring the ability to read demands much more practice from these children than from their peers the automatisation of reading poses an additional challenge also a fluent ability to read is a prerequisite to be able to understand a demanding piece of text
7474061 a slow reader isnt able to grasp a given text as a whole and therefore has a hard time following the storyline this is why we should pay special attention not only to the accuracy of reading and writing but also to the comprehension of texts even with quite long sentences
7474062 and in a way that children find amusing even if they do have difficulties in learning to read
7474063 the best time to start these exercises is the latter part of the pre school age but its not too late even after the children have started school the learning result of course improves with repeated training more than once a day and in short sessions the optimal time for a single playing session is however long the children find it enjoyable

7474069 in most capital cities petrol prices crept higher in the latest week after falling sharply over the past month mr james said
7474070 based on trends in the wholesale market the average pump price looks set to consolidate near 1 50 a litre
7474071 the average motorist is now forking out around 209 a month on petrol a saving of around 20 from the highs in mid july but still up 40 a month on a year ago mr james said
7474072 fuelwatch wont work wont give the benefits to consumers that its meant to senator xenophon told abc radio today
7474073 if the wholesale price is determined by the big oil companies and they also control many of the outlets its not a level playing field for those small operators those independent operators in the retail sector
7474074 central to our concerns is the fact that the proposal forces retail prices to be locked in for a 24 hour period association spokesman matthew hanton said
7474075 by banning the intra day price movements of fuel retailers motorists will ultimately pay more at the pump particularly those thousands of motorists that already shop smart and take advantage of the weekly discount cycle

7474078 i saw a wall of ice coming towards us and then we were carried 200 metres
7474079 there was absolutely no noise it was very disturbing we only had time to swerve to the right before being mowed down
7474080 if the snow melts and this might not happen because were close to the end of the summer its possible that the bodies will come to the surface if that happens well go and get them
7474081 it was a very very fine morning i went outside to see what the weather was like and i saw a line of lights moving up the mountain
7474082 i put on my harness i was ready to go i looked again and i asked myself am i dreaming then i understood
7474083 when i say scene from the apocalypse its because there were a lot of injured it was cold it was dark it was stressful
7474084 we found the first casualty who had a broken leg and after that we found a guide who had three broken vertebrae people with hypothermia people in panic people who had been through something horrific
7474085 they were white from head to foot but they were okay they went back to the shelter
7474086 i saw a wall of ice coming towards us and then we were carried 200 metres
7474087 reactive oxygen species lead to oxidative stress in the body which can also cause dna damage we were able to gather clear evidence of a short term increase in certain indicators for oxidative stress during the competition and have already published these results however now we were also able to demonstrate that despite this increase no notable and persistent damage was caused to the athletes dna this is a surprising result which initially appears to contradict the data gathered in similar studies
7474088 the comparable studies analysed different biomarkers for predominantly short lived dna damage our study focused primarily on damage to dna that was subsequently evident in daughter cells following cell division and could therefore be of long term detriment to the body however we can sound the all clear in this respect our study clearly shows that in this case extreme competitive sport did not result in any increase in dna damage
7474089 no acute and persistent dna damage after an ironman triathlon
7474090 this study provides some interesting clues into why some children are more likely to develop into adult snorers and adds to the body of evidence that respiratory problems in early life can lead to the development of respiratory conditions in later life
7474091 snoring is more than just a nuisance and can be a sign of a respiratory condition called sleep apnoea which affects more than 110 000 people in the uk and is caused by the narrowing of the throat during sleep we would welcome further research in this area to establish why exposure to these risk factors causes some children to become snorers in later life
7474092 it has been a great success especially as there have been no major casualties
7474093 the global attention has been fantastic television ratings around the world at record levels and the athletes made history
7474094 but longer term we are looking at growing our position in china which is our fourth largest market and this means increasing brand awareness
7474095 i would definitely say the beijing games were a success for sponsors as there is a tremendous amount of recognition around the companies involved
7474096 we have a very clear target for our presence at the beijing olympics and we want to see a 10 percent improvement for brand enhancement in china
7474097 so far from interim reports and our sales figures the beijing olympics has been a great success
7474098 but just buying the rings is not good enough they need to buy the rings and then spend about twice that amount again to aggregate it that is where the value comes in

7474100 i found the cooking of the inhabitants of the slum in soweto in south africa a lot more diverse than ours
7474101 its true im going to be harsh but i think a lot of english peoples food lacks heart its bland
7474102 its true in the centre of london and in the big northern cities
7474103 its nothing to do with famine or war quite the opposite england is one of the richest countries in the world
7474104 the people im telling you about have huge tv sets a lot bigger than mine they have state of the art mobile phones cars and they go and get drunk in pubs at the weekend their poverty shows in the way they feed themselves

7474155 in the world that i study everybodys trying to kill the biofilm
7474156 but theres not a concrete answer for that and thats why you need to understand methods
7474157 thats why we can be one of the few labs in the world that can focus on methods development
7474158 every time a person buys a product with an epa approved efficacy claim such as kills 99 percent of bacteria the public trusts the validity of the process used to prove that claim
7474159 our goal is to grow bacteria in a way thats relevant to how the bacteria exist where the product is used
7474160 that way we can have more confidence in the products actual effectiveness and so can the public
7474161 so many results depend on the process a person uses

7474168 when these things get thrown at you you actually try that much harder he thaksin is even more adamant now because this is his love and he wants to show people he is really committed
7474169 i asked the question as well as everyone else is the club for sale and he is quite adamant this club is not for sale and he is here for the long haul
7474170 this was a big win for us irrespective of the fact west ham went down to 10 men mark noble was sent off so early i felt we were in control
7474171 there was a real determination in our play and a willingness to ask questions of the opposition
7474172 after two games only no it is only two games if it was the last games of the season maybe there would be pressure but now no
7474173 i think teams have time now to lose some points
7474174 i understand that we didnt play like last week but i also understand the reasons why
7474175 wigan played better than portsmouth they pressured us and they were playing at home the people can help more than they can when we are at stamford bridge
7474176 also i have had many problems this week michael ballack played with a little injury michael essien has not been training for 10 days then trains for two and i needed him to play 90 minutes and mikel john obi is out
7474177 his declarations have been inopportune but nobody is going to be kept at the club against their will

7474195 lespressione coda lunga in inglese the long tail stata coniata dallo stesso anderson in un articolo dellottobre 2004 su wired magazine per descrivere alcuni modelli economici e commerciali come ad esempio amazon com o netflix il termine anche utilizzato comunemente nelle scienze statistiche per definire modelli di distribuzione della ricchezza e di usi lessicali in queste distribuzioni una popolazione ad alta frequenza o ampiezza seguita da una popolazione a bassa frequenza o ampiezza che diminuisce gradatamente tail off in molti casi gli eventi poco frequenti o di bassa ampiezza la coda lunga possono cumulativamente superare in numero o in importanza la porzione iniziale della curva di modo che presi tutti insieme rappresentano la maggioranza anderson sostiene che i prodotti a bassa richiesta o con ridotti volumi di vendita possono collettivamente occupare una quota di mercato equivalente o superiore a quella dei pochi bestseller o blockbuster se il punto vendita o il canale di distribuzione sono abbastanza grandi

7474215 a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being interrogated on the island
7474216 were probably holding around 3 000 people you know bagram air field diego garcia guant namo 16 camps throughout iraq
7474217 theyre behind bars weve got them on diego garcia in bagram air field in guant namo
7474218 we have received concurring confirmations that united states agencies have used diego garcia which is the international legal responsibility of the uk in the processing of high value detainees
7474219 he had received credible evidence from well placed sources familiar with the situation on the island that detainees were held on diego garcia between 2002 and 2003
7474220 the cia officer surprised attendees by volunteering the information apparently to demonstrate that the agency was doing its best to obtain valuable intelligence
7474221 the us may also have kept prisoners on ships within diego garcias territorial waters a contention the us has long denied
7474222 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
7474223 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the us did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
7474224 is a violation of uk law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
7474225 a us plane with a single detainee on board refuelled at the us facility in diego garcia the detainees did not leave the plane and the us government has assured us that no us detainees have ever been held on diego garcia
7474226 neither of the two detainees carried aboard the rendition flights that refuelled at diego garcia was ever part of the cias high value terrorist interrogation program
7474227 the united states government confirmed that with the exception of two cases related to diego garcia in 2002 there have been no other instances in which us intelligence flights landed in the united kingdom our overseas territories or the crown dependencies with a detainee on board since 11 september 2001
7474228 intentionally failed to ask the right questions of the us and accepted implausible us assurances at face value
7474229 this remains a transatlantic cover up of epic proportions while the british government seems content to accept whatever nonsense it is fed by its us allies the sordid truth about diego garcias central role in the unjust rendition and detention of prisoners in the so called war on terror cannot be hidden forever
7474230 it is deplorable that previous us assurances about rendition flights have turned out to be false the failure of the united states administration to tell the truth resulted in the uk government inadvertently misleading our select committee and the house of commons we intend to examine further the extent of uk supervision of us activities on diego garcia including all flights and ships serviced from diego garcia

7474301 ive always believed that you learn more about a person or a company when things are bad than you ever learn about them when things are good like many others ive complained about american airlines in the past because of their poor treatment of their customers
7474302 today however i was more disgusted by this company than ive ever been by any company ive ever done business with since 2000 ive flown 578 814 total miles ive spent literally tens of thousands of dollars with them ive defended them to my friends and continued to choose them when other airlines were significantly cheaper ive cut them slack for poor customer service for canceled flights for marginal on time delays and hours spent on tarmacs waiting for gates to open up and through it all i continued to choose them continued to spend extra money to fly with them
7474303 i called american and politely explained my situation they had an open flight at the right time they were willing to waive the typical 100 change fee with a copy of the death certificate but they were unwilling to waive the 359 fare difference update i was more than willing to provide a death certificate and or the number of the funeral home for the waiver of both fees and told them so they had a chance to turn a terribly sad chapter of my life into a story about what a great company they were and they passed it up
7474304 again i politely explained that i have nearly 600 000 miles flow im a loyal customer that ive been gold or platinum for years now
7474305 american reviewed the policy a few years back and decided that since funeral homes doctors and clothiers dont discount their rates we shouldnt either
7474306 first of all i was asking for them to waive an unnecessary fee not give me a discount secondly thats a stupid comparison doctors and funeral homes dont work on a sliding scale clothing is reusable i could go on with how stupid this quote is but its just not worth the time
7474307 when i told irving the supervisor that id been a loyal customer for years and that i felt that the
7474308 and im not here to argue with you either american in fact im not here to fly with you defend you or support you not only have i lost interested in maintaining our quasi relationship ill now actively work to find alternatives to using you hard to do when you live in dallas but absolutely not impossible ill encourage others to think twice about using you all because you were more interested in potentially getting an extra 359
7474309 how can we expand our world and solve problems of scarcity unless were willing to converse conversations start with a willingness to begin a relationships that is the entire premise of the relationship economy
7474310 its absolutely surreal i never thought that this would be possible
7474311 i wasnt even sure of my medal chances at all
7474312 thats it its a silver medal i am so happy with this and then i won i cant believe it im so happy
7474313 i had some very wise words and some very good advice before coming into the 10m competition to just enjoy it have fun and thats what i thought right from the very first dive in the prelims to the very last dive in the final
7474314 i was definitely stressing it to myself just enjoy the moment there is nothing you can do to change whats about to happen so just enjoy it and it worked
7474315 als je jezelf voor de terein gooit gaat het sneller
7474316 ich nehme das nicht mehr hin ich bin ein mensch und werde behandelt wie ein tier
7474317 wir k mpfen gegen trotzki sinowjew kamenew und andere nicht weil sie juden sind sondern weil sie oppositionelle sind
7474318 die absicht war eindeutig darauf hinzuweisen dass an der spitze der opposition juden stehen
7474319 wenn f r die mehrheit der juden in der udssr die proletarische revolution die hoffnung auf eine wirkliche emanzipation in sich barg so haben der stalinismus und die entartung der udssr diese hoffnungen auf null reduziert wenn der antisemitismus der vater des zionismus ist dann ist der stalinismus sicherlich sein gevatter
7474320 die erfahrung der damals v llig neuen ideologie des antisemitismus machten die ja mit dem christlichen antijudaismus nicht gerade viel zu tun hat
7474321 freundlich zu behandeln dann m chten viele von ihnen rechte christen werden
7474322 nicht weiter versuchen darf kulturell europa im nahen osten zu sein
7474323 der begriff des imperialismus trifft auf jeden fall auf israel nicht zu
7474324 mit seiner kampferfahrenen armee ist israel f r uns im nahen osten eine wirklich n tzliche kraft g be es israel mit dieser streitmacht nicht m ssten wir unsere eigene einsetzen unsererseits handelt es sich also nicht nur um eine selbstlose geste
7474325 manchmal auch zur massiven einschr nkungen in der faktischen gleichbehandlung j discher und arabischer staatsb rger f hrt
7474326 w rden ganz gewiss durch die permanente bedrohungssituation gef rdert der sich die israelische gesellschaft ausgesetzt sieht
7474327 hatten damals noch berwiegend ein interesse an ausgleich mit der arabischen bev lkerung erst das massaker von hebron 1929 macht deutlich dass die realisierung eines j dischen staates nicht auf gegenliebe sto en w rde
7474328 auch eine verh rtung auf der seite der j dischen siedler nach sich gezogen
7474329 wenn wir sagen dass die araber uns angreifen und wir uns verteidigen so ist dies nur die halbe wahrheit was unsere sicherheit und unser leben angeht verteidigen wir uns aber das k mpfen ist nur ein aspekt des konflikts der seinem wesen nach ein politischer ist und politisch gesehen sind wir die aggressoren und sie verteidigen sich

7474332 steht das wo sich ein akzent verschieben lie e in einem akzeptablem verh ltnis zu dem was wir nicht ver ndern k nnen was wir schlucken m ssen
7474333 grat zwischen politischem realismus und prinzipienlosem opportunismus ganz besonders schmal
7474334 daher habe ich meine ganze kraft drangesetzt eine vers hnung herbeizuf hren zwischen dem j dischen volk und dem deutschen volk
7474335 konnte nat rlich an der brd nicht spurlos vor bergehen

7474339 die ungehinderte fortdauernde siedlungspolitik hat kein koh rentes territorium brig gelassen welches als dauerhaftes staatsgebiet f r ein souver nes pal stina zur verf gung stehen k nnte
7474340 wenn die israelischen regierungen an dem konzept des j dischen staates festhalten ist die konfrontation zwischen j discher und arabischer bev lkerung unausweichlich
7474341 das fl chtlingsproblem der pal stinenser steht nicht im gleichen rang
7474342 the bn machinery has not been at its best there is no cohesion among the parties and little fighting spirit if anwar wins big questions will be raised about the preparations and leadership ultimately it will fall on pak lah

7474434 er moet de komende tijd iets ontstaan in de groep de hi rarchie ontbreekt nog een beetje echte leiders zijn er niet we hebben geen extraverte dynamische spelers die de boel op sleeptouw nemen met huntelaar en schaars had je die vorig jaar wel
7474435 aissati was in portugal al goed nu kan hij heel belangrijk worden ook ryan donk en ryan babel brengen wat extras
7474436 we hebben in 2006 het ek gewonnen de mensen verwachten dat nu weer de druk zal daarom veel groter zijn wat dat betreft kun je misschien beter in het buitenland zitten waar je rustig je ding kunt doen reken maar dat in heerenveen elke dag 500 mensen de training bekijken al is dat ook wel weer leuk natuurlijk
7474437 op het wk onder 20 in 2005 was de sfeer in de stadions fantastisch ook nu zijn onze wedstrijden alweer bijna uitverkocht
7474438 want wij hebben dan wat aan kwaliteit ingeleverd de tegenstanders zijn ook hun beste spelers kwijtgeraakt met deze selectie is het bereiken van de halve finales haalbaar als dat lukt mogen we tevreden zijn plaatsing voor de olympische spelen in peking is mijn grote doel
7474439 ik kies nu bewust voor vlaar omdat hij in 2008 ook nog mee mag doen aan de olympische spelen in peking
7474440 hij kan op dit toernooi vast groeien in zijn rol
7474441 deze selectie is volgens mij gelijkwaardig aan de groep die vorig jaar de titel won achterin zijn we misschien zelfs wat sterker geworden over het middenveld maak ik me al helemaal geen zorgen met spelers als hedwiges maduro luigi bruins en julian jenner het enige probleem is de spitspositie straks krijgen we gelukkig ryan babel erbij maar hij is niet te vergelijken met klaas jan huntelaar huntelaar heeft oog voor het doel babel veel minder we missen een makkelijk scorende spits daarom moeten we nu meer als team spelen
7474442 we have exported almost rm340mil worth of cables and rods to europe asia pacific and the middle east in the first six months of this year
7474443 the group expects local demand for its cable products to pick up possibly towards year end and early 2009 based on the expected increase in infrastructure spending under the ninth malaysia plan
7474444 there will be strong demand from the bakun undersea cable project and the sarawak corridor of renewable energy score projects
7474445 there will be substantial demand for 500kv high voltage direct current hvdc overhead transmission lines both in peninsular malaysia and east malaysia
7474446 we will bid for the project as leader universal has a good track record of manufacturing and supplying hvdc transmission lines
7474447 we are looking at going upstream in our manufacturing activities to stay competitive
7474448 the power purchase and implementation agreements and government guarantee were executed in march this year
7474449 the group is aiming to grow the power business to complement its core business in cable and wire
7474450 concession business gives us the stability of income that complements well with our manufacturing businesses

7474460 it was about 2pm when danny rang me and he sounded fine he didnt sound panicked its just not like him to vanish without trace
7474461 dannys very sociable makes friends easily and is highly intelligent hes also very non confrontational
7474462 when i got to koh pha ngan the police knew very little about the case they hadnt even searched the area where danny was last seen its a bit of a disgrace really
7474463 he had been in regular contact with us the whole time so when we didnt hear from him for a couple of days i thought it was pretty strange i started trying to find him and asking around
7474464 there was nothing to suggest he was depressed i really cant fathom what happened to him
7474465 its very very strange the bar isnt near a beach but i suppose its possible he could have wandered down to the sea gone swimming and got into difficulty
7474466 but a body would usually get washed up if someone drowned if hed fallen or had an accident near the bar he would have been found by now
7474467 there can be the occasional fight in the backyard bar but no one saw any argument taking place that day as far as i know

7474472 i can now walk again slowly without the drag but its going to take at least six months of physiotherapy before i start to walk more normally again
7474473 i know what the demands of having four children are
7474474 but six in such a short space of time i sometimes wonder if shes given herself chance to adapt
7474475 thankfully she has done the rather clever thing of having the children all reasonably close in age which will mean that eventually they will all play nicely together
7474476 its f ing great to be home i have to tell you
7474477 we talked about what we could do with colleges given the fact that we have so much traffic coming from them
7474478 the light bulb went off by simul streaming fringe and sarah connor the college students get to see the show and we get the increased fanbase and buzz
7474479 the whole world doesnt revolve round her and she needs to realise that
7474480 our lives are so different shes a wife and a mother and im a young single girl
7474481 shes steering towards looking like her with the dark hair and going really skinny
7474482 but posh doesnt say anything about that i just think get over yourself
7474483 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled

7474485 since the case is sub judice we cant comment as of now however we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and its unfortunate that warner has chosen to file a case so close to our films release in my opinion i dont think our title has any similarity or links with harry potter

7474519 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by the time of christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7474520 its fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7474521 some people have said its as big a financial shock as the great depression and as far as the oil shock goes the rise in oil prices is in the same order of magnitude that we had to deal in the 1970s
7474522 there are periods when markets look like they are getting better then another grenade explodes another bout of fear of sustainability of some financial institutions maybe intervention by the authorities
7474523 it has been very much ebb and flow and the mood here is very much one of financial caution as regards the next year we have our fingers crossed but there is the recognition there is still quite a long way to go yet
7474524 on the assumption commodity prices remain stable and if anything fall back then inflation should drop back as we go through next year
7474525 one would hope that the conditions in credit markets should gradually start to improve and those two factors will help to ensure growth will start to pick up as we go through next year
7474526 its going to be a tricky period household real income is very low that will make it difficult for households and there are difficult social issues that will arise
7474527 but the important thing is people realise this is just a transitory period of subdued of growth and we will get through the other side and growth will resume to more normal levels
7474528 hopefully we can go back to something like the steady growth that we experienced over the past decade

7474558 we all know that microsoft can update windows xp at will if automatic updates are enabled did you know that microsoft can also update your operating system even if you disabled automatic updates most users would probably deny that this is possible but it turns out to be true several researchers discovered that microsoft was actually updating nine files in windows vista and windows xp sp2 without the users consent and with automatic updates turned off the nine files in question are not the same and they seem to the update mechanism itself it still raises the question if microsoft should be allowed to update files on your system without asking for your permission instead while the updates this time did not seem to be critical or change functionality it could very well be that microsoft decides to do so the next time im thinking of drm and anti piracy measures for instance

7474563 but how could ur uncle marry his daughters best friend and how did the daughter go on with it i dont understand samiira
7474564 i couldnt figure who u were u grew up a lot and many things changed and u even grew this
7474565 u also changed a lot u became chubby and old and some how ur tone changed a bit
7474566 haa they are my cousins they came last year come on let me introduce u

7474574 shhh haiga qasin sheekada isug she said and went on with the story
7474575 now the family is not as peaceful as they look there are internal feuds and grudges and yasmin being the oldest child of the old man she has a bad grudge with her step mom its something that got to do with the way she brought them up and such stuff she wasnt fair
7474576 her mom died when yasmin and her siblings were babies

7474590 ga hier weg maar maak geen lawaai want als ze erachter komen dan vermoorden ze u maar mij eerst

7474602 if jet fuel were to stay at current levels for several years and virgin blue could not significantly increase fares it would not survive jp morgan analysts matthew crowe and russell crichton brown wrote in a note
7474603 a bag costs us more to put through an airplane than a passenger
7474604 tiger has had to re allocate its resources to meet the demand in its next stage of growth tiger airways spokesman matt hobbs said in a statement
7474605 what we want to do is redeploy capacity rather than cut flying to where we can maximize our revenue
7474606 the fact is that fuel prices are something we have no control over so we have to look harder at areas where we do have control
7474607 despite our fuel hedging strategy fuel surcharges two separate across the board fare increases and a recruitment freeze we are not bridging the widening gap between the actual increase in the cost of fuel and the amount we offset
7474608 this will enable us to make significant changes to domestic and international flying for both qantas and jetstar in some cases this will involve pulling off routes entirely in other cases we will scale back frequencies and capacity
7474609 wherever possible we have tried to minimise the overall impact of the changes
7474610 we have been delighted with the complimentary customer feedback on qantas premium economy cabin which demonstrates a clear place for a product of this type and quality forward bookings show high levels of demand
7474611 the new service also includes priority check in dedicated cabin crew an additional hand baggage allowance and priority boarding and disembarkation
7474612 these changes will establish the program as a world leader among loyalty programs in terms of the value it offers members and the breadth of product choices
7474613 these people speculators and hedge funds buy oil futures and say that this or that event may cause an oil shortage
7474614 not very long after this people react to this and by then the message would be there is a shortage of supply even though there is none
7474615 first look at the oil tankers at sea if they are not moving and just floating out at sea that means they have no crude or processed oil to transport that is not happening and that means there is no shortage
7474616 second go to the petrol stations if there are long queues that means there is a shortage again this is not happening and this can only mean there is more than enough supply
7474617 as an ex oilman i tell you there is no shortage
7474618 i always believe in the brick and mortar something i can touch these people are trading with nothing
7474619 many years ago we at shell had wanted to buy enron i was leading the team then and we hired over 60 consultants to study how a company with no oil fields refineries or gas stations could make so much money
7474620 one of the consultants tried to convince me to recommend to the shell bosses to buy enron but i said no because i could not touch what they were trading in
7474621 we are considering a range of options which may include capacity reductions redeployment of aircraft fare reviews and several other initiatives not just the single demand side lever of fare reviews as the jpmorgan report suggested
7474622 just as importantly the supply side should be considered in any economic argument
7474623 in the airline business you have two choices today you can decide to do something or you can sit and pray that fuel is going to go back to 100 or 80
7474624 the things were looking at are reductions in capacity further cash management
7474625 were looking at what we can do in terms of redeploying planes into different more profitable markets
7474626 the long list of changes that includes the installation of new air conditioning carpets bathrooms and fittings will completely refresh and reposition the hotel and its suitability to both corporate and leisure visitors
7474627 to date we have not experienced any significant issues as a result of the unions overtime bans
7474628 with four hour strikes planned for sydney and brisbane on thursday and melbourne on friday we expect only small changes to our flight schedule
7474629 our new lounges have been purpose built to provide space increased privacy and a range of business services for our premium customers
7474630 qantas is the business travellers airline and our facilities are designed to meet their particular needs

7474741 far from being merely associated with quantum measurements this randomness is at the very heart of reality
7474742 it even creates the sensation of the present which is so conspicuously absent from todays physics
7474743 the main reason was that the result was so abstract it did not appear to connect directly with physics
7474744 the universe is rich enough to be self referencing for instance im aware of myself
7474745 this ghostly long range connectivity is apparently outside of space
7474746 einstein thought an explanation of the present was beyond theoretical physics
7474747 the present is therefore real and distinct from an imagined future and a recorded past
7474748 somehow in the process of generating reality the pseudo objects must become hidden from view
7474749 if our system self organises to a state of criticality we can construct reality from pseudo objects and simultaneously hide them from view
7474750 but it ceases to be a problem if self organised criticality hides the lowest layer of reality
7474751 the start up pseudo objects can be viewed as nothing more than a bundle of weakly linked pseudo objects and so on ad infinitum but no experiment will be able to probe this structure so we have covered our tracks completely
7474752 i have never heard of anyone working on such a fundamental level as this
7474753 i agree with the basic premise that everything is ultimately random but am still sceptical of the details
7474754 it would be much more convincing if cahill and klinger could show something physical that is some physical law emerging from this
7474755 for example if this is to be a model of space i would expect something like einsteins field equation for local space curvatures emerging now that would be something
7474756 i would be amazed though pleased if they could actually do what you say they claim to
7474757 ive seen several physics papers like this that try to get space time or even the laws of physics to emerge from random structures at a lower level
7474758 theyre interesting efforts and show how deeply ingrained the statistical point of view is in physics but they are difficult path breaking and highly tentative efforts far removed from the mainstream of contemporary physics
7474759 it is the logic of the limitations of logic that is ultimately responsible for generating this new physics which appears to be predicting something very much like our reality
7474760 we were in love with each other at the time we recorded that album we were new friends discovering new parts about each other and we had songs and we had the ability to translate those songs into records that was astounding and we knew it
7474761 when we walked out of the studio with that two track under our arm we knew what it was going to do we knew that it was going to be a hit we knew that we had nailed something that wasnt really that popular kind of then it was all led zeppelin and jimi hendrix and stuff and here comes this little acoustic record
7474762 its about three women that i loved one of whom was christine hinton the girl who got killed who was my girlfriend and one of whom was joni mitchell and the other one is somebody that i cant tell it might be my best song
7474763 crosby sent me a tape of guinnevere in 1968 and it was one of the things that made me really realize that this man was a profound thinker and a great musician guinnevere and deja vu were on the same tape and it was then that i realized that crosby was something special and weve had a great time singing that song cause we never do it the same way twice
7474764 i wrote that right after they assassinated bobby kennedy it was a result of losing him of losing john kennedy and martin luther king i started to feel overwhelmed it seemed as if it was ballot by bullet it seemed as if it didnt matter how good a person we could find to put up as an inspiration and a leader for the good that somehow the other side would triumph by simply gunning them down
7474765 that was written by paul kanter and stephen stills and myself on my boat in florida its one of my most favorite crosby stills amp nash songs i really love what it says i really love how unusual it is and i really love the harmonies its definitely a science fiction song no question
7474766 in 1966 i was visiting morocco on vacation to marrakesh and getting on a train and having a first class ticket and then realizing that the first class compartment was completely boring so i decide im going to go and see what the rest of the train is like and the rest of the train was fascinating just like the song says there were ducks and pigs and chickens all over the place and people lighting fires its literally the song as it is what happened to me
7474767 when i wrote it i used cardboard shirt blocking you know those things from the cleaners cause they were harder to lose than pieces of paper and they didnt crumple up i could line them up on music stands and theyd stand up
7474768 probably one of my favorite crosby stills amp nash songs stephens the only one that plays on the suite
7474769 that was the first song we ever sang together it was in joni mitchells living room
7474770 no it was at cass elliots dining room table in the corner in a stucco room near the kitchen and the pool
7474771 i wouldve never sung for the first time with you guys in front of joni mitchell she was too intimidating
7474772 weve been fighting about this for 40 years actually since our last tour especially
7474773 and if you play the blues like i do you have the extra delight of having another voice with which to express yourself which is what we are doing with our screaming and a crying and a weeping guitars
7474774 the message that the blues carry is a popular one in this town these days anyway as demographics reveal that more american guys from the babyboomer generations and similar european dudes are heading to thailand for extended breaks
7474775 then white kids applied new interpretations to the form as they embraced and fashioned rock music and at the same time gave the blues a new voice cool looking electric guitars and powerful amplifiers added to the awesome delivery of this great music and the late part of the swinging sixties and most of the seventies was dominated by rock music which was born from the blues and the influential music of chuck berry and many more like him the rolling stones was a blues band for chrissake
7474776 well local blues stars chai and his blues maniacs have been carrying the torch for the blues down at saxophone pub at victory monument for years
7474777 but me and my buddies got our ball rollin here with the delta boys back in the late 1990s and we was kept busy spreading the word until the band folded as members moved on
7474778 and we like to think that our popularity is due to the fact that like the old blues masters we try to play the real thing that is genuine blues and stay away from the hollywood style blues brothers approach we play chicago blues delta blues and texas blues and little or no hollywood blues
7474779 the bands music has enjoyed phenomenal success since the cd went up on the net and weve shifted a load of cds and individual tracks on one site alone
7474780 while all that was going on the bands london office has done all the legwork to get the album to a bigger audience and from june 11 we went live on itunes stores around the world itunes u s itunes australia n z itunes japan itunes canada itunes uk european union and then on other important net retail outlets including rhapsody napster emusic groupietunes amazon mp3 lala and shockhound that means the band and its music is now represented on nearly 30 sites worldwide now
7474781 sales should go up a gear now we hope as most of what we earn goes to the bands own special charity
7474782 billy the mountain were born in the blues and then took a breath of steely dan little feat dylan and pink floyd and came out the other end smiling youll hear that journey in their music which is delivered by some very fine musicians too they say its great sunday morning music
7474783 and this band will sell we reckon they are the pink floyd of this new century and throw in a touch of little feat and steely dan and you have a very powerful combination of grooves and rock steady tunes supporting cool lyrics and awesome musicianship no shredders and no predictable cock rock neither
7474784 to great response we ran some of the tunes naked on the bands own www myspace com thebillymountain site and then the band principally nicolai kehlet took over production and the result is an album of eight or nine very special songs and i have to say the big labels are looking to get their hands on this cool new music but the band wants this to go to market via the internet and we support that idea given that we have little alternative
7474785 but the songs are awesome and i predict this album this breath of musical fresh air is going to be a classic
7474786 we had a lot fun producing the album at my own paradise studio here in bangkok and we work well together with zanders great lyrics and tunes and dare i say my ear for a good beat and an fm radio friendly vibe
7474787 our fans tease us that we are the floyd or steely dan of the 21st century and thats crazy and scary we are all floyd and steely dan fans of course but they are like gods to us the idea that we are composers on the same planet is almost ridiculous but we like the compliment that we might sound a bit like little feat and our new stuff is definitely going there if anywhere at all
7474788 driven by a desire to not let lowell george be forgotten and everything we are writing right now is kind of a tribute to him and his gift as a groovemeister singer and slide god
7474789 theres a bit of hendrix in there too and if we are exposing our origins and ages then so be it its about time i grew up listening and playing while those guys zappa captain beefheart and alex harvey and jimi and zepp were changing the world and were going back consciously or otherwise to a time when music was new and adventurous and worth queuing to see live i just hope we can do the times justice
7474790 billy the mountain has won band for the day and from everyone on the bftd team we offer our best wishes to everyone involved in their success we hope now they will not only be seen and heard by thousands of people but that they will sell a large number of their bftd tracks on the day as our featured artist
7474791 its a great honour to be acknowledged by such an important music site and we will make the most of our day in the sun telling everyone that we are todays band for the day
7474792 and the icing on the cake is our kids charity makes more income from sales on this band for the day feature
7474793 oh we have too much income and assets to qualify
7474794 no compromises managed to find the right designer and the right manufacturer and at the launch of the new range at the 2005 thai furniture federation fair tiff took the award for the best modern design at the fair and a best designer award too
7474795 we built the perfect triangle for this business and for new product development of any kind i took care of the design process consulting regularly with the client over the net and the very occasional visit then once the designs were approved i took care of the manufacturing and quality control all just a drive away from my office and then when the finished product was delivered to kirkodan they went ahead efficiently marketing the new range a process in which they are undoubtedly the experts this was a very efficient uncluttered process and we also produced the whole range from conception to sale in record time
7474796 my original designs were of course subject to detailed feedback from the kircodan offices and this streamlined design and production process undoubtedly helped produce a very highly developed and cutting edge range of furniture which incidentally is selling like hotcakes around the world
7474797 consequently we contacted some well known danish architects arne vodder and erik steen larsen and they designed some chairs tables and benches many of which are still popular among our customers today and over the years a number of other architects have joined our company and our designs are now selling in most parts of the world
7474798 the deliberate variety in our designs is aimed at different markets and to suit a variety of tastes demands and locations gardens patios conservatories restaurants and public areas our customers in the united states for instance seldom buy the same designs as customers from europe and even inside europe there are different tastes
7474799 in 2001 we met klaus kummer who now lives in bangkok but graduated from a well known danish design school at the time we met klaus he was mainly designing office furniture for a thai company acmen but we soon realised that he had a good eye for design and could easily use his skills to design other kinds of furniture to create a new model in our business three parties have to cooperate the buyer the designer and the producer we already had a long lasting relationship with o k wood products in bangkok who has produced all our furniture since 1990 and now with a designer actually living in bangkok it was easier to develop and test new models klaus could quickly correct and adjust the samples made by o k wood to the drawings that klaus and we had agreed upon

7474831 it was about 2pm when danny rang me and he sounded fine he didnt sound panicked its just not like him to vanish without trace
7474832 dannys very sociable makes friends easily and is highly intelligent hes also very non confrontational
7474833 when i got to koh pha ngan the police knew very little about the case they hadnt even searched the area where danny was last seen its a bit of a disgrace really
7474834 he had been in regular contact with us the whole time so when we didnt hear from him for a couple of days i thought it was pretty strange i started trying to find him and asking around
7474835 there was nothing to suggest he was depressed i really cant fathom what happened to him
7474836 its very very strange the bar isnt near a beach but i suppose its possible he could have wandered down to the sea gone swimming and got into difficulty
7474837 but a body would usually get washed up if someone drowned if hed fallen or had an accident near the bar he would have been found by now
7474838 there can be the occasional fight in the backyard bar but no one saw any argument taking place that day as far as i know

7474850 this is a day of joy for the fighters of freedom and independence said said al attaba 56 the longest serving palestinian prisoner who had been serving a life sentence since 1977 for killing an israeli woman
7474851 it is like a wedding celebration for the palestinian people but our joy will not be complete until all palestinian prisoners are released he said by telephone referring to the some 11 000 palestinians still jailed in israel
7474852 abu ali yatta who was jailed in 1979 for killing an israeli student
7474853 blood on their hands who have been implicated in deadly attacks against its citizens
7474854 this is a big day we have been awaiting for 32 years said attabas sister sanaa who along with friends and family has been preparing a heros welcome for her brother when he returns to his home in the west bank city of nablus
7474855 it is a gesture towards the palestinian leadership to strengthen moderate and pragmatic forces olmerts spokesman mark regev said
7474856 we hope it will contribute to a positive climate he said it is not easy to release prisoners and particularly those who have been involved in murderous terrorist attacks
7474857 when you look at some of the things you say why didnt they pick that up but then you understand that actually theyre not trained or havent the experience to understand the college of emergency medicines tony joseph told seven
7474858 any avoidable death clearly is a great concern professor steven boyages from the service said
7474859 im looking forward to the discussions with the east timorese well work this through but the scheme as we announced it at the niue pacific islands forum summit is as it stands he told abc radio
7474860 one of the matters to report back is this and that is to be by years end and possibly earlier in terms of feasibility mr rudd said
7474861 but lets take it from the ground up theres still work to be done
7474862 we agreed with the australian government with the prime minister that we will discuss how we can participate and how the australian government can give us this opportunity he said
7474863 we have agreed to launch a joint education training and employment initiative which will come back to us with specific recommendations for action by years end mr rudd said
7474864 in particular what we are looking at is the needs in the timor leste public sector and its public service for an intensified training program grassroots middle level and senior level in order to make sure that east timor is properly equipped to address its challenges for development
7474865 the specialist training wing will allow the east timorese defence force to continue to develop as a national institution that secures and builds a better future for this vibrant democracy he said in a statement
7474866 in most capital cities petrol prices crept higher in the latest week after falling sharply over the past month mr james said
7474867 based on trends in the wholesale market the average pump price looks set to consolidate near 1 50 a litre
7474868 the average motorist is now forking out around 209 a month on petrol a saving of around 20 from the highs in mid july but still up 40 a month on a year ago mr james said
7474869 fuelwatch wont work wont give the benefits to consumers that its meant to senator xenophon told abc radio today
7474870 if the wholesale price is determined by the big oil companies and they also control many of the outlets its not a level playing field for those small operators those independent operators in the retail sector
7474871 central to our concerns is the fact that the proposal forces retail prices to be locked in for a 24 hour period association spokesman matthew hanton said

7474881 the hardest part about blogging is coming up with the content when i blog my goal is to put out 8 posts per month thats 2 per week
7474882 is there a business blogging routine or what do you normally do
7474883 once a month i do a podcast on real estate related topics i blog the podcast one down seven to go usually i will blog on my new listings typically i will do 4 postings on these i dont want to have too many listings posted as the content is not well rounded after my brochure is created i will simply copy it and post it as a blog essentially its me plagiarizing myself five down three to go whenever i read the newspaper or watch the news if there is any real estate related topic being talked about i simply comment on it with whatever thoughts come to mind and doing three of those per month is a no brainer three down none to go
7474884 how does your business blog shape up versus other forms of advertising
7474885 afc is in mijn ogen n van de beste amateurvoetbalverenigingen van nederland en laten we duidelijk zijn iedere trainer wil wel naar deze club afc is dan ook het ajax van amsterdam en wil altijd kampioen worden als je niet tegen die druk kunt moet je er niet gaan voetballen of trainer worden
7474886 bij dws moesten we leuren om iemand er bij te krijgen hier bij afc is dat totaal anders er bieden zich bijna dagelijks nieuwe spelers aan om op goed genoeg te mogen voetballen we moeten zelfs de deur dicht houden en dat is een compleet nieuw fenomeen voor mij
7474887 daar kreeg ik een a contract en speelde nog in de europacup tegen fc k ln
7474888 bij dws heb ik er uit gehaald wat erin zat maar om er al na een jaar weg te lopen dat zit eenvoudig niet in mijn karakter
7474889 dit seizoen zal zwaar worden alle hoofdklassers focussen zich op de topklasse maar ik heb goede verwachtingen van afc in de selectie zitten acht nieuwe spelers pinto is weer terug van fc den bosch we hebben centrale middenvelder willem scheerens van dwv en vleugelspits malcolm esajas kwam mee van dws tot nu was het als je tegen afc speelt en er bovenop gaat kletsen win je altijd dat moet er nu af het roer gaat om fysiek zijn we een stuk sterker geworden
7474890 i still read a newspaper but thats yesterdays news by the time i get to the newspaper

7474894 die branche und die betreiber unterst tzen uns eindeutig darin die messe in leipzig fortzuf hren
7474895 wir danken der messe leipzig f r den guten job den sie in den vergangenen jahren mit der durchf hrung der gc gemacht hat f r uns steht aber fest dass die gro e branchenmesse im computer und videospielbereich ab n chstem jahr in k ln stattfindet

7474897 in leipzig hat die messe bisher sehr gut funktioniert der umzug nach k ln ist aber aufgrund der wachsenden internationalen bedeutung der veranstaltung ein wichtiger schritt zur zukunftssicherung des messestandorts deutschland

7474902 meer variatie aan acts de komende jaren moeten we de diepte in
7474903 wij willen mensen meegeven dat ze moeten genieten van elektrische apparatuur
7474904 ik kom voor de gezelligheid de sfeer de hele entourage zelf ben ik niet zo van het alternatieve daarom vind ik dit festival leuk
7474905 wat dat betreft komen we niet echt aan ons trekken
7474906 takes place october 11 at the thomas amp mack center in las vegas a heavyweight bout between andrei arlovski and josh barnett headlines the event
7474907 which has sold more than 500 000 copies in the u s and was osbournes first all new studio recording in six years
7474908 acho que o ocidente se impressionou conosco e essas duas semanas foram uma janela que permitiu aos dois lados ocidente e oriente interagir e se conhecer melhor acho que seremos olhados com mais respeito a partir de agora

7474914 the 42nd montreux jazz festival was a particularly good time and im grateful to claude nobs for the superb gift he presented to each member of the band a massive four volume book tracing his history with the festival fascinating stuff

7474921 sarah and brent are incredibly dedicated and talented professionals and these results prove it were also gratified to see our new all carbon multisport bike perform so well in its debut at the olympics
7474922 normally you wouldnt ride a new bike in an event like the olympics
7474923 but when i rode the triad in training i knew i had to have it for this event im glad i did because the cycling segment was much faster and more difficult than our team expected the triad helped me stay in the lead group putting me in a great position to start the run
7474924 the bike segment was hilly but i was able to ride to the top of the climbs with ease and transition to the run with the energy i needed to win

7474939 way that is most advantageous to the customer and least expensive for us
7474940 there is a well developed space that ing started in
7474941 it doesnt matter how much you hate china and chinese we are destined to be stronger and stronger we will disappoint you i feel sorry for you again
7474942 one cannot help upon reading such comments perceiving that the chinese feel an immense patriotism which we in the west have often tended to underestimate any critical reporting on the part of the foreign media is immediately met with charges of bias and this presumably from fairly ordinary citizens what i and no doubt many other foreign observers find hard to understand is the source of all this national pride
7474943 please keep your hands of our motherland because it is our own family problems we would love to talk to you if you try to understand us a bit more in a fairly way we like to make friends with you as we did never truly hated you even you destroyed our country and cut our land in pieces many years ago read the chinese history in 1899 and during the 20s 30s
7474944 oh yes everything is on us milk price gone up cause the chinese started drinking milk fiscal deficit cause chinas weak currency soaring unemployment cause chinese cheap stuff anything else dont you need worry about chinas going to skip the responsibilities this world got to be a fair world the new china is never to be anyones scapegoat
7474945 no matter bush comes or not olympic will continue business between china and american will continue tibetans remain in the chinese family will continue and so will the communitist partys rule
7474946 bbc continues to publish distortion about china why dont you just add up all the emission by developed countries in the last century and then compared will all the emission by china then there will be no argument about who are the real contributors to the global warming why bbc do not do that is baffling unless bbc has a hidden agenda to smeared chinas good name
7474947 the reason why west media can dare to demonize china is that chinese people are too nice when they face west
7474948 this should be a pretty good year for leaf color change
7474949 although there was enough rainfall this spring to keep the trees healthy we are still in drought conditions in the western part of the state which surprisingly is good for fall color fortunately the summer temperatures have not been as consistently hot as we had last year so we should not experience the early leaf drop we had last fall it all adds up to a nice long progression of fall color
7474950 if the temperatures in september and october cooperate and cool down contributing to the breakdown of chlorophyll we should expect to see some brilliant fall colors this year
7474951 last year there was not much of a peak although we did see some brilliant color this year the trees should be on a more typical color schedule peaking in mid october in the mountains
7474952 and a sharp cooling of temperatures in september and october would really cause the colors to burst as this stimulates the production of anthocyanin or red pigments

7474954 we know that the atlantic basin hurricane season peaks from august to october but long term prediction of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes is still a developing science
7474955 these events all point out the urgent need to better understand earths natural processes and how to live with them
7474956 iype recognizes that earth can be a dangerous place as our growing world population tends to settle along the coastal and mountainous areas of the continents our communities become more vulnerable to the risks of multiple hazards
7474957 we have made important strides in hazard science and reducing risk using scientific knowledge coupled with monitoring and warning systems there is however much still to learn
7474958 it is critical to partner with communities engineers government officials and emergency preparedness personnel to successfully prepare for disasters and build resilient communities

7475010 diese ergebnisse erkl ren sich vor allem aus der tatsache dass financial supply chain management im klassischen organigramm keinen platz hat und an der schnittstelle zwischen der finanz und einkaufsabteilung liegt
7475011 das hat zur folge dass die einkaufsabteilung sich bislang kaum mit den finanztechnischen aspekten ihrer t tigkeit befasst und der finanzabteilung wiederum das inhaltliche know how fehlt um das thema effektiv zu managen zahlreiche unternehmen haben dies inzwischen erkannt doch die praktische umsetzung l sst in vielen bereichen noch auf sich warten
7475012 ein blick auf asien und die usa wo supply chain financing eine wichtige und etablierte strategie ist zeigt welche chancen europ ische unternehmen hier vergeben
7475013 im hinblick auf die finanzielle stabilit t der zulieferer die transparenz der wertsch pfungskette und kosteneinsparungen lassen sich hier erhebliche potenziale heben
7475014 unternehmen aus hochsteuerl ndern haben im globalen markt einen strukturellen nachteil gegen ber wettbewerbern deren einkaufsorganisationen die steuervorteile anderer standorte nutzen die komplexe frage wie man mit dieser ungleichheit umgehen soll l sst sich nicht eindeutig beantworten sie aber nicht zu erkennen und zu analysieren ist schlicht fahrl ssig

7475045 just got off the phone with another reporter i told her no i wasnt specifically trying to get bloggers to join a union but rather i was looking at any and all vehicles through which bloggers could affiliate and thus get affordable health insurance no there really wasnt anyone we could bargain with about wages and working conditions and yes i did think we deserved support as opposed to someone who blogs about say model trains because after all we raised lots and lots of money for democrats last year and targeted it into key races namely that our strength was in making local races national and sending financial support their way

7475117 it is heartening that assam is taking the lead in setting up medical colleges
7475118 there is a major shortage of trained medical professionals and nurses in the country and this is a major challenge for us in providing healthcare services to the people of india
7475119 we need to address these issues both at the national and the regional levels to ensure that there are no shortage of doctors and nurses it is heartening that assam is taking the lead in setting up medical colleges
7475120 assam is taking the lead in showing the rest of india in terms of providing adequate healthcare delivery especially in the rural sector
7475121 the results of the national rural health mission nrhm in assam were very encouraging and the state government needs to be complimented for it

7475168 its easy when things are going well that everyone close to you puts your arms on their shoulders to say you are number one number one number one and then suddenly when you have a difficult situation then you see ha ha this is already a boiled driver thats not the case
7475169 hes the world champion we are a team and of course we will support everyone of the team and above all of course kimi because we trust him 100 percent
7475170 its in the difficult moments that the team has to stay together we dont have any doubt at all about kimis performance and im pretty sure he will come back from here up to the end in brazil
7475171 when youre a driver first of all you are really able to look inside and understand what things are going well and the things that are going wrong and for sure at this moment we because i want to stress and underline the fact that we have to work together and understand how on our side we can improve and help
7475172 and im pretty sure that as i said before once again that hes totally committed and you will see up again in the end because he wants to show and we want to show that hes the world champion believe me
7475173 well of course this is a problem that in this condition make us not sleep very well
7475174 if you dont arrive in races it is difficult in a championship that is so tight and you lose points on the reliability to be up in both classifications
7475175 the only thing we can do is to work hard and try to understand whats the reason for these failures and work
7475176 thats the only thing we have to do and keep fighting because on the other side we saw great performance of the car coming back and this is what we want

7475179 hey that seems like a good way to spend the afternoon
7475180 the pattern of booking has been very different this year we have never had so many enquiries from people ringing on the day and wanting to stay that night
7475181 it looks as though people have literally got the car loaded up in the morning and are ready to go and seize the moment
7475182 many guests however are turning up without a few essentials we thought we had better help so we are offering an overnight kit packed with a dressing gown toothbrush toothpaste razor and shaving foam so a last minute break is as stress free as possible
7475183 we want to make sure we are providing what our clients want
7475184 i think everyone is appreciating the attractions closer to home now and as a family friendly hotel in beautiful grounds next to our theme park camelot we are ideal for a stress free and affordable break
7475185 in the west bank most students will have to cross one of more than 600 physical obstacles to movement
7475186 last year half of the teachers in my school arrived late in the morning because there was no transportation due to fuel shortages but there were teachers who walked long distances in gaza city to come to school and we appreciate their efforts if the blockade continues on gaza i will not be able to go to school and continue my education there will be no text books and stationary and teachers wont be able to come to school without transportation my father is not working and my family can barely afford food for us so it is difficult for them to pay for school needs and expenses my brother mohammed couldnt go to university and my sister haya will not go to school to study tawjihi grade 12 this year because there is no money to pay for the expenses and buy her new jelbab secondary school uniform my goal in life is to continue in my education and not to stop for any reason i dont want to step back i will continue my education because i am a clever student and i am one of the top 10 students in my class
7475187 these were men who had been sentenced and found guilty by the supreme court walking around freely
7475188 it was evening around the time for the last prayer when armed men came and took my son islamuddin by force i have eye witness statements from nine people that he was there from that night until now my son has never been seen
7475189 the commander and three of his fighters came and took my wife out of our home and took her to their house about 200 metres away and in front of these witnesses raped her
7475190 there are difficulties were rebuilding institutions including our justice institutions and there are shortcomings but the president and the government are committed to the rule of law on all equally
7475191 theyre in the government karzai the americans the british sit down with them they have impunity theyve become very courageous and can do whatever crimes they like
7475192 weve already lost our son our honour weve sold our land to pay for legal costs and weve lost our home what else can we lose

7475195 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7475196 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7475197 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip
7475198 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
7475199 told us that the kindle is definitely selling very well but they also said the analysts and reporters giving out these extremely high estimates did not run them by company
7475200 i have been tracking the sales of kindle editions of our books against sales of the printed versions for the past almost eight months kindle sales have declined noticeably over the past few weeks while print editions continue to sell at a steady pace
7475201 were sticking by our sources on the estimates of units shipped from the factories in china
7475202 amazon is working on a new version of the kindle and sees a big opportunity to market its e book reader to college students mcadams wright ragen analyst tim bueneman said friday in an e mailed note based on meetings with management
7475203 the convenience of having your newspapers pushed to you full text newspapers and blogs is fantastic
7475204 i recently rented a kindle from the library at my school they have 6 kindles which they have for rent as a pilot program
7475205 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7475206 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7475207 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7475208 especially in flash flood type of storms where a lot of water and debris are generated very quickly and can pile up against the fences very rapidly
7475209 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy
7475210 he does not waive us doing what we would have to do without the waiver so it doesnt change anything in the environment
7475211 the monument had suggested that they take into consideration everything that can happen with a weather event
7475212 we had a concern that this was going to happen

7475214 things im proud of having accomplished with the deeprockdrive team
7475215 things i wish id have done differently with my first startup
7475216 building a startup is the most difficult and most rewarding thing anyone can do sometimes you can even make some money at the end of it all there are so many things that can go wrong it is a miracle when a startup actually makes it it is important to celebrate our successes learn from our failures and value them equally failure is important because success is a terrible teacher
7475217 web 2 0 but im trying to shy away from that phrase because its a loaded term now and i dont want you to think its necessarily anything new or a specific thing its a name that has been given to an emerging trend
7475218 very soon all single player gaming will happen within a multiplayer context of connectivity persistent and publicly visible profiles and awareness of other users
7475219 the fallacy is to think that social networks are just made up of people theyre not social networks consist of people who are connected by a shared object
7475220 social complexity increases based on economic participation you need people to be economic participants even when not actively present
7475221 this edition of the series was filmed before the recent earthquake
7475222 there are now tremendous opportunities for china and the uk to build strong trade and cultural links as a result of london following beijing as the host city for the olympic games bilateral relations are also very important and companies like china holidays assist in no small way to spread the mutual understanding of each others culture and points of view
7475223 however i do believe that the uk tourism industry should do more to make life easier for chinese visitors such as having more chinese speaking and guides and increasing chinese language signage
7475224 i hope this underlines to travel agents in china that the uk authorities do indeed welcome chinese visitors and that we are ready to welcome even more in the coming months

7475238 hopefully we can solidify some stuff and even if we dont get two fully solid we feel if we can get close to that we can keep it going

7475243 there have been a lot of questions asked about what we are doing and the one i get a lot is the points on the 07 are we changing them what are we doing the points will stay with the 07 we have all the confidence in the world in clint and his team that were going to be ok there we have some things working there as well right now like we do every year at this time we start evaluating our competition where we are at with all of our teams we use jeffs and kevins input a lot kevin is doing an appearance but jeff is here glad to have you jeff we are just thrilled about next year we have our work cut out for us the next three weeks and that is what we are concentrating on right now is to get in to the chase and at that point we want to be a championship contender which i know we will be weve got to get through that and once we do that then we will start addressing other things
7475244 we are going to be just fine weve did a lot of research and looked in to a lot of different things at this time we really cant say what the plan is but we are definitely working on a few things
7475245 it is like i told him richard beats beatin dents in the body shop
7475246 we are working on all of that at this time
7475247 he just explained to me that you reap what you sow which i believe
7475248 i explained to him thats why that happened that way thats it i have a lot of respect for him and the organization they do a really good job and i really look up to them so thats that
7475249 i think reed is today as good as hes ever going to be if somebody else wants to put him in a car fine with us we have a pretty good idea that hes going to drive the 10 car i wish him good luck

7475251 we dont have anyone that were entertaining specifically here this weekend things like this definitely help our chances of putting together a bona fide program for next season its really important like i said in the last statement runs like this really help our program and the future of our program i feel like this season weve really risen toward the top we compete with the best week in and week out in the nationwide series i feel like we justify a full time sponsorship and thats definitely what were working to put together for next year
7475252 yeah i was really concerned if hed have hit me he would have wrecked me for sure this track is very very challenging and i think we saw that in qualifying for the nationwide cars the nationwide cars are a handful ive got blisters on my hands from driving tonight thats how hard these cars drive theyre tough i think they might even be tougher than the cot cars you go through the corner so fast its hard to really explain it to you theyre out of control theyve got a short wheel base nice front ends and a lot of down force the way they go through those patches theyre very unpredictable i also feel like the tire we run is made more for a cot than ours so its a little less forgiving than what we need all those things add up and make these things a challenge to drive

7475404 most people did not know that the work in ray goehners materials characterization department at sandia national laboratories was contributing important information to the fbis investigation of letters containing bacillus anthracis the spores that cause the disease anthrax
7475405 initially scanning electron microscopy sem conducted at another laboratory showed high silicon and oxygen signals that led them to conclude that the spores were a weaponized form says kotula
7475406 the possible misinterpretation of the sem results arose because microanalysis in the sem is not a surface sensitive tool
7475407 because a spore body can be 1 5 to 2 microns wide by 1 micron long a sem cannot localize the elemental signal from whole spore bodies
7475408 lacked that fuzzy outer coating that would indicate that theyd been weaponized

7475578 this repression will be remembered as one of the defining characteristics of the beijing games

7475599 i have asked marco why he did not stand up and try to score and he is adamant that the defender caught him if thats the case then i will hold my hand up and accept it
7475600 but after watching the dvd and if thats not the case that he could have stood up and had a go at goal then i will give him the biggest rollicking he has ever had
7475601 because that was chance to get us level and we had scored then i believe we could have gone on and won the game
7475602 we knew it was going to be a battle it wasnt a surprise but i thought we could have done better
7475603 but again we conceded three goals and that was the most disappointing thing
7475604 we need to face the fact that we conceded too many goals last season and have now conceded five goals in two games at the start of this season
7475605 we need to think about that and worry a bit about that because it is not like we didnt concede goals last season we conceded a lot of goals
7475606 and we are still conceding goals we need to talk about it
7475607 we always bounced back last season and we will try and do that again
7475608 i cant promise that but our confidence is fine it is not low we are just sad not to have got a least a point from the weekend
7475609 confidence is still okay we played a very good game against manchester city at home
7475610 we hope to win again on thursday we are just disappointed that we came back twice against stoke but lost the game
7475611 we are looking forward to this week coming up but we cant be happy
7475612 however when the dust settles we are facing a big week
7475613 im using a satellite thats orbiting the asteroid and the rotation of the asteroid itself to wrap this ribbon

7475619 inbreeding clearly supports absence of any hybridisation between indian red jungle fowl and domestic birds in india and genetic impurity
7475620 possible hybridisation observed in previous studies could have been because of limited number of samples
7475621 it was suspected that the domestic chicken is inter breeding with the wild red jungle fowl resulting in erosion of genetic purity of the wild birds in the light of these reports it was important to assess the genetic uniqueness of indian red jungle fowls
7475622 the present study shows that the fowl displayed inbreeding and not inter breeding
7475623 the findings should be used carefully there was always doubt whether the assumption made about the red jungle fowl being threatened with extinction due to genetic contamination was true but it was a possibility and needed to be tested
7475624 carbofuran is one of the most deadly pesticides to birds left on the market it is responsible for the deaths of millions of wild birds since its introduction in 1967 including bald and golden eagles red tailed hawks and migratory songbirds in its 2005 ecological risk assessment on carbofuran epa stated that all legal uses of the pesticide were likely to kill wild birds

7475641 i havent run since matt died but im sure hes going to be running right beside me helping me along the way
7475642 to me its not about raising money or about politics its about that woman who lost her son

7475644 math and english math and english are universal everything else they teach you is a crock
7475645 math im a professional woodworker so i use it every day
7475646 i have never been to an assembly like that just to hear a pin drop in an auditorium filled with 1 000 students was just amazing
7475647 the important thing is to keep that going its human nature that it can wear off after a while thats why we wanted to keep doing this and move it forward
7475648 just a simple teenage girl that believed in one word very strongly and that word was compassion
7475649 he told us he was looking for a metal art foundry in maine
7475650 this is not like producing a sink this is a well known artist theres a social political aspect to it too
7475651 it was really amazing here we are a small company from maine and our work was going to be at the democratic convention
7475652 its thin enough to work with and thick enough so it so it doesnt bend like a pretzel
7475653 we wanted to find someone nearby and the fact that they were from maine was a bonus
7475654 sure were artists first but its great its going to be supporting barack obama
7475655 this feels sort of surreal for me were a little cog in a wheel and were thrust in this larger machinery but all the pieces of the machinery are needed you know
7475656 the big thing always is to get the first goal
7475657 poly had nothing too threatening not that we had a bunch of threatening chances either but the one good chance we had we stuck it and that makes a big difference
7475658 i know the confidence is there but its been a year and a half since i stepped on the field in a collegiate game
7475659 it feels good to get the big save and keep a shutout its awesome
7475660 it was very overwhelming at first but it was a good experience because you meet a lot of people doing it
7475661 its even just worth rushing even though youre in the sun and its really hot at the end even if you dont do it at least you meet one person in your recruitment group that youre going to be close with
7475662 but everyone says that the house you end up with is the one where you belong you gotta trust in them as well as yourself to make the decision and i think the way that it matches up you really do end up where you belong
7475663 it was all very fair it didnt seem like anything stood out to be like that doesnt seem right kinda thing
7475664 they did everything really classy and everyone was really nice but it was a really hard decision
7475665 i think what you want to do especially this year because camp was a week longer because students start school a week later is change things up again because camp is a grind
7475666 it is the same thing especially offensively over and over and over again so i think anything you can do to give them a change of scenery is good
7475667 i thought fort huachuca was good because of that and then also the team building aspect too
7475668 it has been a good camp and to me we are certainly a lot further along than we were
7475669 i think it went very well and i think our kids worked extremely hard in being a more selfless team and working for each other
7475670 and that has been a big goal of ours and i think we are much stronger because of it
7475671 but what we start with next week doesnt necessarily mean its going to be that way throughout the year
7475672 i think it was awesome and a great experience for him to get here because i heard him mention on tv that he saw that void in the outfield on the wall of hillenbrand stadium in tucson of him never making it to the world series
7475673 its so different from 2000 when his sister was a freshman
7475674 it wasnt nearly as smooth this year everyone has been so welcoming hospitable kind and funny
7475675 when we drove up to the dorm at 9 a m aug 21 there were young men in purple shirts there to help us unload
7475676 i was wearing a pair of cal shorts because my sister goes to school there and he told me i was going to have to get some new shorts
7475677 i told him i was supporting my sister and he said you have to support yourself now
7475678 our support really came out of the realization that we cant do our jobs by ourselves
7475679 we have to work with the community and develop relationships so that students see us as someone who can help them
7475680 students can walk in on a class and see if there are any openings and very often almost always there are openings in classes where the rosters says its filled
7475681 very few instructors will have one and then theres the hassle of where do you go to get one
7475682 this does allow us to solely look at kamp s current duties
7475683 its simple math students could buy one and have a bike that will serve as a mode of free transportation for years
7475684 i think its a great idea and i think its good that that they arent gas powered
7475685 they are pretty expensive though and ive already had one bike stolen from me
7475686 i would never want to have something that expensive just sitting around at the u of a because if it got stolen id be out a lot of money
7475687 i am in favor of whatever helps make the traffic situation better
7475688 theres way too many cars and if people want to ride electric bikes i think thats great
7475689 i think it would be dangerous to have people riding 20 miles an hour down the bike lanes
7475690 theyre going to a bowl game this year they need to for us fans
7475691 theyre going to be very strong on offense returning 10 starters
7475692 i think they have a good shot at winning eight or nine games this year
7475693 i really wanted to just make my jump so i could relax a little but i missed it and had to rely on harris and day missing their jumps
7475694 i watch the olympics because i have pride for my country honestly at first i didnt know ua students were there
7475695 i did see jenny finch but shes alumni i am proud that ua students were there but really id watch either way go america
7475696 i have been watching the olympics since the beginning and im sad its ending
7475697 robby has strep throat and we are checking him for mono so we will know more about his status as the week goes on and what kind of timetable we are looking at
7475698 we are a little unsure about right now so hopefully we will get him back as soon as possible
7475699 it is a nice way to enter into the season so that we can focus on golf
7475700 i guess they want to make me the icon there
7475701 theyre real excited about me coming to work for them they know the deal they know what theyre getting in and feel comfortable about the whole situation
7475702 if he has the opportunity right now to make 800 000 from a team and get a shoe contract and make more than 1 million before he even goes into the 2009 nba draft then why wouldnt he do that
7475703 thousands of soldiers and hundreds of tanks ships and warplanes were waiting for mr putins command
7475704 consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
7475705 the party had a pirate theme so i decided to turn the cake into a jolly roger flag the icing was dark chocolate fondant dyed black with food coloring the skull and crossbones were cut freehand out of white fondant the cake itself was red velvet and it ended up being 15

7475736 we have first hand experience of the skills problem here
7475737 the biggest problem you have is that so many people who have left over the past 15 years dont see a reason to come back unless you have globally competitive professionals working in sa you really cant support the local development needs
7475738 they prefer to find people who have experience and pick them up at inflated salaries from elsewhere rather than invest in new people
7475739 that practical work experience enables them to perform immediately when they get into the work environment
7475740 students typically work for three hours a day on some courses
7475741 at the moment we cant grow our businesses because we cant get the right people and we are spending too much money retraining them

7475750 la crisi del risparmio e delle famiglie stato del tutto fisiologico nulla a che fare con quanto avvenuto negli stati uniti prima dello scoppio della bolla qui non c nessuna bolla perch la societ italiana ha manifestato una propria saggezza nella modernizzazione dei comportamenti finanziari
7475751 we couldnt all be cowboys so some of us are clowns
7475752 he just turned on me and that is really all i remember
7475753 theres no doubt he can start a test hes perfectly capable of that
7475754 it was great for timana to get the time that he got
7475755 we delayed his entry obviously and deferred to the blokes who had the background of test rugby first with the initial replacement option
7475756 but when timana got in the game my first instinct was that he did really well having watched it live
7475757 well have a look at the footage and pour over it and contemplate our combinations and what we believe will work for us
7475758 i think ive taken my opportunities this year so hopefully if i get a spot we can make it another good win
7475759 i see myself as a 13 but obviously stirlings captain and also had a great game yesterday but i could slot in at 12 or any other place in the backline
7475760 we can swap any time i can go 12 he can go 13 were both big centres and get over the advantage line and i think thats a bonus for us
7475761 if it was to happen i think youd just have to take it in your stride
7475762 i think ive taken a lot of confidence out of yesterday and not knowing i was going to be there because of an illness to mcmeniman and yet the team had such a good result

7475776 this organization is a terrorist organization and created mayhem against public life
7475777 pakistans leadership has clearly stated their commitment to pursuing and eliminating terrorism and securing pakistans borders for the benefit of its own citizens

7475783 these were men who had been sentenced and found guilty by the supreme court walking around freely
7475784 it was evening around the time for the last prayer when armed men came and took my son islamuddin by force i have eyewitness statements from nine people that he was there from that night until now my son has never been seen
7475785 the commander and three of his fighters came and took my wife out of our home and took her to their house about 200 meters away and in front of these witnesses raped her

7475795 did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us on the road and while he opened the scriptures to us
7475796 we ought to obey god rather than men the god of our fathers raised up jesus whom you murdered by hanging on a tree him god has exalted to his right hand to be prince and savior to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins and we are his witnesses to these things and so also is the holy spirit whom god has given to those who obey him

7475805 no formal claim of responsibility has been made and the motive for the kidnapping remains unknown as well there have been no demands
7475806 it is not clear whether they are being held for political purposes as bargaining chips or for financial purposes but journalists who spoke on condition of anonymity for their security said the abduction seemed to be a pre planned attack
7475807 they were simply doing their job of reporting the story and presenting the plight of somali people to the world

7475831 its always something to watch out for when you have a high ranking member of congress or an important senator whose child goes into the influence business
7475832 its not necessarily that the fathers going to do favors for the childs clients but that every other member knows who his father is and what the connection is and that can carry a lot of influence as well
7475833 hunter biden does not lobby and has not lobbied senator bidens office

7475841 i chose to work with armada because he is a talented musician and i feel he will provide the diversity i need
7475842 im happy to be in zimbabwe working with some talented artists like maskiri and i like the way they treated me and i hope i will put a remarkable change in his music
7475843 the city has a legion of fans but unfortunately they have not had an opportunity to attend live shows from jazz musicians who often prefer to stage such shows in the capital harare
7475844 with this initiative we want to keep jazz fans happy by inviting renowned and upcoming jazz musicians for live shows every friday which to date has been well attended
7475845 we want to rekindle the township jazz music and there are a lot of people who have a passion for that type of music
7475846 since its launch end of july the response has been overwhelming we are even encouraged to make it bigger and better even youngsters who you would normally expect to attend kwaito shows are attending these jazz treats
7475847 its not easy for israel to release prisoners some of the individuals being released today are guilty of direct involvement in the murder of innocent civilians
7475848 but we understand the importance of the prisoner issue for palestinian society we believe this action can support the negotiation process and create goodwill
7475849 we had lost hope that my brother would be released because hes been in prison for 32 years

7475861 if the us dollar is rising commodities take a hit its been a huge factor
7475862 we may see this rally in the us dollar continue in the short term but you have to differentiate between speculation and the underlying demand for commodities
7475863 the majority of the increase in commodities over the last five years has been driven by demand from china and the emerging economies being so great that supplies havent been able to keep up
7475864 hes got some major problems like internal bleeding and hes on dialysis so his kidneys are failing again and they are talking again about suspected pneumonia so they are three bad reports

7475866 it takes about 10 hours for us to get a result
7475867 its been something of a concern this new problem hes got and we hope this will overcome it for them to at least put the operation off for some time
7475868 hes in such a weak state that theyre reluctant to operate on him
7475869 in it then we just tell python to print out whatever is inside the
7475870 string and the exclamation mark at the start of the
7475871 string they help format the output and make it look nice so that the strings dont all run together edit
7475872 if we add 10 to your number we get s
7475873 i know that you can change at the very last minute but he wasnt listed as one of the subs
7475874 its something i probably need to talk to the ffa about just to have a clarification about that ruling but certainly we know that you can make a change right up to just before the game starts
7475875 once again franky farina has done a shifty on us
7475876 no i would prefer a little bit more clarification even if you have a fifth substitute named so at least we know that hes actually testing and theres a possibility that he might start the game
7475877 in that situation i would prefer to know whos lining up where because even craig moore with one leg is probably just as good as a centre back or a pairing at the back
7475878 he adds a lot of experience and i would have preferred craig moore not be there
7475879 it was good because i was desperate to play missing the first league game it was nice to get out there
7475880 very interesting development from the point of view of our project
7475881 a point that needs making is that judge harvey is no mug when it comes to the internet he has written a text book on cyber law in new zealand
7475882 on a technical level he probably knows more about the internet than any other judge in the country
7475883 we have started questioning chen chih chung and his wife huang jui ching in the case

7475893 hes got some major problems like internal bleeding and hes on dialysis so his kidneys are failing again and they are talking again about suspected pneumonia so they are three bad reports
7475894 everything is down and its not looking good but weve still got hope
7475895 it takes about 10 hours for us to get a result
7475896 its been something of a concern this new problem hes got and we hope this will overcome it for them to at least put the operation off for some time
7475897 if the irish think its going to be a soft option we take and back off from being a physical side then theyre wrong
7475898 there are rules which state you can do things and we will try and stay on that line within the rules
7475899 for the selection we are looking at players with a discipline about them that will respect the series respect the jumper they are wearing and respect the opposition
7475900 im a bloke who hasnt played it hasnt coached it youve got to get the best deputies you possibly can
7475901 the three people weve chosen have all played all are intelligent men and theyve still got an active role in afl coaching or commentating

7475912 if the us dollar is rising commodities take a hit its been a huge factor
7475913 we may see this rally in the us dollar continue in the short term but you have to differentiate between speculation and the underlying demand for commodities
7475914 the majority of the increase in commodities over the last five years has been driven by demand from china and the emerging economies being so great that supplies havent been able to keep up
7475915 theres no doubt he can start a test hes perfectly capable of that
7475916 it was great for timana to get the time that he got
7475917 we delayed his entry obviously and deferred to the blokes who had the background of test rugby first with the initial replacement option
7475918 but when timana got in the game my first instinct was that he did really well having watched it live
7475919 well have a look at the footage and pour over it and contemplate our combinations and what we believe will work for us
7475920 i think ive taken my opportunities this year so hopefully if i get a spot we can make it another good win
7475921 i see myself as a 13 but obviously stirlings captain and also had a great game yesterday but i could slot in at 12 or any other place in the backline
7475922 we can swap any time i can go 12 he can go 13 were both big centres and get over the advantage line and i think thats a bonus for us
7475923 if it was to happen i think youd just have to take it in your stride
7475924 the dominant paradigm within which social scientists assess natural resource issues
7475925 has been embraced as a sacred text by scholars and professionals in the practice of designing futures for others and imposing their own economic and environmental rationality on other social systems of which they have incomplete understanding and knowledge
7475926 the rational herdsman concludes that the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd
7475927 t he use of arable and meadowlands was under the supervision and direction of the community
7475928 just as the share of each member in so much of the mark as was distributed was of equal size so was his share also in the use of the common mark the nature of this use was determined by the members of the community as a whole
7475929 at fixed times and if necessary more frequently they met in the open air to discuss the affairs of the mark and to sit in judgment upon breaches of regulations and disputes concerning the mark
7475930 w hat existed in fact was not a tragedy of the commons but rather a triumph that for hundreds of years and perhaps thousands although written records do not exist to prove the longer era land was managed successfully by communities
7475931 it is to be expected that each herdsman will try to keep as many cattle as possible on the commons as a rational being each herdsman seeks to maximize his gain
7475932 we must admit that our legal system of private property plus inheritance is unjust but we put up with it because we are not convinced at the moment that anyone has invented a better system the alternative of the commons is too horrifying to contemplate injustice is preferable to total ruin
7475933 t he entire spirit of capitalist production which is oriented towards the most immediate monetary profits stands in contradiction to agriculture which has to concern itself with the whole gamut of permanent conditions of life required by the chain of human generations
7475934 hardins fable was taken up by the gathering forces of neo liberal reaction in the 1970s and his essay became the scientific foundation of world bank and imf policies viz enclosure of commons and privatization of public property the message is clear we must never treat the earth as a common treasury we must be ruthless and greedy or else we will perish
7475935 t hese large amounts of land with their attendant natural resources will never yield their maximum benefit to canadas native people as long as they are held as collective property subject to political management collective property is the path of poverty and private property is the path of prosperity

7475943 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7475944 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7475945 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7475946 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7475947 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7475948 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7475949 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7475950 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
7475951 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7475952 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun

7475956 to offset the tax increases that otherwise occur inexorably each year as incomes rise with inflation lifting people into higher tax brackets
7475957 to limit personal income tax relief to one round of rate cuts and to tilt the relief toward those who earn less than 50 000 a year
7475958 raised the top income tax rate from 28 to 33 percent for married couples earning more than 78 400 a year and individuals earning more than 47 050 increased the minimum tax from 21 to 25 percent and imposed a 10 percent surcharge on taxable income for one person exceeding 1 million a year

7475988 we staan nu rond de 33e plaats op de wereldranglijst wanneer je bij de eerste 24 zit kom je in aanmerking voor peking het meetpunt daarvoor ligt eind juni we gaan proberen om daar bij te komen
7475989 die punten moeten gehaald worden op toernooien voor de world tour daar gaan we ons op richten
7475990 vanaf januari kunnen we terecht in den haag waar ook een nieuwe hal komt daarnaast gaan we ook nog verderop in het jaar trainingsstages in het buitenland doen in een zaal mis je toch de weersomstandigheden
7475991 het seizoen begint voor ons echt met de eerste world tour wedstrijden in australi eind maart
7475992 im extremely happy in the final we played very good
7475993 and we won the gold medal the australian team played also a tough match this result is somewhat surprising because this year i changed my partner all the games have been very difficult and the final match has been really hard we have improved match by match and we have fixed our team play very well during the games
7475994 i worked to get this world title for the whole year i dedicate this gold medal to all the staff of the national team thanks to all the fans its really beautiful to win at home
7475995 we wanted to win a bronze medal we hoped to do better than last year but it wasnt possible
7475996 yesterday i cried and cried because i was very sad about the result
7475997 im so happy especially because my partner had an injured ankle and he played nevertheless feeling pain all the time

7476003 suggests that battle for the presidency between the illinois senator and republican rival john mccain is all tied up
7476004 family is shaping the content of the entire day and thats not been done before
7476005 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7476006 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7476007 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7476008 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7476009 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to
7476010 make people aware of the kind of sacrifice barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope
7476011 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7476012 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7476013 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7476014 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7476015 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7476016 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward

7476018 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7476019 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7476020 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7476021 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7476022 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7476023 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7476024 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night
7476025 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7476026 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7476027 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7476028 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7476029 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7476030 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7476031 republican always always campaign by protraying the democratic candidate as an out of touch elitist
7476032 democrats in general and obama in particular have trouble connecting with working class voters
7476033 mccain s a graduate of annapolis i know a lot of the annapolis breed remember i m west point where i was born my father went there
7476034 so the obama campaign is going all out on the issue of mccain s multiple houses isn t that kind of stupid
7476035 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7476036 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7476037 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7476038 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7476039 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7476040 i started looking around going whos the biggest fish in this pond
7476041 its pretty clear to me that for a lot of important folks at alabama the answer to the winning question is yes
7476042 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7476043 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7476044 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7476045 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7476046 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7476047 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7476048 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7476049 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7476050 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7476051 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7476052 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7476053 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7476054 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7476055 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7476056 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7476057 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7476058 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7476059 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7476060 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7476061 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment

7476069 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7476070 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7476071 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7476072 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7476073 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7476074 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7476075 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7476076 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7476077 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7476078 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7476079 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7476080 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7476081 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7476082 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7476083 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7476084 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7476085 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7476086 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7476087 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7476088 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7476089 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7476090 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7476091 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7476092 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7476093 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7476094 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
7476095 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
7476096 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
7476097 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7476098 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7476099 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7476100 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7476101 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7476102 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7476103 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7476104 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7476105 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
7476106 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
7476107 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
7476108 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
7476109 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
7476110 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
7476111 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
7476112 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7476113 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7476114 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7476115 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7476116 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7476117 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7476118 i dont know about others but my bsnl phone given by parliament is not working here i hope you have understood why is it so
7476119 meine t tigkeit bei travail suisse entsprach meinem temperament meiner grundhaltung und meinen berzeugungen es war ein traumjob
7476120 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7476121 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7476122 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7476123 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7476124 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7476125 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7476126 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7476127 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7476128 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7476129 i dont know if you are aware that i am a decorated vietnam war veteran
7476130 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7476131 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7476132 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7476133 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7476134 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7476135 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7476136 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7476137 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7476138 i voted for the bill before i voted against it
7476139 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7476140 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7476141 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7476142 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7476143 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7476144 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7476145 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7476146 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7476147 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7476148 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7476149 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7476150 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7476151 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7476152 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7476153 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7476154 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7476155 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7476156 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7476157 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7476158 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7476159 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7476160 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7476161 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7476162 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7476163 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7476164 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7476165 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7476166 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7476167 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7476168 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7476169 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7476170 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7476171 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7476172 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future
7476173 of course because we have got to get on with the job we have got to get on with the job people want us to get on with the job getting on with the job is the most important thing at the moment
7476174 im happy to talk to you because you are here i have given you special time that is very good of me you are very fortunate

7476180 gov david a paterson insists the state has a legal right to collect taxes on indian retailer cigarette sales but says he wants to negotiate with the tribes to end the years long stalemate instead of trying to force an immediate halt to the tax free sales
7476181 in his most extensive remarks on a subject that has stymied a long line of governors before him paterson on wednesday suggested that fear of violence by native american protesters is driving part of his decision to take a slower route than the state legislature is demanding
7476182 native american leaders who have been hearing a growing number of legislators and others pressing paterson to collect the tax to help raise revenues to reduce the states budget deficit sounded relieved tuesday evening
7476183 the tribes got the gold mine tax payers got the shaft
7476184 there were groundlings the working class it breaks down barriers or at least i hope it does
7476185 i get objections and helpful suggestions from literally all over the world iran israel south africa china japan
7476186 frankly i got hooked on berts lectures which make some of the most challenging philosophy accessible to lay people
7476187 i get a lot of e mails from high school and college students
7476188 they have no hesitation about writing to a professor and asking a question they just send an e mail
7476189 i received an e mail from a devout christian lady who said i said calvary instead of cavalry
7476190 ive been in classes where the professor decided to webcast it and attendance drops there is also a class ive been to taught by a really great professor and even though the class is webcast students still show up its a packed house for every lecture
7476191 it makes me very happy that my thoughts have gone out into the world and make all these other people happy
7476192 but i lose about 25 percent of the students so i have a half empty lecture hall which i dont like one bit they are listening to me lying on the lawn running or doing the dishes

7476201 we sent several of our units out there with the helicopter and canine units and established a perimeter
7476202 we searched the spruce creek neighborhood and heard he might have headed west but we were unable to locate him
7476203 we believe he was familiar with the area and had contacts down there that couldve helped him escape
7476204 i need someone that can do everything because i am basicly an invalid
7476205 we started july 1 with one budget cut because of state revenue problems since then we received an additional 4 percent cut in state programs
7476206 we dont do a full assessment until theres money available and theres no money available right now
7476207 we are using donations we have from individuals and churches and looking for other donations or trying to transfer people to another program
7476208 we want to be able to maintain services until we can get some attrition
7476209 that covers current clients that doesnt cover the waiting list we think we are good for the next three months but we just started this fiscal year as the year goes on we may have to cut some peoples services back some but we are optimistic about finding ways of not having to do that hopefully we wont get any further budget cuts
7476210 but at this point hopefully those kind of deficiencies wont be passed again on to our vulnerable people which is children and elderly
7476211 but of course next session if monies continue to be so slow in coming in i believe there will be cuts across the board hopefully the economy will pick up by the time we have next session
7476212 we would like to develop a training program for groups who want to come out and do those things but are not sure how to organize and do it
7476213 we did make 22 referrals in the months of june and july in marion county
7476214 however we received over 250 reports its less than 10 percent of the total number of reports we received
7476215 the other thing i think is important to know we consider the services provided by marion county senior services to be invaluable
7476216 in many situations its the difference of allowing someone to remain in their home that wishes to do so and having to potentially place that individual into a facility such as a skilled nursing facility or an assisted living facility
7476217 they get more referrals than most but it also means that people at risk are being protected by dcf it does put all the providers in a precarious position and really in need of more of a cushion than they needed before you can get referrals toward the end of a contract year and have to do it and have to find the money somewhere and its tough

7476231 a case has been registered against the malaysian social service a chennai based private company licensed by the indian government for having sent at least 120 children for adoption abroad our investigations found a simple modus operandi street children were kidnapped for a mere rs 500 and given for adoption abroad for sums ranging from as low as rs 10 000 to as high as 10 000 per child
7476232 obviously kidnapped children have been passed off by impostors claiming to be their mothers donating them for adoption their real parents may not even be aware where their children are and may not have received a single rupee as compensation
7476233 while bringing the guilty to book may be a problem due to the absence of complainants disturbing children living abroad with emotional moorings may prove counterproductive as none of them would like to return to a poverty stricken life back home
7476234 many foreign countries do not recognise indian laws or some can reject efforts to prosecute alleged wrongdoers outright because their deeds may not constitute an offence in the countries where the children are living now

7476266 if i was mccain id be thinking about my own attack dog
7476267 hes going to want someone who can go toe to toe with biden
7476268 certainly biden was a big choice for obama and it does therefore force mccain to think about a big choice both in terms of debates and the potential demographic or state by state advantages in who he picks for his running mate
7476269 obama has effectively checked mccain on mccains only relevant argument by choosing biden who has more foreign policy and washington experience than mccain

7476361 these new figures are tragic and frightening and represent a wake up call for the nation they show that previous estimates of the epidemics size and cost were very much understated the obesity epidemic in australia is having a direct and catastrophic influence on increasing the incidence of type 2 diabetes we know that obesity and type 2 diabetes can be prevented and we need to make fundamental changes in the way we live to arrest the escalating crisis the report underlines the need to shift our focus on health and wellbeing and make prevention our priority

7476379 do i think its a mans world in television that is the most ridiculous question i have been asked all week
7476380 the worst thing you can be in this industry is a middle class white male if any middle class white male i come across says he wants to enter television i say give up all hope theyve no chance
7476381 he lists five women because he couldnt possibly name all the men in positions of power in tv because he would be there all bloody day
7476382 he talks about middle class white men being a beleaguered species on television well excuse me but jonathan ross jeremy on newsnight look at the today programme have i got news for you newsnight
7476383 it seems to me that tv is a fantastic place for middle class white males they are very much judged to be the people imbued with a sort of gravitas that women are still struggling to achieve

7476397 were going to have to find a way to win those swing states like nevada colorado and new mexico and you choose a senator from delaware
7476398 many texas delegates just arent all that thrilled with biden
7476399 were struggling to find a place where she can be kept under lock and key
7476400 we have to wait and see what the judge decides
7476401 im not ready to take that kind of money out of the county coffers if there are other options
7476402 i think she has shown from the day of her initial arrest to the day of her indictment that shes not a flight risk
7476403 you could turn a gym into a courtroom if you needed to
7476404 our no 1 market is dallas for origination and destination
7476405 i wouldnt be surprised if 80 percent of travelers from houston are here on business

7476407 fuel costs are so high it gives the stores a better reason to buy from a local grower than hauling from a long distance
7476408 ive done better this year since the price went up in fuel than i have in the last four years

7476414 theres been a big demand for it this year more than normal
7476415 theres been other outlets too that have been a little more eager to buy our produce than normal
7476416 most of my farmers are in a terrible bind right now from the top of texas to the bottom
7476417 ive not had any farmers tell me its a good thing
7476418 i think the day is soon when agriculture is going to be really booming
7476419 i dont know if san antonio realizes how important we are to produce food for them
7476420 urban residents are much more keen on trees than they are on grasses
7476421 if we have agreed that restoring this habitat is worth it then we have to take action
7476422 weve been watching a fuzzy focus movie for a long time
7476423 this is a controversy thats been brewing since the very first original master plan public meetings
7476424 the area is right now heavily populated by a number of mixed hardwoods oaks mesquites texas persimmon and condalia bushes that are not only historic but beautiful in their own right
7476425 were proponents for trees and parks and this pristine location in the middle of san antonio and were very interested in the historic aspects of the park but we just cant micromanage that much
7476426 officials plan to restore grasses has some worried about the trees
7476427 we were lucky enough to spend time in washington d c spain and utah and during that time we went back and forth to san antonio
7476428 they loved this city it was where they met and courted and wed
7476429 my parents werent judgmental but they were quick to offer advice they werent stern about it there was no finger shaking going on
7476430 he loved growing vegetables okra beans corn and tomatoes made it onto our table and the tables of friends
7476431 and he adored flowers he was very good with roses and pink seemed to be his favorite color for those we werent much for cutting flowers i guess because we were outside with them so much
7476432 wyss 78 loved gardening singing and opening up his home to others
7476433 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the rest of the world
7476434 together we shared the excitement and drama of the games
7476435 we are first and foremost an organization devoted to sport but it is sport with a purpose
7476436 placing sport at the service of mankind and leveraging olympic values to promote better understanding between people nations and religions stands at the core of our mission
7476437 we cannot be more pleased with the chinese peoples presentation and hosting of these games
7476438 whether its the olympic village or the venues they have done an incredible job
7476439 its for everybody i can see all faces getting excited about him its huge
7476440 but we did not fight the civil war over whether catholics could be americans
7476441 this is a very big deal in every way this country is just saturated with questions of race
7476442 the democratic convention is making unprecedented efforts to reach out to women and the latino community
7476443 civil rights and faith leaders will come together to commemorate the anniversary of that historic march that created the tipping point for change in this country
7476444 we had to go through the back door to go up in the balcony in the movie theater
7476445 for so long so many of us just wanted to be looked at as equals for who we are for a person like me who has run for office in a district predominantly anglo this is a realization that we are moving forward
7476446 but i knew him well enough to make judgments about his intelligence integrity compassion for others the qualities that are important to me in selecting a president
7476447 there is no assurance that the convention will heal the visible wounds in the democratic party
7476448 they had already crowned mr obama and we havent even had our convention yet we havent voted yet
7476449 we want to make sure that she is respected and her votes are counted
7476450 after the votes are counted then we come together and support obama
7476451 being a part of that for the last 35 years its very exciting
7476452 we are here together and the voices who havent been heard can now be heard
7476453 the boxing motivates people to avoid the problems inside here
7476454 were told we have to be disciplined to continue in sport
7476455 just because they are deprived of their freedom does not mean they should be deprived of their development
7476456 you arent immune from falling into vice or bad friendships

7476509 has been investigating the case of the abduction since it emerged
7476510 we demand that those holding abdifatah mohammed elmi nigel brenan and amanda lindhout free them unconditionally and immediately
7476511 we are worried about their safety as we have had no contact with anybody saying they are holding three journalists and their driver
7476512 weve all been following team gb whilst theyve been in beijing theyve done the uk proud and were so pleased to be delivering them back to home soil to the heroes welcome theyve earned
7476513 were honoured and delighted to be carrying the team home
7476514 we think they deserve to relax and be thoroughly looked after following their amazing efforts in beijing
7476515 im happy i was man of the match but the rest of it was not so good
7476516 we dominated the game played good football but they had two chances and scored
7476517 if we look back at the game there were a lot of positives
7476518 i think we will get better and better especially at home with that kind of support but we need to make more chances
7476519 i dont know what expectations are but we will have no problems staying in the premier league if we play like this every week
7476520 i got back on monday and every night have been waking up at 3 am or 4am and thats been it we travelled for 12 hours so that was tiring as well
7476521 i had my mum dad and little sister here and i was looking forward to playing
7476522 i will get better because i wont be jet lagged its been difficult i was very tired because i was jet lagged and havent been able to sleep all night
7476523 neither george nor jody will be playing for quite a while we were already looking for new players this just increases the need
7476524 it doesnt look good for george hes a tough nut and he went off strapped up but i wouldnt like to guess just how bad it was
7476525 but it looks like he might have fluid on the knee so well have to wait and see
7476526 i think he got fouled he was pulled from behind and he just twisted it as went down
7476527 hes been on the transfer list but ill be taking him off it after that
7476528 he showed just how much he wants to stay and play
7476529 lets correct this complete fallacy that we didnt create chances last season last year we created chances too we just bloody missed them thats all
7476530 we didnt have people to put them in the net so far we have

7476534 a lot of people havent read his books and want to feel connected to him as a man and want to feel close to him
7476535 i want to get stories about him out to as many people as possible he really was an extraordinary son and brother and he is an extraordinary father
7476536 and i want to encourage people to take in that human dimension i do not feel as though it is at all unrelated to the kind of president hes going to be
7476537 my brother is not employing me and we have our mortgage
7476538 hopped on the backs of motorcycles with women in rural credit programs all over the world
7476539 the one who insisted that we engage in a life of service
7476540 he would have opinions about boys i dated he really took his job as big brother seriously he was the man in our lives because our mother divorced my father and our grandfather died so he really ended up being the man of the house
7476541 i scolded maya for spending one evening watching tv instead of reading the novels id bought for her
7476542 she was right of course i looked at my baby sister and saw a full grown woman beautiful and wise and looking like a latin countess with her olive skin and long black hair and black bridesmaids gown
7476543 they took turns sharing family stories with us maya beat barack at scrabble last year during their christmas vacation and this year he beat her auma begged off the scrabble game with jet lag as she had just arrived from kenya maya shared stories of barack taking care of her after her father died and teaching her how to believe in herself and be strong and grow into her best self
7476544 i really did think i was going to be awfully exotic in iowa
7476545 i really felt like the country was being returned to us all
7476546 i live in hawaii and that distance leads to a sort of natural anonymity
7476547 ah ha of course this is how it should have been all along this is what we were all striving for it all makes sense now i had been seeing in a mirror dimly but now i see face to face
7476548 like anyone else i choose things i want to talk about there are some things i am comfortable talking about some things i am not beyond that i am fine
7476549 i often catch up with salman and even shah rukh we live close by so its easier
7476550 i really enjoy it i can really have the kind of communication i want i can express firsthand what i am feeling thinking
7476551 earlier it would be only through the media which is an important link still but now i have a personal equation with people across the globe and the most endearing fact is that its purely emotional
7476552 years ago i would have never imagined having a personal contact with the stars i admired
7476553 it was blown out of proportion in retrospect i should have realised that this would happen seventy per cent of my fans took it in the spirit it was meant to be some said i shouldnt have done so because they hold me in high regard and i understand that but the fact is that we are just the way we are i am the way i am i am happy with my sense of humour if i have upset people which i didnt intend to i am sorry but i am not sorry for what i did because thats the kind of guy i am
7476554 whenever my film is up for release i tend to smoke this is something im not happy about once jaane tu ya jaane na is released i would give up hopefully
7476555 i am a very cottage industry kind of guy i believe in doing what i like as a production house we will only make films we love scripts we like and movies we are proud of i may act or i may not but the philosophy will be the same

7476564 if it was a regular season game he probably would have played coach tony dungy said
7476565 we are satisfied with our framework but since there are always on the margins evolutions we have to adjust our framework regularly to market practices
7476566 im looking forward to the discussions with the east timorese well work this through but the scheme as we announced it at the niue pacific islands forum summit is as it stands he told abc radio
7476567 one of the matters to report back is this and that is to be by years end and possibly earlier in terms of feasibility mr rudd said
7476568 but lets take it from the ground up theres still work to be done
7476569 we agreed with the australian government with the prime minister that we will discuss how we can participate and how the australian government can give us this opportunity he said
7476570 we have agreed to launch a joint education training and employment initiative which will come back to us with specific recommendations for action by years end mr rudd said
7476571 in particular what we are looking at is the needs in the timor leste public sector and its public service for an intensified training program grassroots middle level and senior level in order to make sure that east timor is properly equipped to address its challenges for development
7476572 the specialist training wing will allow the east timorese defence force to continue to develop as a national institution that secures and builds a better future for this vibrant democracy he said in a statement

7476591 this changes the strategic relationship between the us and poland there is a clear and explicit understanding that if there are negative consequences of stationing the missile shield the us will come to polands defense
7476592 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia its to protect our european allies from any rogue threats
7476593 the strategic significance of the system consists of intercepting those few dozen missiles moscow can launch following a first strike its a crucial element to develop a nuclear first strike capacity against russia the original plan is for ten interceptor missiles in poland but once established their number could be easily increased
7476594 guarantee s a us edge to carry out nuclear war without risking a counter strike
7476595 were at war against determined enemies and we must not rest until that war is won

7476597 every nation in every region now has a decision to make either you are with us or you are with the terrorists
7476598 no one with good intentions towards us and the west should
7476599 moscows willingness to crush georgia with overwhelming force and claims the kremlin has 10 times as many tactical short range warheads as the us
7476600 pugnacious russia determined to acquire economic and military power and not afraid to use threats and force to get its way with nuclear weapons central to the russian geopolitical calculus
7476601 the dark days of communist yore and captures the threat of what we and russias neighbors are up against
7476602 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
7476603 immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
7476604 nato can act to stabiliz e this very dangerous situation
7476605 now is the time for action not just words russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
7476606 making putin pay and turning russias georgian rout into a political defeat
7476607 to remove president saakasvili from the office to which he was elected in 2004 and to overthrow a democratic government
7476608 western authorities to explore the vulnerability of russian assets abroad or at least make life difficult for the holders of those assets
7476609 in the world of global commerce china calculated that staging an olympic extravaganza could enhance its ambivalent reputation by contrast the putin government seems to believe its power grows in sync with its reputation as an international pariah an outsider state

7476612 the war in georgia marks an easy return to territorial expansion and attempted regional dominance
7476613 tried to give russians an alternative narrative he put forward democracy as a unifying and legitimizing idea for the new russian state
7476614 young democracies around russia back into moscows sphere of influence the worldview of a russian nationalist is hard for outsiders to comprehend
7476615 kremlin capitalism is a threat to the west by using its market strength in oil and gas resources to strong arm its neighbors and outmaneuver the us and eu
7476616 is to replace a pro western government with a new russian satellite reminiscent of the brezhnev doctrine its part of a broader campaign to annex new territory expand the russian empire conduct cyber attacks against the baltic states assassinate enemies and use economic intimidation through cutoffs of russian oil and gas shipments to ukraine and the czech republic it is important that moscow pays a concrete and tangible price for its latest aggression at least comparable to what it paid for the 1979 invasion of afghanistan
7476617 burned and houses broken unburied bodies lay rotting fresh graves were dug in gardens and basements most victims interviewed were ethnic georgians in central georgian villages some killings were carried out for revenge some involved theft and still others seemed to be that the power balance was shifting away from ethnic georgians to the ossetian separatists and their russian backers
7476618 georgians living in several of the villages said the russians occupying their land had treated them well done nothing to encourage them to leave and offered the only protection available from the south ossestian militias they feared most
7476619 us sees much to fear in a hostile russia by usher ing in a sustained period of renewed animosity with the west problems extend ing far beyond arms deals with syria and the mountains of georgia

7476622 abkhazia rallie d for independence and the abkhazian parliament has approved an official appeal to russia to recognize its independence
7476623 russia is always with you and will never leave you in the lurch
7476624 the kremlin is nearing formal recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia possibly as early as next week
7476625 support is likely and that after all the events that have occurred one should not expect otherwise
7476626 appealed to russia and to governments of other countries to recognize abkhazias independence
7476627 express such a will and if the russian president makes a relevant decision on this score
7476628 again said they will never agree to remain within georgia
7476629 in accordance with the international agreements to their previous places of deployment
7476630 envisaged in the international agreement poti is outside of the security zone
7476631 but that does not mean we will sit behind a fence watching them riding around in hummers
7476632 we have registered an increase in georgian reconnaissance activities and preparations for armed actions in the georgian south ossetian conflict zone
7476633 temporarily suspending military cooperation with nato until a political decision on relations
7476634 now we see russian forces which responded to attacks on russian peacekeepers in south ossetia legitimately
7476635 local s ossetian and abkhazian population said they fear georgia might repeat its regional aggression they also want russian troops to stay in the area to shield them from any possible attacks

7476651 my personal view is that a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in this is very much a personal view at this stage
7476652 if we want to retain our position as a constructive eu member state we cannot simply sit on our hands as some would have us do and keep saying that no means no
7476653 mr roche is not calling for a second referendum to be put that would not be a fair reflection the government is instead following the steps it said it would take in the wake of the referendum outcome
7476654 we now need to take a hard look at our situation within the eu
7476655 we have to recognise however that all other member states 26 sovereign democratic parliaments are likely to have ratified the treaty by the end of the year this will leave ireland in an isolated position
7476656 in the view of the other member states we will be preventing the eu from equipping itself to deal with the many political and economic challenges facing todays europe
7476657 not an inch is not a policy that has much to commend it in a dynamic europe that wants to move forward
7476658 we have to explore all possible solutions we cannot exclude the possibility that at some stage and in the right circumstances it may be necessary to consult the people once again
7476659 my personal view is that a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in this is very much a personal view at this stage

7476705 i have felt it myself the glitter of nuclear weapons it is irresistible if you come to them as a scientist to feel its there in your hands to release this energy that fuels the stars to let it do your bidding to perform these miracles to lift a million tons of rock into the sky it is something that gives people an illusion of illimitable power and it is in some ways responsible for all our troubles this what you might call technical arrogance that overcomes people when they see what they can do with their minds
7476706 though it might be possible at vast expense to construct local defense systems that would only let through a few percent of ballistic missiles the much touted idea of a national umbrella was nonsense
7476707 looking into my often cloudy crystal ball i suspect that a total defense might indeed be possible in a century or so but the technology involved would produce as a by product weapons so terrible that no one would bother with anything as primitive as ballistic missiles
7476708 faith in science which after all exists undeniably cannot owe its origin to a calculus of utility it must have originated in spite of the fact that the disutility and dangerousness of the will to truth of truth at any price is proved to it constantly
7476709 invariably do the right thing after they have examined every other alternative
7476710 we do not ride on the railroad it rides upon us
7476711 cease and desist from work creating developing improving and manufacturing nuclear weapons and other weapons of potential mass destruction
7476712 rich in proportion to the number of things which we can afford to let alone
7476713 at the dawn of societies men saw their passage on earth as nothing more than a labyrinth of pain at the end of which stood a door leading via their death to the company of gods and to
7476714 the exercise of vital powers along lines of excellence in a life affording them scope
7476715 i would have told them not to publish im glad they didnt ask me i guess
7476716 he was not working from his drawings or clay models they had all been put away he was carving from the images in his mind his eyes and hands knew where every line curve mass must emerge and at what depth in the heart of the stone to create the low relief
7476717 we ought to have some reluctance to believe that we are very exceptionally early for instance in the earliest 0 001 percent among all humans who will ever have lived this would be some reason for thinking that humankind will not survive for many more centuries let alone colonize the galaxy carters doomsday argument doesnt generate any risk estimates just by itself it is an argument for revising the estimates which we generate when we consider various possible dangers
7476718 if we used strict liability as an alternative to regulation it would be impossible for any developer to internalize the cost of the risk destruction of the biosphere so theoretically the activity of developing nanotechnology should never be undertaken
7476719 the forgotten menace nuclear weapons stockpiles still represent the biggest threat to civilization
7476720 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7476721 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7476722 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7476723 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7476724 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7476725 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7476726 var olan olaylar zaten kurtlar vadisinde izliyorsunuz bunun devam gelecek ama bunlar senaristlerin bilece i bir ey

7476728 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7476729 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7476730 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7476731 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7476732 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7476733 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7476734 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7476735 who are open to doing something on the production side
7476736 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7476737 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7476738 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7476739 lavevamo vista venerd pomeriggio mentre stava montando la tenda insieme con il marito
7476740 e poi di notte siamo tornati indietro ma non volevamo i loro soldi
7476741 si sono andati ad accampare in un posto abbandonato da dio e dagli uomini dopo aver chiesto consiglio su dove mettere la tenda a un branco di pastori immigrati la loro stata una grave imprudenza
7476742 la stessa mentalit assurda di coloro che arrivano a rinfacciare alle donne stuprate di aver in qualche modo provocato i loro aguzzini
7476743 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7476744 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7476745 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7476746 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7476747 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7476748 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7476749 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7476750 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7476751 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7476752 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7476753 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7476754 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7476755 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7476756 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7476757 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7476758 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7476759 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7476760 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7476761 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7476762 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7476763 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7476764 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7476765 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7476766 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7476767 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

7476774 our two year housing rents is running out but so far we dont know yet when they would pay the remaining 80 per cent of compensation now we have no place to stay

7476777 this land still belong to us we will continue to block the bpls works from continuing to built dams here until we get full payment of the compensation money
7476778 we are trying to raise the profile but we are finding it very difficult to get recognition they see women as always being the victims never the perpetrator
7476779 it is totally unreported we are trying to flag this up and say please see there is a need for services we need to do a pilot project and get statistics
7476780 there should be an equivalent agency to help men as there is for women and children i wrote to the minister and got a reply back on 7 may saying there is no need for such a service and it is covered by things like victim support i don t think that s correct and i want to continue to press him and the scottish government and get a credible response to this to make sure there is a proper dedicated facility
7476781 my eyes suffer terribly every time i chop onions i look like a scot coming out of murrayfield after a beating by england i ve tried all of the old wives tales to no effect if they have finally nailed the problem with this invention i would be very impressed
7476782 i would love to see my customers faces though if they were greeted at the door by a madman in a huge pair of goggles
7476783 strong onions do make your eyes run even when you re used to them but i think i d get a few laughs if i turned up to work wearing goggles i m not sure they re something that will take off in professional kitchens
7476784 if you switch on american tv you see all these gadgets most of them would be no use at all there are certain things which are actually a great help such as a machine we have to take the zest of citrus fruit and it saves us a lot of time but most of the things on the market are useless
7476785 we do sell a metal bar which helps people get the smell of onions off their hands and that is very popular so i think the goggles would be too

7476798 that seems to be trend these days isnt it mate
7476799 if it was me obviously id like every game to be on all platforms so id only have to buy one perhaps that could happened in the future but right now it doesnt
7476800 i see where you misunderstood me here im not advocating one platform there could be multiple platforms with all these unique features but games in generation would work or even just be released on all of them as an example say i wanted to buy the wii for its control and price id buy that and be able to get the whole library of games on it obviously the problem would be hardware but if there was a standard much like with the dvd i think it could work out fine i dont know could happened probably wont id like it to because i own the 360 and the ps3 and i desperately want to get rid of one but there are like three exclusives on each that pull me towards keeping them
7476801 so as long as its good who really cares how many there are besides most of those good fps are on the ps3 too like cod4 and that doesnt take away from my enjoyment of it

7476903 theres a lot of anti american stereotypes and actually living with an american making it work has definitely made me kind of forget about the stereotype and realize that there are all kinds of people here

7476957 its not as if we can just say hang on a second and just press pause weve got to play and weve got to grind it out
7476958 saturday was a classic example of that it was a class goal from ossie which we know he can create but look at the goal yak scored thats not a yakubu goal thats more a case of grinding it out and chasing it down so thats what its going to take

7476990 its good to have players of their calibre in the team because not only do they add good competition when it comes to trying for a place in the starting line up but i am learning a lot from them
7476991 i never meant to hurt laffor we both went for a high ball but unfortunately my foot caught him in the process i am very sorry and even apologised to his family and his teammates at supersport united
7476992 this is part of football and things like this happen he is a great friend something that started whilst we were still playing together at jomo cosmos i really appreciated his visit
7476993 its a great feeling to score 100 goals in english football
7476994 i have to thank the players too its not just me i couldnt score without them
7476995 i was on the wall intending to defend that free kick when i felt someone holding me from behind
7476996 and i reacted normally by pulling my hand away with some effort and when i turned around i saw him sadomba clutching his face and going down
7476997 i never really struck him with my elbow but somehow i made a slight contact when i reacted to his approach on me
7476998 i was even surprised to see him writhing in agony like that
7476999 the referee was very close and i thought he clearly saw how i was provoked and reacted
7477000 there was never an intention to harm on my part but i was shocked to get a red card when the referee called me i thought i was going to just get a verbal caution and not the red card
7477001 edward clearly acted and that stunt was fit for a movie not football
7477002 did you see the way he came back into the game without even getting medical attention as opposed to the time he spent on the ground
7477003 a defeat is never pleasing no matter how well you would have played
7477004 we wanted to win this game at all costs and thats why we tried to create chances
7477005 its unfortunate that we failed to score even from the penalty
7477006 it was just not our day but we are still determined to do our best in all the competitions we are still involved in
7477007 this was a very tough match but in the end we won
7477008 we wanted to paint the sky green before the match and we did just that
7477009 the early penalty was big challenge to us but we survived
7477010 we handled it well and saved then we scored the red card affected us as well but we did not panic
7477011 he did well for the day although he could have scored from some of the chances
7477012 but overall i am impressed because i sent him in to give a tough time to two defenders to neutralise their one man advantage
7477013 your performance at these games has really done the nation proud and i would like to thank you all for a job well done you really did us proud
7477014 this performance must not only end here in beijing we must aim to do much better at the next olympic games in london in four years time
7477015 we must start our preparations for the 2012 london games now and aim to reap more medals there than the four that we have won here in beijing
7477016 this is really a wonderful gesture from the first lady and i would like to thank her for recognising the teams remarkable and wonderful performance during the beijing games
7477017 it also makes the athletes feel that their sacrifices and efforts are being appreciated back home this is really inspiring

7477056 as for our normal charts and indicators gold remains below its negative sloping moving average line and it would take another one or two weeks of action such as this week to change that the intermediate term momentum indicator remains in its negative zone but has moved above its trigger line and the line has now turned very slightly to the positive side so one would call it a negative rating but moving positively the volume indicator has perked up a bit but is still below its intermediate term negative trigger line

7477093 the choice is endless and it is easy to get carried away with gimmicky features or fork out for expensive appliances that you just wont use to their full potential
7477094 good lighting and the best quality fittings you can afford are also a priority to satisfy both design and function
7477095 playing it safe with cabinet colors and styles pays off in the long term especially when you come to selling your property
7477096 when you are choosing the style of your cabinets keep in mind that contemporary colors and finishes are likely to date fast shiny red colors might be a statement piece now but what about 10 years down the line

7477120 this is the olympics how often in your life do you get the chance to be involved in something this big to win the silver medal is for me incredible i could never in my wildest dreams have expected to experience something like this
7477121 it is a little disappointing as we were so close to getting gold but silver is still a great achievement we had to battle hard to get to the final and look at brazil even with ronaldinho in their team they only got a bronze medal im sure they would prefer to be in our position
7477122 we lost to a very good team but there is no shame in that we got to the final and won a silver medal at the olympics its the biggest achievement of my career without a doubt and one of the greatest things thats ever happened to me i cant wait to get home and show everyone the medal
7477123 its so big in nigeria that they are talking about having parades through the streets with us with our medals ive never experienced anything like this im so pleased that i came to the olympics it wasnt easy but its been totally worth the effort involved in getting here
7477124 it is difficult for my club they havent made big signings yet this summer and they have some injuries so the squad is not that large at the moment and they need me i want to be back with them as soon as i can but this was an incredible opportunity and i dont regret playing in the olympics at all

7477130 it may be hard for most people to believe this but ebay at the time was incredibly under developed on many of the retail basics of merchandising inventory selection and promotion why well because ebay com isnt actually a retailer of anything we realized post launch that we needed to develop that expertise quickly even to the point of understanding sourcing distribution and product selection having 10 million products is great but its no good if you dont have the right products at the right price

7477139 es ist aus ganz verschiedenen gr nden weder sinnvoll noch machbar in der schweiz eine grand prix strecke zu bauen
7477140 erstens aus politischen gr nden die formel 1 dehnt sich im moment vor allem richtung asien aus allenfalls auch russland also wird es in diesen aufstrebenden m rkten tendenziell eher mehr strecken geben in europa daf r weniger
7477141 zweitens aus finanziellen gr nden bauen in der schweiz ist deutlich teurer als im ausland um formel 1 anspr chen gerecht zu werden w rde so eine strecke deshalb sehr viel geld kosten weshalb es kaum m glich w re sie rentabel zu betreiben zumal man zus tzlich viel daf r bezahlen muss den ganzen zirkus einzukaufen da austragungsrechte zu entrichten sind
7477142 eine formel 1 strecke k nnen sich heute nur noch st dte und l nder leisten die ganz klar ein standortmarketing betreiben und bereit sind daf r viel geld zu investieren
7477143 gibt es auch probleme bez glich des standorts ein rundkurs m sste in der n he eines internationalen flughafens gebaut werden doch weder in den ballungsr umen z rich basel oder genf ist gen gend raum f r eine solche strecke vorhanden
7477144 this looks like a step backward for obama cnn polling director keating holland says
7477145 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain

7477259 stumbling on happiness is a book about a very simple but powerful idea what distinguishes us as human beings from other animals is our ability to predict the future or rather our interest in predicting the future we spend a great deal of our waking life imagining what it would be like to be this way or that way or to do this or that or taste or buy or experience some state or feeling or thing we do that for good reasons it is what allows us to shape our life and it is by trying to exert some control over our futures that we attempt to be happy but by any objective measure we are really bad at that predictive function were terrible at knowing how we will feel a day or a month or year from now and even worse at knowing what will and will not bring us that cherished happiness gilbert sets out to figure what thats so why we are so terrible at something that would seem to be so extraordinarily important

7477322 we are conscious of that and we are trying to bring it to a conclusion as soon as we can but the nature of the complexities and the way the planning system works mean we have to ensure we give the applicant reasonable opportunity to see if they can overcome issues that arise

7477347 so you cut a deal with a cell tower company so they would put up some of the money
7477348 we knew the tower would have to be over engineered for the extra load so the cell phone company would have to pick up that cost
7477349 you want approval for a strengthened tower then well want photos and specs

7477357 we have already opened 20 reebok classics stores till now in key cities of ncr mumbai bangalore hyderabad chennai jaipur chandigarh and pune and plan to take the tally to 75 by end of 2008 09
7477358 it would also consist of indian origin collections like the dance inspired collection being promoted by bipasha basu dhoni 7 collection designed with inputs from ms dhoni himself and fish fry for reebok designed by manish arora
7477359 reebok has been there in the lifestyle space for quite some time now and we started off by foraying into lifestyle last year with niche initiatives like fish fry for reebok by manish arora and launch of some very stylish collections like dj shoes and canvas collection

7477364 a case has been registered against the malaysian social service a chennai based private company licensed by the indian government for having sent at least 120 children for adoption abroad our investigations found a simple modus operandi street children were kidnapped for a mere rs 500 and given for adoption abroad for sums ranging from as low as rs 10 000 to as high as 10 000 per child
7477365 obviously kidnapped children have been passed off by impostors claiming to be their mothers donating them for adoption their real parents may not even be aware where their children are and may not have received a single rupee as compensation
7477366 while bringing the guilty to book may be a problem due to the absence of complainants disturbing children living abroad with emotional moorings may prove counterproductive as none of them would like to return to a poverty stricken life back home

7477376 i guess if i have to look at one i would want one in my backyard so i can make a profit
7477377 its not as if they are going to go in and stick a turbine up tomorrow
7477378 we need to get as much facts as we can to make an educated decision
7477379 im disappointed that they did not approve the six turbines within one and a half miles of el paso which el paso finds acceptable
7477380 my main concern is the white oak project but if this one passes it greases the slope
7477381 queremos que la gente se asegure de qui n es el senador obama y ad nde quiere llevar al pa s
7477382 en segundo lugar deseamos que los votantes conozcan sus opciones en esta elecci n entre obama que quiere cambiar radicalmente la forma en la que se hacen negocios en washington y john mccain que es m s de lo mismo que hemos tenido en los ltimos ocho a os
7477383 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding
7477384 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish and through trial and error i finally settled on type of spit for the task at hand
7477385 attendance of the company officials was normal but that of the contractual workers was less than normal
7477386 we should agitate peacefully and no harm should be done to the tata motors small car factory
7477387 mobile advertising in india can be bigger than internet advertising in the next three four years
7477388 as such everyone benefits the key lies in publishers creating media on mobile based on sms and permission from the subscribers
7477389 but it is just starting mobile ad spend is currently estimated to be just about rs 250 300 million
7477390 its not the end of the world ive got other great stuff going on
7477391 ohh ma pole kellegile v lgu mul on raha teeks drinki v i
7477392 we have never been involved with this to the best of my knowledge and never been consulted so this is the first time we have been made aware of this
7477393 i feel particularly aggrieved by this because they are holding some public exhibitions and have stated that we are working with them on this i think it is very very wrong because we arent
7477394 i have always believed that the council should remain neutral on all things until they actually come up for debate
7477395 i am very very annoyed that weve been put in the correspondence like this
7477396 following the recent months of consultation with local residents stakeholders and parish councils infinergy has helped to establish a resident liaison group
7477397 the group brings together local residents along with representatives from parish councils in askam and ireleth kirkby ireleth pennington dalton with newton lindal and marton and ulverston
7477398 i propose we write to infinergy and disassociate ourselves and in conjunction with that say you cant use our hall either because that would be tacit approval
7477399 it is more about him mendis if he bowls a bad ball then punish him and build up pressure on him if you continue to defend him then you know he will also be on top
7477400 it is very important that whenever he bowled a bad bowl we will get runs out of them so that you know he mendis gets under a bit of pressure
7477401 i think s badri nath s effort was great he took on mendis he went for a big shot but that is what you need to do at times to put some pressure on the bowler till now he mendis was never under any sort of pressure so he was bowling at his best
7477402 it is better to have a contributory effort while winning a match but we are not relying on one individual
7477403 if you will have the privilege of getting individual performances like zaheer played well in the last match in this match also he has bowled well but it is always better to win in the sense when it is a team effort and every one enjoys no body had a bad day it is good overall if we can continue to do this way
7477404 were responsible for recording all transactions that relate to real property homes commercial buildings land including documents that might pertain to the properties such as foreclosures divorces deaths that kind of thing
7477405 we will have electronic recording before i leave so people will never have to leave their offices
7477406 i have never asked any of my staff what political affiliation they are
7477407 what really matters is the background can they do the job
7477408 right now they are opening a brand new plant in germany of course they are not a huge company as a result of that their focus is on that getting that done successfully and being able to take care of three or four things going on theyve got a 2 billon backlog of demand and so because of that they have to get components from all over the world so as a company they are scrambling
7477409 so were contacting all the wind energy companies and saying have you thought about buying turbines for the butte plant because the longer theres a cue of purchasers the longer the more viable a plant is as i say they have a 2 billion backlog of turbine demand so we have to develop the demand within 1 000 miles surrounding butte
7477410 at our level of government we can only make noise
7477411 theyre top guy is here in montana and hes staying until this gets done
7477412 weve put several projects on hold until we get matl out
7477413 there needs to be better management of the process to make sure these projects get out the door
7477414 we urge you to redouble your efforts to expedite approval of the permit to ensure the matl line is constructed on scheduled
7477415 we have to make it easy to conserve and convert as a result of that our economy and our environment will benefit substantially
7477416 hawaii has the potential to move further and faster than the rest of the u s demonstrating the economic growth and job creation opportunity from reducing oil dependence and greenhouse gas emissions
7477417 it all starts to fit together for a much brighter future for our state
7477418 hawaii has a chance to be a model for renewable energy for the entire world not just the u s
7477419 were looking at 400 turbines in two projects in stutsman county
7477420 were not the only people looking at coming to north dakota we need your support to put a zoning ordinance in place for wind farm projects
7477421 so no one can come in and build a wind farm that interferes with us
7477422 weve gone through this with feedlots and solid waste and now this is the next hot button issue to be dealt with
7477423 de burgemeester alemanno van rome vindt het niet gek dat twee nederlandse toeristen beroofd zijn
7477424 mms acknowledges that they dont know the environmental consequences of this development
7477425 they have no standards and a free for all approach to this
7477426 i think that its a vast overstatement to say that its industry driven
7477427 we are moving forward with the best environmental standards that the federal government has to offer
7477428 we have a great deal of respect for the mms commitment to get this right
7477429 while there may be some fine tuning they are absolutely on the right path
7477430 the smaller turbines that hes talking about almost dont pay in terms of kilowatts per hour produced
7477431 hes going to need money to build them and then you end up with a tremendous amount of red tape its a nightmare
7477432 if you dont ask youre never going to find out
7477433 windmills are no panacea for our problems but they can help
7477434 no one thing will fix the problems we have created over the years
7477435 it would have been a small but identifiable portion of the buildings needs
7477436 we were hoping that at peak capacity it would have been enough to power the elevators if it were able to do that it would have been rather impressive
7477437 they were designed to capture the prevailing winds from the hudson river
7477438 they dont necessarily have to be incredibly high up to be productive
7477439 where wind power is integrated within the building and one doesnt need all sorts of fanciful contraptions appended to the top
7477440 it is unbelievable how life is so unpredictable and finds a way to distract and derail you from your plans my prayers are with jade her family in this hour when they face one of the biggest tests of their life in times ahead i pray she comes out of this soon and stronger hope that she is going back with happy memories from this country
7477441 in theory it may be feasible to remove turbines and pylons but the network of roads access tracks and laydown areas will remain as scars on the landscape for hundreds if not thousands of years
7477442 while sequential market growth is unusual in the second quarter of the calendar year its clear that in q2 2008 intels processor shipments drove the growth intels processor shipments alone grew nearly 4 3 over the first quarter and 20 8 year over year while amds processor shipments were about flat
7477443 while processor unit shipments exceeded our forecast in q2 2008 intels aggressive approach to the market through both product and pricing point to a major supply side variable however economic concerns cause us to maintain our conservative outlook for the second half of the year
7477444 explained very well when it came up as an issue
7477445 no member or employee of a liquor control board shall directly or indirectly derive any profit or remuneration from the purchase or sale of any such i e alcoholic beverage other than the salary or wages payable for the discharge of the duties of the office or position
7477446 a payment or reward for goods or services or for losses sustained or incovenience caused
7477447 i have absolutely no idea whether that makes any sense from a scientific from a practical point of view
7477448 are you going to put a big windmill on top of the empire state building i think thats very unlikely
7477449 can you put windmills off the coastline that is highly likely
7477450 i can seriously imagine offshore wind farms but in terms of actually urban turbines in manhattan we are a ways off from that
7477451 windmills are no panacea for our problems they can help just like biofuels can help just like tides can help
7477452 in the end it is conservation that is the main thing you and i can do and that we can do in this city
7477453 nosaltres som al govern per posar a lagenda temes com el finan ament erc ser la garantia dun bon finan ament erc ha de ser al govern per aix i per altres q estions com lorganitzaci territorial en vegueries o el suport als ajuntaments el paper derc al govern s fonamental
7477454 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
7477455 moderation in temper is always a virtue but moderation in principle is always a vice
7477456 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
7477457 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
7477458 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
7477459 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
7477460 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
7477461 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
7477462 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
7477463 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
7477464 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
7477465 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
7477466 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
7477467 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
7477468 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
7477469 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
7477470 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
7477471 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
7477472 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
7477473 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
7477474 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
7477475 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
7477476 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
7477477 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
7477478 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
7477479 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
7477480 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
7477481 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
7477482 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
7477483 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
7477484 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
7477485 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
7477486 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
7477487 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
7477488 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
7477489 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
7477490 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
7477491 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
7477492 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
7477493 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
7477494 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
7477495 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
7477496 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
7477497 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
7477498 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
7477499 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
7477500 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
7477501 the human race has improved everything except the human race adlai stephenson
7477502 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
7477503 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine
7477504 try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value

7477517 it gives me great pride and happiness to see the establishment of a new xinhua finance library that will give underprivileged rural chinese young and old access to books and a chance to escape the confines of poverty through education i would like to thank the redcross society of hohhot and the qingshuihe county government for their support and assistance in realizing this library in addition to this i would also like to thank the committed employees of the xinhua finance group worldwide for their contributions it is only with their unwavering compassion and determination that the foundation has been able to extend what it has done in ningxia to inner mongolia
7477518 it is my utmost honor to be here today to express my gratitude to xinhua finance and welcome them to inner mongolia inner mongolia is a region on the northern frontiers of china rich in natural resources to tap these natural resources and further develop the region in the future inner mongolia will however require a large pool of talented individuals as a result the xinhua finance library foundation has identified the need to foster learning among local residents in impoverished regions and has acted by providing them access to books and other resources in this fashion local residents are now able to further enrich their knowledge and help develop their home region in the future we will continue to provide our support to such charitable endeavors

7477622 our hope is that the vast majority of our employees will be able to find employment through the contacts that they make at one of our job fairs or through the ongoing support that we will be providing at our job and resource centers

7477626 ajax will be champions with two fingers up their nose
7477627 the medical staff of the olympic team had said there was no risk because nothing was damaged
7477628 a match like this has to be taken seriously which means that the pitch should be in order

7477631 craftsmanship was secondary if it ends in failure the outcome will be predictable the english coach will be taken out with the garbage mcclaren wont be able to help it if he turns out to be the wrong man in the wrong place

7477633 we put the bodies in the main mosque he told the associated press by phone sometimes pausing to collect himself as he wept

7477639 the goal is still the same and the pressure is still the same
7477640 the goal is to continue to improve my tennis and to continue playing a very good tournament
7477641 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7477642 so it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces now maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having no 1 next to me and it should be interesting
7477643 i think its tough to play perfect for five years in a row
7477644 i think one big result and its turned around for him i know pretty much every player except for one that would take his bad year so i think you have to use a little bit of perspective hes created a monster for himself
7477645 thats the plan but i dont think either one of us is aiming for two

7477656 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by the time of christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7477657 its fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7477658 some people have said its as big a financial shock as the great depression and as far as the oil shock goes the rise in oil prices is in the same order of magnitude that we had to deal in the 1970s
7477659 there are periods when markets look like they are getting better then another grenade explodes another bout of fear of sustainability of some financial institutions maybe intervention by the authorities

7477713 basically the development of superblocks is a positive thing in jakarta which has very poor access to mobility because a superblock puts together several different functions in one spot
7477714 unfortunately the city s infrastructure including public transportation pedestrian walkways road water power and telecommunications services are not yet ready to support the superblocks development
7477715 without infrastructure improvement any kind of development in the city will be stuck
7477716 most designs brought to us are already approved by the spatial planning agency and other relevant agencies like the transportation agency it is hard to overturn the approval
7477717 the seven vessels went as far as eight miles from the coast watched by boats which circled around them
7477718 today people expect more content and more detail about events as they happen through the it infrastructure that atos origin has designed built and operated during the beijing 2008 olympic games the competition results have been viewed and read by more people and on more channels web mobile phone and tv than ever before atos origin our long term partner is the brains behind the operations for the olympic games consistently delivering on schedule and within budget
7477719 the remote cis service provided by atos origin has been nothing short of exceptional system execution and delivery was flawless for the first time nbc producers and commentators in new york had real time access to live results data as our teams in beijing this has enabled nbc to work more efficiently and effectively saving real money by allowing us to reduce production personnel in beijing
7477720 it is changing the way that the olympic games are viewed and we at atos origin are playing a mission critical role in ensuring that richer more detailed and colourful content is available immediately to audiences around the world in the way that they want to receive it
7477721 as the beijing 2008 olympic games end our teams are already focussed on next months paralympic games in beijing the vancouver 2010 winter olympics games and the london 2012 olympic games we are proud to be a partner to the international olympic committee and we support and share its values for performance diversity and fair play

7477753 laurens and i had known one another and been friends since 1984 when i moved to munich it made sense to me to team up with him because with nextfilm he already had a structure in place but only on the condition that the company would operate from berlin
7477754 we then did two documentaries followed by our next feature
7477755 in the last two years of his life laurens worked as writer and co director on reverse shot rebellion of the filmmakers a documentary produced by rainer koelmel and kinowelt international about the history of filmverlag der autoren kinowelt also handled world sales for the documentary coffee beans for a life which i produced in 2005
7477756 we were in the middle of developing our next feature about the berliner bank scandal dir ulrich stein when laurens was diagnosed with cancer
7477757 it really stopped us in our tracks and the company was in limbo from that point on nothing much was done until his death in april 2007
7477758 i thought for quite a long time about what i should do and then decided to carry on by myself

7477774 exchange control issues aside forward yields on foreign property investments in highly developed countries such as the us the uk and other european centres have been far too low to be attractive to south african listed companies as the acquisition of such foreign assets would be income dilutionary to local funds which in turn would have had a negative effect on the acquirers share price
7477775 the drop in value is dramatic up to 50 although the net asset values have not decreased in the same proportions
7477776 leads to the suggestion that some of the yields in those markets could well become attractive viz a viz the prices of south african properties
7477777 i think we still need to see some of our properties adjust downwards to make them attractive in the existing environment
7477778 i still read a newspaper but thats yesterdays news by the time i get to the newspaper
7477779 for us to stay in the game and to stay relevant we have got to go digital

7477783 this time we have two candidates who are very good and were very close
7477784 its so close that for the first time since 1980 we are likely to have a discussion of the candidates on the convention floor
7477785 we are selecting a candidate who is best fitted to represent the core values of the democratic party and carry those values to the general electorate i will do whatever my candidate tells me to do personal agendas are subordinate to whatever your candidate wants you to do

7477792 the idea was if the budget committee members met throughout the year they would have an opportunity to learn more and understand the budget better and therefore make a more educated budget decision at budget time
7477793 i dont think the budgets that were made were made badly
7477794 not at all but i do think there was a sense of frustration that input might have been more detailed and perhaps more knowledgeable

7477796 which retailer is going to offer the best prices for the things students need most is how consumers are entering the back to school marketplace

7477802 my children go through glue sticks and i would rather have a supply at home that only cost me 15 cents in the fall instead of purchasing more in january when the prices goes back to 1 each
7477803 i start adding office depot and staples to my list for stores to check each sunday starting in late july
7477804 there isnt a need for students to have a new backpack ruler or even box of crayons if last years supplies are still usable

7477831 what we havent been able to do yet is introduce some short term measures that will deal with the problem here and now and the type of measure that can do that is critically looking at our speed limits it wont actually cost people anything and they will see their own fuel bills fall

7477845 it is increasingly clear that president bush does not have a strategy for victory in iraq rather he hopes to prevent defeat and pass the problem along to his successor
7477846 the idea as in bosnia is to maintain a united iraq by decentralizing it giving each ethno religious group kurd sunni arab and shiite arab room to run its own affairs while leaving the central government in charge of common interests
7477847 fourth the president must direct the military to design a plan for withdrawing and redeploying our troops from iraq by 2008
7477848 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7477849 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders iraq cannot survive unless it is unified and dividing it would keep the problems alive for a long time
7477850 such a person if he would assume the vice presidency post would not serve to improve iraq usa relations

7477873 they his young players have to work harder to get back into the game so it probably does deflate the young blokes
7477874 you dont necessarily need senior players that have been in the game for so long making off the ball decisions like they do
7477875 i think the way hes been playing in the last few weeks in the role around the midfield and creating for our team has been a positive
7477876 if he thinks he can play on next year then by all means play on you need players at a club to guide the younger guys
7477877 jeffs been around for a while and played in big games grand finals and some of the younger guys look up to him just the way he performs
7477878 the experience that hes had just to guide the young blokes will be very important

7477888 it was obviously the news i didnt want to hear but after listening to the explanation i am convinced this is the right procedure the right way to go
7477889 there were lots of people like me who slapped their foreheads and said why didnt i think of that
7477890 people knew that for some of these stream ciphers they could express the output as a formula of the key
7477891 im looking forward to the discussions with the east timorese well work this through but the scheme as we announced it at the niue pacific islands forum summit is as it stands he told abc radio
7477892 one of the matters to report back is this and that is to be by years end and possibly earlier in terms of feasibility mr rudd said
7477893 but lets take it from the ground up theres still work to be done
7477894 we agreed with the australian government with the prime minister that we will discuss how we can participate and how the australian government can give us this opportunity he said
7477895 we have agreed to launch a joint education training and employment initiative which will come back to us with specific recommendations for action by years end mr rudd said
7477896 in particular what we are looking at is the needs in the timor leste public sector and its public service for an intensified training program grassroots middle level and senior level in order to make sure that east timor is properly equipped to address its challenges for development
7477897 the specialist training wing will allow the east timorese defence force to continue to develop as a national institution that secures and builds a better future for this vibrant democracy he said in a statement
7477898 this is a day of joy for the fighters of freedom and independence said said al attaba 56 the longest serving palestinian prisoner who had been serving a life sentence since 1977 for killing an israeli woman
7477899 it is like a wedding celebration for the palestinian people but our joy will not be complete until all palestinian prisoners are released he said by telephone referring to the some 11 000 palestinians still jailed in israel
7477900 abu ali yatta who was jailed in 1979 for killing an israeli student

7477902 this is a big day we have been awaiting for 32 years said attabas sister sanaa who along with friends and family has been preparing a heros welcome for her brother when he returns to his home in the west bank city of nablus
7477903 it is a gesture towards the palestinian leadership to strengthen moderate and pragmatic forces olmerts spokesman mark regev said
7477904 we hope it will contribute to a positive climate he said it is not easy to release prisoners and particularly those who have been involved in murderous terrorist attacks
7477905 we are working a lot i want this cd to come out in december but it wont be easy given all the prime ministers responsibilities the 45 year old apicella was quoted as saying

7477907 any avoidable death clearly is a great concern professor steven boyages from the service said
7477908 in most capital cities petrol prices crept higher in the latest week after falling sharply over the past month mr james said
7477909 based on trends in the wholesale market the average pump price looks set to consolidate near 1 50 a litre
7477910 the average motorist is now forking out around 209 a month on petrol a saving of around 20 from the highs in mid july but still up 40 a month on a year ago mr james said
7477911 fuelwatch wont work wont give the benefits to consumers that its meant to senator xenophon told abc radio today
7477912 if the wholesale price is determined by the big oil companies and they also control many of the outlets its not a level playing field for those small operators those independent operators in the retail sector
7477913 central to our concerns is the fact that the proposal forces retail prices to be locked in for a 24 hour period association spokesman matthew hanton said

7477960 dari segi substansi hukum sebenarnya tidak ada masalah karena indikator indikator yang menunjukkan bahwa fatwa itu jauh jauh hari sebelumnya telah mendapat dukungan juga sudah sangat nyata selama ini
7477961 merokok dapat menyebabkan kanker serangan jantung impotensi dan gangguan kehamilan dan janin
7477962 kini telah ada larangan merokok di tempat tempat tertentu atau pemisahan antara kawasan merokok dengan kawasan bebas asap rokok secara nasional dan bahkan juga dunia juga ada hari bebas tembakau dan semua itu merupakan berbagai bentuk pengakuan sekaligus indikator bahwa larangan merokok itu sesungguhnya didukung dari berbagai aspek kehidupan
7477963 jadi dari indikator indator itu sudah sangat jelas bahwa merokok bukan sesuatu yang baik dan menimbulkan mudarat bagi kehidupan manusia
7477964 karenanya fatwa itu sendiri harus bisa disinergikan agar bisa diterima secara menyeluruh agar fatwa memiliki kekuatan yang perlu diselesaikan adalah bagaimana mensinergikan segala sesuatunya secara komprehensif dan dalam hal ini mui harus duduk bersama dengan menteri agama menteri kesehatan menteri perdagangan dan juga dengan menteri keuangan
7477965 siapapun pasti setuju kalau rokok itu merusak kini tinggal bagaimana mensinergikan fatwa itu dengan berbagai kepentingan yang ada agar tidak sampai menimbulkan masalah yang tidak diinginkan di kemudian hari

7477976 it is more about him mendis if he bowls a bad ball then punish him and build up pressure on him if you continue to defend him then you know he will also be on top
7477977 it is very important that whenever he bowled a bad bowl we will get runs out of them so that you know he mendis gets under a bit of pressure
7477978 i think s badri nath s effort was great he took on mendis he went for a big shot but that is what you need to do at times to put some pressure on the bowler till now he mendis was never under any sort of pressure so he was bowling at his best

7478065 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
7478066 when the president of the united states goes and gives a speech it is not a political speech or a political rally
7478067 im surprised at how finely calibrated every single word was measured i wasnt saying anything i hadnt said before that i didnt say a year ago or when i was a united states senator
7478068 you have all these mementos of abraham lincoln but you have this flat screen tv in there

7478070 jurisdiction the subcommittee deals with all matters concerning u s relations with the countries on the continent of europe and with the north atlantic treaty organization the european union and the organization for security and cooperation in europe
7478071 a mbassador john ritch who served for two decades as the senate foreign relations committees senior staffer on european affairs and east west relations p oints out that as subcommittee chair obama could have examined a wide variety of urgent matters from the role of nato in afghanistan and iraq to european energy policy and european responses to climate change
7478072 obamas second trip abroad as a u s senator starts in qatar and in addition to iraq will include stops in kuwait jordan israel and the palestinian territories according to a statement from his washington office
7478073 sen evan bayh d in is traveling with u s sen barack obama d ill sen christopher kit bond r mo and rep harold ford d tenn their weeklong trip including a stop in israel for meetings with israeli and palestinian officials other stops included kuwait qatar afghanistan and pakistan
7478074 after a two day iraq tour obama is to travel to jordan and israel on his own
7478075 perhaps most importantly some of these troops could be redeployed to afghanistan where our lack of focus and commitment of resources has led to an increasing deterioration of the security situation there by redeploying from iraq to afghanistan we will answer natos call for more troops and provide a much needed boost to this critical fight against terrorism
7478076 fy2007 supplemental appropriations for defense foreign affairs and other purposes
7478077 thats part of what were missing right now in afghanistan if you talk to if you talk to commanders on the ground there theyll tell you instead of having another platoon id rather than a couple of agricultural specialists we need more troops on the ground in afghanistan but what we also need is to teach them to grow things other than poppy right and thats something that we just simply have not focused on so its an excellent question its going to be one of the central challenges of my administration
7478078 weve got to get the job done there and that requires us to have enough troops so that were not just air raiding villages and killing civilians which is causing enormous pressure over there
7478079 right now we dont have enough troops and nato hasnt provided enough troops because they are still angry about us going into iraq so we just dont have enough capacity right now to deal with and its not just troops by the way its like arabic interpreters arab language speakers we only have a certain number of them and if they are all in iraq then its harder for us to use them and obviously they may not speak arabic but the various dialects that they speak in afghanistan oftentimes people who speak urdu or pashto or whatever th e languages are they are going to be needed in those areas and a lot of them have ended up being placed elsewhere so weve got to focus on afghanistan

7478108 a public announcement is planned for the fall given the myriad challenges that will face the next president barack would encourage sen mccain to begin to undertake a similar process the adviser said

7478202 on the first burst of gunfire children and women immediately become the victims and thousands of families flee and lose their homes as the fighting intensifies there are more victims and the psychosocial wounds caused by the war deepen
7478203 children are unable to sleep for fear that something might happen at night they cannot eat well and of course they are forced to stop schooling
7478204 oftentimes children get hungry and sick because of inadequate food and decent homes this is because government agencies are often not ready for these offensives are unable to organize the evacuation of civilians and could not ensure the welfare of the affected families especially the children
7478205 it is irresponsible and the damage resulting from these indiscriminate bombings by the military would be much bigger because they do not distinguish the targets as a result residents become fearful and their lives are threatened because no one is spared from these bombings
7478206 napoleon announced that from now on the sunday morning meetings would come to an end they were unnecessary he said and wasted time the animals would still assemble on sunday mornings to salute the flag sing beasts of england and receive their orders for the week but there would be no more debates

7478221 stop the torture stop the war this is what were fighting for
7478222 the war in iraq and the war in afghanistan are both the wrong wars
7478223 if the us wants to stop terrorism they should stop participating in it
7478224 john mccain and obama are both saying afghanistans the right war

7478233 it isnt just a case of us not being good enough when the questions were asked i prefer to think that this was a truly outstanding bunch of jamaican sprinters male and female
7478234 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world

7478244 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
7478245 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
7478246 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
7478247 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

7478270 my goal was to encourage a young family member how important it is to complete her high school education
7478271 a lot of years have gone by and i realized that i could fall flat on my face but i thought the risk was worth that goal at my age it was not my intentions to go out and look for a job but to show that dedication could go a long way in these young people completing this program

7478278 i happen to consider the wood carvings that darrell riggs does to be fantastic
7478279 i also feel that mr riggs is a great advocate for the fact that a person who has been diagnosed with parkinsons disease can still be independent and contribute great beauty to society he is a true inspiration that one needs to look at abilities instead of a persons disability
7478280 i didnt mind having people watch because im a people person and enjoyed the contact

7478284 he goes out of his way to make sure they all can see and thinks of safety first
7478285 it brightens their day that he takes the time to do this he is very artistic and a wonderful volunteer
7478286 he doesnt even bring it up or make it an issue
7478287 how do wholehearted and sincere servants of christ become vulnerable to demonic seduction
7478288 none of us is sinless but sin is not where the enemy most often gets his foothold among the godly rather where christian victims are concerned the enemy more often latches on to personal weaknesses
7478289 this one area of ignorance drains our spiritual strength faster than any other
7478290 without his truth in our heads and hearts we are lame ducks awaiting the inevitable
7478291 knowing the difference between what is and is not of god is critical to living in victory if after all we cannot discern the devils lies from gods promises we have little hope of tuning satan out or tuning the lord in
7478292 anytime we are loaded down with sins whether intentional or not we are game for seduction we are vastly helped when we recognize acknowledge and ask forgiveness for our errors both the intentional and the unplanned
7478293 i know the lord is always with me i will not be shaken for he is right beside me

7478326 we always knew there was going to be an odour but we didnt forecast it to be this bad
7478327 its a 40 year old building and there are several new technologies that need to be addressed to decrease the sound and odour
7478328 i cry and get angry because i dont think its fair that i cant even take my daughter for a nice summer walk because it smells so bad outside
7478329 i love my home and i dont want to move but its stresses us out to no end
7478330 a new stack will be put in this friday and will bring it down to half an odour unit and the noise level down substantially

7478339 los datos ponen de manifiesto que la construcci n es el sector que destruye m s empleo y no volver a ser el motor del crecimiento econ mico de modo que deberemos de dar cobertura a una parte de desempleados de la construcci n y reorientarlos hacia otros sectores como la rehabilitaci n la vivienda p blica y la industria fundamentalmente la ligada a la innovaci n y a los temas sociales

7478408 it is important to remember that when the development was mooted permission was granted by the responsible heritage authority albeit reluctantly to demolish the old structures on the site but with the proviso that the new structure should acknowledge and commemorate the important social history of the indian people who lived in and around diagonal street johannesburg in a sense therefore it was the way indians were required to live and work that the new structures were designed to replicate not merely the building typology that was retained more importantly it was social values and a way of life that was conserved i think it would be fair to say that what was conserved at the time was building typology overlaid with a recognition of the social values of an important but disenfranchised group

7478435 robinho has a contract with madrid but i think it would be harmful if he stayed at the club and wasnt happy about it because it would be bad for his career
7478436 he also has world cup qualification to play with his national team and i think this would be very bad for robinho
7478437 its robinhos opinion hes made known his interest in leaving madrid but its something the directors have to decide together with the player to find the best option for both
7478438 for me the best solution is for madrid to be okay
7478439 for me robinho is the same player as always he is an important player who should be part of this project
7478440 i think that he knows that he can be successful at real madrid it is a subject that you need to resolve in the best way possible but we are all selfish and the best would be that he stays with us for a long time
7478441 without doubt though its not a comfortable situation either for him or for us
7478442 when these things get thrown at you you actually try that much harder
7478443 he thaksin is even more adamant now because this is his love and he wants to show people he is really committed

7478445 i asked why did you buy it he said he bought it because there is a 10 year plan
7478446 this was a big win for us irrespective of the fact west ham went down to 10 men mark noble was sent off so early i felt we were in control

7478571 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish and through trial and error i finally settled on the best type of spit for the task at hand

7478581 who decides what the price band should be when companies like vodafone essar and bharti airtel can have a price band of around rs 800 900 how come the countrys number one telecom company is priced so low
7478582 the amount will go to the government and this might not necessarily be used for bsnls expansion
7478583 telecom companies like mtnl mahanagar telephone nigam ltd hindustan cables and iti ltd who listed themselves on the stock exchange are now loss making companies for the past five years
7478584 we have been assured by the telecom minister that the government will not proceed without the trade unions consent

7478595 israel will almost surely attack irans nuclear sites in the next four to seven months and the leaders in washington and even tehran should hope that the attack will be successful enough to cause at least a significant delay in the iranian production schedule if not complete destruction of that countrys nuclear program because if the attack fails the middle east will almost certainly face a nuclear war either through a subsequent pre emptive israeli nuclear strike or a nuclear exchange shortly after iran gets the bomb
7478596 israel believing that its very existence is at stake and this is a feeling shared by most israelis across the political spectrum will certainly make the effort
7478597 given the fundamentalist self sacrificial mindset of the mullahs who run iran israel knows that deterrence may not work as well as it did with the comparatively rational men who ran the kremlin and white house during the cold war they are likely to use any bomb they build both because of ideology and because of fear of israeli nuclear pre emption

7478618 have i become your enemy by telling you the truth
7478619 the world will assume that all ways of living which an ordained person is allowed to adopt are in christian eyes equally valid
7478620 we must no longer be children tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine but speaking the truth in love we must grow up in every way into him who is the head even christ

7478625 the vision of a global church of interdependent communities is not the vision of an ecclesiastical world empire or even a colonial relic the global horizon of the church matters because churches without this are always in danger of slowly surrendering to the culture around them and losing sight of their calling to challenge that culture

7478628 this was chinas last gold medal of the beijing 2008 olympic games but perhaps the most important one because after seven years of intense preparations bocog and china has offered to the world 16 days of exciting olympic sports competitions supported by smooth operations a success which has permitted the athletes to achieve their best in optimal conditions
7478629 my colleagues and i are extremely honored to be awarded the olympic order
7478630 its not only a honor for the entire team of bocog but also a recognition of the hard work that the chinese people have done to host a successful games
7478631 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by the time of christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7478632 its fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7478633 some people have said its as big a financial shock as the great depression and as far as the oil shock goes the rise in oil prices is in the same order of magnitude that we had to deal in the 1970s
7478634 there are periods when markets look like they are getting better then another grenade explodes another bout of fear of sustainability of some financial institutions maybe intervention by the authorities
7478635 its obviously disappointing to lose a second game in a row
7478636 we went into the game hoping to get a victory but it wasnt meant to be
7478637 i thought after getting the scoreline to 1 1 we had a good 15 minutes to get the second goal
7478638 we had three good chances chances for woodgate bent and bale but it wasnt to be and it was sunderland who got the second goal
7478639 berbatov did not play because he wasnt in the right condition to play i spoke to him he told me that so he didnt play
7478640 well have to wait and see what happens in the next few days its impossible to say what will happen until we have spoken to the player
7478641 as for him not playing this is a situation which is very personal some footballers can play under these circumstances and others cant berbatov is in the later category
7478642 thats a very interesting question and a question that you should ask the club

7478719 a lot of homosexual couples asked me to not risk delaying getting the law passed by insisting on the word marriage
7478720 in cuba marriage is not as important as the family and at least this way we can guarantee the personal and inheritance rights of homosexuals and transsexuals
7478721 ive seen changes in my father since i was a child i saw him as macho and homophobic but as i have grown and changed as a person so i have seen him change
7478722 here we get a lot of respect this institution has helped raise our self esteem
7478723 in the early years of the revolution much of the world was homophobic it was the same here in cuba and led to acts which i consider unjust
7478724 what i see now is that both cuban society and the government have realised that these were mistakes there is also the desire to take initiatives which would prevent such things happening again

7478726 by declaring professor kenneth good an illegal immigrant he the president acted within his powers

7478729 in an essay the totalitarian temptation delivered in an address in 2003 to a conference on totalitarianism organised by the university of krakow in poland a country that knew both hitlers boot and stalins prof scruton considered the origin of totalitarianism to lie in the ordinary human emotion of resentment
7478730 totalitarianism he considers to be present when there is the absence of any fundamental constraint on the central authority
7478731 following the model pioneered in russia by lenin and trotsky and perfected by stalin its form is as follows society was controlled by the state the state was controlled by the party and the party was controlled from the top by the leadership this conception fits the reign of zanu pf as led by mugabe in zimbabwe
7478732 these outstanding claims are difficult to settle as a result of the nature of the challenges that affect them such as opposition from some of the landowners who are disputing the validity of the claims exorbitant land prices claims that have been referred to the land claims court family disputes as well as boundary disputes involving traditional leaders

7478754 think of some of the big things we handle like american idol we handle billions of text messages each month this is business as usual
7478755 to spoof it theyd have to have a giant list of numbers to mail it out to
7478756 a variety of measures both technical and human to avoid that kind of thing
7478757 it was a marketing move we thought it was a pretty interesting strategy
7478758 the aim was to attract attention the people in the queues told passers by about the iphone
7478759 we couldnt have expected the same kind of fever as in the united states given that apples products arent that well known in poland and in central europe in general
7478760 a total of 38 000 people signed up on our website to be kept up to date about the iphone before the launch

7478775 the lad would certainly be useful for our style of play but mourinho knows full well that we cannot sign quaresma until we sell someone else
7478776 it was a shame to see jan stretchered off like that but shaun and i played really well together
7478777 we connected on the park and communicated really well you saw the results and i hope we can repeat this in future
7478778 shaun is a really good player and i hope that he along with scott jan and myself he can help celtic achieve our target of winning the league for a fourth time in succession
7478779 we do not know who will be playing but everybody will be ready both physically and mentally
7478780 shaun and myself can give rangers problems next week but im unsure as to whether either of us will play because we do not know who will be fit
7478781 i played three times against rangers last season and the atmosphere at both celtic park and ibrox is fantastic for me it is one of the best derbies in the world and im just really glad im part of this
7478782 its important for your confidence to get off the mark early in the season and it shows you are here and good enough to play for celtic at this level

7478785 ladies and gentleman the coverage of barack obama was embarrassing
7478786 i am happy because we got an agreement with the people from the club i was trying to push it so we could get the deal done because people were talking too much about situations which werent there
7478787 i think that starting this week we can have an easy week now in training and just enjoy and concentrate on each game
7478788 it is great news for the fans but also for the players the gaffer and for me it wasnt a good thing to get phone calls every day asking me what is happening
7478789 so for me it is very important that it is all done and now i can just focus now on blackburn and football im 100 a blackburn player and i will keep working hard
7478790 the whole concepts ridiculous and only could be put forward by somebody whos seriously out of touch with scotland
7478791 who on earth would really want to jeopardise or sacrifice the future of scotland as an international football country so we could have a couple of players in an under 23 team in four years time
7478792 if you look at jamaica its an exceptionally brilliant nation and at the same time a small nation
7478793 the disappointing thing is that our performances against tottenham and liverpool merited six to four points not three like we have
7478794 we need to move on and pick ourselves up for the cup game its not hard but physically it might be hard it was demanding at liverpool and we worked hard
7478795 im desperate to have a good cup run whether that is in the carling cup or fa cup i dont care but we want to get into europe and the cups are the best way
7478796 we had a real belief that we could win and for 85 minutes we thought we would do that
7478797 even when it went to 1 1 we didnt think we would lose and we almost went ahead again
7478798 but we are looking good and we have to make sure this defeat doesnt turn out to be a major set back
7478799 the majority of the increase in commodities over the last five years has been driven by demand from china and the emerging economies being so great that supplies havent been able to keep up
7478800 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off
7478801 will highlight barack obamas life story his commitment to change and the voices of americans calling for a new direction for this country
7478802 demonstrate the breadth of our party and the different kinds of people who make up our country and have found a home in the democratic party because it represents their values
7478803 we agreed to make joint efforts to ensure the six party talks process enters a new phase
7478804 it will illuminate what fountainbridges most famous former milkman thinks of many aspects of scottish culture and life including sport architecture and of course the gothic tendency in scots literature

7478807 das war ein ganz anderer rhythmus verstehen sie mein herr befreiungsmusik
7478808 ich glaube nicht dass dieser herr ein liebhaber des jazz ist
7478809 in georgien haben mir viele misstraut ich spreche zwar georgisch aber mit akzent und schlecht das ist f r einen georgier unannehmbar

7478816 es geht hier darum eine geschichte zu beenden in der wir alle uns nur zum zeitvertreib fremdweltlicher zuschauer umherbewegen in der wir alle m glichst interessant sein m ssen m glichst gef hrlich m glichst t dlich f reinander und auch immer m glichst unterschiedlich

7478819 la informaci n que tenemos hasta ahora es que las rebajas han ido muy bien con un incremento de entre un 15 y 20 m s de ventas pero el volumen de facturaci n del conjunto de la temporada ser menor un 5 menos seg n nuestras previsiones a causa de la ca da del consumo
7478820 que se ha vendido m s en rebajas pero con tanto descuento que no sirve para compensar el conjunto de la temporada
7478821 a partir del 15 de agosto se han visto rebajas de hasta el 70 del precio algo que no pasaba hace a os
7478822 es un intento de salvar los muebles pero ser muy dif cil ahora lo que interesar a es que empezara a hacer fr o porque aparte del problema de la crisis la climatolog a ha sido muy variable esta temporada el calor vino tarde y no ha incentivado la compra de prendas de vestir
7478823 el sector de moda con un 20 menos de negocio muebles un 40 menos y electrodom sticos con m s del 15
7478824 la electr nica y la inform tica de consumo tambi n han registrado un 15 menos de ventas en el conjunto de la temporada precisamente en un sector en donde los precios est n bajando
7478825 la electr nica como el sector de la moda y confecci n es deflacionista porque cada a o se ofrece m s calidad sin aumentar los precios
7478826 el freno del consumo es psicol gico en un 50 las familias han dejado de consumir por el efecto psicol gico por o r y o r hablar de crisis no porque los precios hayan subido o porque hayan perdido poder adquisitivo
7478827 la banca ha restringido el cr dito al consumo y la capacidad de endeudamiento de las tarjetas de cr dito
7478828 ya que se ha sufrido el efecto de la subida del eur bor y de la gasolina pero hay gastos que las familias siguen haciendo como las vacaciones o el ocio en detrimento de las compras
7478829 las administraciones p blicas han de impulsar pol ticas de confianza y reducci n de impuestos para que el consumo pueda reactivarse

7478838 kelly shoppach and ryan garko will likely be the odd men out
7478839 my guess is that sal fasano and andy gonzalez will be the odd men out
7478840 why did the browns fall short of the playoffs last season
7478841 yes he may not be aggressive on the base paths he may not be a fan of bunting ever and he just couldnt get along with brandon phillips
7478842 5 is your friend and teammate braylon edwards plotting some sort of revenge after gashing his foot a couple weeks ago nah laughs hes just working to get back he will be fine hes taking care of his foot and he will be ready soon

7478850 as in the olympics we have a medals table at the end and people compete as an individual and for their country
7478851 we are looking forward to a fantastic competition there are some real quality athletes although the games are very inclusive
7478852 we expect these to be the biggest and most successful games ever
7478853 im looking forward to the discussions with the east timorese well work this through but the scheme as we announced it at the niue pacific islands forum summit is as it stands he told abc radio
7478854 one of the matters to report back is this and that is to be by years end and possibly earlier in terms of feasibility mr rudd said
7478855 but lets take it from the ground up theres still work to be done
7478856 we agreed with the australian government with the prime minister that we will discuss how we can participate and how the australian government can give us this opportunity he said
7478857 we have agreed to launch a joint education training and employment initiative which will come back to us with specific recommendations for action by years end mr rudd said
7478858 in particular what we are looking at is the needs in the timor leste public sector and its public service for an intensified training program grassroots middle level and senior level in order to make sure that east timor is properly equipped to address its challenges for development
7478859 the specialist training wing will allow the east timorese defence force to continue to develop as a national institution that secures and builds a better future for this vibrant democracy he said in a statement
7478860 we are working a lot i want this cd to come out in december but it wont be easy given all the prime ministers responsibilities the 45 year old apicella was quoted as saying
7478861 will anybody remain unidentified i cant say at this moment but the possibility exists he said during an interview with news radio cadena ser
7478862 we are working day and night and well but since the process started it has become more difficult than we expected due to the bad state of some of the dna samples said rubalcaba
7478863 if the sample can be matched to someone close like a brother or father it is easy but when there are only distant family members available it becomes much more complicated he added

7478865 this is a day of joy for the fighters of freedom and independence said said al attaba 56 the longest serving palestinian prisoner who had been serving a life sentence since 1977 for killing an israeli woman
7478866 it is like a wedding celebration for the palestinian people but our joy will not be complete until all palestinian prisoners are released he said by telephone referring to the some 11 000 palestinians still jailed in israel
7478867 abu ali yatta who was jailed in 1979 for killing an israeli student
7478868 blood on their hands who have been implicated in deadly attacks against its citizens
7478869 this is a big day we have been awaiting for 32 years said attabas sister sanaa who along with friends and family has been preparing a heros welcome for her brother when he returns to his home in the west bank city of nablus
7478870 it is a gesture towards the palestinian leadership to strengthen moderate and pragmatic forces olmerts spokesman mark regev said
7478871 we hope it will contribute to a positive climate he said it is not easy to release prisoners and particularly those who have been involved in murderous terrorist attacks
7478872 in the matter of the royal shop the executive council remains convinced that the companys resistance to its workers exercise of their right to freedom of association sprang from reasons other than the expected preference of most employers not to have to deal with the union
7478873 the outcome was a work stoppage which the executive council supported
7478874 in both cases there is a sufficient body of support to make the executive council signal that it requires a total national rejection of approaches to social values and national development such as those being advocated by those interests supportive of the royal shop and sandy lane

7478880 the caspian region is wondering what this means for the future
7478881 after the military conflict with russia georgia cannot be marked on oil and gas maps as a safe transit route and no amount of support from nato can change this alteration
7478882 has always looked more like a diplomats pipe dream than a viable economic project
7478883 its promoters had not only failed to secure supply and transit agreements but also had yet to identify an oil company eager to champion the project and finance the pipeline
7478884 a mere demonstration of force apparently was enough to put tremendous psychological pressure on both suppliers and consumers
7478885 during the conflict russias black sea fleet patrolled georgias coast apparently indicating that the task to transport crude oil from ports to international markets could become a challenging objective
7478886 not a doable project because there is not enough gas to justify the investment
7478887 the only thing that can make it viable is by using iranian gas
7478888 want to have their cake and eat it too they want to keep europe from using russian gas and they want to keep iran in a corner too
7478889 we can forget about that project now russia has made that very clear russia did not invade kazakhstan but rather a small country that is a bottleneck between central asia and the west no one will want to take the risk of angering the russians again
7478890 washington must make financing and constructing the nabucco gas pipeline a top priority
7478891 in most capital cities petrol prices crept higher in the latest week after falling sharply over the past month
7478892 based on trends in the wholesale market the average pump price looks set to consolidate near 1 50 a litre
7478893 the average motorist is now forking out around 209 a month on petrol a saving of around 20 from the highs in mid july but still up 40 a month on a year ago
7478894 fuelwatch wont work wont give the benefits to consumers that its meant to
7478895 if the wholesale price is determined by the big oil companies and they also control many of the outlets its not a level playing field for those small operators those independent operators in the retail sector
7478896 central to our concerns is the fact that the proposal forces retail prices to be locked in for a 24 hour period
7478897 anticancer research is aimed at understanding the molecular pathways that can be selectively targeted to halt tumor growth
7478898 we know that the mtor pathway is activated in many cancers and therefore is a good target for fighting a wide array of tumors
7478899 we analyzed tissue from human biopsies as well as cancer cell lines and genetically engineered mouse models of cancer
7478900 this study inserts a new piece of information into the puzzle of the effects of mtorc1 inhibitors in cell signaling
7478901 furthermore because there are inhibitors of mapk pathway already approved for the treatment of cancer it provides us with the rationale for using combinations of mtorc1 and mapk inhibitors in attacking tumors thereby offering cancer patients another treatment option with immediate applicability
7478902 es ist noch kein meister vom himmel gefallen deshalb m ssen auch werdende fallschirmspringer durch eine harte schule gehen besonders schwer f llt es den meisten zu beginn der ausbildung im freien fall eine vorgegebene haltung einzunehmen

7478908 people are becoming more aware of the negative effects of conventional pesticides at the same time growers are more willing to switch they have more choices and incentive compared to 10 years ago
7478909 i think there has been enough scientific evidence that theres a difference between lets say conventional tomatoes and organic tomatoes in terms of pesticide residues but also improved taste and higher levels of antioxidants
7478910 i think its a combination of the movement of green chemistry trying to protect the environment and peoples thoughts about their own health maybe not even their health but their kids and grandkids health

7478923 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world athletes from 204 national olympic committees came to these dazzling venues and awed us with their talent
7478924 new stars were born stars from past games amazed us again we shared their joys and their tears and we marveled at their ability we will long remember the achievements we witnessed here

7478947 pemerintah telah banyak mengeluarkan undang undang yang mengatur pembinaan anak anak berkebutuhan khusus namun itu semua akan menjadi sia sia jika tidak ada kontribusi dari pihak non pemerintah
7478948 meskipun demikian harus diakui bahwa ini tidaklah cukup untuk menyantuni semu anak anak berkebutuhan khusus yang ada di jakarta
7478949 kami berusaha memberi kesempatan kepada pihak lain baik dari dalam maupun luar negeri untuk menjadi donatur sebagai upaya menolong anak anak cacat khususnya penderita cerebral palsy ini penting sebab masa depan anak anak tersebut cenderung dilupakan dalam masyarakat

7478980 that such a large amount of fish is used for the pet food industry is real eye opener
7478981 what is also interesting is that in australia pet cats are eating an estimated 13 7 kilograms of fish a year which far exceeds the australian average human per capita fish and seafood consumption of around 11 kilograms
7478982 our pets seem to be eating better than their owners
7478983 while much of the criticism has been on the grounds that forage fish could be better used for human consumption directly particularly amongst the poorer nations of the world rather than in the production of food for farmed fish little attention has been paid to the amount of forage fish used by the pet food industry
7478984 these gourmet pet foods contain a significant amount of fish that may be suitable for direct human consumption
7478985 that such a large amount of fish is used for the pet food industry is real eye opener

7479052 the economic potential associated with the convergence of xml web services and gis
7479053 the web is really a new medium it is the biggest change since the printing press in our society
7479054 we look back at the millennia at the events that have changed our society the internet will be up there because its had such a huge impact in such a short period of time
7479055 as we move forward with geography and the web together the accessibility of information needed to make decisions will make decisions happened much faster
7479056 one of biggest challenges to doing this is data accessibility
7479057 the data is not all in the right format to support communityviz but it is a look into the future into what the geoweb will bring us
7479058 whether were talking about canada and national mapping agencies that produce the bulk of data or in the u s usgs or national geospatial intelligence agency or in the uk ordnance survey or other countries where mapping is primarily a military function and access by civilian sector is severely restricted
7479059 it is then disseminated to a vast collection of users many of whom are not expert heres a distinction between non expert user and expert producer much of this dissemination occurs with various kinds of restrictions so countries and governments will vary as to whether the distribution is at the cost of reproduction or try to recover some of the cost of production

7479140 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7479141 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7479142 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7479143 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7479144 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7479145 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7479146 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7479147 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7479148 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7479149 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7479150 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7479151 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7479152 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7479153 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7479154 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7479155 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7479156 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7479157 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7479158 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7479159 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7479160 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7479161 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7479162 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7479163 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7479164 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7479165 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7479166 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7479167 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7479168 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7479169 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7479170 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7479171 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7479172 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7479173 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7479174 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7479175 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7479176 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7479177 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7479178 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7479179 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7479180 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7479181 the important thing is for him to be happy and im happy for him
7479182 at chelsea he certainly wasnt happy during two seasons and with three different coaches in charge someone like him who returns home does so with a lot of motivation
7479183 i cant say i wish great things for him because milan is a rival but lets say i hope he becomes champion of the uefa cup
7479184 hopefully its not as bad this time but theyre not going to give any medals out in august or september everybody wishes are that you win every game and it doesnt happen and everybody wishes that you dont get injuries but it happens
7479185 we have got difficult away games and its never easy at fratton park then we have got liverpool and chelsea with the super cup in between it does not give us any respite
7479186 by the time we get to the liverpool and chelsea games i think we will be in a far better position player wise and hopefully form wise too
7479187 i had a bad few days but i sat down and thought about it after i lost and i realised i was never going to be a winner over here anyway because theres no way i was going to beat shiming zou
7479188 after the fight i said a few things heat of the moment stuff some people back home probably do understand but the papers just jumped at the chance to ridicule me but i just need to grow up
7479189 but at the end of the day its still a bronze as soon as i got out of the ring there were a load of microphones stuck in my face
7479190 but hopefully people will remember me more as an olympic bronze medallist than for what i said
7479191 im going to stay at 48kg and hopefully shiming zou retires and gives me a chance
7479192 the operation has been booked and at the minute i can postpone it if it the injury settles down again
7479193 the surgeon feels i wont be able to last until the end of the season hopefully i can prove him wrong
7479194 we are going to have a lot of games coming up with the setanta sports cup starting again well have three games a week and whether my body can take that i dont know
7479195 ive had no calls about kevin doyle for probably about two weeks plus now
7479196 they cant make bids unless they call and i havent had a call so i havent had a bid
7479197 i do not believe that despite this negative result i am now out of the running for the title
7479198 there is nothing in the interview of kgalema that says judges are holier than thou kgalema is reminding us of the responsibility to respect the institutions of democracy
7479199 we have noted the interview of the anc deputy president and he is not saying anything else it also does not mean the judiciary is above criticism
7479200 the sacp is firmly of the view that continuation with the trial of jacob zuma is neither in the interests of our country nor that of justice
7479201 the manner in which the prosecuting authorities have handled the investigations and the trial undermines the basic precepts of natural justice and we are therefore of the view that he will not and cannot get a fair trial
7479202 to this end an urgent political solution needs to be found in order to arrive at such a conclusion the case against zuma and its handling has for all intents and purposes ceased to be a legal matter but has become a key political challenge facing our democracy going into the future
7479203 constitutional amendment number 18 2007 makes provision for the birth of the human rights commission parliament will however pass the necessary legislation which would enable government to establish the commission
7479204 one remains optimistic that the commission will be born during the life of this about to be born parliament
7479205 shortly after the passage of the enabling law zimbabweans became busy with preparations for and the actual electoral process as well as the presidential run off election which took place in june 2008
7479206 these matters remained of paramount importance and they stalled the establishment of the human rights commission
7479207 construction of the new parliament will commence sooner rather than later treasury will make available the requisite funds for the purpose
7479208 the new parliament building will hopefully be completed within the lifespan of this seventh parliament of zimbabwe
7479209 we have unanimously settled for mr moyo for the post of the speaker of the house of assembly and we are prepared to back any other candidate from the other political party for the post of deputy
7479210 we are still consulting with other members of parliament from other political parties and some of them have endorsed our candidate
7479211 it was in their interest to have a candidate from their formation
7479212 it is strategic to have a person from our party because we feel that there would be more free debate when the presiding officer is from our side than any other side we are still lobbying and persuading other parties to accept our candidate
7479213 we are confident that something will come out of the consultations we are currently carrying out
7479214 consultations are still ongoing and we will convene our caucus at 0800 this morning as part of our consultations
7479215 one of the main issues that the sacp will be raising at the tripartite alliance summit is the overwhelming dominance and control of treasury over key social policy decisions and the proximity of some of our cadres in government to big capital we need to restructure the functioning of the treasury vis vis the rest of government
7479216 what we often hear from government departments when it comes to implementing social policy is that the treasury has turned them down this is a lopsided view of how things are supposed to happen
7479217 a windfall tax on its super profits must be introduced immediately
7479218 the sacp further proposes that the tax should be ring fenced and used to develop alternative and sustainable energy sources and to reduce our dependency on foreign oil imports through increased public investments in for instance public transport
7479219 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7479220 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7479221 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7479222 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7479223 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7479224 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7479225 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7479226 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7479227 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7479228 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7479229 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7479230 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7479231 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7479232 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7479233 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7479234 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7479235 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7479236 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7479237 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7479238 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7479239 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7479240 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7479241 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7479242 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7479243 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7479244 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7479245 leul s a depreciat usor in deschiderea sedintei pana spre 3 53 lei euro dar a revenit la scurt timp spre 3 52 lei euro probabil ca dobanzile foarte mari din piata impiedica moneda nationala sa se deprecieze
7479246 we gaven onze zaak de naam carroesel omdat in de woning van de kunstenaar een paardje in papier mach stond dat vroeger op een echte kindermolen was gemonteerd we mochten dat van zoon kenneth smith behouden
7479247 one cannot over emphasise the importance of peace in the regions development indeed peace and peaceful resolution of conflicts are prerequisites for development
7479248 it is for this reason that the promotion of peace security and stability are major objectives of sadc and the african union
7479249 the training centre as a centre of excellence in peace support operations for the region has a big role to play in identifying and planning for the brigades training needs and achieve the regions peace and security objectives
7479250 at this critical time of nation building through the formation of an all inclusive government members of all parties must do everything possible to facilitate a genuine lasting and stable government of zimbabwe by zimbabweans and for zimbabweans let us help build the zimbabwe we will be proud of
7479251 selfish and external interests must not be allowed to frustrate president mugabes meticulous nation building skills as a tried and tested leader since the liberation struggle which saw the formation of the first government of national unity in 1980 and the unity accord between pf zapu and zanu pf in 1987
7479252 the results of negotiations mediated by president mbeki appointed by sadc and the african union are historic in africa and the whole world in that where there has been disagreements people have not resorted to fighting and loss of lives fighting has remained through the meetings of the minds

7479256 strategia de dezvoltare a bancii vizeaza in continuare pentru anul in curs cresterea productivitatii libra bank a luat masuri pentru fluidizarea fluxului operational propriu prin infiintarea unui centru de procesare care centralizeaza si eficientizeaza activitatea operationala a bancii
7479257 consolidarea pozitiei k tech electronics pe o piata tot mai concurentiala a reprezentat pentru noi o prioritate in acest an evolutia pozitiva a cifrei de afaceri obtinuta in aceasta perioada in care piata si a diminuat cresterile reprezinta un echilibru intre extinderea diviziilor de vanzari si investitiile realizate
7479258 la nivelul pietei de it atat estimarile studiilor independente cat si ale principalilor jucatori din piata sunt rezervate privind cresterile din acest an
7479259 someone didnt do their due diligence exercise on the property
7479260 before you buy or sell a property of any kind either the buyer or the seller should do as a matter of course a proper due diligence to ensure there are no worms in the can it is surely the implication that no proper due diligence was done or that it was half baked
7479261 if they did it erroneously then certainly a potential purchaser may have a claim unless the purchaser should have reasonably known that such a contract was not possible in the first place
7479262 but its not to say that transnet has acted incorrectly without investigating the background and other agreements transnet may have in place with regard to that particular tract of real estate
7479263 urmare a activitatilor investigative specifice demarate in regim de urgenta impreuna cu procurori din cadrul d i i c o t biroul teritorial cluj s a stabilit ca grupul infractional avea 11 membri care incepand cu anul 2006 au pus la punct un mecanism infractional astfel membrii grupului infractional identificat au creat conturi profile pe paginile de internet sus mentionate cu incalcarea regulilor impuse de adminsitratorii site urilor postand date fictive privind identitatea lor si fotografii ale unor persoane de sex feminin cu aspect fizic placut chiar vedete din romania dupa ce se crea un dialog cu viitorii posibili parteneri care accesau aceste pagini de internet acestia erau atrasi intr o cursa fara sa intuiasca urmarile

7479265 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7479266 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7479267 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7479268 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7479269 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7479270 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7479271 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7479272 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7479273 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7479274 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7479275 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7479276 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7479277 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7479278 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7479279 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7479280 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7479281 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7479282 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7479283 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7479284 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7479285 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7479286 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7479287 this is a planning took where all things are going
7479288 this is a day of joy for the fighters of freedom and independence said said al attaba 56 the longest serving palestinian prisoner who had been serving a life sentence since 1977 for killing an israeli woman
7479289 it is like a wedding celebration for the palestinian people but our joy will not be complete until all palestinian prisoners are released he said by telephone referring to the some 11 000 palestinians still jailed in israel
7479290 abu ali yatta who was jailed in 1979 for killing an israeli student
7479291 blood on their hands who have been implicated in deadly attacks against its citizens
7479292 this is a big day we have been awaiting for 32 years said attabas sister sanaa who along with friends and family has been preparing a heros welcome for her brother when he returns to his home in the west bank city of nablus
7479293 it is a gesture towards the palestinian leadership to strengthen moderate and pragmatic forces olmerts spokesman mark regev said
7479294 we hope it will contribute to a positive climate he said it is not easy to release prisoners and particularly those who have been involved in murderous terrorist attacks
7479295 im looking forward to the discussions with the east timorese well work this through but the scheme as we announced it at the niue pacific islands forum summit is as it stands he told abc radio
7479296 one of the matters to report back is this and that is to be by years end and possibly earlier in terms of feasibility mr rudd said
7479297 but lets take it from the ground up theres still work to be done
7479298 we agreed with the australian government with the prime minister that we will discuss how we can participate and how the australian government can give us this opportunity he said
7479299 we have agreed to launch a joint education training and employment initiative which will come back to us with specific recommendations for action by years end mr rudd said
7479300 in particular what we are looking at is the needs in the timor leste public sector and its public service for an intensified training program grassroots middle level and senior level in order to make sure that east timor is properly equipped to address its challenges for development
7479301 the specialist training wing will allow the east timorese defence force to continue to develop as a national institution that secures and builds a better future for this vibrant democracy he said in a statement
7479302 we know that as a close friend you will continue to play a very important role in the building of our state he said
7479303 when you look at some of the things you say why didnt they pick that up but then you understand that actually theyre not trained or havent the experience to understand the college of emergency medicines tony joseph told seven
7479304 any avoidable death clearly is a great concern professor steven boyages from the service said
7479305 we are working a lot i want this cd to come out in december but it wont be easy given all the prime ministers responsibilities the 45 year old apicella was quoted as saying
7479306 me dijo si no quieres nada en serio subes a la habitaci n echamos un polvo y te vas
7479307 if we were gone i dont think cable could hold their interest very long weve put millions and millions of dollars into programming and we should be compensated if youre making money from us
7479308 nosotros lo que pedimos es informaci n por muy triste que sea
7479309 que eso lo que significa es que aunque sea un dedo se enterrar
7479310 quisiera saber yo c mo alguien le puede explicar a una madre que va para canarias a enterrar a sus dos hijas y a su nieto que piense en los estatutos de una asociaci n

7479313 aggressive management of this infectious disease is feasible and can prevent high mortality rates and further transmission of drug resistant strains of tb
7479314 the reason we have the problem is inadequate control of tb
7479315 this treatment is extremely labour and resource intensive and has to be done within extremely well structured tb programmes
7479316 its a very important paper showing its possible to deal with xdr tb but its very expensive
7479317 the thing about home is theyre a team thats just down the road from us there is loads of scope for us to work with them and im looking forward to getting the littlebigplanet space in there working on it and making it cool
7479318 the short answer though is that i cant announce anything right now
7479319 but ive already seen great littlebigplanet content in home which was at that conference and which was public and i think its a great sign that that was possible with a very small amount of time and a small amount of effort
7479320 what satire should be shrewd sassy topical and just plain fun
7479321 effortlessly riffs on all aspects of modern relationships both comedic and dramatic
7479322 it was like a trance it was so glorious it was great to be with my daughter again
7479323 part of the plot as it said in the script was that this event would be used to start an international war on terror
7479324 we have been successful in recent years in attracting new doctors to serve the community having added more than 20 new physicians in just the last three years
7479325 in this highly competitive environment recruiting these new primary care doctors to help meet the needs of the pbmc service area speaks highly of the reputation of our medical staff and our beautiful community
7479326 having been raised in maine and gone to school in other states i realized maine is the best place for me
7479327 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding
7479328 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish and through trial and error i finally settled on the best type of spit for the task at hand
7479329 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7479330 marcus has written a book hasnt he so good luck with that thats the past
7479331 development boom will require significant quantities of extra electricity and water capacity over and above the normal developments assumed in past adwec demand forecasts
7479332 the virtual system encourages patients to walk more quickly and for longer almost without them realising it it is not just that they are distracted from the pain by moving faster than they realise their body actually feels it less were effectively fooling the brain and cheating the body
7479333 its a lot more fun than traditional rehab and it can actually facilitate a much faster recovery our test subjects are usually surprised when i tell them theyve improved by up to 20 per cent
7479334 mais tu te rends compte non mais tu te rends compte
7479335 et ma taille en plus cest un signe du ciel
7479336 religion in america is not about doing the right thing or the ethical thing it is mainly about salvation its mainly about getting your butt saved when you die and that is why i think they are less moral than ethicist
7479337 is there evil and what should we do about it
7479338 oh yea what happens when you die you will meet jesus hes wearing a white robe then you go in this room and you eat eggs
7479339 we vroegen de slachtoffers om hun aankopen te traceren en zagen dat de enige gemeenschappelijke factor was dat ze allemaal iets bij de lokale mcdonalds hadden gekocht
7479340 anything that could possibly happen is talked about in the advance plan
7479341 today it is clear that after georgias aggression against south ossetia that georgian south ossetian and georgian abkhazian relations cannot be returned to their former state
7479342 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have the right to get independence
7479343 under the cover of needing to deliver humanitarian goods nato countries continue to boost their naval grouping
7479344 it now appears likely that bush is cleaning up the remaining unsolved mysteries before he heads to crawford texas bush knows well enough that he cannot be prosecuted criminally while still in office however the federalist papers a collection of eighty five essays written by james madison alexander hamilton and john jay sets the precedent for prosecution after a president leaves office now that the anthrax attacks have identified a villain the remaining mysteries to clear up are the following the mysterious collapse of wtc building seven in the late afternoon of september 11 2001 and the hide and seek game with osama bin laden the remaining events will surely be cleared up in the coming weeks as well as low gas prices so the torch can be passed to john mccain so the same story with the same theme and plot can be continued for the next one hundred years until all of the oil is drained from the middle eastern spigot
7479345 to establish if customers partner is living at the property
7479346 as president of south ossetia and on behalf of the south ossetian parliament and its people with all gratitude to the president of the russian federation i once again call for the recognition of south ossetia as an independent state
7479347 lo que aconseja su revisi n corbacho indic que su intenci n es trasladar tambi n esta idea a las comunidades aut nomas con el fin de que se sumen a la iniciativa con sus respectivos planes de empleo
7479348 los datos ponen de manifiesto que la construcci n es el sector que destruye m s empleo y no volver a ser el motor del crecimiento econ mico de modo que deberemos de dar cobertura a una parte de desempleados de la construcci n y reorientarlos hacia otros sectores como la rehabilitaci n la vivienda p blica y la industria fundamentalmente la ligada a la innovaci n y a los temas sociales
7479349 se hace imprescindible una mayor coordinaci n para poder ligar m s las pol ticas activas y las pasivas que no deben ser gestionadas en compartimentos estancos hay dos administraciones competentes que deben tener una pol tica integral para las pol ticas activas y pasivas
7479350 para buscar una f rmula que permita conciliar la protecci n de los derechos del demandante de empleo con la regulaci n del mercado sin llegar a restringirlo tanto
7479351 el objetivo final es que un desempleado est el menor tiempo posible en esa situaci n utilicemos todos los instrumentos posibles para la consecuci n de ese objetivo esa es una reflexi n que debemos hacer
7479352 queremos que ese discurso sea participado por los agentes sociales y queremos consensuarlo tambi n con las comunidades aut nomas
7479353 y la primera cuesti n es trabajar para que no sea vista como segundo nivel sino como la gran oportunidad para toda una generaci n de poder tener un lugar en el mercado laboral

7479363 pedimos sua imediata libera o e acompanharemos este caso de muito perto
7479364 estamos decepcionados porque a china n o aproveitou os jogos ol mpicos para demonstrar maior toler ncia e mais abertura
7479365 os prisioneiros libertados pertencem a fac es que apoiam o presidente palestino mahmoud abbas e a liberta o um gesto para intensificar o di logo com parceiros que tem um compromisso com a diplomacia e se op em ao terrorismo
7479366 a liberta o dos prisioneiros demonstra a disposi o por parte de israel de fazer concess es dolorosas a fim de promover as negocia es de paz
7479367 espero que em breve israel liberte mais milhares de prisioneiros
7479368 um ato de fraqueza que vai incentivar ainda mais o terrorismo
7479369 esse discurso contra libertar prisioneiros com as m os manchadas de sangue um absurdo
7479370 milhares de israelenses que serviram no ex rcito t m as m os manchadas de sangue de palestinos e n o foram julgados e nem mesmo interrogados
7479371 tenho uma amiga palestina salwa aramin que est em uma situa o intoler vel

7479373 abir foi assassinada com um tiro na cabe a quando sa a da escola em anata jerusalem oriental o soldado nem foi interrogado a queixa da familia foi arquivada
7479374 no nosso caso o assassino de smadar se suicidou mas no caso de abir o assassino continua livre impune tanto n s as m es israelenses que perderam seus filhos como as m es palestinas somos vitimas da ocupa o
7479375 you can lead a horse to water but you cannot force it drink

7479378 she got us off to a great start in the swimming pool six medals up there with rowing and weve got the world championships next year
7479379 sometimes when you are young it goes above your head a little bit as we saw with our lovely young tom
7479380 he just loved every moment and you get experience from the competition so hopefully in four years time when were hoping for him to win medals he will not be quite so overcome by it all
7479381 they have no idea of the impact that they have had on the nation and that is just going to grow and grow and grow over the next four years it is going to be huge
7479382 the whole british olympic team is going to be so much better in four years because its on their home soil and this is their country
7479383 they will do everything they can to prepare to make sure that its a part of their career that is so much better than anything they have ever done and show their home country what they can do
7479384 you put on a party in london and everyone has a great time
7479385 they were having picnics the kids were out they were loving the music and it was what we set out to do which was to celebrate the handover with a big party not just in london but across the country where celebrations also took place
7479386 i do not believe that despite this negative result i am now out of the running for the title
7479387 the operation has been booked and at the minute i can postpone it if it the injury settles down again
7479388 the surgeon feels i wont be able to last until the end of the season hopefully i can prove him wrong
7479389 we are going to have a lot of games coming up with the setanta sports cup starting again well have three games a week and whether my body can take that i dont know
7479390 hopefully its not as bad this time but theyre not going to give any medals out in august or september everybody wishes are that you win every game and it doesnt happen and everybody wishes that you dont get injuries but it happens
7479391 we have got difficult away games and its never easy at fratton park then we have got liverpool and chelsea with the super cup in between it does not give us any respite
7479392 by the time we get to the liverpool and chelsea games i think we will be in a far better position player wise and hopefully form wise too
7479393 i had a bad few days but i sat down and thought about it after i lost and i realised i was never going to be a winner over here anyway because theres no way i was going to beat shiming zou
7479394 after the fight i said a few things heat of the moment stuff some people back home probably do understand but the papers just jumped at the chance to ridicule me but i just need to grow up
7479395 but at the end of the day its still a bronze as soon as i got out of the ring there were a load of microphones stuck in my face
7479396 but hopefully people will remember me more as an olympic bronze medallist than for what i said
7479397 im going to stay at 48kg and hopefully shiming zou retires and gives me a chance
7479398 ive had no calls about kevin doyle for probably about two weeks plus now
7479399 they cant make bids unless they call and i havent had a call so i havent had a bid
7479400 the important thing is for him to be happy and im happy for him
7479401 at chelsea he certainly wasnt happy during two seasons and with three different coaches in charge someone like him who returns home does so with a lot of motivation
7479402 i cant say i wish great things for him because milan is a rival but lets say i hope he becomes champion of the uefa cup

7479405 weve got bill miller who has worked with andrew many times doing the photography wonderful locations were shooting up in muskegon michigan lake michigan is standing in for the atlantic ocean so were shooting in the dunes up there i still have sand coming out of every orifice
7479406 andrew thinks its a more interesting filmic experience to do offspring
7479407 he plays that off through my character george peters who was in the first story the cops come to him when the stuff starts happening again these atrocities he realizes whats going on and gives them the lowdown with two pages of exposition

7479419 i know nothing about russia unilaterally halting the transit of civilian cargoes for the alliances forces through russian territory to afghanistan
7479420 generally speaking this is not our position we dont take such demonstrative steps
7479421 we propose continuing negotiations within the framework of the working group on wto accession but informing our partners of the need to exit some agreements which currently oppose the interests of the russian federation
7479422 reports are that she approached the ips iraqi police saying she had the vest on and didnt want to go through with it
7479423 if she was forced to put on the vest or if she did it voluntarily that is still being reviewed

7479427 he was certified dead by the paramedics on the scene according to his employer the man was from malawi
7479428 no i believe that it is a serious mistake an attempt to change europes borders by force
7479429 it is a classic invasion which has nothing to do with international law
7479430 it was a rescue operation by sarkozy i would like to personally thank him
7479431 if the european union had been chaired by a small country or sarkozy had gone on holiday it is very probable the russian tanks would already be in tbilisi
7479432 egypt is not happy because hamas suspended the talks on a gilad shalit prisoner swap and hamas is angry because egypt remained reluctant to host talks over the reopening of egypts rafah crossing with the gaza strip
7479433 i do not expect a breakthrough in the current round of talks i believe the conditions are not ripe and the situation in gaza and the west bank does not point to the parties being prepared to reconcile
7479434 egypt hopes to enhance talks over shalit but we do not think it is appropriate to talk about an agreement while the ceasefire deal is faltering because of non compliance by the israeli occupation
7479435 egypt wanted to listen to the factions first in preparation for a wider national dialogue which could be held after the muslim holiday of eid el fitr in october

7479438 tens of thousands of people could be in line for a refund
7479439 it wasnt a huge amount of money but it was ours
7479440 the genesis for this was chucks real feeling that this was an unfair position
7479441 georgias territorial integrity and borders of our country are recognized by un and the whole international community with this regard one sided recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia by russia is nothing and it makes threat to russias international image
7479442 the refusal to believe in anything you cant see yourself is absurd think about it ive never saw napoleon with my own eyes but that doesnt mean napoleon didnt exist
7479443 abortion took center stage at the dncs opening event an interfaith gathering that nearly filled the convention centers wells fargo theater
7479444 something within us must be calling for a better way
7479445 if we do not resist at this point at what point will we resist
7479446 that conflicts with our position and our responsibility to human rights itself
7479447 if you would have told me two or three years earlier willie youre going to be eating deer i probably would have looked at you like nah never ever it really wasnt that bad im not saying im going to get in there and cook some deer meat now but ill eat it again

7479457 veel mensen ervaren een koude dag met volop weinig wind en geen regen als een topdag ondanks de lage temperatuur dat is zowel in de zomer als in de winter zo juist de wind be nvloedt het weergevoel van veel mensen heel sterk ook de zon levert een belangrijke bijdrage aan de beleving van het weer zowel fysiek als geestelijk
7479458 if the u s dollar is rising commodities take a hit its been a huge factor
7479459 we may see this rally in the u s dollar continue in the short term but you have to differentiate between speculation and the underlying demand for commodities
7479460 the majority of the increase in commodities over the last five years has been driven by demand from china and the emerging economies being so great that supplies havent been able to keep up
7479461 hes done his best theres a couple of scores that we might question but hes still an olympian still a silver medallist and still a champion to me

7479467 i have read reports in the newspaper that the authorities did not reply to the two aims of mr gambaris mission
7479468 one is to release political prisoners including daw aung san suu kyi and the other is the dialogue between the government and daw aung san suu kyi
7479469 in conclusion mr gambaris visit resulted in no improvement and was a waste of time
7479470 we firmly believe that the way to bring about democracy peacefully is the seven step road map
7479471 we have made all necessary arrangements for your excellency to meet with daw aung san suu kyi your excellency also wished to meet with her and tried your best

7479475 im looking forward to the discussions with the east timorese well work this through but the scheme as we announced it at the niue pacific islands forum summit is as it stands he told abc radio
7479476 one of the matters to report back is this and that is to be by years end and possibly earlier in terms of feasibility mr rudd said
7479477 but lets take it from the ground up theres still work to be done
7479478 we agreed with the australian government with the prime minister that we will discuss how we can participate and how the australian government can give us this opportunity he said
7479479 we have agreed to launch a joint education training and employment initiative which will come back to us with specific recommendations for action by years end mr rudd said
7479480 in particular what we are looking at is the needs in the timor leste public sector and its public service for an intensified training program grassroots middle level and senior level in order to make sure that east timor is properly equipped to address its challenges for development
7479481 the specialist training wing will allow the east timorese defence force to continue to develop as a national institution that secures and builds a better future for this vibrant democracy he said in a statement
7479482 we know that as a close friend you will continue to play a very important role in the building of our state he said
7479483 in most capital cities petrol prices crept higher in the latest week after falling sharply over the past month mr james said
7479484 based on trends in the wholesale market the average pump price looks set to consolidate near 1 50 a litre
7479485 the average motorist is now forking out around 209 a month on petrol a saving of around 20 from the highs in mid july but still up 40 a month on a year ago mr james said
7479486 fuelwatch wont work wont give the benefits to consumers that its meant to senator xenophon told abc radio today
7479487 if the wholesale price is determined by the big oil companies and they also control many of the outlets its not a level playing field for those small operators those independent operators in the retail sector
7479488 central to our concerns is the fact that the proposal forces retail prices to be locked in for a 24 hour period association spokesman matthew hanton said
7479489 by banning the intra day price movements of fuel retailers motorists will ultimately pay more at the pump particularly those thousands of motorists that already shop smart and take advantage of the weekly discount cycle
7479490 in most capital cities petrol prices crept higher in the latest week after falling sharply over the past month mr james said
7479491 based on trends in the wholesale market the average pump price looks set to consolidate near 1 50 a litre
7479492 i think i was discriminated against based on age and favoritism
7479493 we have always been concerned about the buyout selection process and whether it would be fair
7479494 i dont see how you could say that it sets a precedent when its one person out of hundreds
7479495 i had no reason to think that what the governor said was not valid and that it applied to all state employees
7479496 be assured that no employee who declines the buyout will necessarily be subject to an involuntary reduction in force immediately after the buyout
7479497 a reduction in force is a specific term that applies to civil service employees ms alley is not a civil service employee
7479498 i do not think the taxpayers of this state would appreciate an agency holding onto executive service employees who do not have a job to do or a function to perform when that appointing authority can eliminate that position
7479499 we spoke with legal staff and we have learned that it is permissible to offer her the severance package

7479510 hey wally this book says over half of the population is crazy that means between you and me one of us is fucked in the head
7479511 oh no i dont think so im the crazy fucker here
7479512 man hat doch die wahl wenn ich hierher ziehe ist es naiv mich ber l rm zu beschweren
7479513 es ist vor allem auch finanziell gesehen eine super abendgestaltung
7479514 dann werden sich die anwohner beschweren dass sie inmitten einer lichtzentrale wohnen
7479515 die haben schon pech dass sich der g rtnerplatz jetzt so zum in treff entwickelt hat
7479516 dass ist ja auch wichtig denn sonst verscherzt man es sich eben mit den anwohnern
7479517 durch verst ktes licht soll der g rtnerplatz unattraktiver werden und gespr che mit anwohnern sollen die partyg ste auf deren probleme aufmerksam machen
7479518 die anwohner beten schon f r gewitter damit sie ihre ruhe haben
7479519 dort ist es ja auch sch n und es gibt keine direkten anwohner die man um den schlaf bringt
7479520 sie geht lediglich auf die b rger vor ort ein nicht aber auf die m nchner die am g rtnerplatz ihre freizeit verbringen wollen
7479521 die stadt r hmt sich immer mit ihrem italienischen flair und wenn dann mal ein hauch s dl ndischer stimmung auftaucht m chte man sofort alles mit verboten reglementieren
7479522 gerade dass die leute auf den stufen des g rtnerplatztheaters beisammen sitzen und plaudern ist ja das sch ne so etwas macht m nchen doch aus
7479523 wenn man keinen l rm will muss man halt aufs land ziehen
7479524 dann w rde sich das ganze verlagern und die anwohner eines anderen platzes w rden sich beschweren
7479525 die fortschreibung des formats in die dritte generation w rde ich nicht als revolution r beschreiben
7479526 these issues should not be linked we are organizing a non political event and if the hosting country is able to ensure the safety of participants there is no reason why it should not be allowed to host the finals
7479527 the boxing team is very young im happy with them its true we havent won a gold medal but im not aware of any problems
7479528 they came here with no experience and theyve won eight medals no gold i know but nobody was expecting more than one or two medals at all for us
7479529 now we have not only eight medals but also a team with olympic experience ready to start preparing for the next olympics
7479530 i will dedicate the next four years to training because i want to be ready to be an olympic champion in 2012
7479531 im really happy with the silver i know thats very important but i was so close to the gold this time i know im almost there so 2012 will be my year
7479532 an unmanageable bug ridden cost centre whose real lifetime cost is routinely calculated to be around 10 times its purchase price and in some cases significantly more
7479533 that management of that device is getting more complex and thats not to mention the power that they use and the co2 they produce as well
7479534 all of the worlds 450 million business pcs are now firmly in their marketing sights

7479536 theres no grey area between winning and losing we find a way to get it done
7479537 the thing i like about our offense is we can get you a number of ways
7479538 up and down that lineup there are three or four guys that can burn you with a home run everybody in our lineup with the exception of maybe kendall can hit a home run and beat you
7479539 you just dont know who its coming from that day
7479540 its a matter of just relaxing and going out and trying to take each start and improve upon the last one and not try to go out and throw a no hitter
7479541 the consistency he brings to the mound especially his last 10 or 11 times out has been tremendous
7479542 he said i was guaranteed two or three hits just because it was bobblehead day or hit a homer
7479543 he had a rough stretch and we took him out of the eighth inning role
7479544 we backing him up a little bit and kind of hand picked opportunities until he got his feet back on the ground
7479545 i knew wed draw 3 million fans before it was all said and done
7479546 ive seen this town before seen it excited about its baseball team

7479551 it is our hope that this will be the first of such collaborations and that this production will be reproduced at other venues throughout the greater milwaukee area and throughout the state
7479552 our hope is that this venture will bring together young artists from three prominent organizations as well as offer a wonderful introduction for young people to music theatre and dance
7479553 the opportunity to be part of a chamber orchestra playing this revered work is a tremendous bonus for our students
7479554 i grew up in the desert of eastern washington state
7479555 when i got into music my favorite bands played to 150 people in clubs its pretty much completely different than shows like this
7479556 in 95 when we first started playing festivals i had never seen that many people before it was a bit terrifying at first
7479557 we had a lot of big shows this summer but our band has always been more popular in europe than in the us every time we go over there its kind of a band holiday
7479558 since its a harley davdison crowd maybe well play all rock stuff and keep the quiet acoustic stuff down to a minimum so they dont throw bottles of piss at us
7479559 but maybe theyll be into it well have to decide what were going to do i dont know which way it will go
7479560 the harley davidson culture has crept into our band a little bit with some t shirts
7479561 dave grohl is into it im kind of the odd man out because im into motocross and dirt bikes
7479562 but i dont see this as a typical corporate show its more like a whole lifestyle celebration those folks harley enthusiasts are notorious for throwing good parties its going to be interesting to see how it goes

7479565 it was eerie but on the other hand when looking at it from stauffenbergs viewpoint and what he did and what these men did it was powerful
7479566 as an actor i think i can say for all of us who were there that we felt fortunate to get those locations and shoot at those places it really changes the performances to do it there at that spot
7479567 these guys are true american patriots they were fighting two wars
7479568 they were fighting the nazis the fascists in pacific and they were fighting jim crow racism prejudice in the united states of america at the same time
7479569 i love the idea of it it applied to where bond was at the end of the last movie
7479570 the one thing he didnt have with the relationship was that quantum of solace
7479571 its rare where you get a piece of material thats politically pertinent like this but also sort of non preachy and engaging entertainment for an audience
7479572 he doesnt want to be a monster he doesnt want to kill people
7479573 he loves her but if he gets too passionate he will want her blood he will want to kill her
7479574 doing those type of scenes is always a bit strange never mind a husband but an entire crew watching you
7479575 this was two lone wolves its a duel two complicated fascinating really brilliant people
7479576 for men with their histories their intelligence their egos a contest like this really did become kind of life and death
7479577 they say it in the piece there can be only one winner
7479578 were telling it while hes still in office which has never been done
7479579 the set decoration is insane and beautiful to think in the first movie we only had a ladder
7479580 everythings bigger from details like the wardrobe because of how big the screen is and the musical numbers are so much bigger
7479581 he believes hes only got a short time to live and that hes come down with this disease so hes kind of convinced hes got to get up the nerve to tell her how he feels before he dies

7479584 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
7479585 back in june and july i truly thought he was going to blow mccain out of the water and carry 30 or 40 states
7479586 what has happened is that republicans mccain specifically have really twisted his great charisma this electric personality to discredit his ability his experience his capacity his judgment i fear they are about to do to him what they did to gore
7479587 obama has got to do some things that will shore up his ability to lead not just to charm but to lead theyve got to give credibility to his understanding of foreign policy his ability to deal with tough people and tough questions and his ability to be more explicit and convincing on his health care policies and energy policies
7479588 normally i might say these conventions are not so important but i dont think thats the case this year
7479589 there seems to be a sense of urgency we have had a couple of weeks that were not so good
7479590 i think in the case of mccain they need to frame him
7479591 viscerally my feeling is theyve got to come back at him hard and theyve got to do more to complete the task of definition both definition of him as well as definition of john mccain
7479592 he has still got to get to the meat and potato blue collar workers this is a big opportunity for him
7479593 i have a lot of doubts that this convention is going to be as persuasive as it should be because theyve got this damn thing with hillary
7479594 i love hillary i was for her but this is the worst political decision i could imagine this is supposed to be an obama celebration youre going to get the nomination of someone who came very close to winning and youre going to get a lot of people in there cheering and hollering and some people booing
7479595 there has got to be a full reconciliation between the clinton people and the obama people i think the conventions will put to rest any past divisions among supporters
7479596 i did talk to him on the phone a short while ago and told him that he is in everyones thoughts and prayers
7479597 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7479598 but after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure and the right way to go
7479599 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7479600 obviously he loves the giants and obviously he is working for fox
7479601 right now he is relaxing and getting ready for his fox gig
7479602 i havent talked to any of the players or to kiwi or anyone this afternoon and until i do that i will just refrain from any thoughts about what might happen within our team
7479603 just riding on two wheels is really not the point its really more about an emotional experience and an experience of self definition as well
7479604 harley has been around for 105 years and we have a unique credibility and authenticity that none of our competitors can match even though they desperately try to copy us
7479605 because chrome and asphalt put distance between you and whatever the world can throw at you

7479611 demonstrate the breadth of our party and the different kinds of people who make up our country and have found a home in the democratic party because it represents their values
7479612 it would be illegal for anyone to be arrested while they were proceeding to parliament
7479613 zanu pf are in a desperate attempt to try and stop or abort our victory
7479614 the central government is beyond the point where it is satisfied merely with a wait and see attitude now were seeing some action
7479615 fiscal measures work relatively fast while monetary policies tend to have an impact on the economy only after a time lag
7479616 government coffers me be a bit under pressure in the second half of the year
7479617 so there is no need to be drastic in macroeconomic control in the second half of the year
7479618 theres a lot of pain that needs to be addressed
7479619 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why
7479620 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country

7479642 this system could become a tropical depression at any time as it moves west northwestward or northwestward about 15 mph
7479643 i anticipate that this system will be designated a tropical depression or a tropical storm at some point today
7479644 this system should track northwestward and potentially track over southwestern or western haiti late tuesday night or early wednesday morning as a 60 mph tropical storm this system may then track into the southeastern and central bahamas during thursday by friday this system may be tracking slowly northwestward across the central and northwestern bahamas as a strong tropical storm or category 1 hurricane
7479645 this system needs to be watched very closely as it poses a threat to hispaniola jamaica eastern cuba and the southeastern bahamas this system also will need to be watched closely along the entire us coastline as its exact forecast track is uncertain at this point
7479646 mas sempre que posso dou uma folheada nas primeiras p ginas h muita leitura obrigat ria para os vestibulares

7479652 its permanently crippling and it should never be performed by anyone
7479653 there is just as much evidence to support the case against declawing as there is research to support it with some studies finding few or only short term adverse reactions to the surgery and others finding medical complications and significant differences in behavior
7479654 theres not a cause and effect relationship thats been demonstrated there
7479655 in a situation where either the cat goes or the claws go theres so much at this point in terms of improved surgical technique with laser surgery and with pain control that you really can do the procedure with a minimal amount of discomfort to the cat
7479656 i dont think theres any comparison between cats enjoying a life in a household and putting them in a shelter to avoid declawing
7479657 cats start to scratch at a very early age about 8 weeks or so which is often the age theyre being adopted into a family
7479658 if that family right from the get go is providing acceptable scratching objects and making the couch or the chair not so inviting
7479659 it has become so routine that oftentimes a client will think
7479660 ive had people tell me when ive mentioned declawing them things like you should give them up to a no kill shelter rather than declawing them why would i put my cats into an environment where theyd be living in cages they have a very loving home
7479661 they can see its not a huge problem some have even gone out on activities on tours or sand biking
7479662 hong kong observatory had issued the strongest storm warning level 9 in five years on friday
7479663 as it entered a region of cooler ocean temperatures and strong northeasterly wind shear nuri weakened before passing almost directly over the city bringing little more than gusty winds and heavy rain damage reports have been restricted to strewn debris downed trees and in isolated cases toppled scaffolding air does not expect any significant insured losses in hong kong from this event
7479664 the next stop for nuri is chinas guangdong province where on thursday provincial officials recalled more than 40 thousand vessels to harbors and evacuated nearly a quarter of a million people winds will continue to diminish as the storm moves inland and nuri is expected to become a tropical depression within 24 hours still the big question that remains is how much rainfall nuri will dump on mainland china where precipitation induced flood damage often outstrips wind damage from tropical cyclones
7479665 with two more months to go in the most active part of the northwest pacific typhoon season nuri is the twelfth named tropical cyclone so far this year and the sixth to hit china four of the six have made landfall in guangdong province in southern china
7479666 they can see its not a huge problem some have even gone out on activities on tours or sand biking

7479672 theyve been told you cant know everything but they havent been taught you cant do everything
7479673 they become so committed outside themselves that they forget to be committed inside
7479674 we have an obligation but they have an obligation as well
7479675 its not that doctors are better at recovery its that doctors have a much more structured environment for them to return to
7479676 i started to become educated a little bit about substance abuse disorders and became a believer in that this is a disease process not merely a moral failing and people who had these problems could receive help and could return

7479716 when older adults become isolated fragile or suffer cognitive decline their diets often suffer
7479717 they tend to eat foods like toast sweets or junk food rather than cook healthy meals

7479764 this changes the strategic relationship between the us and poland there is a clear and explicit understanding that if there are negative consequences of stationing the missile shield the us will come to polands defense
7479765 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia its to protect our european allies from any rogue threats
7479766 the strategic significance of the system consists of intercepting those few dozen missiles moscow can launch following a first strike its a crucial element to develop a nuclear first strike capacity against russia the original plan is for ten interceptor missiles in poland but once established their number could be easily increased

7479774 the dark days of communist yore and captures the threat of what we and russias neighbors are up against
7479775 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
7479776 immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
7479777 nato can act to stabiliz e this very dangerous situation
7479778 now is the time for action not just words russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
7479779 making putin pay and turning russias georgian rout into a political defeat

7479782 in the world of global commerce china calculated that staging an olympic extravaganza could enhance its ambivalent reputation by contrast the putin government seems to believe its power grows in sync with its reputation as an international pariah an outsider state

7479788 kremlin capitalism is a threat to the west by using its market strength in oil and gas resources to strong arm its neighbors and outmaneuver the us and eu
7479789 is to replace a pro western government with a new russian satellite reminiscent of the brezhnev doctrine its part of a broader campaign to annex new territory expand the russian empire conduct cyber attacks against the baltic states assassinate enemies and use economic intimidation through cutoffs of russian oil and gas shipments to ukraine and the czech republic it is important that moscow pays a concrete and tangible price for its latest aggression at least comparable to what it paid for the 1979 invasion of afghanistan
7479790 burned and houses broken unburied bodies lay rotting fresh graves were dug in gardens and basements most victims interviewed were ethnic georgians in central georgian villages some killings were carried out for revenge some involved theft and still others seemed to be that the power balance was shifting away from ethnic georgians to the ossetian separatists and their russian backers
7479791 georgians living in several of the villages said the russians occupying their land had treated them well done nothing to encourage them to leave and offered the only protection available from the south ossestian militias they feared most
7479792 us sees much to fear in a hostile russia by usher ing in a sustained period of renewed animosity with the west problems extend ing far beyond arms deals with syria and the mountains of georgia

7479798 support is likely and that after all the events that have occurred one should not expect otherwise
7479799 appealed to russia and to governments of other countries to recognize abkhazias independence
7479800 express such a will and if the russian president makes a relevant decision on this score
7479801 again said they will never agree to remain within georgia
7479802 in accordance with the international agreements to their previous places of deployment
7479803 envisaged in the international agreement poti is outside of the security zone
7479804 but that does not mean we will sit behind a fence watching them riding around in hummers
7479805 we have registered an increase in georgian reconnaissance activities and preparations for armed actions in the georgian south ossetian conflict zone
7479806 temporarily suspending military cooperation with nato until a political decision on relations
7479807 now we see russian forces which responded to attacks on russian peacekeepers in south ossetia legitimately
7479808 local s ossetian and abkhazian population said they fear georgia might repeat its regional aggression they also want russian troops to stay in the area to shield them from any possible attacks

7479885 you all saw what happened we need to put our house in order and ensure that we speak with one voice and if we dont things will be too bad for us
7479886 what i believe is that all those in other parties should come to us and give proposals on what we should do let them tell us what we are doing wrong instead of aiming claims that cannot be substantiated
7479887 what we need in the country are not more than five strong political parties eventually we should just have two parties like united states of america and united kingdom
7479888 crime is crime and it does not matter where or when it was committed those arrested must face the law

7479902 every attempt to make war easy and safe will result in humiliation and disaster
7479903 it is a good viewpoint to see the world as a dream when you have something like a nightmare you will wake up and tell yourself that it was only a dream it is said that the world we live in is not a bit different from this

7479906 dritten gegen ber die behauptung aufstellen die mitglieder der familie pierer von esch f hren zu unrecht dieses namen
7479907 waren notwendigerweise zun chst siemens und mein mandant lediglich mit dem vorgang befasst
7479908 es gab aber in diesem zusammenhang keinerlei auftrag oder anregung meines mandanten weil siemens die sache als eigene behandelt hat
7479909 wurde aber weder vorher noch nachher mit den einzelheiten befasst
7479910 nur unter dem namen pierer erfolgen da nach dem sterreichischen gesetz ber die aufhebung des adels vom 3 april 1919 der antragsteller zur f hrung des namens pierer von esch nicht berechtigt ist
7479911 wieder den vollen namen seiner vorfahren pierer von esch f hren zu d rfen
7479912 der durch die f r ihn ma gebend gewesene oder noch ma gebende adelsfeindliche heimatgesetzgebung das recht zur f hrung einer adelsbezeichnung verloren hat
7479913 so wird diesem antrag aus billigkeitsgr nden regelm ig entsprochen
7479914 das von innerhalb des namens zu verschieben und mit einem anderen nachnamen zu verbinden so etwas tut man in unseren kreisen eigentlich nicht
7479915 nur eben nicht ber einen verst rkten vertrieb ihrer produkte

7479918 style should never outweigh function otherwise the workhorse of their home will be all shiny appliances and no muscle power appearances after all arent everything
7479919 sticking with the tried and tested triangle workspace with your sink cooker and fridge freezer at each point is a must if you want to create a functional kitchen
7479920 the choice is endless and it is easy to get carried away with gimmicky features or fork out for expensive appliances that you just wont use to their full potential
7479921 good lighting and the best quality fittings you can afford are also a priority to satisfy both design and function
7479922 playing it safe with cabinet colors and styles pays off in the long term especially when you come to selling your property
7479923 when you are choosing the style of your cabinets keep in mind that contemporary colors and finishes are likely to date fast shiny red colors might be a statement piece now but what about 10 years down the line
7479924 the kitchen is the traditional heart of a family home so the overall design is important if your family is to enjoy spending time there

7479929 with commentary of dr rabia bin hadi umayr al mudkhali professor in the islamic university of madinah al munawwara page 162 para 478
7479930 but ahmad ibn hanbal and other scholars permitted the narration of hadith regarding the virtues of good what is not sure as long as it is not known that it is a lie
7479931 where he presents the views of the majority of the
7479932 and that is the action which is known to be lawful with a shariah evidence and there has been narrated in its virtue hadith that is not known to be a lie it is possible that the reward will be true and none of the imams have said that it is permissible to consider something required waajib or recommended mustahabb by way of a weak hadith and whoever said so differed from the consensus ijmaa
7479933 and just like it is not permissible to forbid something without a shariah evidence daleel sharee but if it something is known to be forbidden and a hadith has been narrated in warning the one who commits such an action and it is not known that it is a lie it is permissible to narrate it and it is permissible to narrate it in the manner of encouraging and discouraging at tarheeb wat targheeb what is not known that it is a lie but in what is known that allah has encouraged or discouraged with another evidence besides this weak hadith whose authenticity is unknown majhoul haaluh
7479934 this is like the situation of the israiliyyaat stories related by the jews it is permissible to be narrated as long as we know that it is not a lie for encouraging or discouraging in what we know that allah has ordered in our law shar or forbade in our law shar
7479935 narrate from the hadith of bani israil and there is no harm in doing it
7479936 as for what has been authenticated as lawful to us by way of the israiliyyaat that has not been proven and no scholar believes in that and ahmad ibn hanbal and the like of the imams never depend on hadith like this in shariah
7479937 so he who transmitted from ahmad that he used to use weak hadith to support his opinion that is neither authentic in grade nor good he made a mistake about ahmad
7479938 and this hadith and the like ahmad calls it weak and he accepted it as a support of his view
7479939 i didnt find this hadith and i am afraid that shaykh mind has gone to the other hadith of abu hurayra ra that says
7479940 i was with ishaq ibn rahuyah when a man said why dont you compile an epitome mukhtasar of the prophetic ways this stayed with me and was the reason why i compiled this book the sahih
7479941 i never included in the sahih a hadith except i made a major ablution ghusl and prayed two rakat beforehand
7479942 the scholars have agreed that the soundest of all hadith compilations are the two sahihs of al bukhari and muslim and their vast majority have agreed that the soundest and most beneficial of the two was
7479943 the totality of its hadiths are 7 275 with the repetitions and about 4 000 without
7479944 the two sahihs differ from all other books only in respect to the fact that what is in them is sahih and does not require investigation
7479945 whatever only al bukhari or only muslim narrates enters also into the category of what is definitely sahih except a few letters which some of the expert critics objected to such as al daraqutni and others and these are known to the specialists
7479946 i am with ibn al salah in his conclusion and directives and allah knows best
7479947 what al nawawi mentioned in sharh sahih muslim is based on the perspective of the majority al aktharin as for that of the verifying authorities al muhaqqiqun then no for the verifying authorities also agree with ibn al salah
7479948 the narration of one such as those does not go below the rank of hasan which we might call the lowest rank of the sahih
7479949 this is an explicit confirmation that al bukhari and muslim did not confine themselves in the narrations of their respective books only to narrate hadiths that have the highest degree of sihha
7479950 the truth without doubt among the verifiers of those who have knowledge of the sciences of hadith is that the hadiths of the two sahihs are all sahih and there is not in a single one of them a cause for true
7479951 all these texts show that most of what is in sahih al bukhari and sahih muslim is of the highest degree of the sahih and that some of what is in them is not of the highest degree of the sahih
7479952 the ruling concerning the hadiths of the two sahihs is that they are all sahih
7479953 ich habe mir immer vorgenommen mich an diese statements zu halten ich sage immer was ich zu der jeweiligen zeit f hle

7479969 killed himself as a result of depression which was caused by stress from the superiors insulting remarks and actions
7479970 the superiors actions were intended to defame the officer and led to the excessive accumulation of psychological burdens on him
7479971 it was beyond something that can be called an instruction
7479972 you are not qualified as a petty officer third class
7479973 it is the first court ruling that recognizes the states violation of its obligation of ensuring security for national public servants over their psychological burdens
7479974 we are grateful for the court decision which ruled that any action claiming a life cannot be deemed an instruction
7479975 we hope the state will try not to let any similar things happen rather than appeal the ruling
7479976 it is disappointing that the states claim could not gain court understanding we will look into the details and decide on what step we will take

7479980 when tourists and people from other districts come to west bay we do not want it to be remembered for unsightly graffiti you would think in this day and age people would be more civilized than to be painting graffiti
7479981 i am asking the community to be watchful and to report any instances of graffiti to the west bay police station or to crime stoppers
7479982 vandalism is a criminal offence and the culprits will be treated accordingly
