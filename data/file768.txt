7680000 im going to be me im the same guy as the head coach as i was as an assistant coach ive just switched offices and if i change shame on me
7680001 i will be loose ive got to be able to think and keep cool and calm im not going to get all hyped up and come charging out of that helmet and trip and fall and embarrass myself
7680002 im going to do the same thing except i wont be near as involved in the play calling as i was
7680003 i told the guys i will have the headsets on but im into special teams thats my job i know the head coach is going to want to make sure the special teams coordinator has his game together and thats my top priority
7680004 weve got a great offensive staff and a great defensive staff they dont need a whole lot of input from me
7680005 i will listen to the play calls and stuff like that but i never go to the defensive side ive got more brain trust over there than a man deserves so i dont need to worry about those guys
7680006 that happened some last year and we got stymied weve tried to work hard on getting the ball to other men in the offense and we felt like that was accomplished
7680007 people will say oh my gosh how can you make that statement well hes a backup running back hes a starting slot and hes our kick returner hes got a great head on his shoulders and he could probably go in there and play quarterback
7680008 were going to try and get the ball to him downfield were going to try and push the ball to him vertically
7680009 were going to horizontally stretch the defense by spacing but were going to get the ball to somehow and not just on bubble screens
7680010 we hated to move him from offense because hes such a playmaker but he is such a skilled athlete back there
7680011 hes going to return punts and kicks and hes going to play corner for us and im excited to see what he can do i dont care if its kent richardson this is not a slam on the other guys but they are probably better athletes they just arent gamers so to speak and just dont have it under the belt like those guys
7680012 were replacing a lot of guys that played a lot of football they just havent been in the arena yet i hope when the lights come on they dont circuit out on athleticism i feel really really good
7680013 were not going to let them catch the ball and tackle them i cant stand that if its in the air go get the ball we have every much right to the ball as they do thats how we feel and thats how we will coach them were probably going to miss some and well probably get burned for some if you play aggressive and you dont play crazy dont just shoot from the hip but you play aggressive and go get it hey if you get beat you get beat
7680014 you cant just depend on incumbency to win races anymore

7680022 they arizona have been watching him for a couple of months now they pulled the trigger today
7680023 theres a theme of moral confusion that runs through the whole record
7680024 the world today is such a confused place things that people think are good values are obviously twisted but there are other things considered evil that obviously arent there is real evil out there but evil urges is about how all of these things that youve been told are evil really arent

7680028 chevron and the other partners believe there will synergies that can be achieved by exxon operating the project
7680029 they already have a significant staffing component in atlantic canada and experience in operating in atlantic canada by virtue of their operation of the hibernia offshore oil project
7680030 all the partners are in agreement that we need to move as expeditiously as possible
7680031 drivers have always had some broad discretion so discretion is put the darn stuff underneath until we implement or change or improve on the policy
7680032 as far as not being allowed to carry on bags thats not something that greyhound has initiated
7680033 am i sorry that this young man was detained for coming up on three days while we went through this yes i certainly am
7680034 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation

7680036 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7680037 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7680038 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

7680041 the bottom line from my perspective is the surgery went well
7680042 right now its a rough day for him but everything went well
7680043 he was fixing to be a big part of this team and to go out there on that field and see this kid laying there after what he went through was tough
7680044 we were talking about it this morning you can be out there in one play and it can be over for you just like that
7680045 i talked to cedric the other day and he told me how well hes doing
7680046 were rooting for him and i just cant wait to see him walk through those practice gates
7680047 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7680048 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7680049 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7680050 they are an obvious attempt to smear the senators character
7680051 shame on all of us for not helping with the project
7680052 after all he has done for us every man woman and child should have chipped in to build our greatest alaskan ever a home the size of the white house
7680053 most importantly however disclosure of the things of value and the negative repercussions flowing from that disclosure would have threatened the defendants future stream of things of value from veco bill allen and others
7680054 let us pray for her and the baby boy she dreamed of with her in eternity in her good care
7680055 when her fellow traffic agents came back from a stressful day on the job they could always count on donnette to lighten their mood with a joke or a funny comment
7680056 she grew up on an island known for its beauty and serenity and she carried that with her even as she walked the streets of new york city
7680057 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7680058 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7680059 we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7680060 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7680061 barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
7680062 a great american story modest means but big dreams and encouragement from loving parents
7680063 i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the centre of my world theyre the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about when i go to bed at night
7680064 a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me
7680065 the leader of the opposition has broken off communication with the prime minister for three weeks and this is clearly a sign of noncooperation
7680066 thats always been our intention at the end of the day the government needs to be able to govern but if thats not possible then somebody needs to get a mandate in order to govern
7680067 they came at us last monday with an e mail asking us for a meeting we responded we would get back to them today so we proposed a date
7680068 hes manufacturing some crisis about a dysfunctional parliament they wanted a meeting before the house returns and were proposing to meet before the house returns
7680069 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7680070 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7680071 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7680072 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7680073 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7680074 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7680075 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7680076 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7680077 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7680078 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7680079 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7680080 this is going to be catastrophic for millions of people
7680081 of course its possible to prepare a forecast with any lead time you like whether or nor that forecast has any accuracy or usable skill is another question
7680082 o governo quer cobrar mais e com maior efici ncia
7680083 from our standpoint this is the right thing to do if there is any question in the consumers mind about any product from that plant then the onus is on us and the cfia to act decisively and swiftly to restore consumer confidence
7680084 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7680085 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7680086 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7680087 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7680088 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7680089 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7680090 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7680091 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7680092 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7680093 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7680094 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7680095 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7680096 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7680097 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7680098 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7680099 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7680100 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7680101 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7680102 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7680103 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7680104 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7680105 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7680106 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7680107 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7680108 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7680109 for proof denies faith and without faith i am nothing
7680110 when creationists talk about god creating every individual species as a separate act they always instance hummingbirds or orchids sunflowers and beautiful things but i tend to think instead of a parasitic worm that is boring through the eye of a boy sitting on the bank of a river in west africa a worm thats going to make him blind and i ask them are you telling me that the god you believe in who you also say is an all merciful god who cares for each one of us individually are you saying that god created this worm that can live in no other way than in an innocent childs eyeball because that doesnt seem to me to coincide with a god whos full of mercy
7680111 the truth may be puzzling it may take some work to grapple with it may be counterintuitive it may contradict deeply held prejudices it may not be consonant with what we desperately want to be true but our preferences do not determine whats true
7680112 for me it is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to persist in delusion however satisfying and reassuring
7680113 weve tended in our cosmologies to make things familiar despite all our best efforts weve not been very inventive in the west heaven is placid and fluffy and hell is like the inside of a volcano in many stories both realms are governed by dominance hierarchies headed by gods or devils monotheists talked about the king of kings in every culture we imagined something like our own political system running the universe few found the similarity suspicious
7680114 you cant convince a believer of anything for their belief is not based on evidence its based on a deep seated need to believe
7680115 i cannot imagine a god who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation whose purposes are modeled after our own a god in short who is but a reflection of human frailty
7680116 a mans ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy education and social ties no religious basis is necessary
7680117 a casual stroll through the lunatic asylum shows that faith does not prove anything
7680118 we must respect the other fellows religion but only in the sense and to the extent that we respect his theory that his wife is beautiful and his children are smart
7680119 if i look over my life every single step of maturing for me every single one has had the exact same common denominator and that was accepting what was true over what i wished were true
7680120 the most savage controversies are those about matters as to which there is no good evidence either way persecution is used in theology not in arithmetic
7680121 the whole conception of a god is a conception derived from the ancient oriental despotisms it is a conception quite unworthy of free men we ought to stand up and look the world frankly in the face we ought to make the best we can of the world and if it is not so good as we wish after all it will still be better than what these others have made of it in all these ages
7680122 for those who believe in god most of the big questions are answered
7680123 whenever people are certain they understand our peculiar situation here on this planet it is because they have accepted a religious faith or a secular ideology ideologies are the modern form of faiths and just stopped thinking
7680124 intelligence is the capacity to receive decode and transmit information efficiently stupidity is blockage of this process at any point bigotry ideologies etc block the ability to receive robotic reality tunnels block the ability to decode or integrate new signals censorship blocks transmission
7680125 the materialist fundamentalists are funnier than the christian fundamentalists because they think theyre rational
7680126 we can all see how other peoples bs belief system or bullshit p makes them blind and
7680127 in gordiano brunos day the 3 terms were divided up differently you had science and mysticism on one side and religion on the other side science and mysticism are alike in their struggle against religion they were both based on experience and respect for the individual the idea of science and mysticism was go out and discover for yourself find out what works find out how the universe is actually structured and how you relate to the structure of the universe and so there were basically 2 areas of scientific exploration the external and the internal but they were both pursued by the same method the experimental method
7680128 belief is the death of intelligence as soon as one believes a doctrine of any sort or assumes certitude one stops thinking about that aspect of existence
7680129 all around one the true believers trudge by mouths grim brows furrowed ulcers and worse eating at their innards this desperate company of oddfellows thoreau live in what psychologists call cognitive dissonance because their reality maps are one and all too small to cover the vast eerie amusing world in which we live they are perpetually frustrated the world does not live up to their fixed beliefs they are all convinced that there is something radically wrong with the universe itself or with the rest of humanity and they never suspect that the real trouble is in their own rigid and robotic nervous systems
7680130 what can be asserted witout proof can be dismissed without proof
7680131 not only is there no god but try getting a plumber on weekends
7680132 holds that the existence of the ultimate cause as god and the essential nature of things are unknown and unknowable or that human knowledge is limited to experience
7680133 a few more questions before you verbally berate me how ever you see fit
7680134 do you think that if you prove me wrong then you must be right
7680135 i know that i may be wrong in my beliefs that everything that i have built my entire process of thinking upon may not be right can you not say the same
7680136 what is this momentum leading you to be so forceful in your beliefs
7680137 im a rational free thinker not a closed minded moron p
7680138 my comment on evolution i suspect you did not fully grasp
7680139 whereas if you dont even belief it how can you even try and discredit me
7680140 i hope one day you truly see the light and join us
7680141 i urge you not to even consider using it again
7680142 we all know how many people have died die and shall die in the name of god
7680143 is jesus willing to prevent evil but not able then he is not omnipotent is he able but not willing then he is malevolent is he both able and willing then whence cometh evil is he neither able nor willing then why call him god
7680144 follow the evidence wherever it leads us even if we dont like the outcomes
7680145 whereas if you dont even belief it how can you even try and discredit me
7680146 if evolution were true wouldnt we see animals that are half evolved from a dog into a pig
7680147 if indeed you live by good morals promote love honesty etc then i have no beef with you and i doubt many other people will have
7680148 what can be asserted without proof can be dismissed without pro
7680149 the bible is many times an allegory never a history book
7680150 in christianity neither morality nor religion come into contact with reality at any point
7680151 is man only gods mistake or god only mans mistake
7680152 each quote was either written by an atheist or is about atheism in general
7680153 for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him
7680154 as it is written there is none righteous no not one
7680155 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god
7680156 but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers drug dealers users for today and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death
7680157 but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us
7680158 but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord
7680159 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
7680160 that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved
7680161 being in the only cab in toronto with a c
7680162 i need to make money now show me how to do it
7680163 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7680164 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7680165 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7680166 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
7680167 no one works for someone we all just work together
7680168 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
7680169 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
7680170 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
7680171 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
7680172 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
7680173 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
7680174 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
7680175 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
7680176 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
7680177 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
7680178 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
7680179 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7680180 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7680181 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7680182 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7680183 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7680184 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7680185 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7680186 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7680187 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7680188 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7680189 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7680190 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7680191 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7680192 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7680193 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7680194 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7680195 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7680196 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7680197 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7680198 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7680199 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7680200 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7680201 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7680202 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7680203 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7680204 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7680205 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7680206 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply

7680209 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
7680210 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7680211 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7680212 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7680213 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7680214 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7680215 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7680216 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7680217 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7680218 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7680219 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7680220 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7680221 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7680222 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7680223 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7680224 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7680225 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7680226 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7680227 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7680228 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7680229 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations

7680231 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7680232 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7680233 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7680234 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7680235 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7680236 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7680237 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7680238 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7680239 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7680240 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7680241 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7680242 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7680243 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7680244 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7680245 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7680246 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7680247 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7680248 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7680249 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7680250 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7680251 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7680252 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7680253 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7680254 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7680255 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7680256 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7680257 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7680258 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7680259 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7680260 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7680261 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7680262 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7680263 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7680264 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7680265 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7680266 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7680267 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7680268 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7680269 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7680270 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7680271 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7680272 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7680273 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7680274 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7680275 this is a planning took where all things are going
7680276 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7680277 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal

7680288 bastion of bigotry against men that has thrown its influence and prestige into violating the rights of men by offering a womens studies program but no mens studies program
7680289 the courses pretty much treat guys as if theyre sources of evil in the world and the women are victims
7680290 im using the same argument here as we have with title ix when a university receives government funding they have to provide equal opportunities for men and women if theres no mens studies womens studies is unconstitutional
7680291 if roy den hollander really understood what mens studies was
7680292 but whenever you make a charge that youre favoring one group over the other they either have to make it equal or eliminate the first one id like to see every womens studies program throughout the country eliminated
7680293 its a belief system and like all religions its an irrational one
7680294 a feminist is someone who was born as a female and because of that believes theyre superior to men and that females are innocent until proven guilty and that guys are primarily always at fault
7680295 if feminism is declared a religion thats going to be a knife to the heart of darkness of it
7680296 and as i smile and put my arms around feminists thats the dagger hidden in my right hand

7680315 this was the perfect way to move the focus from the real issues
7680316 the council has said they didnt want to have layoffs but personnel is 83 percent of the police departments budget
7680317 if the departments can cut their budgets a minimum of 5 percent maybe we can use reserves to stem the tide a while until we get a handle of whats going on
7680318 the council has eliminated some items and added others that werent included in the budget
7680319 were also looking at water and garbage rates park rentals and other fees
7680320 we are perturbed at the lack of interest by city management in cleaning up vacant buildings

7680325 that such a large amount of fish is used for the pet food industry is real eye opener
7680326 what is also interesting is that in australia pet cats are eating an estimated 13 7 kilograms of fish a year which far exceeds the australian average per capita fish and seafood consumption of around 11 kilograms our pets seem to be eating better than their owners

7680357 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7680358 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7680359 we dont need an illusion of partnership when they surround us by bases from all sides they drag more and more states into the north atlantic bloc and they tell us dont worry everythings fine of course we dont like that
7680360 its difficult to count them but they say they are deploying at least 20 at each checkpoint and two or three heavy armored vehicles
7680361 we will focus on a concentrated international effort to help georgia to get rid of the russian forces
7680362 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia
7680363 alarmed by reports of russian plans to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia
7680364 we are hoping to resolve this situation peacefully and if that doesnt work out there are other methods
7680365 i think hell be a bit embarrassed to see us all but hes been the world champion for so long and now finally hes got gold

7680368 sea ice extent is declining at a fairly brisk and steady pace
7680369 the wider deeper northwest passage through parry channel may also open in a matter of days the northern sea route along the eurasian coast is clear
7680370 there were some years when some bears may have had to swim as far as 100 miles
7680371 now the ice is much farther offshore more consistently and for longer so the possibility of long distances between land and sea ice is much greater
7680372 certainly weve seen much increased activity in terms of russian overflights of canadian airspace the americans are seeing the same thing around alaska its something that is now starting to give us some cause for serious concern
7680373 its going to take a significant bullish event for the market to take a u turn that said itll only take one honking hurricane lined up at the gulf of mexico to shift sentiment
7680374 its not that im turning bearish its just that there are fewer and fewer reasons to be bullish prior to winter
7680375 its tough to find any reason to get excited about gas drilling in alberta
7680376 higher american production is certainly a big factor in the gas price correction im very surprised its such a big correction but i believe its overdone we are at or very near the bottom
7680377 we cant get the batteries replaced under warranty but were going to give you a battery pack anyway it will be ready in 15 minutes

7680382 u s swimmer and olympic gold medalist michael phelps eats 12 000 calories a day and trains five hours a day a typical breakfast for him consists of three fried egg sandwiches loaded with cheese lettuce tomatoes fried onions and mayonnaise he follows that up with two cups of coffee a five egg omelet a bowl of grits three slices of french toast topped with powdered sugar and three chocolate chip pancakes if you were an olympic swimmer forced to eat that much what would you have for breakfast what about dinner in this hypothetical exercise you will never gain an ounce have any adverse health effects youre pretty much always hungry and your sponsors are paying your food bills
7680383 it seems almost inconceivable that a candidate who is running on an anti war platform would choose as his running mate one of the 77 senators who voted to drag us into the war in iraq a vote that launched what may be the greatest foreign policy blunder in our nations history
7680384 senator joe bidens complicity in the conspiracy to wage a war of aggression against iraq as well as his votes to continue funding the occupation should disqualify from holding any elected office let alone as vice president
7680385 when joe biden was first elected to the senate in 1972 the federal budget stood at 230 billion
7680386 today the budget is almost fifteen times higher at 3
7680387 joe bidens long tenure in the u s senate is proof that job experience does not translate into wisdom for obama to choose him as his running mate turns all the rhetoric of hope and change into nothing more than a meaningless bumper sticker slogan
7680388 a proud scot and a very proud brit as well
7680389 scotland should always be a stand alone nation at whatever i believe
7680390 we need to be part of the british team at the moment because that is where all the coaches are the facilities and the money
7680391 we would have to be an independent country for the international olympic committee to acknowledge us as a nation
7680392 if scotland was to become independent and we were to have our own olympic team then we would need those facilities in place in order to compete i believe an investigation has to be started now and money put aside now to prepare for that eventuality
7680393 but there is something else as well i still have a problem with a lot of our medals were won in team events we are strong in those team events because we compete as a british team
7680394 if we go independent as a nation in the olympics then that part will be lost
7680395 i think the idea of a scottish olympic team is nonsense to be honest i dont think it would be a good idea
7680396 that would be a step backwards while we might come back with one or two medals it is far better to be part of something bigger like team gb
7680397 ive been very proud to represent scotland at the commonwealth games and that is something i will always treasure and hopefully ill compete again in future years
7680398 i am a proud scot and a very proud brit as well in terms of scotland becoming an olympic nation by itself i think there needs to be a lot more investment up there in terms of facilities but today is about the british team really and we are here to celebrate that
7680399 team gb has had a remarkable games and made us extremely proud as an integral part of team gb scottish athletes made an enormous contribution to the medal haul and once again we punched above our weight
7680400 now is the time for us to congratulate them all but instead alex salmond is abusing the successful performances of scotlands athletes to push his own separatist agenda he should listen carefully to what the athletes themselves are saying they like the vast majority of scots are proud to be both scottish and british
7680401 the snp are so narrow minded they cannot celebrate the success of scots in the gb team they cant cope with the fact that they are proud scots and proud brits
7680402 we must protect our athletes by ending this nonsense of a separate scottish team for the olympics let us celebrate the gb olympic team and the scottish commonwealth team
7680403 we are putting in the investment in new facilities including a new national velodrome in glasgow which will raise our ambition as a country and allow athletes to prepare properly
7680404 the bottom line is that i wouldnt be sitting here with three gold medals or any gold medals around my neck if there hadnt been a facility in edinburgh when i was 13 14 years of age
7680405 obviously there is a new track being built for the commonwealth games in glasgow but to demolish a track in edinburgh means there is a whole crop of young riders who are never going to get the chance to try out the sport
7680406 its very short sighted i think but hopefully there can be some pressure put on them the council as a result of the success of the cycling team and the olympic team as a whole
7680407 shamelessly stole the fights from two cuban boxers in the semifinals
7680408 it was a crime what they did with the young men from our boxing team to complement the work of those who go about stealing athletes from the third world
7680409 we are competing with three important cities tokyo chicago and madrid rio de janeiro has concrete chances
7680410 obviously as a brazilian i want to win as many gold medals as possible but there are others who also want to win i think brazil won some things that it was not in the habit of winning
7680411 she said her hair and body cloaked in the long black abaya that many muslim women wear to cover themselves

7680491 he benji actually helped me write some of the songs for my new album and for the bff show hes a really amazing talent songwriter and singer
7680492 my job as president would be to try to make sure that we are tightening the screws diplomatically on iran that weve mobilized the world community to go after irans program in a serious way to get sanctions in place so that iran starts making a difficult calculation
7680493 weve got to do that before israel feels like its back is to the wall
7680494 i dont want to speculate on whether or not israel feels like it has a green light or not because that would be speculation
7680495 what is not speculation is that we have to act much more forcefully and effectively on the world stage to contain irans nuclear capabilities
7680496 i will tell you having visited israel a month and a half ago their general attitude is we will not allow iran to get a nuclear weapon
7680497 they recognize that there are no good military options but they also recognize that it is from their perspective it is unacceptable for iran to have a nuclear weapon

7680501 eu tamb m posso ver que n s somos o partido mais vibrante inclusivo e energizado e que estamos prontos para competir nos 50 estados a am rica j percebeu que n o podemos mais ter quatro anos do mesmo estilo de governo o partido democrata que pode efetivamente trazer a mudan a que o pa s precisa

7680506 yes i can confirm im pregnant its still early so im being cautious im resting as much as possible im so happy im just saying super healthy ive moved down to the beach with tito i love being by the beach
7680507 i think im gonna stay unmarried and just go for the babies im following in angelinas footsteps
7680508 there is one team that is willing to pay what we want them to pay and another that is not but the player is more attracted to the team that is offering less
7680509 we are ready to defend our interests we will not be selling any of our players for less than the amount that we believe they are worth
7680510 if anyone wants albert riera then they will have to pay what espanyol wants
7680511 he has spent too much time travelling and playing that makes it difficult to be at your best
7680512 the same thing applied to ryan babel he returned from china last week but i only really considered him as a substitute at the weekend
7680513 we were not too happy so we will watch the video and analyse things
7680514 torres knows he has to keep going against big strong defenders the referees know they need to protect the players with quality so we will see
7680515 in an ideal world we would all like michaels contract sorted out sooner rather than later but it is his contract it is nothing to do with me it is between him and the club but in an ideal world we would all like him to get it done
7680516 he is a world renowned centre forward and goal scorer when he leads us out it sends a message to other teams it tells them that we have some real quality in our side
7680517 he is not a ranter and a raver in the dressing room but he doesnt have to be his presence is enough and the aura that he carries with him
7680518 michael has scored a lot of goals past me over the years so i know what it is like to play against him if you are playing against michael owen you know you are playing one of the best in the world
7680519 we have some other good players as well at newcastle but seeing michael on our teamsheet sends out a message he is the most world renowned player we have he has the knack of being in the right place at the right time he is special
7680520 i am very happy because we got an agreement with the people from the club
7680521 i was also trying to push it so we could get the deal done because people were talking too much about situations which werent really there i think that starting this week we can have an easy week now in training and just concentrate on each game
7680522 be good for the dressing room and the team effort
7680523 our study found that pregnant women were more likely to aim for a vaginal delivery and they accept a higher threshold of risks from vaginal delivery when compared with clinicians
7680524 this indicates that experiencing labour and attempting a normal birth are two very important priorities in womens decision making
7680525 it may also indicate that doctors are biased by their inevitable involvement in complex cases or labours where things have gone wrong
7680526 if theyve seen a traumatic birth or been involved in a tragedy there is no debriefing for them
7680527 it can mean they are more judgemental about the risks involved
7680528 this study shows a consistent 20 increase in the risk of diabetes
7680529 it is important to stress that the reason for this is still not understood although it is possible that the caesarean section itself is responsible perhaps because babies born via that method are first exposed to bacteria originating from the hospital environment rather than to maternal bacteria
7680530 type 1 diabetes in childhood has become more prevalent across europe recently and the rate of this increase suggests that environmental factors are the cause
7680531 however despite much investigation these actual factors remain largely unknown
7680532 the findings of this study indicate that the way a baby is delivered could affect how likely it is to develop this condition later in life

7680536 like most australian financial services companies our results for the last financial year were directly and indirectly impacted by external events he said
7680537 however underlying business performance and momentum was maintained and we are well placed to ride out any further deterioration in the market as well as take advantage of any improvement in the industry cycle
7680538 thats still a good performance in a deteriorating economic environment mr mulcahy said
7680539 were very comfortable at the moment with the underlying securities chief financial officer chris skilton said
7680540 its not to say were not watching them very closely though
7680541 certainly the majors have indicated that they would move their rates down he said
7680542 were not a price setter we usually follow so well follow appropriately
7680543 they obviously had a go at iag and they seem to have moved on from than he said
7680544 they recently bought pmi a mortgage insurer so i dont know what their strategy is with regards to acquisitions now
7680545 we wouldnt comment on market rumour but were quite confident that our business is performing strongly
7680546 based on the outlook and continuing good progress on integration the board anticipates the groups ordinary dividend for the full year to june 2009 will be maintained at 107 cents per share suncorp said
7680547 while i understand shareholders will be disappointed by the headline result management responded well to the external challenges we faced our business remains fundamentally sound and the outlook for the current financial year is positive he said in a statement
7680548 merging our banking operations makes sense in the current economic environment and market cycle mr mulcahy said
7680549 this change has been on the radar for some time and the timing is now right
7680550 the promina merger is well advanced and we have the merger team expertise and infrastructure in place to help drive this change
7680551 you can be anything you want just so long as i say its okay
7680552 you will always be alone unless you make my mistakes
7680553 stand tall at the top i pray the view is worth it
7680554 global trading conditions for wine continue to be competitive but the category remains in solid growth mr johnston said
7680555 we have not been immune from industry wide pressures including an economic slow down in key markets and higher grape prices
7680556 foreign exchange movements in the 12 months to 30 june 2008 cut wine earnings by approximately 70 million and wine growth by 14 6 percentage points
7680557 put simply financial returns from wine have not met our expectations
7680558 we are making good progress with our wine review but wont be commenting on our analysis or conclusions until the review is completed
7680559 the impairment charges reflect revised growth expectations and the impact of exchange rate movements on the australian wine business the company said
7680560 the charges include write downs to intangibles inventory agriculture assets and property plant and equipment
7680561 the write down to bulk wine in australia and california adjusts the carrying value of inventory to net realisable value
7680562 continues with a rigorous process reporting directly to the chairman
7680563 the scope of the review is comprehensive and will amongst other things consider the optimal structure and operations of fosters wine business
7680564 fosters continues to expect the review to be completed by the end of 2008
7680565 in light of the wine review fosters will not be providing any specific earnings guidance for fiscal 2009
7680566 me and mine first and everybody else get the heck outta my way
7680567 were checking on all of our neighbors are you ok do you need anything
7680568 how do i get in a warm fuzzy mood for valentines day when theres so much bad stuff going on
7680569 the center of the german ball bearing industry that morning two hundred and ninety one b 17 flying fortresses took off from bases in england headed east toward the german border sixty were shot down taking with them more than 600 men
7680570 the bottom line is that this critically endangered species needs our help
7680571 what we have seen over and over again where economics and partisanship and political interests bump up against the science science loses
7680572 where the science is the weakest and the economic impact is the greatest
7680573 we need to be aware of those things we dont necessarily need to fear them but we need to be prepared and aware so i think we have those two steps covered
7680574 it might be a weather related emergency it could be a chemical issue it could be an intruder on campus whatever it is the students sign up and within minutes we can have that info on their cell phones to let them know take cover here or stay there or stay away from this building
7680575 theres going to be kids crossing crosswalks and pedestrians out and about and they just need to be aware they need to be defensive and be a safe driver
7680576 its a busy street and there is a lot of students exiting a lot of pedestrians as well so the help is that the led signs would be permanent reminders to slow traffic down
7680577 we felt the enforcement efforts in place and the great job our police have been doing why should we spend more money on something where we havent actually documented a speeding issue
7680578 but weve got a leader and i think hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances
7680579 hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances and the last thing we want to do is develop a tradition of knifing our leaders
7680580 we are led by a very talented person in brendan nelson who has my full support who i believe is doing a great job and will lead us to the next federal election
7680581 i took him at his word at that and my presumption is that he will indeed be leaving politics
7680582 but he will make his position clear i suspect in the next two or three weeks
7680583 tu madre va a ser enterrada en un ata d con forma de y

7680585 thats too close to elections probably it should be around four months printing of ballots will take time we will have so many candidates involved
7680586 people will be voting for president vice president senators party list representatives congressmen and so on therell be so many people involved if we use dre and omr there will be so many pictures there and so many types of ballots involved
7680587 creates far more problems than it will ever solve and it leaves the underlying problem untouched
7680588 i do not believe that a woman young middle aged or old just on a whim says i think ill give up my baby
7680589 no person shall be prosecuted for any crime based solely upon the act of leaving a child in the custody of an employee on duty at a hospital licensed by the state of nebraska
7680590 the law says an adult can abandon the child it doesnt even have to be a parent
7680591 hopefully the system would kick in and parents be notified that their child has been abandoned and the family could be reunited but one of our specific concerns involves the possible deprivation of the parents or one parents rights
7680592 what this society needs to do is consider the causes that might compel a woman to give up what might mean more to her than anything in her life
7680593 we need sex education we need to stop talking this abstinence nonsense based on religion and look at the reality of what these women face
7680594 creates far more problems than it will ever solve and it leaves the underlying problem untouched
7680595 im not really good at explaining these things would you like me to show you
7680596 im a little tense my name is claudia black and im from paris
7680597 who are you to determine the speed of our pace
7680598 didnt anyone tell you that the way to a girls heart is holding her properly
7680599 i dont know where you come from but round here manhandeling a girl will hardly get you anywhere
7680600 there was discussion about the fact that the market has become increasingly competitive and that for us to be able to continue to maintain our level of competitiveness in australia we need to work with the government on future transitional assistance programs the spokesman said
7680601 mr mulally reiterated the significant investment that ford has made in australia over the past 82 plus years including recent significant investments such as the development of the all new falcon and the fact that australia is the global engineering lead of the corporations next global light pick up truck he said
7680602 that re emphasised our commitment to australia and that it is an ongoing commitment
7680603 tell me something nice you saw someone else do today
7680604 tell me something nice you did for someone else today
7680605 i think hell be a bit embarrassed to see us all but hes been the world champion for so long and now finally hes got gold
7680606 its a very exciting time and its her first olympics shes been so inspirational
7680607 it is really nice to come home to a nice reception and theres nothing better than coming home
7680608 im going to have a really nice long break and decide what i want to do just do all the things that i havent been able to do and then decide when i want to get back in the pool
7680609 ive had a really hard run but ive had a fantastic time in beijing and i have a beautiful piece of silver hanging around my neck and now that weve finally touched down in sydney its such a great feeling
7680610 swimmers get up really early every day so itll be really nice to stay in bed as long as i want
7680611 everyone was taking photos of each other on the flight and it was really good fun
7680612 we need a policy to create jobs here in america
7680613 to invest in people and our infrastructure right here in the usa
7680614 at a time when iraq has a 79 billion surplus they have parked it in banks in new york city it doesnt make too much sense for us to be still spending u s taxpayer dollars 10 billion monthly rebuilding baghdad
7680615 we should use some of that money to rebuild virginia building roads and laying broadband lines and putting people back to work
7680616 we create jobs now but we also create the competitive platform for the future
7680617 i refuse to sit back like we did in 2000 and 2004 this administration is the worst administration in american foreign policy in modern history maybe ever every single thing theyve touched has been a near disaster
7680618 hybrids can be a silver bullet to high gas bills but some hybrids dont boost fuel economy much at all
7680619 if you just want to ditch a big suv used values are dropping fast
7680620 some cities let hybrid owners drive in the hov lanes
7680621 being here at my first convention its an honor to know that were all going to be a part of history its a unique opportunity to experience the diversity of all the 50 states while also giving me a chance to really see how pa compares to the other states in many ways were a role model for other states in terms of unity were united behind sen obama and were ready to take back the white house were here showing that we are a family ready to work for change as a young delegate its also interesting to learn from others who have been to many conventions before its great to learn about the rich history of past conventions from others who have lived it keeping in mind that well all soon be part of history this thursday when sen obama accepts the presidential nomination its inspiring to me as young and african american in elective office

7680624 despite the handlers best efforts there are always moments of political nakedness during a campaign when the voters see the candidates as they really are those moments can determine the outcome
7680625 i think those are all factors that will contribute to a lower turnout tomorrow tuesday than was originally anticipated
7680626 if i was dealing with flooding and all i wouldnt be thinking about voting but i think that some people who really plan on voting will come out and vote
7680627 not even if it was a hurricane i would still make it its very important especially with the situation were having with the current economy
7680628 if you get these pretzel things it will knock the chips down the bottom
7680629 i was going to get some other thing but ill get the pretzel things
7680630 public transport can offer a more cost effective option than the car is better for the environment and can be a lot less stressful removing the frustration associated with the daily commute by car
7680631 we want to see more scots make the switch leaving the car at home in favour of rail bus cycling and walking
7680632 we are beginning to see progress but with todays figures also revealing that there were more vehicles on our roads in 2007 there is a challenge facing us all as we seek to persuade people to consider more sustainable travel choices
7680633 if the governments in london and edinburgh are serious about tackling car use then they need to be a lot less timid and bring in measures that lead to traffic management
7680634 to be fair in scotland both the old executive and current scottish government have invested in new public transport projects more than the equivalent south of the border
7680635 what these figures do is knock on the head once and for all that public transport can replace car journeys
7680636 the lay out of our communities the lack of capacity and the need for people to commute long distances mean that a strategy is needed that works with cars not replaces them
7680637 the obvious suggestion is park and ride facilities need to be dramatically increased
7680638 the fact is that people are often unaware of public transport alternatives they feel comfortable in their car and feel that they have already paid for it so they want to use it
7680639 labour and the snp love to talk about getting people out of their cars but we have never yet seen a government in london or edinburgh which has any idea how to support public transport
7680640 instead decades of motorway building and subsidies to the airlines have wasted billions of pounds of taxpayers money and left us with record levels of traffic on our roads and filled our skies with planes
7680641 more driving and more flying can only be bad news for the planet
7680642 the scottish governments forthcoming climate bill acknowledges the urgent need for scotland to cut emissions by 80 per cent by 2050 however government support for new motorways roads and bridges and plans to expand airports makes the job of tackling climate change that much more challenging
7680643 i believe we will all remember 2007 as the year that the world responded to a wake up call too long ignored
7680644 we foresee mixed mobility combining intelligent highways and mass transit bike paths and short cut walking routes recharging kiosks and hydrogen fuel stations
7680645 this technology has been around for nearly 50 years but no one has bothered to try and use it
7680646 in september we are testing it in a drive from norwich to monaco and then to newcastle upon tyne
7680647 that is a distance of 2 000 miles and the car will do it on one tank of diesel
7680648 its like having a lamborghini without the cost or the damage to the environment
7680649 its fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7680650 some people have said its as big a financial shock as the great depression and as far as the oil shock goes the rise in oil prices is in the same order of magnitude that we had to deal with in the 1970s
7680651 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by the time of christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7680652 we have our fingers crossed but there is the recognition there is still quite a long way to go yet
7680653 i hope the bank of england are doing more than just crossing their collective fingers
7680654 the bank of england must be prepared to act as lender of last resort we cannot afford to let a major bank collapse
7680655 we certainly believe that the impact of the credit crunch is going to take some time to sort out and it may be prolonged
7680656 but if the right measures can be taken by the government and the monetary policy committee they can avoid a major recession
7680657 weve had a better year ourselves this year despite the various problems and factors which have been at play i think its generally been a good festival without being outstanding my real complaint is that the less successful shows havent done as well as they should have done
7680658 all the issues we know about have played a part in some way the main factor in the downturn is the problems with the box office which created instability in the minds of the public
7680659 we need to get more people into edinburgh during the fringe its as simple as that and i dont think the fringe has reached a peak or become too big
7680660 the last two weekends have been pretty busy but the rest of the fringe hasnt been as busy as it should have been there definitely havent been as many visitors in the city
7680661 the major factor in the drop in ticket sales has to be the box office fiasco were up about 18 per cent ourselves but it is quite important that the overall figure does appear to be down fewer sales means less money in the pockets of performers and more people making a loss at the fringe
7680662 we do need to look at how to make tickets cheaper next year we desperately need to improve the marketing of the festivals particularly outside edinburgh and we need to make sure the box office system works
7680663 our own box office is up about 16 per cent on last year
7680664 the whole venue felt much busier this year and we feel weve benefited from the weather
7680665 the major factor for us is that locals have come out in big numbers and have made up for the fact visitors are down because of the credit crunch
7680666 were no shows like fuerzabruta in the 1 200 capacity black tent down at ocean terminal
7680667 this is the third year that the fringe has sold in excess of 1 5 million tickets signifying another fantastic year for the worlds biggest arts festival
7680668 im confident that the fringe can stay ahead of the competition and retain its number one position as the biggest arts festival in the world
7680669 it still doesnt seem to have sunk in that neanderthals were particular savvy and dangerous
7680670 homo neanderthalensis is a species that lasted in ice age europe for hundreds of thousands of years
7680671 these guys were tough theres evidence that they could take down ice age mammals almost single handedly
7680672 they lasted longer than us evolutionarily and they had larger brains than us if anything if you call someone a neanderthal it should be a compliment
7680673 there are many different pillars that have been holding up this idea that neanderthals are stupider than our own species
7680674 the start of seabed clean up heralds an important phase in the closure programme
7680675 weve made significant progress in recent years to clean up and dismantle the site itself now we are cleaning up off site a legacy that has cast a shadow over the site for too long
7680676 this reminds us that the impacts of the nuclear industry were more widespread and expensive to deal with than anticipated it is a lesson to those with misplaced enthusiasm for a new generation of nuclear facilities
7680677 its welcome that the scale of the problem is being recognised and being cleaned up appropriately but its sad that we have had these particles loose in the environment for a long period i hope we have learned the lessons for the future
7680678 i want to make advertisement sure youve seen me of all the women that youve had the leading ladies do you have just one that stood out in your mind a little more than the others
7680679 youve got the mike stuck half way down your throat
7680680 i do reading and computers and golf i feel theres something cooking but i dont know quite what it is yet
7680681 in the dean village when it was icy i had to shove the horses arse up the hill
7680682 i dont think people in delaware are interested in your dental work your mouth is open when you are listening
7680683 no no they put it on me and told me to take it off at home
7680684 this illustrates the ongoing crisis the fact that there is so little meeting of minds between the dup and sinn fein it isnt a brilliant example of partnership government
7680685 the power sharing government in northern ireland was established after the st andrews talks which envisaged transfer of policing powers by may but unionists ruled this out as being too early
7680686 this sinn fein statement suggests a lot of work to be done around the whole issue what is clear is theres a degree of unhappiness
7680687 the national team comes first and at the moment we are keen to keep our nationality intact we have to have a national scottish team and we cant put that in jeopardy so there has been no change
7680688 thats all hypothetical the problem with international games is getting dates for them so it doesnt even come into the equation
7680689 i dont think a british team is something that will happen the football event in the olympics has a much higher profile in other countries compared with britain and the football authorities in scotland see the idea as the thin end of the wedge if it were to go ahead it would intimate the end of a separate scottish team whats more if you had to pick a team tomorrow you would be lucky to find any scots in it
7680690 first and foremost im scottish and very proud to be scottish
7680691 if having a british team means young girls will lose out on the opportunity of pulling on a scottish jersey then im not for it it was a very very proud moment for me and it would be devastating for girls not to get that chance looking at the numbers a british team would have far more players to choose from and would cut out a lot of scottish girls
7680692 we deserve to have a football team gb at the olympics and i hope it gets sorted
7680693 will put into question all the privileges that the british associations were given
7680694 we were given alcohol a local spirit made from sugar cane
7680695 sexual exploitation particularly of adolescent girls is common and is frequently a precondition for the allocation of work
7680696 the children come from a poor state no one educates them there but at least here they have an opportunity to learn
7680697 the children you see are helping their families they are not working
7680698 a proud scot and a very proud brit as well
7680699 scotland should always be a stand alone nation at whatever i believe
7680700 we need to be part of the british team at the moment because that is where all the coaches are the facilities and the money
7680701 we would have to be an independent country for the international olympic committee to acknowledge us as a nation
7680702 if scotland was to become independent and we were to have our own olympic team then we would need those facilities in place in order to compete i believe an investigation has to be started now and money put aside now to prepare for that eventuality
7680703 but there is something else as well i still have a problem with a lot of our medals were won in team events we are strong in those team events because we compete as a british team
7680704 if we go independent as a nation in the olympics then that part will be lost
7680705 i think the idea of a scottish olympic team is nonsense to be honest i dont think it would be a good idea
7680706 that would be a step backwards while we might come back with one or two medals it is far better to be part of something bigger like team gb
7680707 ive been very proud to represent scotland at the commonwealth games and that is something i will always treasure and hopefully ill compete again in future years
7680708 i am a proud scot and a very proud brit as well in terms of scotland becoming an olympic nation by itself i think there needs to be a lot more investment up there in terms of facilities but today is about the british team really and we are here to celebrate that
7680709 team gb has had a remarkable games and made us extremely proud as an integral part of team gb scottish athletes made an enormous contribution to the medal haul and once again we punched above our weight
7680710 now is the time for us to congratulate them all but instead alex salmond is abusing the successful performances of scotlands athletes to push his own separatist agenda he should listen carefully to what the athletes themselves are saying they like the vast majority of scots are proud to be both scottish and british
7680711 the snp are so narrow minded they cannot celebrate the success of scots in the gb team they cant cope with the fact that they are proud scots and proud brits
7680712 we must protect our athletes by ending this nonsense of a separate scottish team for the olympics let us celebrate the gb olympic team and the scottish commonwealth team
7680713 we are putting in the investment in new facilities including a new national velodrome in glasgow which will raise our ambition as a country and allow athletes to prepare properly
7680714 the bottom line is that i wouldnt be sitting here with three gold medals or any gold medals around my neck if there hadnt been a facility in edinburgh when i was 13 14 years of age
7680715 obviously there is a new track being built for the commonwealth games in glasgow but to demolish a track in edinburgh means there is a whole crop of young riders who are never going to get the chance to try out the sport
7680716 its very short sighted i think but hopefully there can be some pressure put on them the council as a result of the success of the cycling team and the olympic team as a whole
7680717 with the mess the council is in you would think they would be happy for any help they can get
7680718 the grass is a real eyesore but theyre quite happy for it to sit and get longer and longer its beyond a joke
7680719 ive already been out with a strimmer to cut a path through the grass so the kids can get to school they shouldnt be forced to walk the long way its too dangerous
7680720 the council is worried about someone being run over by the mower
7680721 i offered to get some friends to keep a look out while i cut the grass but they wouldnt change their minds
7680722 theres no way i would be able to tackle the grass with a normal mower it would take a week
7680723 people are offering to sort things out themselves because the local authority no longer seems capable
7680724 you would expect this to be welcomed with open arms
7680725 to turn down this offer on the grounds of health and safety gives residents no faith in the direction the council is heading in
7680726 yet again were in the land of health and safety madness
7680727 sometimes bureaucrats will get in the way of people being responsible and doing the right thing
7680728 it is against the law to use the equipment thats been suggested if it is 50 metres from a public road unless its fenced off
7680729 a prosecution figure of 7 per cent for rape is extremely low what this means is the vast majority of rape cases never make it as far as court no one can suggest with any credibility that the vast majority of women reporting rape are lying
7680730 rape is a crime which can take a lot of courage to report and it can come as a shock for women to hear that their case is not being prosecuted
7680731 this includes looking at the initial response from the police right through to what happens in court if the case gets this far rape crisis scotland is calling for a comprehensive and independent study into attrition in rape cases in scotland until we know exactly what the problem is why so many cases are falling down its hard to see how we can know what the solutions are likely to be
7680732 there are a variety of reasons why rapes reported to the police do not result in a prosecution in court and these apply across the country
7680733 there should be no doubt that we will gather all available evidence in the public interest and where we have sufficient evidence to bring before a court we will present a compelling prosecution case
7680734 instances of rape or at least allegations of rape are too numerous for us to accept 7 per cent of cases ever being prosecuted that doesnt make sense at all
7680735 the area around salamander street has in the recent past been the subject of a great deal of debate on the issue of prostitution
7680736 surely there is an opportunity here for the city to revisit this issue with consideration given to the creation of a tolerance zone
7680737 this would demonstrate an enlightened approach and would address important issues before they inevitably arise
7680738 i think that as an act of generosity the director of the cockburn association moira tasker should propose a tolerance zone outside her own house
7680739 the people of leith are sick and tired of people belonging to organisations like this who invariably live in places like stockbridge and morningside proposing once again that we dump all the social problems of edinburgh on leithers
7680740 we have almost eradicated this problem it seems this organisation hasnt looked at the history and the battle the community has fought to liberate the streets for local women
7680741 they should stick to what they do best and not engage in matters they know nothing whatsoever about
7680742 this is the law and we have to work within it whatever its limitations most laws could always do with some fine tuning
7680743 from a legal and enforcement perspective a tolerance zone is not possible theres also a community safety partnership approach we have adopted to encourage routes out of prostitution
7680744 it wasnt my fault i was unable to get there because they didnt give me any directions
7680745 the fact that he didnt turn up shows it was ludicrous to consider legal action
7680746 some people seem to think that if anything goes wrong they can claim compensation for it
7680747 this is the most bizarre tribunal case we have ever had we didnt even meet him he didnt turn up for two interview requests and it ended up at a tribunal
7680748 never had and never will forget you campbell my fav dance buddy back in the old days and the sweetest of hearts how could this happen
7680749 you will be so missed so much i dont know what else to say i hope your spirit finds rest and peace but you will never be gone from thoughts hugs and kisses nicky x
7680750 my thoughts go out to your family you are a much loved son dad husband and friend
7680751 gonna miss u bud not sure what to say but its been honour knowing u the last 15 years
7680752 hes one of the best friends you could hope for and its a privilege to know him
7680753 it is encouraging to know so many people are looking for stuart and offering us their support
7680754 stuart our daughter is improving on a daily basis and is no longer in royal aberdeen childrens hospital
7680755 if you read this stuart please get in touch your family miss you
7680756 all of our thoughts are with the family and loved ones of stuart campbell at this difficult and tragic time
7680757 im so very moved i cant believe youve all turned out for me im just overwhelmed
7680758 this journey began in the fairy story town of tenby in pembrokeshire and its ending here today i cant believe how many of you have turned out i thank you with all my heart
7680759 im really pleased i fractured my hip because its made it far more exciting and i got here just fine
7680760 i thank the head consultant of withybush hospital for letting me go i looked in his eyes and said ive got to do it
7680761 its a journey that came out of sorrow and pain and heartache but its a journey that has turned to joy i made 10 000 friends every year
7680762 everybodys in shock there are no words to describe it really the whole road loves them
7680763 an 18 month old boy is in a critical condition after what appears to be a tragic accident the toddler was playing with other young children in the garden of his home when he sustained a pellet wound to the back of the head
7680764 apparently the dad was cleaning the gun and left it loaded and then went to attend a phone call
7680765 whether it was in the back garden or inside i dont know it beggars belief how you can leave something like that around especially with kids especially loaded its such a shame everybodys shocked
7680766 as a parent of three youngsters i know that beyond doubt this is every parents worst nightmare
7680767 no matter the circumstances everyones prayers and thoughts should be with little rashid and his family they will be going through hell
7680768 when you let other people tell you whats right when you leave your instinct and your own truth behind

7680778 my wee brother was annoying me he flung paint on me so i skelped him over the head with a samurai sword
7680779 the boys grandmother overheard the argument and came downstairs to see what was happening
7680780 she observed that a large tin of white paint had been spilled and had gone on to the clothing of all three males and some of it had gone into the hallway
7680781 she was alarmed at the events that had happened and she called the police
7680782 allan and stuart brennan were having an argument between the kitchen and the hallway it escalates to the extent that stuart brennan throws an open pot of paint over the accused
7680783 the sword which is the property of the complainer is obtained by mr brennan from a recess in the hallway and he strikes the complainer twice on the head with it
7680784 i consider this a very serious matter and in my view a custodial sentence is the only proper disposal for such an offence
7680785 the research is clear if developed countries spent the same amount of money on preventing deforestation and the destruction of peatlands as they do on misguided biofuel subsidies 7 5 billion this would halve the total costs of tackling climate change
7680786 in the uk alone biofuel subsidies cost 550 million annually in 2005 a similar investment in preventing deforestation and peatland destruction could have offset the equivalent of up to 37 per cent of all uk emissions
7680787 it is becoming increasingly clear that unless we find a practical solution to the problems caused by deforestation the battle against climate change is in danger of being lost
7680788 we therefore feel that these repeated defaults and violations have forced us to withdraw our support from the ruling coalition and sit on the opposition benches
7680789 students on benefits and single parents are particularly at the mercy of the very complicated method of getting funding
7680790 we need to simplify the whole system to one that places emphasis on ability to learn
7680791 the real danger is if we keep going the way we are going that there are some universities in the country only the super rich will be able to go to
7680792 every university principal in the country needs to aim to make their university strive for equality and seek people from all backgrounds regardless of their circumstances
7680793 it should never be about the wealth of students they can get through the door
7680794 what is independence who would protect us if were are independent
7680795 we have more of a right to recognition than kosovo
7680796 they are promoting these crimes by not raising their voices against them
7680797 they should be going after the overseers if a child is not getting the minimum wage if the girls are being exploited they are working advertisement as slaves the government should be forced to open schools and the kilns should be shut down
7680798 brick kiln owners are first and foremost business people their motivation is profit appealing to their better nature will yield few results
7680799 but the true genuine spontaneous smile is one where the mouth spreads in a relaxed way across the face and the eyes sparkle or soften depending on the context and meaning of the smile false smiles involve only the mouth
7680800 if you were to cover up the mouth of a false smile in a photograph you would see that the eyes appear to be dead and expressionless
7680801 smiling differs from person to person it is interesting to see from our survey that two politicians figure in the worst fake smile category the next question to ask is do people really trust them
7680802 it seems that we all believe the celebrity megawatt smile is much more trustworthy
7680803 this study shows a consistent 20 per cent increase in the risk of type 1 diabetes
7680804 it is important to stress that the reason for this is still not understood although it is possible that the caesarean section itself is responsible

7680840 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding
7680841 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish
7680842 and through trial and error i finally settled on type of spit for the task at hand
7680843 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7680844 for the first time as i dived to gather the ball at square leg i landed on my side and a shower of murray mints spewed out of my trouser pocket all over the grass right in front of the umpire
7680845 fortunately neither he nor the two batsmen seemed to take much notice as i scrambled around on all fours trying desperately to gather in the sweets before they started asking awkward questions

7680893 with the pending proposal to backfill the elementary school with a preschool and several local nonprofit social service providers the parking issue has risen to the forefront of the discussion
7680894 the community pool and middle school complex similarly create unique on street parking demand during the school year and when special events such as swim meets occur
7680895 the potential for increasing the supply of street parking in most neighborhoods is very limited however establishing angled parking eliminating restricted parking such as loading zones and minimizing no parking areas red zones are all options to be considered when supply is a problem
7680896 they carry a little bit of that same mystique as white sharks
7680897 just the fact that you have a 30 foot invertebrate lurking in the channel its amazing
7680898 i took over the old lease with options on it but it was tied in to what the prices per square footage are around the area
7680899 but a lot of these places are ice cream joints and food places that can sell their food to be eaten off premises our occupancy is limited to 49 and you cant take a drink with you and leave
7680900 i cant keep raising my drink prices because people wont come were not an upscale place and theres no room to expand
7680901 up and down the block places are getting forced out
7680902 and corporate things big chains from los angeles or wherever are whats coming in old santa barbara is leaving
7680903 i guess i went with the license every time it was sold
7680904 im pretty sad about this whole thing we all are
7680905 this place is mels i dont know if it would be right for somewhere else
7680906 we cant take any of the alcohol with us when we close
7680907 the future of waste management is looking at taking the organics fraction out of the stream
7680908 its been a challenge for us because there are no books on this there are no classes on this and theres no certifications there are few people that are really at the forefront so weve actually had to be trailblazers in a sense and figure out what works for us
7680909 the great thing is compost is reusable it goes back into the land so we keep feeding the land rather than the landfills
7680910 this can be quite the wasteful business its nice not to be just throwing it away
7680911 we know that 65 percent of what we generate as a community comes from our businesses
7680912 that means theres no end game theres no stopping point
7680913 were going to get as much as we can out of the landfill
7680914 because we have biodegradable bags that we put all the stuff into the upside is were not putting roughly 10 to 15 plastic trash bags into the landfill as well
7680915 they all go in the same container to make it easy and it does now go away but it turns into something positive the only things we wont take are glass metal and plastic
7680916 every time we use compost were increasing soil fertility the natural way
7680917 were not using all the fertilizers pesticides and synthetic inputs that are petroleum derived that we have to put on agriculture
7680918 santa barbara is a huge agricultural county we do millions and millions of dollars a year in agriculture we realize we can increase the level of sustainable development in terms of agriculture in our county by using the compost we have and reduce our dependence on foreign oil on synthetics on things that are toxic no one really wants to be spraying that stuff on his or her plants they do it because they want to have production if we can do it with compost we see that as a win win for everyone
7680919 compost is a definite solution to greenhouse warming global warming because it addresses all three soil water and air issues
7680920 thats probably the biggest thing other than that we think compost is a great product to use and we think composting is a good way to handle organics the city of santa barbara is showing good leadership in moving in that direction
7680921 i think were taking a very fresh approach to waste management and thats exciting for a lot of people
7680922 a lot of people have been doing trash for 30 or 40 years theres an established way to do it that we think can be reinvented into a better way
7680923 we will get 1 million 150 mile per gallon plug in hybrids on our roads within six years
7680924 i will set a hard cap on all carbon emissions at a level that scientists say is necessary to curb global warming an 80 percent reduction by 2050

7680940 looking out from this podium tonight i see this diverse assembly of democrats as a testament to the strength and unity of our party and the fruition of our 50 state strategy
7680941 we are after all democrats so it may take a while
7680942 were not the fall in line party we are diverse but make no mistake we are unified
7680943 i said mr president you can say whatever you like bill clinton is a unique figure in our politics
7680944 i am absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes
7680945 if we put the choice in front of delegates here and voters all across this country whos going to help rebuild this economy and put your family back to work whos going keep your family safe at night whos going to reduce our dependence on foreign oil the best person to do those things isnt john mccain its barack obama
7680946 want a leader whose judgment and experience they can trust
7680947 when hillary clinton was clearly in the democratic primaries the woman who the person who gathered the most votes 18 million of them was a great debater and a great campaigner
7680948 its not simply in the realm of animals that move very large distances
7680949 we wanted to study some kind of spontaneous behavior because learning experiments can sometimes become very frustrating
7680950 i think itll make us rethink what this kind of sensory ability is used for

7680961 the mysterious death of former deputy white house counsel vince foster
7680962 did a close friend of hillary clinton commit suicide or was it a massive cover up
7680963 vince foster got in his car and drove to fort marcy park in virginia and he supposedly walked through the woods and depending on which version of the story you believe he took his own life
7680964 there are still many chapters remaining open from her hillary clintons time at the rose law firm take whitewater and the death of vince foster
7680965 t onight we travel back in time to the early 70s and based on reporting from new york sun reporter josh gerstein we take a rare look at hillary clintons affiliation with a group of radicals more than three decades ago
7680966 much more of a classic liberal than the rest of us
7680967 all year long publications like the new york times washington post time and newsweek have all reported what they call republican presidential candidate rudy giulianis temper well the subjectiveness aside couldnt the same questions be asked about senator hillary rodham clinton
7680968 i think she does i think she has a temper as do many politicians and rudy giuliani your favorite has a temper as do many people
7680969 i think youve got to keep it in the context of what she does and who she is and im just telling you first of all i do have to say that while there are people who say that she has a bad temper she had almost no turnover on her staff in the white house so that says something
7680970 no i know a lot of them and they like her
7680971 to reject the idea of an on your own society and to replace it with shared responsibility for shared prosperity
7680972 this isnt the first time hillary has made her socialist views and intentions so apparent
7680973 there is no greater force for economic growth than free markets but markets work best with rules that promote our values protect our workers and give all people a chance to succeed

7681040 obviously when one talks about releasing prisoners specifically ones involved in terror against innocent civilians it is not a simple matter
7681041 hopefully it will contribute to a more positive atmosphere and will support the negotiating process between us and the palestinians
7681042 but we will not be satisfied until all prisoners are released the 11 000 who are still waiting
7681043 its extremely important just to keep making forward progress rather than trying prematurely to come to some set of conclusions
7681044 the law and order situation in nwfp and fata will not be solved until theres a stable government in islamabad
7681045 saving lives should be the first issue then we can look at the judges
7681046 we therefore feel that these repeated defaults and violations have forced us to withdraw our support from the ruling coalition and sit on the opposition benches
7681047 are we now a laughingstock for those who didnt want democracy in pakistan for them its a victory but were both losers

7681056 compared to the previous two olympics the atmosphere was better because of the range of medals we were getting from all different sports
7681057 it has been brilliant to try to compare this to what we might do in london casts a negative energy over it we achieved full stop we can look at what we might do in london in 2012 if it is less than what we did here so be it
7681058 in a months time i will have to get my head down and get training again with 5am starts so its more hard work
7681059 our study found that pregnant women were more likely to aim for a vaginal delivery and they accept a higher threshold of risks from vaginal delivery when compared with clinicians
7681060 this indicates that experiencing labour and attempting a normal birth are two very important priorities in womens decision making
7681061 it may also indicate that doctors are biased by their inevitable involvement in complex cases or labours where things have gone wrong
7681062 if theyve seen a traumatic birth or been involved in a tragedy there is no debriefing for them
7681063 it can mean they are more judgemental about the risks involved

7681081 this audience record is something i thought id never see again but what really satisfied me is the way in which these olympics truly captivated and seemed to inspire our country
7681082 for me the greatest measure of success at an olympics is the number of messages i receive from parents of young kids who have fallen in love with the olympics that child means more to me than anything because i think a love affair with the olympics is the greatest in all of sports

7681125 in nederland zijn we gewoon zo verwend als ik hier optreed vindt iedereen het wel leuk maar wanneer ik in argentini sta met een veel kleinere show gaat iedereen de hele avond uit zijn dak

7681142 but to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7681143 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7681144 we are going into the future what did i walk into a time capsule

7681157 i said then 35 000 people drank the kool aid he said barack is a clean cut guy he never liked gutter politics thats why the clintons did so and so i said i dont want to get into this so i went over to the elevator and he said uncle tom then he grabbed me and hugged me and started laughing i said what did you say i turned to freddrenna lyle and i said what did he say she wouldnt say anything thats when i said some bad things to him
7681158 calling me an uncle tom is beyond the pale especially considering where he is close with mayor daley and with gov blagojevich i am hardly the uncle tom here
7681159 i took all the beatings and insults and endured all the racist comments over the years from nasty republican committee chairmen

7681231 beste lezers ik denk in 1987 of 1988 is bij de fietstocht amsterdam op de fiets aan de deelnemers gevraagd naar ideeen om het fietsen in amsterdam beter prettiger veiliger te maken voorrang op fietsroutes kwam als beste uit de bus waarna de gemeente besloot het winnende onderwerp op de spiegelgracht een spraakmakende fietsroute uit te voeren volgens mij is wat er nu ligt uitgevoerd zonder de tekeningen in de verkeerscommissies te bespreken voor ons was de uitvoering een verrassing en wij vonden het meteen een onduidelijke uitvoering de gemeente vond indertijd dat een inritband aan de aanrijzijde en een doorgetrokken trottoirband aan de kant van de weg die voorrang heeft een goede uitvoering was uitritconstructies werden in die tijd op vele manieren uitgevoerd de wetgeving was onduidelijk vooral op jurispudentie gebaseerd wij hebben altijd aangedrongen op eenduidige uitvoering in amsterdam en het liefst duidelijke landelijke richtlijnen duidelijke wetgeving is er volgens mij nog steeds niet uitvoering volgens crow normen is volgens mij nu wel de norm maar die norm was er pas circa 10 jaar na uitvoering op de spiegelgracht de uitvoering op de spiegelgracht met bruine klinkers is nog onduidelijker voor weggebruikers dan een trottoir met stoeptegels doortrekken wij hebben indertijd nadat het uigevoerd is in de werkgroep fiets gezegd dat het onduidelijk is en mensen het niet begrijpen wij hebben toen aangedrongen om dubbelop haaietanden aan te brengen om de voorang duidelijk te maken de gemeente wilde dat niet omdat ze het tegenstrijdig vonden je legt een uitritcontstructie aan die impliceert dat fietsers en voetgangers op de spiegelgracht in in de nieuwe spiegelstraat voorrang hebben dan moet je geen haaietanden aanbrengen dan hebben voergangers geen voorrang uitritconstructies zijn volgens mij nog steeds slecht geregeld in nederland maar stadsdelen volgen nu wel de crow richtlijnen duidelijk is dat de constructie op de kruising spiegelgracht keizersgracht is aangelegd met de intentie fietsers voorrang te geven de inritband op de keizersgracht zou automobilisten minsten aan het twijfelen moeten brengen hoewel het niet aan de huidige eisen voldoet denk ik dat je bij een rechter als fietsers kunt betogen dat je er van uitging dat je voorrang had en dan vind ik het logisch dat je het voordeel van de twijfel hebt de wegbeheerder stadsdeel is verantwoordelijk voor de onduidelijke constructie al heeft het stadsdeel dat niet aangelegd dus ik denk dat of automobilist of stadsdeel de pisang zijn
7681232 dit is een in of uitgang of een aansluiting van een weg op een andere weg die door middel van een doorlopend verlaagd trottoir of een doorlopende verlaagde trottoirband van de kruisende weg is afgescheiden er mogen geen bochtbanden aanwezig zijn en de trottoirbestrating moet doorlopen uitritconstructie een uitrit moet snel als zodanig herkenbaar zijn

7681291 how long will the economy have to pay the price for that illusion the experience of merced which rose higher and fell faster than nearly anywhere else suggests that recovery from the national real estate debacle will be painful and protracted
7681292 weve played the game a lot and think its five star its got over 80 levels and the final one is really hard when you have to blow up fireballs that are coming at you
7681293 were all pleased with the game and hoping for a good response now its on sale at our website
7681294 we currently have two more games in various stages of production and hope to start creating more sophisticated 3d games that will put wales on the map in the computer games industry
7681295 the computer games industry is one of the biggest in the world yet there are very few companies in wales making games as a result many people like myself who are gaining degrees in computer game design are having to leave the country in order to find jobs
7681296 newports university has two excellent computer games development courses producing talented students with lots of potential it seems ludicrous that wales is losing them to other countries because we have no computer games industry
7681297 the release of this game represents a considerable success for adam and his team at dark rock
7681298 at newport we believe its essential to maintain close links with the computer games industry to enable our students to successfully find jobs when they graduate we already have graduates working for major games companies such as sega and blitz and this year sees the first woman graduate from the course
7681299 the university has now helped more than 65 graduates set up their own business
7681300 we have many enterprising students who posses a diverse range of talent and we help them by providing funding and the business skills necessary to become the entrepreneurs of tomorrow and ensure the future growth and prosperity of wales

7681306 when you consider that in recent years australian investors accounted for 40 per cent of the total value of transactions their lack of activity is acutely felt
7681307 while certainly not out capital seeking property is clearly down the outlook for institutional and fund management exposure to property will be driven by risk aversion retail fund flows and adjustments to sector weightings
7681308 none of these factors is likely to have a significant shift in the property sectors favour over the next 12 months although we note that kiwisaver is already starting to make a reasonably large impact to capital flowing into the funds management industry
7681309 will remain limited not just by availability and cost but by concerns over breaching gearing limits
7681310 compounding this is the supply of investment property available in australia one of the reasons so much money has been directed at new zealand was the lack of opportunity at home for australian investors this has changed estimates indicate there is between 10 billion and 30 billion worth of investment stock on the market in a normal market about 10 billion transacts a year
7681311 are we faced with a deluge of distressed sales in some specific sectors of the market such as vacant land and development property we might but this analysis is focused on the mainstream investment market sectors in the mid to upper price brackets here the answer is probably not
7681312 breaching gearing covenants could be one factor to drive forced sales some funds will put property on the market to insure against forced sales further down the track however for most funds property values would have to fall significantly for gearing ratios to be breached and for forced sales to occur
7681313 the 2008 09 net supply pipeline is 65 000sq m or 5 4 per cent of the 2007 stock this certainly looks a lot better than the last two cycles stock increased by 50 per cent between 1988 and 1991 and by 10 per cent between 1998 and 2001
7681314 however in the context of the recent past this supply is sizeable net supply in the past five years totalled less than 20 000sq m and it was negative in the last two years no wonder vacancy rates reached 20 year lows
7681315 however when you superimpose the supply on expected absorption you can see the increasing vacancy pressure growth has been negative in the first half of the year and it will most likely remain subdued through much of 2009
7681316 this is reflected in our low net absorption rate of 13 000sq m combined for 2008 and 2009

7681323 not just about themselves but about the direction of the country as a whole and theyve got good reason to be worried the fact is the economy is not working for ordinary americans
7681324 when you say the fundamentals of the economy are sound and your top economic adviser is saying youve become a nation of whiners then you dont get it
7681325 youre out of touch and youre not hearing the stories of ordinary americans who are working hard every day but feel like their just treading water and in some cases sinking
7681326 john mccain has a compelling biography he served america with bravery and distinction and he deserves respect for that
7681327 but his policies dont deserve respect his ideas dont deserve respect because theyre the same old ideas weve seen out of george bush for the past eight years
7681328 the most important issues for me are affordable health care and getting out of the war
7681329 it is just to let people know there are people in town who like sen mccain

7681334 its already harvest time for several corn fields so its a little too late for any rain at this point but what rain we did get this year helped yield a better crop than in years past
7681335 a lot of people if it doesnt rain they can still go to work tomorrow and still basically draw a paycheck but if it quits raining we quit drawing a paycheck

7681346 sci fi has enjoyed tremendous success with stargate sg 1 and stargate atlantis and were proud to be the home of the new stargate universe
7681347 universe will continue the stargate legacy of vibrant storylines and compelling adventures but will re invent the format in a whole new way
7681348 a little more character based a little less rooted in a sci fi mythology
7681349 it really does come down to characters and stories that are engaging and that people want to see that they feel like they havent seen before
7681350 this is an opportunity to reinvent this franchise and make it relevant to a new generation
7681351 we really dont want to be more of the same its going to build clearly off the existing franchise but with a cast that gives it a younger vibe
7681352 its not the case that anything is being pushed aside any more than sg 1 is pushed aside

7681356 the slowdown in housing starts has been very painful for the industry but it is the necessary medicine to work down the inventory of unsold homes
7681357 we need for sales to outpace production so we can work down these inventories thats what has to happen before we can get this thing back on track
7681358 we know the moment you find something thats more suitable to your needs youre gone
7681359 its going to take a significant bullish event for the market to take a u turn that said itll only take one honking hurricane lined up at the gulf of mexico to shift sentiment

7681361 its tough to find any reason to get excited about gas drilling in alberta

7681366 the videos that we will be selling will not just be of cindy stripping today
7681367 we have videos from the 80s 90s and early 2000 the goal is to give the public what it wants a hot naked woman at different stages of her life this is what the mccain campaign is all about giving the american public the soft core porn choices it wants
7681368 thats why the democrats ended up running a guy who constantly said that experience didnt matter but chose a vp based solely on that concern i mean hell americans only cared about the election when they heard i was having an affair up until that point they were too busy with americas got talent to pay attention bottom line this is a brilliant move by the mccain campaign go for the lowest common denominator it works all the time oh and i want to be clear i never slept with cindy mccain

7681405 wrong the plays of aristophanes prove that the overwhelming majority of athenians were straight and idiogenogamotics were ridiculed as either being effeminate or only doing kologamosis in return for political or financial favours if this was not so then aristophanes would not have mocked the politicians in the front seats as boy fuckers kologamosis with young boys will illegal in ancient athens and those engaging in it were banned from holding elected office or made numerous bum gags or brought naked girls on stage for an all male audience to represent peace or written plays featuring female prostitutes hellenistic romantic fiction such as the aethiopica also disproves your claims that women were only regarded as baby making machines menanders dyskolos also disproves your claims as does book 3 of apollonius argonougtica and euripides hellen kolofilia was nothing more than masturbation just ask yourself why it was only with a man and adolescent boy because it was easier for the giver to think the receiver was a young girl than if it was with a man the same age he might as well have fucked a sheep or a goat so to get back on topic it makes you wonder why rtd made captain jack an omnisexual read complete wanker

7681484 the anecdotal evidence of de stocking mirrors the recent report from the scottish agricultural college which highlighted unprecedented numbers of livestock leaving the hills
7681485 there is no single answer to this problem but i believe we can come up with a package of measures that could make a crucial difference to many considering quitting but we need a statement from the scottish government that recognises the current state of the industry in the hills and that must include getting payments out earlier than the december deadline that eu law demands
7681486 when were going into a time of economic uncertainty like this we turned away from some of the businesses we were looking at because they were followers we were looking for the leaders
7681487 we feel this has given us the market leading position
7681488 thrislington has chosen to concentrate on the top architects and specification markets instead of chasing the construction sector on a project by project basis
7681489 were heavily involved in the refurbishment market and theres definitely been a big upsurge in the number of refurbishments
7681490 social housing is also massive in the uk the products we make fit in perfectly with local authorities that are revamping their housing stock
7681491 and where people were considering moving house theyre now spending a bit of money on their existing houses
7681492 rubicon has historically and we see no reason why this wont continue grown at an accelerated rate compared to our core business so it will have more of a diluting effect on irn bru next year
7681493 we still expect irn bru will continue to grow and will endeavour to achieve that but as in this case if we add to the portfolio then naturally there is a diluting effect on irn bru as part of the business
7681494 a nation of sheep will beget a government of wolves
7681495 with all the different legs im a little slow when i start then i gradually pick up the pace i start feeling good and as im thinking im fine im fine im fine i get faster not fast like im going to break a record time but like ok im stronger now i can do this i can do this i can do this
7681496 uma prova o que deus p s em meu caminho
7681497 over the last twenty years republicans have become very good at finishing the democratic partys sentences and from a branding perspective democrats have broken the golden rule by allowing their competition to define the party identity it was time for the party to take it back
7681498 dit is de voicemail van ben smit spreek u boodschap in na de piep of bel later nog eens terug
7681499 for example youre this special forces unit set out to blow up a bridge while youre heading over to it you notice an antiaircraft unit up on a hill
7681500 it wont affect your current mission one bit but lets say you decide to take it out as a secondary objective a few missions later youre flying over that spot and you wont have to worry about getting shot down
7681501 because of whats on tv each night peoples knowledge of war and how it works and looks like is a lot better these days so everything has to be far more gritty and authentic
7681502 we interviewed lots of people coming back from afghanistan and iraq
7681503 we talked to one captain who had been out on the field every day for six months though he was in firefights almost constantly he only saw the enemy twice the rest of the time it was just shapes in the smoke
7681504 you understand why people fight the way they fight they dont just shoot each other from 10 feet away in fallujah if they know some enemies are in a building they completely drill it
7681505 in the original game unless you really knew the a i scripting tools it was sometimes tough to get the a i to work properly
7681506 you could build this big environment and the a i wouldnt know what to do in it
7681507 its always been really easy for developers to point to cross platform development as an excuse for things not working or looking right but thats just the lazy approach
7681508 this is why we built this engine so wed have games that look and play identical on all platforms
7681509 the numbers are relatively small but the important thing is that these deaths are preventable
7681510 every year a number of patients die in the bath so convincing people to take showers would be life saving
7681511 were not saying that people shouldnt swim but that they need to be aware of the risk and to go with someone who can help if they have problems
7681512 we always need to do whatever we can to ensure seizure control
7681513 people with epilepsy can enjoy the benefits of taking part in many water activities but need to take sensible precautions to reduce risk of drowning
7681514 we wanted to play a system in which the players we had would be comfortable in their positions and i think we used our players the right way
7681515 anderson wanted to play and i think he showed it was a very good decision he was fantastic
7681516 paul scholes looked to control the game and i think he did that we also had the energy and the qualities that both john oshea and darren fletcher bring to the team
7681517 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals it is time for archaeologists to start searching for other reasons why neanderthals became extinct
7681518 technologically speaking there is no clear advantage of one tool over the other when we think of neanderthals we need to stop thinking in terms of stupid or less advanced but more in terms of different
7681519 after many years of learning how to do it we did a number of analyses of efficiency and found that neanderthal tools are no less efficient and indeed in some respects were more efficient than the tools of homo sapiens
7681520 it was only by spending three years in the lab learning how to make these tools that we were able to finally replicate them accurately enough to come up with our findings
7681521 colonising a continent isnt easy colonising a continent during the ice age is even harder so for early homo sapiens colonising ice age europe a new shared and flashy looking technology might serve as one form of social glue by which larger social networks were bonded
7681522 there are no words to describe it really the whole road loves them
7681523 i knew she could be a tricky player i watched her match against katie obrien but i knew i could beat her ive been playing wta tour events for the last few weeks and really believe that i belong at this level and am targetting a place in the top 50 next
7681524 this is the worst air disaster in recent years we have never faced such a tragedy
7681525 at one moment we could not breathe at all because our lungs were burning
7681526 butterflies are very fragile and succumb to heavy rain and strong winds next years butterflies are out as baby caterpillars and it may well be that very heavy rain washes off eggs and in particular young caterpillars or they get diseases
7681527 the last two summers have been blighted by rain and wind that seriously affected their fortunes some species have managed to overcome the odds overall it has been a dreadful year probably the worst in my 45 year experience
7681528 it is now clear that the company intend to ignore the security standards laid down by baa and the department for transport for the safe operation of stansted
7681529 to do this because of a trade dispute is absolutely outrageous we are calling on baa and the transport department to enforce its own security standards
7681530 labour are failing the poorest in society the gap between rich and poor on key indicators like life expectancy is as wide as it has been since victorian times
7681531 labour have neglected our public health infrastructure and despite increasing nhs resources the amount spent in the worst affected areas is no greater than the amount spent in the most affluent areas
7681532 the uk is at the forefront of tackling health inequalities good progress has been made but the challenge of reducing the gap in life expectancy is still very much an issue lord darzis next stage review puts improving access and reducing inequalities at the heart of the nhs for the future including funding for gp practices in deprived areas this reinforces and recognises the global leadership role that uk has in this area
7681533 the nhs was built on the foundation of caring for the community
7681534 it was designed to help those who needed help care for those who needed care and treat those who needed treatment
7681535 total sales by the big three carriers will amount to 3 5 million iphones within the next two years
7681536 this number 3 5 million could turn out to be inflated the operators could lose money because they took all risks upon themselves having failed to dictate terms to retail chains through which they will sell the iphones
7681537 win because smartphones stimulate subscribers to use more value added services such as mobile internet and data transmission

7681547 both india and bangladesh finally exchanged genetic information of its h5n1 strains we have found that both the strains are related however we cant say that bangladesh was the cause of the outbreak in west bengal because we dont have documented proof to show that infected poultry was smuggled into india
7681548 we now know that both the viruses was of clade 2 2 variety which is a sub lineage of the highly pathogenic qinghai strain the strain however is different to the one that caused the manipur and maharashtra outbreaks

7681552 here anyone from many nations is welcome to participate and compete for the glory of victory everyone has a chance of winning a medal plus the opportunity to win one of our great cash prizes
7681553 i am thrilled that my work was recognized by the judges and to have two pieces selected is a real honor
7681554 it is exciting because it gives non members a chance to show their work in this gorgeous historic building
7681555 its the one time of year when we reach beyond our four walls and very small prestigious membership
7681556 weve heard criticism from across the country including representatives of the medical community that mr epps bill as presently drafted could be interpreted as instilling fetal rights let me be clear our government will not reopen the debate on abortion
7681557 for this reason im announcing that the government will introduce legislation that will punish criminals who commit violence against pregnant women but do so in a way that leaves no room for the introduction of fetal rights
7681558 our first day in camp a dry thunderstorm system came through and i remember something like 5 000 lightning strikes hit in the region we were in and i think 180 new fires popped up between washington and oregon
7681559 the fires we were fighting this year were smaller than we are used to because we are doing initial attack and we was hitting them just as soon as they were starting to pop up
7681560 we go in first cut out all the trees that are brunt through and could be hung up our job is to put them on the ground so other crews dont worry about it
7681561 youll sleep on the ground with a sleeping bag sometimes we dont even have a tent sometimes they just drop sleeping bags out of the helicopter to you on the top of a ridge
7681562 it kind of gets in your blood after a while
7681563 seriously i dont think the tow truck guys is gonna say oh look what ive always wanted lady boy cds

7681570 lovinsky abduction was reportedly made to look like a kidnapping for ransom on tuesday 14 august the alleged abductors called family asking for a ransom of usd 300 000 however there has been no further contact from the abductors
7681571 lovinsky pierre antoine graduated in psychology from the haitian state university and obtained further specialisation on child psychology in montreal canada he has been involved for several years as a grass roots community organizer mainly working with children in the early 1990s he co founded the foundation for the support of children fondsayon kore timoun yo for young street children in port au prince and a centre for teenage mothers foyer pour m res adolescentes
7681572 i know it was a difficult decision for lovinsky because he knew the risks and he had a family that he loved but in the end lovinsky felt he could not stay out of haiti any longer that he was needed to help organize progressive grassroots voices in haiti
7681573 i last saw lovinsky in person in february 2007 at the time he was receiving threats and frequently changing where he slept he knew he was in danger but also knew that in haitis democratic transition that the traditional forces would have the upper hand he knew that if the people did not organize life would become more difficult for the majority of haitians who are poor
7681574 i have not heard of any report from any haitian authorities on lovinskys disappearance despite requests from lovinskys family fondasyon trant septanm members of the u s congress and human rights and haiti solidarity activists from around the world
7681575 we also know that the police have repeatedly failed to follow up on leads they have been provided it is hard to escape the conclusion that the haitian government is not reporting on its investigation because it is not conducting one
7681576 calling for the authorities to ensure wilson mesiliens protection in accordance with his wishes
7681577 i cannot explain why lovinsky was left out of the working groups report the un mission in haiti issued a press release about it the abduction was in the news amnesty international and other human rights groups issued action alerts the omission was especially troubling because lovinsky was such a high profile human rights activist and candidate for the senate elections
7681578 there is no doubt we are seeking peace and we are calling for the achievement of our national principles
7681579 there will be no peace without the release of all prisoners
7681580 the last thing i wanted to do was go into old age wishing i had been a musician
7681581 thanks to protective zoning laws plaka had become habitable again and was no longer just for night life
7681582 we thought it would be a wonderful place to bring up our baby son
7681583 im dead against any such move if anything laws should be more stringent in plaka
7681584 for 30 years successive governments from both the left and right have maintained a common front in protecting plaka and now we have a an environment minister who unbelievably appears to be giving in to certain interests
7681585 every day we see laws being flouted because of ineffective policing
7681586 were not against having tavernas or bars in the area we just want to keep the equilibrium that has allowed people and businesses in plaka to coexist otherwise residents will simply leave
7681587 we always said training was essential but they ask for more training for a man selling lettuce in the market because he has to use a machine than estate agents
7681588 companies who had always focused on web based activities without the massive overheads associated with a network of physical branch offices are the ones more likely to weather the storm
7681589 history will show who is selling brazil and who is defending the nation
7681590 way of life and set a catastrophic precedent for indians all over the country
7681591 brazil wants to be a big power but this does not give it the right to steamroll over the rights of the indians
7681592 the development of our country cannot be achieved through the extinction of its indigenous people and by disrespecting their rights the big economic interests see aborigines as an obstacle
7681593 in no way appropriate to either calming or defusing tensions
7681594 if they choose to break off this relationship even the whole of it nothing terrible will happen
7681595 my guess is that this vote is a means to achieve better conditions for international negotiations
7681596 if it does this russia will further isolate itself from the entire world and will force the international community to seek more active ways to restore the territorial integrity of georgia
7681597 the fact that there are nine western warships in the black sea cannot but be a cause for concern
7681598 sesiapa yang mengutamakan akhiratnya allah akan memelihara urusannya dan memurahkan hatinya sehingga dunia dan kemewahannya datang bergolek tanpa dikejar dan sesiapa yang mengutamakan dunianya allah akan memporak perandakan urusannya serta ditampakkan kepapaan di hadapan matanya sedangkan dunia dan kemewahannya tidak akan mendatanginya melainkan sekadar apa yang ditentukan tuhan saja
7681599 we are pushing this material to uk media channels eg a bbc radio programme exposing tensions between aq leadership and supporters and a restricted working group will communicate niche messages through media and non media
7681600 they are not heroes and dont have answers and that they harm you your country and your livelihood
7681601 it is aimed primarily but not exclusively at those working with overseas influencers and opinion formers
7681602 use advisedly avoid suggesting that aq is no longer a threat we are not claiming victory over aq we are stressing their declining support
7681603 on the defensive throughout much of the rest of the world
7681604 feed its new franchises with propaganda to keep the brand alive at all costs
7681605 on how best to tailor such material for media engagements presenting information to ministers or to other stakeholders it is in a separate unclassified format to make it the sort of product that a minister or a press officer could use before an interview or that could be given as a crib sheet for trusted contacts
7681606 why work sucks and how to fix it no schedules no meetings no joke the simple change that can make your job terrific
7681607 i feel like ive let people down i feel bad about all this

7681610 we are after all democrats so it might take a while but make no mistake we are united
7681611 creates far more problems than it will ever solve and it leaves the underlying problem untouched
7681612 i do not believe that a woman young middle aged or old just on a whim says i think ill give up my baby
7681613 no person shall be prosecuted for any crime based solely upon the act of leaving a child in the custody of an employee on duty at a hospital licensed by the state of nebraska
7681614 the law says an adult can abandon the child it doesnt even have to be a parent
7681615 hopefully the system would kick in and parents be notified that their child has been abandoned and the family could be reunited but one of our specific concerns involves the possible deprivation of the parents or one parents rights
7681616 what this society needs to do is consider the causes that might compel a woman to give up what might mean more to her than anything in her life
7681617 we need sex education we need to stop talking this abstinence nonsense based on religion and look at the reality of what these women face
7681618 creates far more problems than it will ever solve and it leaves the underlying problem untouched
7681619 this divorce has been very painful for my wife and me i maintain my complete innocence of any charges and i am confident that all relevant matters will be resolved in my favor in the meantime as this is a an ongoing legal matter it would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this time
7681620 i regret that because of my candidacy this private matter has come into public view i would request that the media respect my familys privacy
7681621 this neighborhood and this city has been my home for more than 50 years the people here know who i am and where i come from this campaign is about jobs education and finding new ways to help our kids make the transition to independent adulthood

7681636 global trading conditions for wine continue to be competitive but the category remains in solid growth mr johnston said
7681637 we have not been immune from industry wide pressures including an economic slow down in key markets and higher grape prices
7681638 foreign exchange movements in the 12 months to 30 june 2008 cut wine earnings by approximately 70 million and wine growth by 14 6 percentage points
7681639 put simply financial returns from wine have not met our expectations
7681640 we are making good progress with our wine review but wont be commenting on our analysis or conclusions until the review is completed
7681641 the impairment charges reflect revised growth expectations and the impact of exchange rate movements on the australian wine business the company said
7681642 the charges include write downs to intangibles inventory agriculture assets and property plant and equipment
7681643 the write down to bulk wine in australia and california adjusts the carrying value of inventory to net realisable value
7681644 continues with a rigorous process reporting directly to the chairman
7681645 the scope of the review is comprehensive and will amongst other things consider the optimal structure and operations of fosters wine business
7681646 fosters continues to expect the review to be completed by the end of 2008
7681647 in light of the wine review fosters will not be providing any specific earnings guidance for fiscal 2009
7681648 but weve got a leader and i think hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances
7681649 hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances and the last thing we want to do is develop a tradition of knifing our leaders
7681650 we are led by a very talented person in brendan nelson who has my full support who i believe is doing a great job and will lead us to the next federal election
7681651 i took him at his word at that and my presumption is that he will indeed be leaving politics
7681652 but he will make his position clear i suspect in the next two or three weeks
7681653 like most australian financial services companies our results for the last financial year were directly and indirectly impacted by external events he said
7681654 however underlying business performance and momentum was maintained and we are well placed to ride out any further deterioration in the market as well as take advantage of any improvement in the industry cycle
7681655 thats still a good performance in a deteriorating economic environment mr mulcahy said
7681656 were very comfortable at the moment with the underlying securities chief financial officer chris skilton said
7681657 its not to say were not watching them very closely though
7681658 certainly the majors have indicated that they would move their rates down he said
7681659 were not a price setter we usually follow so well follow appropriately
7681660 they obviously had a go at iag and they seem to have moved on from than he said
7681661 they recently bought pmi a mortgage insurer so i dont know what their strategy is with regards to acquisitions now
7681662 we wouldnt comment on market rumour but were quite confident that our business is performing strongly
7681663 based on the outlook and continuing good progress on integration the board anticipates the groups ordinary dividend for the full year to june 2009 will be maintained at 107 cents per share suncorp said
7681664 while i understand shareholders will be disappointed by the headline result management responded well to the external challenges we faced our business remains fundamentally sound and the outlook for the current financial year is positive he said in a statement
7681665 merging our banking operations makes sense in the current economic environment and market cycle mr mulcahy said
7681666 this change has been on the radar for some time and the timing is now right
7681667 the promina merger is well advanced and we have the merger team expertise and infrastructure in place to help drive this change
7681668 there was discussion about the fact that the market has become increasingly competitive and that for us to be able to continue to maintain our level of competitiveness in australia we need to work with the government on future transitional assistance programs the spokesman said
7681669 mr mulally reiterated the significant investment that ford has made in australia over the past 82 plus years including recent significant investments such as the development of the all new falcon and the fact that australia is the global engineering lead of the corporations next global light pick up truck he said
7681670 that re emphasised our commitment to australia and that it is an ongoing commitment
7681671 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
7681672 what do you think he meant when he said did that
7681673 those on the left side of the political spectrum believe that high energy prices are a necessary tool to force americans to conserve and adopt a lower standard of living
7681674 this is an ethically challenged immoral public policy position it is the major driver of the current war on the poor and those who preach this type of policy are truly the punishers of the poor
7681675 this isnt cool i probably wont see you again bye

7681688 with our depth of talent and expanse of people i firmly believe india can be a world class sporting power
7681689 i would like to see 500 million skilled technicians and i think this is possible in the next 15 years
7681690 we need to create a capacity for becoming the education laboratory of the world
7681691 india needs to become a source of global innovations by generating new businesses technologies and new business models to create these new models of innovation we need to stress on education by making education affordable to one and all without any lowering of quality the bottom of the pyramid 800 million poor indians can become a major source of innovations if empowered with the tool of education with our people culture and the right mindset we can and need to create a minimum 30 multinational fortune 100 companies
7681692 we need to focus on gold medal winners in the olympics
7681693 its like being at the top of a mountain you keep climbing and then suddenly there is nothing

7681697 i believe in the testimony of the complainant fahmi and that there was an offer made by vijian to the complainant
7681698 corruption is a serious offence its seriousness is further aggravated by the fact that the accused is a lawyer an officer of the court
7681699 he is the sole breadwinner in the family his conviction will have serious repercussions on his livelihood as a lawyer
7681700 i do not agree with the defence counsel that the offence was not premeditated
7681701 from the facts he had made an attempt to find out who was the dpp handling the case and went looking for him his intention was clear from his conduct
7681702 her husband a supervisor is present to post bail she also does not have a passport
7681703 all remaining crew members are safe and are taken care of negotiations are ongoing to secure the safe release of the crew members
7681704 to protect and safeguard the safety of our people onboard we are not able to provide any detailed information at this point of time further updates will be provided as and when necessary
7681705 there are parties still negotiating with those involved in the hijacking but so far no decision has been arrived at our hostages are safe but negotiations are still going on to secure their release
7681706 we cannot afford to have a fortress mentality nor can we afford to have a lackadaisical attitude towards border security it is in this crucial aspect that technology can play a pivotal role making security a less intrusive endeavour
7681707 the right machines and the most relevant technology should be procured
7681708 this win win approach by the department deserves the utmost commendation and emulation by other agencies ukm should take the opportunity in line with kuala lumpurs aspiration to become a regional centre of educational excellence to explore new technologies and disciplines in their research and development capability
7681709 i was told the machine can generate several applications for the purpose of radiobiology medical industry physics research and other usages in applied sciences
7681710 it is hoped the r amp d spin offs from the machine will expand the technology of radiation in the country to support its development as a world class inventor
7681711 it can surpass 13 000 with the latest twist of events
7681712 only the older voters are split in choosing anwar the younger voters are solid
7681713 a lot of them think their rights are eroding under bn
7681714 the training programmes will cover housekeeping and taking care of children senior citizens and babies and also women under confinement
7681715 those who complete the training will be qualified to provide their services in domestic homes old folks homes or kindergartens
7681716 this is not a welfare programme it is a service economy project which is both practical and functional considering that many women are absorbed into the career market and there is a huge demand for home managers
7681717 compared with foreign maids their service charge is reasonable this is because an employer has to pay agent fees medical charges and salary to hire a foreign maid which works out to be as much as a local housekeeper
7681718 under the laws of the country whenever a seat falls vacant a by election is held to fill it thats all
7681719 olympic athletes dream of being part of the olympics every four years
7681720 right after the olympics are over our mindset is already focused on the next four years and what we can do to change how we prepare and try some new things and thats something im looking forward to now
7681721 i still have things that i want to do in the sport ive never competed over here in london and im looking forward to really experiencing more of the city and be able to prepare myself to hopefully swim some fast times
7681722 ive no idea what im really going to do but im looking forward to trying some new events and swimming some events that i havent really had the opportunity to swim since my schedule is always so crowded
7681723 ive never really swum the backstroke or the 100m freestyle at a major international competition so bob bowman my coach is going to throw everything he has ever done coaching me out of the door and try something completely different just to see how it works
7681724 no breaststroke no distance swimming no open water at least those guys will still be my friends
7681725 im excited for the next four years and today sunday is the kick off for the next four years
7681726 i know that its not going to be easy getting there and there are going to be some bumps in the road here and there but everybody has bumps in the road and it really just depends on how you get over those and make sure it doesnt happen again
7681727 i dont think its going to be perfect but its going to be fun over the next few years while i finish off my career
7681728 i told myself i would never compete past the age of 30
7681729 i started swimming when i was seven and i told my coach im not swimming past the age of 30 so dont get any ideas
7681730 when we first started the campaign people said the bn did not stand any chance of a victory
7681731 however after two weeks of effort pleading and praying the support has tilted our way
7681732 all these allegations against him were not raised by us umno but by his former supporters like ezam mohd ezam mohd nor nallakaruppan datuk s nallakaruppan and saiful mohd saiful bukhari azlan
7681733 instead of answering the allegations anwar has only been dodging them playing tai chi and silat lincah chinese and malay martial arts to avoid the issues
7681734 he has been completely sidelined and ignored and mohd hamdan is a very disappointed man indeed
7681735 by right he should also have been given some role as pas is after all part of the pakatan rakyat that is why pas has actually not given its full support to anwar in this by election
7681736 i think the voters have accepted the fact that you can quibble about the details but what they want to know is the sumpah oath itself
7681737 i think the fact that anwar has not responded is playing in the minds of the voters
7681738 do not be intimidated by any tactics used by the opposition they had resorted to rough tactics during the nomination day including assaulting two photographers
7681739 i was shocked that this happened in our country it is totally unacceptable
7681740 well they always say so but after they win they keep quiet
7681741 even if they cant i hope they are able to give their employees time off to cast their votes
7681742 the achievements of our women should be an inspiration to us they have proven themselves in all fields including those where their presence was formerly unheard of
7681743 a harmonious and well structured family is crucial for the development of the young
7681744 this will lead to well balanced individuals with good attributes and attitudes who contribute to the countrys well being
7681745 as a result he will continue his mandate until 2010
7681746 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding
7681747 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish and through trial and error i finally settled on the best type of spit for the task at hand
7681748 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7681749 marcus has written a book hasnt he so good luck with that thats the past
7681750 when these things get thrown at you you actually try that much harder
7681751 he thaksin is even more adamant now because this is his love and he wants to show people he is really committed
7681752 i asked the question as well as everyone else is the club for sale and he is quite adamant this club is not for sale and he is here for the long haul
7681753 i asked why did you buy it he said he bought it because there is a 10 year plan
7681754 he bought some traditional pyjamas with a dragon and phoenix design
7681755 we got the invitation from the organisers just two weeks ago and within that time we had to form a team
7681756 we have no idea about the rules of the game nor the size of the pitch knowing our limitations we have not set any target we will be happy if we can minimise the number of goals scored against us
7681757 naturally we will be opting for a more defensive game
7681758 we are ashamed that the official did such a thing and this is not the first time it has happen
7681759 it has happen many times and we hope that authorities will take stern action against the official who has tarnished the image of the country
7681760 the official had called the lo to the room on the pretext of discussing the schedule but he then spoke to her about sex
7681761 despite the lo trying to leave the room the official continued harassing her
7681762 i have written to maau seeking an explanation this is a serious matter and we are waiting for a reply
7681763 we cannot afford another off colour performance tomorrow today the bowlers have been training hard for the team event and i hope they will bowl to expectations
7681764 i have selected eight new faces from the razak cup including negri sembilans g kavin kartik 16 year old boy who played very well in the tournament
7681765 we have started training and i will continue even during the fasting month to build their fitness which was lacking during the razak cup
7681766 it will be good for the juniors to play in the tough mhl i believe they will pick up some valuable pointers
7681767 kim is now free after coaching china mens team for the beijing olympics and we have approached him to train our players on a consultant basis
7681768 he has yet to reply but we hope he can come and help seniors coach sarjit singh and rajan as a consultant because both the sides have major assignments next year
7681769 i dont think it is me who did anything wrong they should have been investigating adrian
7681770 i was the race leader and he was lapped so he should have given way to me anyway
7681771 there was nothing for him to gain because he would let me go by on the track so it was unnecessary in the pit lane
7681772 i knew nothing about this incident and it is not right so i dont want to be getting involved in it
7681773 on top of the visible presence of policemen at polling centres special action force and commando 69 personnel will be mobilised around the constituency
7681774 my life here is very good although medical insurance is expensive i take care of my health through exercise good diet and an annual physical examination
7681775 it is not a certainty for josiah anymore in fact we mncf have taken this stand based on the progress of our development programmes
7681776 there are riders already contracted under the 2012 olympic programme and there are those in the back up squad
7681777 london is four years from now so even the riders in our junior squad should they be able to step up their game in the time in between now and then will stand a chance
7681778 there are limited places to ride under the national team in important meets like the world cup series and the world championships so our stand is always to pick the best
7681779 were not saying that were closing the door or dropping josiah just yet but from now he not only has to work hard he has to perform and produce results if he wants to remain at the forefront of our plans more so because he is the most senior rider we have
7681780 the defamatory words were repeated in an article written by the journalist edited by wong and published by the star
7681781 bn giving up theres no fight on the ground just up to kl for propaganda war no sign of out of town supporters or canvassers no jam anywhere all gone back
7681782 i hope voters will fulfil their responsibility do not fear your safety as the police have given the assurance that adequate measures have been taken
7681783 arif shah has assured me that he will work hard for the people and help bring development to permatang pauh
7681784 estamos muito perto de um acordo precisamos apenas resolver alguns m nimos detalhes e assinar os pap is para que fique tudo acertado mas acho que isso apenas quest o de tempo
7681785 o local muito bom mas precisamos fazer algumas reformas existem tr s campos em perfeitas condi es de uso mas precisamos ainda fazer toda a infra estrutura essas obras ser o feitas com calma
7681786 foi muito ruim ver todos os garotos ganharem aquela chance e eu machucado mas j estou bem e se o professor quiser j pode me escalar
7681787 ele tem muita qualidade mas sabe que tem muito a crescer uma evolu o natural e temos trabalhado nisso
7681788 muito dif cil mas quem sabe tenho contrato em vigor com o lyon e sou bem tratado na fran a mas jamais podemos dizer nunca a certas coisas um caso a se pensar apesar de ser complicado
7681789 acho que roberto um homem de car ter e de princ pios e que vai fazer bem ao vasco quanto a mim deixa eu acabar de jogar minha bola
7681790 temos de jogar fechadinhos com marca o bem forte e saindo r pido nos contra ataques sabemos que ser uma partida bem complicada pois o atl tico mg n o vem bem no campeonato brasileiro para eles a nica alternativa de t tulo no centen rio do clube pode ser a sul americana
7681791 n o teremos o wellington mas eu e o gil j provamos que podemos formar uma boa dupla foi assim contra o atl tico pr na arena da baixada quando demos muito trabalho aos marcadores s n o inventarmos demais que nos sairemos bem
7681792 the handover was marked with a quirky eight minute cameo of the capital that smacked more of the swinging sixties than of the 21st century cosmopolis that will stage the next games
7681793 if this is a statement of intent from the 2012 organisers that they will not try to match beijing in scale or spectacle but will instead rely on flair and wit it is commendable
7681794 as an emerging superpower china felt it had something to prove london should in keeping with our nations character be a little more understated
7681795 are no doubt nervous wondering how on earth they follow that
7681796 we should aim for something distinctively quirkily british with a lasting legacy and no terrible hangover in the shape of huge debts as well as unused and unloved sports stadia
7681797 the real lesson of beijing though is that there is no hope for london in trying to outdo the chinese on grandeur
7681798 encouragingly the signs yesterday sunday were that this is still not being attempted
7681799 the chinese superpower may have used the games to demonstrate its new might what made them great for the rest of the world however was sport pure and simple
7681800 i have walked the earth since the morning of time ive seen so many little men squandering little lives in petty power struggles that bring meaning to an otherwise futile momentary existences
7681801 if he promises me an end to boredom ill take it
7681802 the sale generates a strong financial return for bluescope steel and reflects the current high world demand for iron ore
7681803 we are pleased with the financial outcome from this transaction
7681804 the waikato north head mine supplies new zealand steels steelmaking operations and is a strategic component of the overall new zealand platform
7681805 i cant reveal details presently but what i can say is that malaysia may adopt foreign athletes at the london games
7681806 its nothing new as over the years we have adopted foreign athletes to don national colours for instance yuan yufang
7681807 we are looking at beefing up our competitiveness in several sports their presence will also help local athletes improve
7681808 its a common trend in modern sports several countries like singapore and bahrain won medals in the beijing games because of their adopted athletes
7681809 i rate this outing as malaysias best ever in an olympics im saying this because not only did the country end its 12 year olympic medal drought through lee chong weis silver but several other athletes recorded significant firsts for the country
7681810 we have also become more competitive in cycling and archery and with the right guidance they could be medal prospects in the london games
7681811 the public should appreciate chong weis effort as its not easy to win an olympic medal im saying this because some overwhelming favourites failed to win a medal in beijing even tennis star roger federer failed to make it count in the singles event
7681812 cheng chu sian and his teammates in archery and several other athletes could have gone further in their events if they were mentally prepared
7681813 mental preparation will be given more importance in the yet to be launched 2012 london games elite programme
7681814 we are giving priority to only sports with medal prospects from now on as for now we have identified these three sports but we will evaluate other sports before making further inclusions
7681815 athletes shortlisted under this programme will be given extensive exposure and guided by good coaches
7681816 if athletes from sports not under the programme do qualify for the next olympics we will evaluate and compare their standard with the worlds best first before deciding on the extent of funding
7681817 we will extend the contracts of those who have met our council expectations
7681818 however we will continue to rely on foreign coaches in sports like diving and gymnastics as theres not many qualified local coaches with the necessary experience
7681819 once there were two brothers one ran away to sea the other was elected vice president and nothing was ever heard from either of them again
7681820 i do not choose to be buried until i am really dead
7681821 it would be foolish not to aspire to even greater heights

7681825 boart longyears 2008 first half results reflect continued strong growth from both our drilling services and products divisions due to ongoing high demand particularly in mineral exploration
7681826 boart longyear has seen little impact on demand despite uncertainties in global financial markets
7681827 we have managed the increasing cost pressures from steel oil and labour effectively
7681828 we expect demand to continue to be strong in the second half and we are well positioned to meet market requirements
7681829 while we see some regional differences in total around the globe we are not seeing any downturn in demand for our products or services in the minerals industry
7681830 primary continues to possess a strong long term outlook based on the opportunities presented by a favourable industry backdrop and the material synergies set to be realised from the integration of the symbion operations
7681831 primary anticipates a strong performance in full year 2009 and is forecasting an ebitda earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation result of approximately 350 million compared to full year 2008 ebitda of approximately 175 million
7681832 managements focus is now on the integration of symbions medical centre pathology and imaging activities
7681833 the combined group is on track to realise an identified 95 105 million of synergies by the end of full year 2010
7681834 maka sesungguhnya dia bohong kalau berteriak teriak ingin membela syariat islam ini adalah ajaran syiah pak ajaran syiah dipake oleh mereka itu gimana mereka itu mengaku salafy bodoh begitu pak kok masih percaya itu orang orang masuk kelompoknya itu pak syiah bahkan syiah sendiri juga dilanggar itu terutama setelah revolusi khumaini karena orang syiah tidak mau berjihad sebelum imam mahdi yang dia maksud turun baru ada jihad tapi karena terpaksa didhalimi khumaini melanggar aturan itu pak jihad duluan belum ada khalifah kelompok ini ngakunya ahlus sunnah ngakunya salafy syiah dari konteks ini pak dari konteks ini syiah dia juga murjiah
7681835 coba kalau sekarang ada umat islam yang justru bersatu dengan thaghut memerangi para mujahid hukumnya apa pak kafiiir jawab penonton kafir halawi menegaskan trnskrptr antum kan ragu kalau ragu aqidahnya juga perlu dicek ha ha ha penonton iya kata waman yakfir bithaghut waman yumimbillah faqadistamsaka bil urwatil wutsqa antum ibadahnya sudah hebat tidak menyekutukan allah tapi ada thaghut nggak dikafirkan tolak aqidah antum itu ayat bicara
7681836 jadi george bush itu ternyata lebih pinter daripada kita yang sudah ngaji tauhid berpuluh puluh tahun
7681837 kalau orang betul betul cinta kepada iman dan ada keimanan tidak mungkin orang itu bisa bergaul dengan orang kafir walaupun hanya simbol
7681838 kalau orang betul betul cinta kepada iman dan ada keimanan tidak mungkin orang itu bisa bergaul dengan orang kafir walaupun hanya simbol apalagi kalau duduk bersahabat dengan mereka bahkan ikut membela misi misi mereka
7681839 jelas pak hukumnya sudah jelas sebetulnya ini sudah jelas dan jaman ini kalau ini tidak usah nunggu nunggu mahkamah kelambanan pak
7681840 jadi jelas pak kita tahu pak kalau kelompok ini di mana sebetulnya mereka itu siapa di belakang mereka
7681841 justru di situlah yahudi kehebatannya memancing atau menyusupkan orang yang sulit untuk dipahami karena apa karena argumentasi yang dipake juga ada dari agama
7681842 ana tanya jadi imam ahmad bin hanbal pak dia adalah salafush shalih ya kan
7681843 akan tetapi mereka tidak akan mampu untuk menulis seperti kitab ini sebab kitab ini dari ciptaan allah bukan dari ciptaan seorang manusia
7681844 sebagaimana ruh termasuk rahasia rahasia yang allah mengkhususkan dirinya dengan rahasia rahasia tersebut begitu pula al quran merupakan ciptaan allah yang seorang makhlukpun tidak akan dapat menyamainya
7681845 telah berkata ibnu uyainah juga muadz dan hajjaj bin muhammad dan yazid bin harun dan hasyim bin al qasim dan ar rabi bin nafi al halabi dan muhammad bin yusuf dan ashim bin ali dan yahya bin yahya serta ahlul ilmi bahwa barang siapa mengatakan al quran makhluk maka orang tersebut telah kafir
7681846 siapa yang tidak mau berbaiat maka silahkan mencari jamaah lain selain ikhwanul muslimin
7681847 seorang tabiin bernama mutharrif bin abdillah bin syikhkhir mengingkari zaid bin shouhan dalam hal tulisan perjanjian yang ia siapkan untuk orang lain
7681848 jangan kalian terburu buru pada anak ini apa yang kamu katakan wahai anak
7681849 bahwa allah telah mengambil janji atas diriku dalam kitab nya maka saya tidak akan mengambil janji lagi selain janji yang allah telah ambil atas diriku
7681850 para ulama besar dan mujahid serta syuhada berdasarkan kesaksian seluruh umat islam di seluruh penjuru bumi
7681851 terang terangan menampakkan kegigihan dan keberaniannya dalam berdakwah menegakkan al haq dan amar maruf nahi munkar dan diklaim oleh penulis
7681852 meskipun yang dikritik adalah imam samudra terpidana mati kasus bom bali 1 tetapi mengatakan seseorang dengan perkataan
7681853 yang anda promosikan tidaklah mampu untuk menutup nutupi setan bisumu terhadap kawan kawan premanmu dan kebuasan dakwah
7681854 aku bersahabat dengan ikhwan al hashafiyah di damanhur dan aku rutin menghadiri hadrah yakni acara berkumpulnya para shufi untuk berdzikir dan bernyanyi di masjid at taubah dalam setiap malamnya
7681855 dan hadir pula as sayyid abdul wahab seorang pemberi ijazah dalam aliran hashafiyah lalu aku mengambil al hashafiyah as syadzaliyah dari beliau dan beliau mengijinkanku dengan wirid wirid serta amalan amalannya
7681856 dan di damanhur semakin kuat hubungannya yaitu hasan al banna dengan ikhwan al hashafiyah serta beliau rutin menghadiri hadroh di masjid at taubah pada setiap malamnya bersama ikhwan hashafiyah dan beliau bersemangat untuk mengambil thariqah ini hingga beliau dapat berpindah dari derajat muhib ke derajat at tabi al mubaya yang diikuti dan diberi baiat
7681857 dan dipertengahan ini tampak bagi kami untuk membentuk di al mahmudiyah sebuah organisasi perbaikan yaitu jumiyah al hashafiyah al khairiyah serta mendirikan kantor sekretariat untuknya dan aku serahkan pengendaliannya sesudah itu kepada organisasi
7681858 adalah hari hari di damanhur dan di madrasah mualimin merupakan hari hari tenggelaman dalam perasaan tasawwuf dan ibadah sehingga itu adalah masa tenggelam dalam ibadah dan tasawwuf
7681859 aku tinggal di damanhur kenyang dengan pemikiran hashafiyah dan damanhur adalah tempat kuburnya as syaikh sayyid hasanain al hashafi yang merupakan syaikh thariqah yang pertama
7681860 dan sesudah shalat isya saudaraku yaitu hasan al banna duduk bersama orang orang yang berdzikir dari kalangan ikhwan al hashafiyah sedang qalbunya telah terang dengan cahaya allah maka akupun duduk disebelahnya berdzikir kepada allah bersama orang orang yang berdzikir masjidpun telah kosong kecuali oleh orang orang yang berdzikir dan penerangan masjidpun telah redup kecuali sumbu dari obor dan malampun telah sunyi kecuali oleh bisikan doa atau oleh kilatan cahaya ruangan dipenuhi dengan cahaya langit diselimuti oleh kemuliaan sang robbani dan tubuh tubuhpun ketakutan dan para arwah linglung serta lenyaplah segala sesuatu dalam wujud dan tersapu lalu mengalunlah suara nyanyian dalam kemanisan dan kegembiraan allah katakanlah dan jika engkau menginginkan puncak kesempurnaan maka segala sesuatunya selain allah jika kamu teliti adalah tiada secara rinci maupun global
7681861 as syaikh hasan al banna dan tonggak pendidikan ruhiyah dalam dirinya dan dalam jamaah besarnya
7681862 pergerakan islam di masa ini berpegang pada kesufian sebagai landasan pemikiran serta landasan budi pekerti dengan bentuk yang global
7681863 dan pada waktu yang bersamaan aku ingin kalau seorang muslim itu mengenali makna hakikat kesufian yang itu merupakan ciri khas dakwah ustadz al banna
7681864 sesungguhnya kaum muslimin memiliki imam dalam aqidah untuk masa yang panjang maka imam mereka dalam masalah aqidah adalah seperti abul hasan al asyari dan abul hasan al maturidi
7681865 berdasar pada kaidah kaidah yang lembut dalam ilmu aqidah maka munculah ilmu mantiq islami sesudah mengalami modernisasi dari mantiq yunani
7681866 sesungguhnya ilmu mantiq dapat menjaga akal dari kesalahan dalam masalah aqidah
7681867 barangsiapa mempelajari agama ini dengan ilmu kalam maka ia telah menjadi zindiq menyembunyikan kekafiran dalam hati dan menampakan keislaman
7681868 hukumanku terhadap ahlul kalam adalah hendaknya mereka dipukul dengan pelepah kurma dan dengan sandal sandal serta diarak keliling kabilah kabilah dan diucapkan
7681869 mereka adalah ahlul bidah mereka berselisih dalam al kitab dan mereka menyelisihi al kitab mereka bersepakat untuk memisahkan diri dari al kitab mereka membicarakan al kalam yang mutasyabih dan mereka menipu kalangan bodoh dari manusia dengan apa yang terperangkap didalamnya
7681870 aku mempelajari tarian inggris di kantor kantor imaduddin dan waktu itu pelajaran satu tarian membayar tiga pond mesir maka aku belajar dansa juga fokester juga charliston dan tango aku juga belajar musik secara rutin
7681871 sesungguhnya dalam kehidupanku ada beberapa yang tidak diridhai oleh kalangan mutasyadid keras dari ikhwan atau dari selain mereka seperti tarian inggris dan musik sedang kehidupan bagi bertolaknya kehidupanku adalah jauh dari belenggu ikatan yang satupun agama dari agama agama ini tidak memerintahkannya khususnya islam kita yang oleh nabi kita disifati dengan yang maknanya
7681872 sesungguhnya saat aku bekerja sebagai pengacara di suatu hari jumat aku mengunjungi beberapa film di bioskop lalu aku merasa sangat gembira dengan adanya kesempatan istirahat kutunaikan shalat dzuhur dan ashar dengan cara jama qashar di salah satu sudut bioskop di mana aku sedang berada di dalamnya
7681873 jika kalian bertanya kepadaku tentang hawa nafsu maka akulah hawa nafsu akulah anak hawa nafsu dan akulah bapak hawa nafsu serta saudara hawa nafsu
7681874 apakah mereka pernah membaca pengakuan kami di sebuah media bahwa kami orang im atau kelompok im atau beraliran im
7681875 terbitan robbani press jakarta 2001 mengajarkan kejelekan dan kehinaan dakwah hizbiyyahnya
7681876 bahkan dakwah ikhwan meninggalkan keberadaan dalam barisannya siapapun yang lari dari belenggu aturan aturan mereka walaupun orang tersebut adalah dai yang terwara dalam pemahaman terhadap islam dan aqidah islam juga walaupun ia adalah orang yang paling banyak membaca kitab kitab dan orang yang paling gigih pembelaannya terhadap umat islam dan terkhusyu dalam sholat
7681877 dan kami meyakini bahwa pendapat salaf dalam masalah mendiamkan dan menyerahkan sepenuhnya ilmu tentang makna makna ini semua kepada allah tabaraka wa taala adalah lebih selamat dan utama untuk diikuti
7681878 ikhwanul muslimin tidak menginginkan dalam masalah aqidah dan penjelasannya hanya sekedar kalimat kalimat yang dihafal dan diulang ulang ikhwan juga tidak menghendaki masalah ini dijadikan ajang perdebatan dengan orang lain tanpa ada pengaruh apapun di dalam kehidupan orang bersangkutan lihatlah betapa sejak awal didirikannya dan mulai dari pendirinya sendiri ikhwanul muslimin telah nyata bermanhaj salaf hanya saja yang membedakan adalah bahwa ikhwanul muslimin menerima perbedaan pendapat yang terjadi antara salaf dengan khalaf
7681879 istiwa itu sudah diketahui sedang caranya tidak diketahui mengimaninya adalah wajib dan menanyakan bagaimana nya adalah bidah adapun kamu adalah seorang yang buruk keluarkan dia
7681880 kalau sudah tetap hal ini maka sesungguhnya salaf dan khalaf telah bersepakat atas asas tawil makna kontekstual sehingga menjadi minimlah perselisihan antara keduanya bahwa khalaf menambahkan pembatasan makna yang diinginkan tatkala ada keterpaksaan yang mendesak mereka untuk melakukannya demi menjaga akidah awam dari kesamaran menyamakan allah subhanahu wa taala dengan makhluk ini adalah sebuah perselisihan yang tidak pantas menimbulkan polemik dan permusuhan
7681881 yakni tangan yang layak dengan kemuliaan nya suci dari penyerupaan dan kesamaan
7681882 dan bertawakkallah kepada allah yang hidup kekal yang tidak mati dan bertasbihlah dengan memuji nya
7681883 kami dan seluruh ulama kita dari penduduk hijaz tihamah yaman iraq syam dan mesir menyatakan mazhab kami adalah kami menetapkan apa yang telah ditetapkan oleh allah subhanahu wa taala untuk diri nya kami mengikrarkannya dengan lisan kami dan membenarkannya dengan hati kami tanpa menyerupakan wajah khaliq kami dengan wajah seorang makhluk maha perkasa rabb kami dari penyerupaan dengan para makhluk nya maha mulia rabb kami dari ucapan para ahli tathil serta maha perkasa eksistensi nya dari apa yang dikatakan oleh orang orang yang menolak nama nama dan sifat allah subhanahu wa taala tersebut sama sekali
7681884 semua sifat ini ditetapkan melalui nash dan telah diriwayatkan hadits hadits dari tersebut kabar sang jujur rasulullah
7681885 di atas jalan ini salaf dan khalaf rahimahumullah semuanya sepakat mengikrarkan penetapannya membiarkan sebagaimana adanya dan menetapkan sifat yang disebutkan oleh nash nash kitabullah dan sunnah rasulullah
7681886 kita menetapkan rabb kita subhanahu wa taala ada di atas ketinggian dan istiwa nya di atas arsy nya sebagaimana yang layak bagi kemuliaan dan keagungan nya
7681887 jadi tidak ada perlunya mengingkari dengan keras orang orang yang meyakini karomah para wali dan berlindung kepada kubur kubur suci mereka dan berdoa di depannya ketika tertimpa berbagai musibah karomah para wali itu merupakan bagian dari dalil adanya mujizat para nabi
7681888 oleh karena itu nampaknya saya cenderung memilih pendapat pihak yang menyatakan bahwa rasulullah
7681889 jika demikian maka tidak ada alasan untuk bersikap keras mengingkari orang orang yang meyakini keramat para wali mendatangi mereka di kuburnya yang suci dan berdoa di sana ketika susah dan keramat para wali termasuk bukti mujizat para nabi
7681890 kita tidak ambil pusing dengan orang orang yang menjunjung para wali allah subhanahu wa taala peziarahnya dan orang orang yang berdoa di kuburan mereka
7681891 tidak tertinggal satupun kesyirikan kubur melainkan telah dihalalkan oleh penasehat umum ikhwanul muslimin dengan kata katanya ini
7681892 tentunya at tilmisani mengetahui bahwa pada kuburan kuburan yang ada di mesir sebuah negara dimana buku syahidul mihrab umar bin al khaththab terbit dari sana serta umar at tilmisani sebagai mursyid umum di sana telah dilakukan syirik terbesar yang pernah dikenal oleh bumi kuburan dithawafi oleh orang orang dan dimohon darinya semua yang dimohon kepada allah subhanahu wa taala dengan sebab para penghuninya dianggap sebagai wali
7681893 itukah wali wali mereka itulah kubur yang diseru oleh mursyid umum
7681894 kalau demikian keinginan cinta dan ketergantunganku kepada para wali allah kalau demikianlah perasaanku yang melimpah ruah dengan ketenangan dan keelokan sewaktu berziarah dan berada di sisi mereka sesungguhnya ia tidak mencacatkan akidah tauhid sesungguhnya saya tidak mengajak untuk menghadap kepada dzatnya dan seluruh urusan ini dari awal hingga akhirnya adalah urusan menikmati lalu saya katakan kepada orang orang yang keras mengingkari pelan pelan tidak ada kesyirikan dalam perkara ini keberhalaan dan pengingkaran terhadap ilah
7681895 saya katakan kalau keadaan para penasehat dan cendekiawan manhaj al ikhwan ini demikian maka coba anda bayangkan bagaimana dengan pengikutnya jika seperti ini yang sempat tertulis maka bagaimana dengan yang belum tertuliskan apakah masuk akal seorang menyangka dirinya berakidah tauhid sementara dia memberikan loyalitasnya kepada siapa yang menghalalkan syirik akbar syirik besar dan sebaliknya marah serta memperingatkan orang orang agar menjauhi para pembela akidah tauhid
7681896 islam harus berkuasa memerintah karena hanya dialah satu satunya aqidah yang positif dan adaptif yang memadukan antara ajaran kristen dan komunisme perpaduan yang sempurna yang mencakup tujuan keduanya saling menambah saling melengkapi dan seimbang
7681897 justru kami merasa heran dengan para penghujat yang menganggap sayyid berbau khawarij atau tukang mengkafirkan orang padahal mereka sendiri telah berlaku demikian terhadap sayyid quthb
7681898 solusi lantas menurut anda apa vonis yang tepat bagi orang yang mengatakan bahwa islam adalah hasil perpaduan yang sempurna antara ajaran kristen dengan komunisme
7681899 yang luar biasa terhadap nabiyullah musa alaihis salam di buku yang ditulisnya sendiri
7681900 1 kita ambil musa dia adalah contoh seorang pemimpin yang temperamental fanatik kesukuan dan tidak bertabiat stabil
7681901 seorang pemimpin yang temperamental fanatik kesukuan dan tidak bertabiat stabil
7681902 dien di kedalaman jiwa dan penegasan indera sedangkan tercapainya keindahan seni menjadi rambu adanya kesiapan untuk menerima pengaruh keagamaan 20 ketika seni naik ke tingkat setinggi ini dan ketika jiwa menjadi jernih untuk menerima misi keindahan itu
7681903 saya dengan terang terangan mengatakan hakekat yang terakhir ini juga menyatakan dengan terang terangan bersamanya bahwa saya tidak tunduk dalam hal ini kepada aqidah religius yang membelenggu pikiranku dari pemahaman
7681904 saya dalam titik ini bukanlah pria agamis yang diikat oleh aqidah murni sehingga tidak dapat melakukan pembahasan bebas bahkan saya adalah pria pemikir yang menghormati akalnya dari sifat kufur nimat dan cerita berhiaskan kebohongan
7681905 terang terangan menampakkan kegigihan dan keberaniannya dalam berdakwah menegakkan al haq dan amar maruf nahi munkar
7681906 sesungguhnya mengolok olok allah ayat ayatnya dan rasulnya merupakan kekafiran yang mengeluarkan seseorang dari agama karena prinsip agama terbangun di atas dasar mengagungkan allah agama nya dan rasul nya sedangkan mengolok olok sesuatu diantaranya adalah bertentangan dengan prinsip ini dan membatalkannya dengan sekeras kerasnya
7681907 mencela allah dan rasul nya serta agama merupakan kafir akbar dan kemurtadan dari islam maka dia harus dimintai taubat jika dia taubat maka dibebaskan jikalau tidak maka wajib atas pemerintah untuk membunuhnya karena berdasarkan sabda nabi
7681908 upaya dia hasan al banna peny dan seluruh pengikutnya untuk mendekatkan antara virus yang dapat membuat kafir atau fasik seseorang muslim dengan ahlussunnah dengan asumsi bahwa syiah dan sunni seluruhnya adalah muslim
7681909 sebelum kita meninggalkan al azhar maka kita akan mendengarkan fatwa yang dikeluarkannya khususnya tentang mazhab syiah
7681910 sesungguhnya mazhab yang dikenal sebagai mazhab syiah dua belas adalah sebuah mazhab yang secara syari boleh beribadah dengannya sebagaimana seluruh mazhab ahlussunnah
7681911 seseorang dari kalangan awam datang kepadaku dalam keadaan emosi mempertanyakan bagaimana bisa syaikh al azhar mengeluarkan fatwanya bahwa syiah adalah sebuah mazhab islam sebagaimana mazhab mazhab yang sudah dikenal lainnya
7681912 akan tetapi saya melihat mereka itu melakukan shalat dan puasa sebagaimana kita shalat dan puasa
7681913 lebih mengherankan lagi mereka itu membaca al quran mengagungkan rasulullah dan berhaji ke baitul haram
7681914 sampai kabar kepadaku bahwa mereka mempunyai al quran yang lain dan datang ke kabah untuk menghinakannya
7681915 kamu mendapat udzur sesungguhnya ada sebagian orang dari kita yang menyebarkan keadaan orang lain untuk menghancurkan dan melukai kehormatannya
7681916 al ghazzali menegaskan dalam thaliah islamiyyah edisi 26 maret nomor 85 memberi jawaban terhadap pertanyaan yang diajukan kepadanya seputar peranannya dalam kelompok rekonsiliasi ia katakan
7681917 semoga allah berbuat baik kepada anda hadits nabi shalallahu alaihi wassalam tentang berpecahnya umat umat yakni sabda beliau
7681918 dia masuk dalam 72 dolongan ini golongan sesat red barangsiapa yang menyelisihi akidah ahli sunnah maka ia telah masuk kepada 72 golongan maksud dari sabda beliau umatku adalah umat ijabah artinya mereka yang menerima dan menampakkan keikutan mereka kepada beliau tujuh puluh tiga golongan yang lolos dan selamat adalah yang mengikuti beliau dan konsekwan dalam agamanya dan tujuh puluh dua golongan di antara mereka ada bermacam macam ada yang kafir ada yang bermaksiat dan ada yang berbuat bidah
7681919 maksudnya kedua golongan ini jamaah tabligh dan ikhwan termasuk dari tujuh puluh dua
7681920 hai orang orang yang beriman janganlah kamu menjadi seperti orang orang yang menyakiti musa maka allah membersihkannya dari tuduhan tuduhan yang mereka katakan dan adalah dia seorang yang mempunyai kedudukan terhormat di sisi allah
7681921 dan aku telah memilih kamu maka dengarkanlah apa yang akan diwahyukan kepadamu
7681922 semoga allah taala merahmati musa alaihis salam sesungguhnya dia telah disakiti lebih dari ini maka dia bersabar
7681923 dan di antara hiburan yang menenangkan jiwa menyenangkan hati dan dinikmati oleh telinga adalah nyanyian islam telah membolehkannya selama tidak mengandung unsur unsur fahisy keji kata kata kotor atau mendorong perbuatan dosa dan tidak apa apa pula jika diiringi musik yang tidak terlalu keras dan mustahab diadakan dalam acara acara ceria untuk menunjukkan suka cita dan ketenangan jiwa seperti hari raya pengantin menyambut kedatangan saat pesta nikah akikah dan kelahiran anak
7681924 sesungguhnya nyanyian tersebut pada dasarnya tidaklah haram baik memakai alat musik ataupun tidak memakai alat musik sayyidati 678
7681925 batasan ini hanyalah teori yang tidak mungkin dipraktekkan karena yang membangkitkan perasaan adalah relatif berbeda seiring dengan perbedaan watak dan karakter seseorang laki laki dan perempuan tua dan muda panas dan dingin dan sebagainya ini tidak tersamar lagi bagi orang yang pandai sungguh demi allah aku sangatlah heran dengan ulama al azhar yang selalu mendakwahkan batasan teoritis ini di samping menyelisihi hadits hadits yang shahih madzhab imam yang empat perkataan para ulama salaf mereka juga menciptakan alasan alasan dari diri mereka sendiri yang belum pernah diucapkan oleh seorang pun dari imam yang diikuti maka dampak akhirnya adalah membolehkan apa yang diharamkan seperti musik dan lagu ini menurut mereka juga
7681926 micah was a little bit groggy obviously but the paramedics did their job there are always concerns when you see incidents like this they stabilised him and got him off the pitch
7681927 they did all the correct things and by all accounts he was lucid in the tunnel
7681928 i do not think there is any concern regarding a neck injury it is more he has a bang on his head
7681929 he will be observed for the next couple of hours and he may be allowed to go home providing he has some support there
7681930 it is always nice to play well in front of the owner of the club it does help
7681931 i spoke to him earlier in the week and i was really excited by what he had to say i am sure he enjoyed the game today sunday
7681932 our country should play p ramlee films every day his films can teach us how we can live together happily and harmoniously like in the good old days
7681933 i knew firsthand what it was like then when malaysia was in shambles
7681934 we should appreciate the differences in our races and religions i like to see this happen as it is important
7681935 the electoral roll has gone through the process of cleansing and we have taken out the names of those who were confirmed dead or wanted to change their addresses to other constituencies
7681936 the names were transferred based on requests by voters themselves or the dead persons next of kin
7681937 this allegation is something that we are very familiar with whenever there is an election there will be someone pointing fingers at us trying to create doubts on the authenticity of the electoral roll i do not know the figures they are talking about but bring us the proof if there is any
7681938 i want to stress here that the roll has been processed according to the law by making the allegation to the media i think this is not fair to the ec
7681939 we have been working hard to process the electoral roll everybody should trust us and our independence as an election commission and please dont question the authenticity of the roll
7681940 the roll had been put up for display for public objections before it was verified it is a clean roll consisting of the names of all registered voters in the parliamentary constituency
7681941 god must love poor people he made so many of them
7681942 rather than the traditional mode of government by and for the few
7681943 one of my objectives from day one was to reduce the role of the mayor
7681944 the united states is destined to plague the americas with misery in the name of liberty
7681945 could it be that some children are born with the genetic stuff to go on to actually become elite athletes

7681947 you dont want them to zigzag you want the one thats going to get to the egg and fertilize it first
7681948 i got to be adventurous in other ways not just adventurous on the playing fields
7681949 as a parent i just dont think thats something i would even think about
7681950 growing up with my dad not being around much it was odd people who remembered him were always like man there are so many things you do that are just like your dad your mannerisms the way you talk the way you hold your hands and i wondered is that innate is that something that is just in me

7681953 if you go easy on your back to school shopping and get good grades this year how about this well get you that tv youve wanted for your room
7681954 weve scored three offensive touchdowns in 10 quarters and we need to move to a situation where we have a more mobile quarterback
7681955 there are more than 20 manhole covers between the second ring road and the fourth ring road
7681956 we lost 49 0 to the wallabies a few years ago and imagine if we had sacked jake white then
7681957 we have learned that it is not necessarily the best approach to take
7681958 the reaction from the crowd at durban was new to me we are unwavering in our backing for peter but the public here know their rugby very very well probably better than any other nation on earth and we will listen to all our stakeholders including supporters
7681959 im very happy doing what i am doing and i certainly enjoyed working with south africa last year id always be willing to give them a hand but for the next three years i have decided my future is here at saracens after that i will have a look around
7681960 be good for the dressing room and the team effort
7681961 we arent just going to concentrate our means on four or five sports to bring home the medals like the british have done
7681962 80 of the french medallists will still be up for selection in 2012
7681963 in london there will be european chauvinism judge corruption buying of brawn and brains and a strong dose of racism
7681964 its easy when things are going well everyone close to you says you are no1 and then suddenly when you have a difficult situation they say ha ha this is already a boiled driver thats not the case he is the world champion we are a team and of course we will support everyone of the team and above all of course kimi because we trust him 100 it is in the difficult moments that the team has to stay together we dont have any doubt at all about kimis performance and im pretty sure he will come back from here up to the end of the season in brazil
7681965 so what is it about the 20m match that made you reassess steve
7681966 this is embarrassing i cant believe this is the first foreigners will see of londons olympics
7681967 i obviously knew that i was going on the saturday night and when he came off the field at headingley and said i am off i thought oh bloody hell there are two captains going it doesnt look too good it was pure coincidence we communicate all the time i knew that he was struggling but i never had an inkling that he was going to give it up
7681968 i just wanted to go back into the ranks and enjoy my cricket because it was getting to the point where i was going on to the cricket field and not enjoying it
7681969 ive never been that kind of character to dislike the game it was starting to really get to me i cant wait to stand at backward point not think about where the fielders go whether to bring a man in who is coming on to bowl its going to be nice
7681970 decisions like that can haunt you afterwards and they added to my lack of mental energy
7681971 i have grown up wanting to play test cricket for england and that was about to be taken away from us
7681972 i have always been good at getting away from the game in between series getting time off and i just felt that the captaincy never really allows you to switch off and recharge the batteries when you come close to losing your test spot it hits you hard
7681973 i generally have to put a lot of hard work and effort into the game on its own to stay at the top level everybody keeps saying that i havent got the most ability in the world and it might be true i have to put a lot of mental energy into it
7681974 the funny thing is were always asked to be 100 all of the time and whether it is subconscious or not weve got a big ashes series coming up maybe subconsciously you try and peak at the right time
7681975 obviously andys got the talent that the rest of us havent but its all relative to where we are at
7681976 not everything is just about the men there are girls working hard doing the same thing we are all busting our backsides we are all trying hard and we are all trying to achieve the same things
7681977 im like infatuated with the guy now we were in stamford and i had no idea who michael phelps was the whole olympic swimming team was in the same hotel as us before i even realised he was michael phelps i was like yeah he is hes really cute and i was having breakfast next to him on the next table but i just couldnt bring myself to say anything to him i was just in awe of him
7681978 i think each time i play a grand slam i always think that oh this could be my last time playing here
7681979 ive obviously learned that i have no idea what the future kind of holds and what will happen and i dont make decisions for the future any more from this day that im living in but sure im here i mean im so excited to be back here
7681980 i didnt think i would be back playing you never know how many more chances youll get to be playing here
7681981 its out of our hands now but weve given ourselves an opportunity
7681982 were delighted weve made the six because its been a long tough year with a lot of challenges to overcome
7681983 we were dreadful for large parts of the game but the way we responded showed that we have a lot of ability and resolve
7681984 even when we were leading i thought we were in harlem globetrotter mode and we didnt get as excited without the ball as we did with it bradford were very composed
7681985 if youre looking for the safe choice then you shouldnt be supporting a 46 year old black guy
7681986 the district has sought to place the proverbial cart before the horse
7681987 the electrical system in the pool is old enough that the preliminary report said the electrical system might not be adequate to take care of an electrical surge like from a lightning strike
7681988 there are ways to test for it but we couldnt do it right away
7681989 we felt it was prudent for the safety of our patrons not to open today or tomorrow
7681990 hiv and aids multiple sclerosis breast cancer and lou gehrigs disease
7681991 the way theyre talking it could be quite a mess over there for people that are driving and walking and delivering meals obviously
7681992 they come for their hour and they pick and they deliver so we want to make sure they are able to do that in that hours time
7681993 nice car but itd be really nice with a gm ls7
7681994 a minivan will make me look well like a minivan driving loser

7681996 do i contradict myself very well then i contradict myself i am large i contain multitudes
7681997 ian math shmath its a rant and as such can contain shameless hyperbole
7681998 little gti youre so much fun i love to drive you
7681999 well weve established that the vanagon isnt exactly a race car
7682000 ruby dont drive your air cooled vanagon westfalia to town
7682001 id investigate whether a porsche or subaru boxer engine might fit
7682002 i mean how cool is it when your everyday transportation can double as an apartment
7682003 if you was wack in the analog world you will be wack in digital world
7682004 he has not given us even one shilling but we still have hope
7682005 it is to wage war by sea land and air with all our might and with all the strength that god can give us to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark lamentable catalogue of human crime that is our policy
7682006 writing is an untangling of the mind knot and once it is untangled a gesture the ribbon is allowed to float away and twist and turn in the wind
7682007 where would i want to play wherever they ask me
7682008 it doesnt matter to me i enjoy doing everything and i think that they see that too
7682009 i love playing football and anytime i get a chance to get out and make any kind of play on either side of the ball its fun i love what i do
7682010 i guess im just trying to literally learn every day and hopefully make some plays whenever i get a chance
7682011 we used ray last year on the practice squad to run routes for the defense as an offensive receiver and he really did a good job
7682012 i think he can play both receiver and defensive back at a competent level
7682013 he is a tough kid he runs hard he catches the ball well and he showed up in the kicking game his versatility is his number one strength at this point but when he does play he has been productive in defense special teams and offense he is a unique guy
7682014 i dont think you can worry about all the stuff you cant control
7682015 bryan has been around a number of years now and he has been a good defenseman for quite some time
7682016 im excited about bryans willingness to come here on a tryout it will certainly pick up the competition level of what is going to take place in training camp
7682017 it was pretty clear cut for me that frankie is the guy
7682018 i believe i can be a closer ive got the stuff im glad i got the opportunity now now its my time to show that i can be the man
7682019 he went out there with whatever he had that day and make the hitter look like nothing im going to miss him he was the guy who didnt have that great of stuff but he taught me even if you dont have the greatest stuff you can still pitch
7682020 we reviewed all the medical records and spoke with the victims physician and the evidence showed that the loss of the fetus was not related to or a result of the crash caused by the defendant
7682021 im already training so my next opponent better watch out
7682022 but that was the worst mistake i ever made i got dana over my back all the time did you eat did you sleep drink your water its like im two years old but its all good
7682023 hey i just want to say a massive thank you to every single person who came to any of the shows i played bought any of our cds and came up and talked to me after i had an unbelievable time in steer clear and got to do things which i never thought i could do as well as meet so many different people i count myself very lucky because not a lot of people get to start bands with their best friends and have hundreds of people turn up to shows making posters with your name on them and i just want to say a thank you to every person who loves this band as much as i do the decision to leave the band for me was one of the hardest decisions i will ever make but i feel at this stage if i stayed in the band any longer i would only hold it back everyone in the band has their own different priorites and with that i feel that it is best for everyone that we part now i absolutely love this band and that includes each and every member and i will certainly be at every future show i can be we are all very much still friends and will keep it that way that said i want to wish steer clear the best of luck for the future and i hope that with a new member they can finish what we started thanks again vinny
7682024 that created the muslim terrorists who are now waging jihad on the industrialized world
7682025 its strange to acknowledge that calling someone a muslim is a smear
7682026 speak out forcefully against the anti muslim bigotry at the core of this smear
7682027 raised the issue of islamophobia and allows it to be acknowledged and openly discussed

7682152 to be competitive michigan needs the best educated workforce in the nation and the fact that one in every four high school students is failing to graduate on time is totally unacceptable

7682165 the bottom line from my perspective is the surgery went well
7682166 right now its a rough day for him but everything went well
7682167 he was fixing to be a big part of this team and to go out there on that field and see this kid laying there after what he went through was tough
7682168 we were talking about it this morning you can be out there in one play and it can be over for you just like that
7682169 i talked to cedric the other day and he told me how well hes doing

7682172 when her fellow traffic agents came back from a stressful day on the job they could always count on donnette to lighten their mood with a joke or a funny comment

7682182 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
7682183 i dont feel like they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
7682184 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
7682185 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
7682186 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it
7682187 i can lead them from a fire tornado and toxic spill we have plans in place for that i cannot lead them from an active shooter
7682188 there are people who are going to think this is extreme but its easy to defend
7682189 its unfair of us to ask teachers to take on the additional job of being police officers
7682190 theres a lot of incidents where that would have saved a number of lives

7682207 yes it hurts like fuck but you would be surprised how freeing it is to get punched in the face
7682208 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7682209 we believe prosocial behaviour is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices they seem to care for the welfare of those they know
7682210 the system failed to do the job of educating them
7682211 instead just passing them on to high school and letting someone else worry about them
7682212 we pushed them through they moved forward and they got further behind

7682220 the sloan is probably the most important survey in astronomy that has been done
7682221 it has impacted on everything from our understanding of asteroids to the fundamental forces in nature
7682222 what we have achieved is far more spectacular than i could have hoped
7682223 when we started astronomers relied on old photographic film plates and had to spend hours poring over them to make discoveries our images have meant this work can be done on a computer and the detail we have revealed makes all the headaches along the way worthwhile
7682224 when we began taking images we found that objects in the asteroid belt of our own solar system were moving enough that we could detect them
7682225 it was confusing our software so we made it automatically detect them so the computer could get rid of them as a result we have found over half a million new asteroids out there
7682226 its basically a comet but it never gets close enough to the sun to develop a long bright tail of evaporated gas and dust
7682227 i know this is a huge change for titchwell and for the very many people who share our deep love for the reserve but the need to go ahead with this scheme was clear

7682285 its thrown them off balance and well continue to maintain the momentum to keep them off balance in that specific area
7682286 i personally believe weve taken out some of the key leaders that have conducted some of these ied operations that have affected local nationals afghan security forces as well as isaf soldiers and canadians
7682287 it struck the front right side of the vehicle flipped us over and fortunately all of us made it out alive
7682288 ive talked to many soldiers whove cheated death countless times between ieds and firefights with insurgents and they keep going back out there and doing their job
7682289 i think thats what me and my fellow reporter are going to keep doing while were here
7682290 that is a decision the club has to make that is a very interesting question you should ask the club he didnt play because he wasnt in the right condition this is what he told me before the game when i spoke to him so he did not play well have to wait and see tomorrow well speak to the player and then well make a decision its a situation that is very personal there are players able to play under these circumstances and others whose head is not right berbatov is in the latter category well have a meeting with the player and clarify a few points and see if there is a decision to be made well meet primarily to know if he is in any state to play in the next match or we have to find another solution he hasnt got any power if he is no condition to play the game he in not going to play that is the same as any other player
7682291 we wont be dancing in the streets in sunderland for beating tottenham away from home well have a cup of tea and sandwich as normal we fancy our chances and were happy with the progress were making players showed the other side to them the character of the players is there for everyone to see we have that and you can criticise in other areas but not character when youve won the game you say berbatovs a talented boy but darren bent is also a good player
7682292 someone told me he scored on his debut for liverpool but i couldnt care less what he did in the past its a good start djibril only trained with us yesterday and he was always going to be on the bench he gives us good options if things arent going our way
7682293 this is an educational biography since the man is a good role model through his contribution to eradicate poverty from ethiopia i have spent over 300 000 birr and twenty months of work for the realization of the book
7682294 europe must get china right as a threat an opportunity and prospective partner
7682295 we must examine our political and economic ties with china
7682296 the biggest single challenge of globalization in the trade field
7682297 in the past we were running to catch up with the higher productivity of the united states now we need to run with one eye on those out in front and the other watching new countries china india brazil coming up behind
7682298 i will be using the second half of this year to define a new forward looking agenda that helps to boost our competitive performance at home and abroad an agenda that focuses on hard economic priorities and adapts our thinking to the realities and challenges of globalization
7682299 and now trades as much as the eu did in 1994
7682300 show leadership to push for change even if it is painful
7682301 those people are laughing they must be talking about me
7682302 the boss wants to see me it must be bad
7682303 hopefully by going digital with our music we can do our part to save a few trees in the process
7682304 china and india are the two important markets to drive up the e7 economies
7682305 china needs to diversify its capital markets besides focusing on the banking sector
7682306 it was kind of pathetic to tell you the truth
7682307 we consider this decision another step in russias fight against georgian sovereignty
7682308 it is and will be if accepted by the russian president a continuation of russian aggression against georgia and a serious violation of international law
7682309 not on the basis of rather vague concerns about security
7682310 if youre a foreign intelligence service and you know that a us federal agency is buying 15 000 computers from your company wouldnt you look into the possibility that you could do something about that
7682311 i turned on the tap to clean some knives and forks and beer came out
7682312 ill still focus on music this is what im best at
7682313 his performance has surpassed the atmosphere created by the original script
7682314 what impressed me most is that he acts and approaches the role with his heart the only in which an actor can strike a chord with the audience
7682315 what i can do is to learn my lines carefully
7682316 with a latent capacity chou is expected to stay with zhang for about 20 days and to compose and sing the song played at the end of the film
7682317 la existencia objetiva de una estructura para cometer cr menes
7682318 he is the fourth out of five actors who have been hired to play the part originated by edward furlong in 1991s
7682319 it was terrifying for all of us and i didnt know if the show was going to be good
7682320 when i first heard they were making it i thought i love terminator and i thought it was going to suck then i read the script and talked to executive producer josh friedman about all the avenues and the idea of doing a robot show that has musings about religion and art and love and all that kind of stuff and it is very cool i felt confident with the show
7682321 in the first season we were really paying attention to every little thing and trying to be true to the movies
7682322 now i feel like weve established ourselves of course we are still part of the movies but more of our own thing and thats making the show better because we are being able to go off and do all kinds of stuff
7682323 i knew it would frustrate some people in the first season with the performance i did
7682324 because i wanted him to be kind of weak and hide behind his hair and sit behind the computer and people to go this isnt the savior of the world wheres he so that then we could watch him shift i felt that doing what he does just wouldnt happen i think there has to be things that occur that just build up till the end of this thing and thats what happens so this is so great i just get to play rage and bitterness and power that i didnt get to do at all last year by my own choice
7682325 whats cool is i am fucking kicking ass this season for a change
7682326 i am actually getting to fight people and shoot guns not that that is all i care about if i had to that all the time it would be boring but its nice to do when its for a reason so this season ive gotten to do a lot of stuff ive gone to a firing range im actually using guns and i get into a big fight theres so much action in the first episode a lot of it in the next couple episodes is with cameron but in the first episode im in a car that flips were upside down and i get a windshield smashed in my face that was an intense episode right out of the gate after five months of eating bon bons and watching tv first day at work and theres glass flying everywhere
7682327 its a tricky relationship because john on the one hand doesnt want to feel anymore
7682328 i think thats the biggest difference in the first season he was really very emotional and was holding on to his feelings and now he doesnt want feelings because they get in the way yet on the other hand he really likes this girl he cant help it its kind of his one way to a normal something in his life but shes the pushy one at first he is like i dont i cant just leave me alone but she breaks through so i wouldnt necessarily say hes smooth
7682329 i did not know that until half an hour before the panel
7682330 i just got a house and im very scared because friedman could kill me but then that means the rest of the world is fucked
7682331 dick was escorted back to the holding area at one point i noticed dick sat up from the floor and his pants were soaked from the waist area to the ankles dick has just urinated on himself
7682332 i asked dick why he didnt tell me he had to use the restroom again dick stated that he did not want to knock on the window like a caged animal
7682333 when i was trying to change my boyfriends wardrobe after a year of being together i was running all over the place sure i couldve gone online to pick up everything but you need to touch and feel the fabrics so here we are with a store full of gyllenhaal approved threads and facial hair growth kits
7682334 my jakey has a bit of an indie rock vibe to him you know he could be in vampire weekend or a cooler band i also picked up a shirt for myself
7682335 according to the center for responsive politics which follows political money joe biden throughout his u s senate career has raised only 390 298 from the tv movies music sector including a mere 187 600 from entertainment industry donors in 2008 while he was running for president
7682336 carlos diaz is reporting all week from denvers democratic national convention and is available for live shots
7682337 he has been incredible in his ability to link up and get to the right spots when we need someone to run into space
7682338 you need to be an extremely talented endurance athlete to keep getting into spots that other people cant get to because they are too tired
7682339 when you watch him play a game he runs really hard
7682340 hes doing a little bit of what shaun hart and nigel lappin used to do
7682341 la excelente acogida del llamado a sumarse al padr n

7682344 recursos del estado como el programa al presidente para promover candidaturas de su partido socialista unido de venezuela psuv eso est prohibido por la ley
7682345 i think its what people expected its going to be a tight race
7682346 her people have to be deeply worried by these returns
7682347 we said all along that we had a lot of work to do and that we werent taking anything for granted
7682348 were still viewing it like that we havent changed our game plan
7682349 the obama wave is also there and were confident that that will have an impact in this state
7682350 for months democrats have tried to say this race wont be close
7682351 the polls have been saying otherwise the primary results just confirmed that its dead even again
7682352 youre going to have a ton of young voters who will come out and vote for obama and no one else on the ticket
7682353 even though nationally it looks like this going to be a very strong democratic year both rossi and mccain seem like theyd be able to overtake those national odds for whatever reason
7682354 that doesnt mean theyll win but both of them are quite competitive in a year when their party has a lot of disadvantages
7682355 what we learned in 2004 is that every vote really does matter
7682356 were a couple of days away from our first game against charleston southern the team is excited we had a great practice last night and we have one tonight were looking forward to our first game in dolphin stadium
7682357 charleston southern has a new defensive coordinator so we really dont know what theyre going to run on defense well have to go back to some clemson stuff and try to find some film on some of the other places that hes been and get some ideas about some things hes done with those programs also they have a new special teams coordinator but theres really only so much you can do on special teams but we worked on the punt return game a lot because thats the biggest part of a game that can make or break a team and thats punt protection
7682358 byrnes been snapping since spring hes done a great job and as a matter of fact were a better team with him snapping right now were getting the ball down to 2 0 from snap to kick sometimes when you keep working guys at a different position they get better at it thats the positive about getting him in the game right now
7682359 its not really a distraction with whats going on right now its kind of a different team you have adversities and you deal with them but you stay focused on the biggest product which youre trying to get done and then you move forward
7682360 they both handle themselves with a lot of pride and a lot of poise as quarterbacks they put a lot of pressure on themselves they put the blame on themselves as far as missing passes theyll say they didnt get it off on time or theyll say it was their fault there are going to be some bad plays in games but when they take the blame for things in practice its easier for the team to be relaxed for something like that in a game
7682361 i became aware of jacory his 11th grade year as he would come to games and stand on the sidelines and interact with the players he would either be with sean spence or hed be with tommy streeter and they would interact with the guys well he was never just with offense or defense he was with different guys and handled himself so well
7682362 as far as marve i noticed him when he was at camps in the summer i saw he was throwing the ball better than a lot of other people for his age and he was holding up in camps he was going up against some premier quarterbacks and he handled himself so well he would tell receivers to run a little shorter and ill get you the ball things like that impressed me about him
7682363 i am not really changing the plays for the young quarterbacks i just think you put the ball into the playmakers hands it doesnt always have to be a 90 yard pass or anything like that if a guy takes a pass in the flats and takes it 70 yards then its still a 70 yard pass whether you throw it 70 or you throw it five it will still take you the same distance
7682364 its always exciting when you play the first game of the season its a night game and i think you have a lot of fans interested in seeing the product because of the recruiting and things like that
7682365 so it could be a tank or tankless water system but the energy source comes from the sun rather than via a utility company
7682366 we made it really clear that when we recruit new industry we make sure were not recruiting someone who will be a challenge for other businesses
7682367 we will have to do an analysis of the business plan to make sure nothing poses an unfair advantage over private sector companies
7682368 were not relying simply on those folks who were there before
7682369 but im confident we know how to get a hold of them some of them have stayed in touch with us
7682370 ive seen them go through adversity theyve seen me as their head coach go through adversity i think they can trust were not going to be a bunch of knee jerk blamers were going to go in there and fix this thing together
7682371 as you do in your first year sometimes you throw some pups to the wolves
7682372 sometimes you have to bite that bullet and hope it pays off for you in the end
7682373 the more points they scored the more frustrated we got
7682374 it makes you feel great and lets you know this offense could go to a lot of places
7682375 i dont ever have to worry about him running the wrong route or taking seven steps when he should take six
7682376 i can tell by his eyes if im open or not if somebodys on my tail if he gives me those eyes i know its coming and ill just run with him its just natural between us
7682377 i think we were better in the spring than we were at any point all of last season
7682378 having the same coaching staff for two years is huge for us
7682379 were going to try to execute get guys good at their technique and what their assignment is and advance the ball based on playing good football
7682380 it should allow us to get a better pass rush and more sacks
7682381 its going to be more of a scheme thing than one player having to work so hard to make a play
7682382 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7682383 sharon was there with him and his friends from louisiana
7682384 this is not going to be the year that we make big changes
7682385 inclusive candidate who understands that our party needs to reach out to all americans to win this election
7682386 contrary to media reports britney was never slated to perform on this years vmas shes in the middle of recording her next album which is going amazingly well and her focus remains on the studio
7682387 any ideas that we have about her hair are always theoretical and we always have to be prepared but she is not performing and so we dont have to worry about that
7682388 it is important to know that we are united in our determination to turning around america
7682389 and by united i mean all of us the afl cio the nea change to win 17 million members 38 million potential voters in union households
7682390 i know we can count on the nea the afl cio and change to win
7682391 pay attention if you see something amiss let someone know

7682394 we knew that online was going to be a very natural extension to that
7682395 by 2010 20 per cent of our revenues should come from online from digital applications
7682396 so if theres a great restaurant you like why not once you have found it save that listing to your facebook profile
7682397 who would have thought that a 100 years ago that we would have been repurposing our content for that kind of environment
7682398 when we look at advertisers who invest heavily online they also tend to invest more in print than the average so they are looking at it as a way of growing leads
7682399 under terms of the arrangement ypg will now be able to provide its base of about 425 000 advertisers an enhanced advertising offering which will improve the ability of small and medium sized enterprises to further market their businesses online

7682409 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
7682410 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
7682411 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
7682412 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
7682413 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
7682414 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
7682415 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
7682416 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
7682417 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
7682418 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
7682419 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
7682420 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
7682421 no they dont create jobs they keep windfall profits at the top

7682427 i respect carrie and i would never say anything like that
7682428 i think its impressive how many no 1s carrie underwood has
7682429 her choice in songs is really great and she has an incredible voice as far as new people she has one of the strongest voices out there
7682430 youre not hot enough for me to be talking to
7682431 we were praying for the baby unfortunately he could not survive i hope hes in a better place hes with his mother
7682432 this story hit me like a ton of bricks i was just hoping for the fathers sake that the baby would survive the lords will was to take the baby and be with his mother in heaven
7682433 you just have to stick to the will of god but for those who are driving a vehicle thats not safe i hope this will be a warning to them
7682434 we need to be responsible for our cars and make sure our cars are in perfect working condition because we know things fail and we need to be responsible for our actions
7682435 she went way ahead of her time it wasnt her time but life is so unfair
7682436 i think its fair to say that the cw has been a bad actor particularly when it comes to gossip girl
7682437 but i think that the cw has already demonstrated that theyll stoop to any level in a rather desperate attempt to build buzz
7682438 it stands to reason 90210 is going to be a similar type show
7682439 withholding the advance screener has nothing to do with content concerns
7682440 90210 has had strong demand and enthusiastic support from the advertising community since the moment the applause ceased at our 2008 upfront presentation
7682441 media buyers hate groups like the ptc and they want to be able to ignore them

7682445 what an advantage this trip will be for us the chance to go compete and practice to learn what our team can do i am really excited for this opportunity that will help us learn about our team better ive had other coaches tell me there are so many advantages to this trip
7682446 we stressed some of our defense today and from there moved on to our transition play you have to give a young team small doses of information at a time it will benefit us in the long run
7682447 the men approached the deputy wanting to know what was going on and did so in an aggressive verbal manner
7682448 there were about seven of them who walked towards him and the deputy fearing for his safety unsheathed his weapon and as soon as he did so it was over
7682449 making clothes together in our studio makes us feel complete we probably sound like a group of grannies in a knitting circle but its the truth and it gives us some control over our visual identity
7682450 we see if they have a sewing kit in the amenities drawer in case we feel inspired
7682451 when you are a big band and everyone is taking shots at you the more things you can do together the better and if youre wearing uniforms made by your own hands it helps achieve that

7682453 if i want to go out and drink and throw a glass in the street ill do it as long as the reason is that i want to have fun and not that i want to create some sort of tension around me then id be a d k but im not
7682454 people think chace is gay and thought i was gay that we were humping its not true but hilarious people project their fantasies onto people ive never been someone who makes it my objective to go out and pick up chicks but ive met some fantastic ladies here you know those amazing conversations where you find yourself in a cafe talking until 2 a m and never see them again
7682455 i love going out in the summer the girls wear their nice dresses did that sound sleazy it really did didnt it put it like this everyone comes out looking gorgeous in summer we are a more beautiful species in the summer
7682456 this changes the strategic relationship between the us and poland there is a clear and explicit understanding that if there are negative consequences of stationing the missile shield the us will come to polands defense
7682457 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia its to protect our european allies from any rogue threats
7682458 the strategic significance of the system consists of intercepting those few dozen missiles moscow can launch following a first strike its a crucial element to develop a nuclear first strike capacity against russia the original plan is for ten interceptor missiles in poland but once established their number could be easily increased
7682459 guarantee s a us edge to carry out nuclear war without risking a counter strike
7682460 were at war against determined enemies and we must not rest until that war is won
7682461 stands for freedom around the world now the world must stand for freedom in georgia
7682462 every nation in every region now has a decision to make either you are with us or you are with the terrorists
7682463 no one with good intentions towards us and the west should
7682464 moscows willingness to crush georgia with overwhelming force and claims the kremlin has 10 times as many tactical short range warheads as the us
7682465 pugnacious russia determined to acquire economic and military power and not afraid to use threats and force to get its way with nuclear weapons central to the russian geopolitical calculus
7682466 the dark days of communist yore and captures the threat of what we and russias neighbors are up against
7682467 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
7682468 immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
7682469 nato can act to stabiliz e this very dangerous situation
7682470 now is the time for action not just words russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
7682471 making putin pay and turning russias georgian rout into a political defeat
7682472 to remove president saakasvili from the office to which he was elected in 2004 and to overthrow a democratic government
7682473 western authorities to explore the vulnerability of russian assets abroad or at least make life difficult for the holders of those assets
7682474 in the world of global commerce china calculated that staging an olympic extravaganza could enhance its ambivalent reputation by contrast the putin government seems to believe its power grows in sync with its reputation as an international pariah an outsider state
7682475 russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world

7682477 the war in georgia marks an easy return to territorial expansion and attempted regional dominance
7682478 tried to give russians an alternative narrative he put forward democracy as a unifying and legitimizing idea for the new russian state
7682479 young democracies around russia back into moscows sphere of influence the worldview of a russian nationalist is hard for outsiders to comprehend
7682480 kremlin capitalism is a threat to the west by using its market strength in oil and gas resources to strong arm its neighbors and outmaneuver the us and eu
7682481 is to replace a pro western government with a new russian satellite reminiscent of the brezhnev doctrine its part of a broader campaign to annex new territory expand the russian empire conduct cyber attacks against the baltic states assassinate enemies and use economic intimidation through cutoffs of russian oil and gas shipments to ukraine and the czech republic it is important that moscow pays a concrete and tangible price for its latest aggression at least comparable to what it paid for the 1979 invasion of afghanistan
7682482 burned and houses broken unburied bodies lay rotting fresh graves were dug in gardens and basements most victims interviewed were ethnic georgians in central georgian villages some killings were carried out for revenge some involved theft and still others seemed to be that the power balance was shifting away from ethnic georgians to the ossetian separatists and their russian backers
7682483 georgians living in several of the villages said the russians occupying their land had treated them well done nothing to encourage them to leave and offered the only protection available from the south ossestian militias they feared most
7682484 us sees much to fear in a hostile russia by usher ing in a sustained period of renewed animosity with the west problems extend ing far beyond arms deals with syria and the mountains of georgia
7682485 the hegemon in that region and we are not and thats a fact
7682486 any kind of coercive actions like economic sanctions or anything else
7682487 abkhazia rallie d for independence and the abkhazian parliament has approved an official appeal to russia to recognize its independence
7682488 russia is always with you and will never leave you in the lurch

7682730 weve heard criticisms from across the country including representative from the medical community that ken epps bill could be interpreted that mr epps bill as presently drafted could be interpreted as instilling fetal rights
7682731 let me be clear our government will not reopen the debate on abortion
7682732 for this reason and in the context of the governments tackling crime agenda im announcing that the government will introduce legislation that will punish criminals who commit violence against pregnant women but do so in a way that leaves no room for the introduction of fetal rights
7682733 i am very disappointed he has fallen victim to the scare tactics of special interests groups who refuse to stand by pregnant women who want their unborn babies protected in law
7682734 why have increased penalties for attacks on pregnant women if the baby doesnt matter
7682735 either the unborn child matters so that attacks on pregnant women are more heinous in which case bill c 484 is a direct recognition of that reality or the child doesnt matter in which case we dont need any new law the current provisions in the criminal code cover the violence to the woman
7682736 besides my legal advisors and the justice department have assured me that pregnancy is already deemed an aggravating factor for sentencing purposes as part of our case law
7682737 and i have also been assured that c 484 will not change that
7682738 the only thing you cant do is sit in a tyled lodge with them

7682742 they seem to care for the welfare of those they know
7682743 subjects systematically favoured the prosocial option provided their partner was a familiar b visible and c receiving rewards of equal value
7682744 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7682745 we believe prosocial behaviour is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices
7682746 our simple message to those mps considering their options is dont rush as a nation we have more to lose than to gain by getting this wrong
7682747 we are after all democrats so it may take a while
7682748 were not the fall in line party we are diverse but make no mistake we are unified

7682753 when hillary clinton was clearly in the democratic primaries the woman who the person who gathered the most votes 18 million of them was a great debater and a great campaigner

7682767 the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious
7682768 barack obama has re opened a wound among american catholics by picking a pro abortion catholic politician the american bishops have made clear that catholic political leaders must defend the dignity of every human person including the unborn sadly joe bidens tenure in the united states senate has been marked by steadfast support for legal abortion
7682769 i am a long standing supporter of roe v wade and a womans right to choose
7682770 now everywhere biden campaigns well have this question of whether a pro abortion catholic can receive communion senator biden is an unrepentant supporter of abortion in direct opposition to the church he claims as his own selecting a pro abortion catholic is a slap in the face to catholic voters
7682771 no one today would accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
7682772 the promotion of abortion by any catholic is a grave and serious matter objectively according to the constant teaching of the scriptures and the church it would be more spiritually beneficial for such a person to refrain from receiving the body and blood of christ i ask catholics in this position to have the integrity to respect the eucharist catholic teaching and the catholic faithful
7682773 i dont think you have to see prices go up just some stabilization so we know the home price declines arent continuing to get out of hand

7682782 ted is eager to get back on the campaign trail to elect barack obama as president build a stronger democratic majority in the senate and put america back on track
7682783 the reason people dont like michelle obama is because they are afraid of a strong independant woman she is herself not portraying a 1960s stereotype of the helpless innocent southern bell like hillary or the no brains rich brat cindy mccain
7682784 but this past year i really worked hard on integrating the different elements ive been happier less stressed and more productive
7682785 get more sleep take some time to meditate connect the head and the body
7682786 the result will be fewer mistakes and more time in making wiser decisions clinton is famous for saying some of his biggest errors where when he was sleep deprived
7682787 i really do think this is a moment in the culture when a critical mass is turning to more self awareness to protect themselves from the negative stuff all around them we really do need to learn to unplug and recharge if we are to be successful
7682788 on the road its a little harder than it would be at home

7682810 although all of my big parties are super fun and always have a fund raising component theres something special about the portland masturbate a thon
7682811 i call it the fund raiser you cant say without a smile and maybe because masturbation is so universal and so individual it always draws an especially pansexual crowd my male volunteers tell me it feels great to be able to hand a lesbian a ziploc bag filled with lube gloves and a vibrator and get a big smile in return instead of a slap across the face
7682812 in addition to being excited about the burlesque theme and the fact canadas wet spots are performing im especially excited about the level of involvement and interest this years portland masturbate a thon has been drawing from the adult entertainment industry
7682813 its a great opportunity to introduce literally hundreds of sexually adventurous people to new toys garments sex furniture and other products and services

7682822 if schauer thinks he can run a positive campaign that will not be enough for that district because it is too republican he needs to contrast with the walberg record
7682823 the numbers show voters arent buying what congressman walberg is selling
7682824 this poll reflects the momentum weve been seeing on the ground for the past several months
7682825 people simply arent buying what tim walberg is selling and mark has the message and the momentum to win this race in november

7682840 ill gun your sorry ass down if you touch fifi my pet gorilla
7682841 ive always felt for a long time since i was a kid myself that i wanted to do something with my faith and that god was calling me towards ministry
7682842 i felt passionately that i wanted to put my christian faith in action and actually see young people coming to christ its very much on my heart to see young people valued because a lot of the time i dont think they are
7682843 i work through the church to bring children into a safe environment where they are supported and valued
7682844 these children are usually from poor or broken families and need love we have a youth club in st marks and they do come here but i also want to support them where they are
7682845 its mainly to let them know they have a voice so they can contribute to improving their community and themselves
7682846 what comes out most in the forums is that they really just want to be listened to a lot of the time apart from issues such as drugs family often matters a lot to them the fingers usually pointed at them first whenever crime is mentioned but these young people do have a heart for their community
7682847 michaels hands are pretty filthy by this point in the series its becoming harder and harder to tell the good guys from the bad guys the question becomes can there be any sort of redemption for michael
7682848 what would that look like what would that take perhaps laying down his life so that someone else can live might be one answer to that question
7682849 i think the interesting wrinkle that saras return signifieds is that hwen michael thought she was dead he crossed certain lines that he otherwise might not have crossed
7682850 i think that michael is still a good man but at this point i think it would take something quite extreme for him to really even the score
7682851 i think the only thing michael is fit for is as a hired gun
7682852 michael is not particularly interested in his own survival michael is interested in self sacrifice i think michael has a touch of the martyr about him
7682853 i think when all is said and done the brothers will be able to part as equals
7682854 my favorite so far has been 1 and 3 because i happen to think my character works best behind bars
7682855 its one of my least favorite seasons because it felt as though my character was literally and figuratively running shotgun
7682856 i think its finally time to take on the puppet master
7682857 the tattoo is addressed pretty definitively in the first episode
7682858 i appreciated that i had to wear long sleeve shirts
7682859 how can we really address this issue that really feels satisfying and gives some closure to people who were constantly on the lookout for it
7682860 i wouldnt be surprised we do love the unexpected twists and turns on this show i think rockmond would be a great edition
7682861 not entirely white not entirely black not entirely good not entirely evil
7682862 im not going to jump into the next bourne supremacy franchise
7682863 because at the end of the day its important to come home and unwind
7682864 im always thinking of the character even when im not on set it has become part of the air that i breathe
7682865 all i have to do is show up on set stand in front ofrobert knepper and i get instinctively what michaels relationship is with t bag
7682866 because of the media and the fans theres more energy or electricity in the ballpark but you cant bring in a pitcher an inning earlier they dont give you two wins when you beat the yankees so you cant do it differently
7682867 im looking forward to it thats what you play baseball for is that type of atmosphere those type of games
7682868 i guess i felt more of that during the all star game because it was an all star game and you had time to maybe think about things
7682869 when were playing the team were just trying to beat them thats really what i care about i dont get too caught up in the other stuff
7682870 so go work with republicans and reform our state ethics law
7682871 beginning today the nation and the world will focus its attention on the presidential nominating conventions and cq will be there in full force to cover the action
7682872 we are extremely proud of our unparalleled coverage thanks to our award winning journalists and the variety of vehicles we are using to deliver that coverage
7682873 youre free but your shadow is chaos and it will always be there by your side
7682874 reflected my flat mate when we discussed the movie anarchy and freedom still cohabitate in congo definitely
7682875 the best vacation i ever had was a boat trip on the congo river
7682876 an american once told me that was three years ago in mozambique in a five star beach resort i was on the un payroll i had escaped the peacekeeping mission on rnr while he was on a reconnaissance trip for his multi millionaire clients
7682877 our six planned boat trips on the congo river are fully booked for 2007
7682878 says the belgium of his wealthy eco tourists congos paths have definitely become unbeaten
7682879 serious speed well probably do a lot of irritating of people on the base paths if we can get them on
7682880 when you give players creative control you have to expect theyre going to do the unexpected
7682881 some of its really good for what they were shooting for its amazingly explicit especially when those creations are animated we just have to make sure those people arent messing up the experience for others
7682882 you can play through the entire game without killing anything
7682883 its very challenging but its also very beneficial when the game initializes the relationships of other creatures or tribes or civilizations for the next level many of those relationships have to do with how aggressive those creatures perceive you to be
7682884 we werent thinking of the sims as a brand we were thinking of it as an offbeat computer game with spore we had the confidence that the players would always exceed our expectations if we gave them more creative control from day one weve been thinking about spore as a brand
7682885 you can apply that to almost any format i dont want to limit spore to just games theres a lot of other activities including books movies tv or whatever you can imagine that we could take it in if we think of it as a brand what that could look like is yet to be determined
7682886 spore on almost any platform is going to be different and tied to the unique aspects of that platform
7682887 sitting in front of a console is very different from sitting in front of a pc whether youre using a mouse or a ps3 controller or a wii wand that right off the bat is arguing for a somewhat different design
7682888 i dont think we could design a sequel to spore until the fans showed us what they like
7682889 i think theres going to be a fair amount of learning over the next few months whats important for me is what sort of stories the players are using the game to tell games that have the longest legs are the ones with the most narrative density
7682890 we knew that online was going to be a very natural extension to that
7682891 by 2010 20 per cent of our revenues should come from online from digital applications
7682892 so if theres a great restaurant you like why not once you have found it save that listing to your facebook profile
7682893 who would have thought that a 100 years ago that we would have been repurposing our content for that kind of environment
7682894 when we look at advertisers who invest heavily online they also tend to invest more in print than the average so they are looking at it as a way of growing leads
7682895 under terms of the arrangement ypg will now be able to provide its base of about 425 000 advertisers an enhanced advertising offering which will improve the ability of small and medium sized enterprises to further market their businesses online

7682901 there were studies into whether cats and guinea pigs can be infected this was done when the original outbreak occurred in 1994
7682902 we did a survey of bat carers and tested them and none showed any exposure to the hendra virus
7682903 bats wont be culled they are a protected species and are an important part of the ecosystem
7682904 we are far better looking at how horses catch the virus
7682905 we are studying how the virus travels in bat populations and how it is related to the reproductive cycle

7682910 if we can get the cabinet or the state government to agree to putting in the extra funding i believe council should also do that
7682911 just imagine the system going all of the way to burleigh heads it frees up all of those buses then to run east west which then improves these service to reedy creek mudgeeraba and nerang
7682912 its a complete exaggeration to suggest that if we oppose these four particular tax measures we will be picking apart the governments surplus
7682913 if we were to oppose these particular measures they amount to about 1 5 billion of revenue a year thats about 0 5 per cent of total government revenue
7682914 it would mean that this year there would be a surplus of 20 billion instead of 21 5 billion
7682915 what the government is actually doing is taxing australians now in an unjustifiable way in order to spend it later to buy their way back into office in 2010

7682975 that decision is not going to help things it only adds to the tension in the region
7682976 we will take any decision including up to a complete break in relations
7682977 there has been a dramatic worsening of our relations but we are not to blame
7682978 we risk committing a serious error by thinking that cheap information made universally available through electronic media fulfills the requirements of a democratic society for organized knowledge past generations had to win knowledge by using their wits and never took what they knew for granted recalling their labor and travail is if anything more important than ever if we are to distinguish what is truly novel about the information age from what is transient hype

7683002 its a little like the conservative party line on the disintegration of the black family we look at the statistics and assume our case is strong while ignoring the fact that telling the black community theyd be fine if they all stopped being so dissolute

7683004 the russians are digging entrenchments and a checkpoint to the entrance

7683006 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that def inition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
7683007 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemna tion of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abor tion
7683008 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder
7683009 its giving both an opportunity to further develop their fan bases and develop further excitement around the potential of them coming together
7683010 if chris destroys another opponent people are really going to be clamoring especially if gina gets in and clobbers hers its just really about letting the fighters develop letting them grow in their skills and their character development in order for them to eventually meet one another

7683015 a pesar del paro camionero se pudo dar esta ca da en los precios de todos estos alimentos
7683016 durante 2007 y en lo corrido de 2008 los alimentos han desempe ado un papel protag nico en el comportamiento general del ipc ndice de precios al consumidor debido a que sus ajustes han estado por encima de las metas de infl aci n fijadas por el banco
7683017 en n meses recientes las expectativas de inflaci n siguen aumentando y contin an la tendencia que muestra la inflaci n al consumidor
7683018 las expectativas a diciembre de 2008 obtenidas a partir de la encuesta mensual que aplica el banco se situaron a comienzos de julio en 6 7
7683019 este aumento es superior al registrado por la inflaci n total en el mismo per odo para el caso de las expectativas a un a o el dato m s reciente se sit a en 5 5 lo que es 70 pb puntos b sicos m s que lo reportado un trimestre atr s
7683020 uno de los riesgos m s altos que enfrenta la estabilidad de la inflaci n en colombia hacia el largo plazo es el aumento de las expectativas
7683021 este fen meno puede alentar incrementos de precios por encima de las metas establecidas por el banco en lo que resta del a o y a comienzos de 2009 especialmente si la credibilidad de la pol tica monetaria es baja tal como lo sugieren las encuestas
7683022 the reason people dont like michelle obama is because they are afraid of a strong independant woman she is herself not portraying a 1960s stereotype of the helpless innocent southern bell like hillary or the no brains rich brat cindy mccain

7683058 that puts him in a terrible bind because you cant give a ringing endorsement when youre talking about foreign policy
7683059 obviously the hard thing to talk about with obama is commander in chief of all his many talents
7683060 this is planetary destabilization and its already begun the question is how do we arrest this before it gets to the point of catastrophe
7683061 the earth could be free of arctic summer ice within our lifetime
7683062 this has not happened as far as we know in 130 000 years as long as human beings have existed on the planet
7683063 if you had a gauge in your car reading in the red zone how long would you feel comfortable driving down the highway like that thats where we are now

7683065 if we were to move to the most efficient lighting technologies available today we could reduce electricity demand by 12 percent
7683066 on coal fired energy kutscher says energy efficiency alone can reduce u s energy use by 57 percent and beyond efficiency carbon emissions can be drastically reduced by generating vastly more energy from cleaner sources like the wind sun and earths heat we see 40 percent of the worlds electricity coming from wind
7683067 that would require building roughly a million and a half over the next dozen years now a million and a half may sound like a lot but we make 65 million cars a year

7683074 we cant have half measures we dont have time to lose we have to hit the ground running
7683075 now is the time to speak the truth and bring new people into the political process well only do this from the bottom up if people way beyond

7683093 ive met a lot of different people who shape our lives
7683094 if you look at the hard numbers and the voting trends from the past five years young voters have turned out in increasingly large numbers in the last three major elections
7683095 theres no reason to think that young voters wont show up in november in record numbers anyone who thinks otherwise is operating out of old preconceptions and isnt taking a hard look at the facts on the ground
7683096 for those who believe that everyone under 30 is voting for obama i think they are right that young people want change but i think its wrong that all of us young people believe that obama has the answers
7683097 yes obama talks about change but he has no substance we need a leader with answers and with experience and for many of us this year that leader is john mccain
7683098 i see a lot of friends who were apolitical being informed first and becoming obama supporters second
7683099 he gives the country the opportunity to move past a lot of the stale old politics and find solutions to the countrys biggest problems
7683100 that can alienate local voters when you have some fresh faced kid from across the country telling you what you should be thinking instead of a factory worker down the street
7683101 mccains greatest support is among older voters over 65 and he is weakest among voters under 40
7683102 its absolutely his strategy to maximize turnout among the older crowd and minimize the influence of younger voters
7683103 mccains ads are insulting to the intelligence of young people all hes doing is turning himself into the crazy old man who yells at kids to get off his lawn
7683104 although i hope people vote for barak obama i care more about people getting involved in the political process

7683132 when you see yourself doing something badly and nobodys bothering you to tell you anymore thats a very bad place to be your critics are the ones telling you they still love you and care
7683133 it would mean for example in this current financial year a surplus of 20 billion instead of 21 5 billion
7683134 lets not be lectured by the labor party about fiscal rectitude they have nothing to tell us
7683135 they certainly dont have a mandate for these completely unjustifiable tax increases
7683136 what the government is actually doing is taxing australians now in an unjustifiable way in order to spend it later in order to buy their way back into office in 2010

7683170 he was a proven vote getter in a republican district
7683171 a guy who had a clear ability to work across the aisle and a great familiarity with defense and veterans issues he was well liked by his colleagues he could be a strong contender for cabinet spot if he wants to leave the house
7683172 for me to even speculate about a cabinet position i would be putting the cart before the horse
7683173 the attached print ad part of a series of similar ads run by glaxosmithkline is the most egregious example of this type of advertising this ad is designed to instill fear in the minds of aids patients by telling them that switching aids treatment presumably from gsk drugs may lead to increased side effects and potentially treatment failure this message is gsks response to the increased number of patients switching from its drugs to newer treatments and seeks to discourage aids patients from changing their antiretroviral arv regimens regardless of their medical needs further the explicit message in this ad avoid hidden dangers from switching your hiv medicine is that safety and efficacy information provided by a patients doctor or the fda is incorrect or misleading
7683174 the ads are part of a larger trend of drug companies taking aim at rival hiv drugs hinting at side effects and other drawbacks experts say
7683175 a development fueling the sharp elbows advertising the market for hiv medicines has grown crowded and companies want to protect their market share
7683176 can be deceiving avoid hidden dangers from changing your hiv medicines
7683177 if you are thinking about switching your hiv medicine make sure you know what youre getting into
7683178 with these latest ads gsk has sunk to a new low the company has resorted to exploiting patient fears in order to sell a product while remaining unconcerned about the harm caused to patients who are scared off treatment altogether because of gsks tactics
7683179 we are disappointed that poz magazine a publication targeted to an hiv positive population would run such ads this kind of underhanded negative advertising creates fear of hiv treatment in general which could dissuade people from seeking treatment at all we are also disappointed that despite repeated communication with the fda regarding our concerns over a similar gsk ad campaign last year there appears to be a total lack of oversight of direct to consumer advertising of prescription drugs that is why we are appealing to hhs in the hopes that our concerns will be heard and these harmful ads pulled
7683180 we are encouraged that the results of the japanese and u s studies are consistent and both suggest that nitric oxide donation may allow a more sustained intraocular pressure lowering effect nicox and pfizer are in active discussions regarding the worldwide rights to pf 03187207 which we believe has a certain commercial potential which should be realized we are also pleased by the progress that has been made in the research program focused on diabetic retinopathy where we hope a lead compound will be selected in the first half of next year
7683181 the fact that these animals dont die and are restored to normal health despite a total lack of insulin is hard for many researchers and clinicians to believe
7683182 many scientists including us thought it would be a waste of time to give leptin in the absence of insulin weve been brainwashed into thinking that insulin is the only substance that can correct the consequences of insulin deficiency
7683183 but if we gave them the leptin gene within two weeks the terminally ill rodents were restored to full health without any other treatment
7683184 my hope is that you could give leptin for one type of action glucagons suppression for example and insulin for another or perhaps give a substance other than insulin entirely
7683185 what would be a tremendous advance would be the ability to give an oral agent that suppresses glucagon without injections
7683186 one of the things that happens when a child gets type 1 diabetes is their growth is stunted until theyre given insulin
7683187 the same is true with these mice however we found that if you take a diabetic rat thats not receiving insulin and make it hyperleptinemic it almost catches up growthwise

7683351 well others could come forward just as much as i could the interesting thing was i didnt hesitate
7683352 this is a far reaching program designed to comprehensively restructure and reposition the business for years to come
7683353 we wanted to make a major change today across the company in order to accelerate our building of a strong and dynamic integrated media business
7683354 however the content creation and selection will remain under the control of their editors
7683355 as a result of this program a number of positions will likely be declared redundant
7683356 there will also be a wide range of initiatives to significantly reduce costs in all departments across the business including deferral of wage reviews for senior management
7683357 there will be criticism from some inside and outside the company that these changes particularly in editorial will compromise quality and critical mass in the metro mastheads and their mission we reject that
7683358 this initiative has been carefully constructed by the publishers with full regard for the integrity of their mastheads our newspapers will remain true to their heritage and their values of quality and excellence
7683359 a wide range of initiatives will result in a head count reduction of approximately 550 employees in australia and new zealand or approximately five per cent of the companys full time workforce
7683360 media companies fit for the modern media world need to be lean and agile
7683361 this far reaching program will position us well for the next stage of our growth and development
7683362 over the course of the 2006 and 2007 financial years we achieved 52 million in ongoing real cost reductions
7683363 cost synergies associated with the merger of fairfax media and rural press and the acquisition of southern cross radio produced a further 53 million in savings
7683364 all of these synergies will be realised by the end of this financial year
7683365 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7683366 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognise these separatist regions
7683367 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7683368 the united states will continue to stand with the people of georgia and their democracy and to support its sovereignty and territorial integrity
7683369 the g7 is united in support for georgias territorial integrity and alarmed by reports of russian plans to recognise abkhazia and south ossetia
7683370 that decision is not going to help things it only adds to the tension in the region
7683371 we will take any decision including up to a complete break in relations
7683372 there has been a dramatic worsening of our relations but we are not to blame
7683373 there were studies into whether cats and guinea pigs can be infected this was done when the original outbreak occurred in 1994
7683374 we did a survey of bat carers and tested them and none showed any exposure to the hendra virus
7683375 bats wont be culled they are a protected species and are an important part of the ecosystem
7683376 we are far better looking at how horses catch the virus
7683377 we are studying how the virus travels in bat populations and how it is related to the reproductive cycle

7683417 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
7683418 multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries
7683419 apparently a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight
7683420 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
7683421 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws

7683485 i tore around in my back yard with that and when i turned eight i was old enough to drive racing carts
7683486 i was racing again the next week young and dumb
7683487 my parents mortgaged their house so that i could go go cart racing

7683495 we knew if we were at the same racetrack wed have to beat each other to win and we just got in a shoving match in race cars every time one of us would hit the other it was harder than the one before eventually kenny crashed me bad enough to where i couldnt get it to move
7683496 i reached in his car and tried to grab hold of him
7683497 wasnt a very smart thing to do the funny thing is dale earnhardt was in front of kennys car and earnhardt slows down to a crawl to give me time to get to kenny so the old man was working with me there
7683498 sometimes i just want to shake some damn sense into him
7683499 but tonys a good guy i would say that if he got in shape hed win even more races but i dont think tony needs to do that to win
7683500 i like to think i do things the right way

7683512 folks were going to lock people up were going to put them in the county jail when they violate the law but were also going to give the nonviolent offender those that just cant seem to get it together an opportunity

7683546 recruiting is going well finally after two back to back bowl wins and if we can make it three years in a row to the post season then i think national prominence is possible we need to build continuity in the program and recruit well but we also have to win games
7683547 now its just a matter of whether were going to move forward and if the new faces will make their own names or whether theyll slide and not be as productive as i anticipate we can be
7683548 theyve got a lot of new guys stepping into positions that have been manned by some pretty prominent players in recent years as well
7683549 the biggest question marks are the players and what their talent level and execution levels are going to be on both sides of the ball
7683550 you look at their home record and you look at hunter cantwells experience at the quarterback position its understandable
7683551 id rather be georgia this year going in and saying were the no 1 team in the nation id like to deal with that someday
7683552 absolutely were not in that position yet and for us to have continuity and respect in the pre season we have to beat the teams kentucky hasnt beaten on a regular basis not just one or two years in a row
7683553 for all those whose cares have been our concern the work goes on the cause endures the hope still lives and the dream shall never die

7683558 sen biden improved the bill for low income workers women and children there were times when he believed amendments on both sides would have blown up a bipartisan compromise backed by three quarters of the senate at those moments sen biden had to make the tough calls and he voted to pass a bill
7683559 ive talked to the mccain campaign a little bit about the issue but certainly not about me being in that mix
7683560 i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7683561 the bottom line is that this critically endangered species needs our help
7683562 noaas decision on these measures is based on the best data and scientific understanding available
7683563 what we have seen over and over again where economics and partisanship and political interests bump up against the science science loses

7683580 inclusive candidate who understands that our party needs to reach out to all americans to win this election
7683581 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
7683582 mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
7683583 this response ad is more smoke and mirrors from a candidate desperate to obscure his long standing relationship with admitted domestic terrorist william ayers
7683584 senator obama is pretending to barely know the man who hosted the launch of his political career and with whom he has worked for years to advance a liberal agenda
7683585 bill clinton knows a little bit about trying to yank the economy out of the doldrums
7683586 it wouldnt make sense for me to want to edit his remarks
7683587 during the course of a 19 month campaign i think that youre on the television screen youre in big auditoriums but sometimes who you are may get lost
7683588 the fact is we had a very hard fought primary there are going to be some of senator clintons supporters we have to work hard to persuade to come on board thats not surprising

7683594 sen biden improved the bill for low income workers women and children there were times when he believed amendments on both sides would have blown up a bipartisan compromise backed by three quarters of the senate at those moments sen biden had to make the tough calls and he voted to pass a bill
7683595 the healing process is going to be a little longer than four days

7683628 its very hard to find good sushi chefs especially nowadays
7683629 its in our industrys interest to build a not for profit school
7683630 sushi is the core of japanese food culture in the u s but with the increase of sushi restaurants we are finding a lack of chefs and the techniques of local sushi chefs is declining
7683631 living in japan you know that youre not supposed to eat certain fish in certain seasons here anything goes people think raw fish is raw fish
7683632 seasoning and flavors are changing a lot compared to the traditional way sometimes its good sometimes its bad the good part is that we are dealing with american tastes so we should adjust flavors and some people do it well but some fish some sauces some vegetables dont match sometimes thats the bad part if i can teach how to make sushi well thats good
7683633 our quickness is not bad but it aint great either
7683634 they have a lot of confidence in them and that makes them easy to coach
7683635 we can very good but our league is very tough
7683636 these guys play really well with each other they are intense good learners and have a good work ethic
7683637 i believe we are not going to go 0 10 or 10 0 but we should turn a few heads if we fall short we look and see where we can build
7683638 we are young and are going to make some mistakes but that is how you learn
7683639 there are a lot of tradition rich programs on the 8 man level and we have our work cut out for us
7683640 since january when biden dropped out of the presidential race he and obama have quietly worked to smooth over their disagreements and biden has sought to erase divisions between the two of them on iraq sources say
7683641 longstanding ties to trial lawyers and lobbyists and a taste for pork barrel spending
7683642 wouldnt be allowed to contribute money to his fathers vice presidential effort
7683643 tapped as his running mate a man whose dramatic life story rivals his own and holds political appeal far beyond the foreign policy expertise that is bidens most obvious asset
7683644 was his status as chairman of the senate foreign relations committee which should help counter republican charges that mr obama lacks the experience to be commander in chief
7683645 sen obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength its quite clear from all of the commentaries all of the things ive heard from democrats in particular the strong choice would have been hillary clinton
7683646 i think the selection of joe biden really is an admission or acknowledgement that barack obama did not have that experience did not have those credentials as joe biden hillary clinton evan bayh and others said about barack obama
7683647 it was a pick made from weakness it is a pick that in effect acknowledges i was being wounded on the commander in chief lack of foreign policy experience issue and i picked the most experienced democratic senator in foreign policy
7683648 has the ability to reach across the aisle and work with the republicans and he knows john mccain and obviously we need everybody
7683649 going to grow on the american people very fast because hes a tremendously engaging guy a tremendously bright guy and a guy whos sort of harry truman like he tells it like it is
7683650 it got all split in two and thats how we came to be identical
7683651 i started using the skull image when i was buying kids clothes for my cousins
7683652 everything for boys had skulls emblazoned on it and i just thought its such a weird thing to be instilling in little boys who are full of life
7683653 you cant help but be overwhelmed with catholic iconography in barcelona i went to church as a kid so for me the big rorschachs allude to the way the church is set up with an altar and vases everything in proportion
7683654 i used to use palette knives from france that cost 60 each until a neighbour who makes cupcakes walked in and said thats not a palette knife this is a palette knife
7683655 i didnt think id be as impressed as i was
7683656 everything was about the joy of life or this horrible fiery death its so overwhelming and so so inspiring i walked out of there and wanted to make a portrait as though i was gazing into the fires of hell
7683657 i had a friend walk into the studio and say i love that butterfly i said what butterfly theyre all skulls and he went oh my god theyre skulls i love that
7683658 to make their most grateful acknowledgments to their friends and customers for the many favours and civilities they have received and hope by this union they will be enabled to carry on their business to the entire satisfaction of their friends as on their part the strictest assiduity and attention shall be observed
7683659 it all depends on who is raising the funds firms like us who invest in early stage companies will be least impacted as we are not looking at immediate gains
7683660 the zr1 is fast sharp and quick in ways only a race car can be this is a brilliant car
7683661 i had to take 52 cases of beer home and put them in my basement and i dont even drink beer
7683662 in those days we were married and had children joe was manager of farmer bros restaurant service and we didnt practice or anything
7683663 but he just had one of those rare nights and he wasnt even paying attention to it
7683664 you could just go out there and just do it if you just had the right line that day you could easily bowl a 300
7683665 but i dont know it took me three years to do it a lot of its mental its all about hitting your mark finding that nice groove
7683666 i think everybody can bowl it brings you all together especially if youre all friends you come down here and throw a few hits
7683667 all of us at the tahoe daily tribune enjoyed pauls involvement with the paper we thank him for his hard work and wish him well
7683668 youre right near landers go in and tell the security guard you need to go to registration go up then go down to c1 and you can use the computer labs there
7683669 thai soldiers told us that they have locked the gate because thai tourists and students are visiting the temple and they are worried that there could be clashes if cambodians are allowed into the temple at the same time
7683670 thai soldiers at the gate told our military commanders that they have closed the gate on their commanders order they refused to open the gate for us even though our military commanders tried to negotiate with them to do so
7683671 i am disappointed with the thai decision to close the temple gate they should understand that the temple belongs to cambodia and should be under cambodian control
7683672 they agreed with us that they would withdraw their armed forces from ta moan thom temple
7683673 by locking the gate to cambodians the thais have gone back on their promise and violated the reached agreement
7683674 i have been a journalist for 32 years 23 of them at the new york times and i have a fair understanding of my professions rules and standards
7683675 we are appealing to the general public and to wealthy donors to help fund the road to ta moan thom
7683676 we believe people will contribute because the road will help protect the sovereignty of the kingdom
7683677 now we can reach the temple only by tractor or on foot
7683678 our soldiers have been guarding the temple for years and weve had to do so on foot during the rainy season the new road will help us more effectively defend the border
7683679 the relationship between the two countries has markedly improved over the last two years
7683680 im hesitant to say that because i think it still has a long way to go as many of you have heard me say before a few years of good relations cant really compensate for decades of misunderstandings and distrust
7683681 us government policy has shown clearly that it used to oppose the government now it shows clearly that they are pro government
7683682 they seem to have more cooperation with the government than before thats why they have less criticism of the government
7683683 the united states should not reduce aid to local ngos and they should not undertake more cooperation with the government they should strengthen more democracy and human rights in cambodia they should not give more aid to the government but should strengthen more aid to local ngos so the local ngos can strengthen human rights and democracy in this country
7683684 the oil could be a very good thing for cambodia
7683685 because cambodia is such a poor country and the economy is at such a low level that the oil if its used properly if it is used for the benefit of the cambodian people if its used to build roads and develop the educational system and the health system and things like that it is an opportunity for cambodia to really jump start its country and jump start the economy
7683686 tenemos un estudio en casa en el que ambos estamos trabajando

7683715 boart longyears 2008 first half results reflect continued strong growth from both our drilling services and products divisions due to ongoing high demand particularly in mineral exploration
7683716 boart longyear has seen little impact on demand despite uncertainties in global financial markets
7683717 we have managed the increasing cost pressures from steel oil and labour effectively
7683718 we expect demand to continue to be strong in the second half and we are well positioned to meet market requirements
7683719 while we see some regional differences in total around the globe we are not seeing any downturn in demand for our products or services in the minerals industry
7683720 primary continues to possess a strong long term outlook based on the opportunities presented by a favourable industry backdrop and the material synergies set to be realised from the integration of the symbion operations

7683722 managements focus is now on the integration of symbions medical centre pathology and imaging activities
7683723 the combined group is on track to realise an identified 95 105 million of synergies by the end of full year 2010
7683724 he has been incredible in his ability to link up and get to the right spots when we need someone to run into space

7683726 a wide range of initiatives will result in a head count reduction of approximately 550 employees in australia and new zealand or approximately five per cent of the companys full time workforce
7683727 media companies fit for the modern media world need to be lean and agile
7683728 this far reaching program will position us well for the next stage of our growth and development
7683729 over the course of the 2006 and 2007 financial years we achieved 52 million in ongoing real cost reductions
7683730 cost synergies associated with the merger of fairfax media and rural press and the acquisition of southern cross radio produced a further 53 million in savings
7683731 all of these synergies will be realised by the end of this financial year

7683734 we did a survey of bat carers and tested them and none showed any exposure to the hendra virus
7683735 bats wont be culled they are a protected species and are an important part of the ecosystem
7683736 we are far better looking at how horses catch the virus
7683737 we are studying how the virus travels in bat populations and how it is related to the reproductive cycle

7683739 this is a far reaching program designed to comprehensively restructure and reposition the business for years to come
7683740 we wanted to make a major change today across the company in order to accelerate our building of a strong and dynamic integrated media business
7683741 however the content creation and selection will remain under the control of their editors
7683742 as a result of this program a number of positions will likely be declared redundant
7683743 there will also be a wide range of initiatives to significantly reduce costs in all departments across the business including deferral of wage reviews for senior management
7683744 there will be criticism from some inside and outside the company that these changes particularly in editorial will compromise quality and critical mass in the metro mastheads and their mission we reject that
7683745 this initiative has been carefully constructed by the publishers with full regard for the integrity of their mastheads our newspapers will remain true to their heritage and their values of quality and excellence
7683746 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7683747 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognise these separatist regions
7683748 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7683749 the united states will continue to stand with the people of georgia and their democracy and to support its sovereignty and territorial integrity
7683750 the g7 is united in support for georgias territorial integrity and alarmed by reports of russian plans to recognise abkhazia and south ossetia
7683751 that decision is not going to help things it only adds to the tension in the region
7683752 we will take any decision including up to a complete break in relations
7683753 there has been a dramatic worsening of our relations but we are not to blame

7683824 given that our results are backed by numerous experimental studies showing that incense is a powerful producer of particulate matter and that incense smoke contains carcinogenic substances i believe incense should be used with caution
7683825 that is frequent use in rooms where people live should be minimized or at least sufficient ventilation should be secured in our study we find the increased risk of cancer to be present in individuals reporting frequent use of incense for many years thus repeated exposure for years should probably be avoided
7683826 the american lung association is going to add it as a risk factor
7683827 its not nearly the danger of smoking a pack a day for 20 years but its a danger
7683828 certainly i think bathing yourself in particles is probably not the smartest thing in the world but i think very few people fill up their room with incense
7683829 its a population based study which means that you can make an association but not necessarily a conclusion
7683830 it probably promotes more work in the area of routine household items and things we need to be looking at more prospectively to make a clear cause and effect relationship
7683831 anything that affects air quality negatively is not a good thing
7683832 burning in general and the release of smoke these things are certainly to be avoided at the very least chemical irritants will set off asthma and thats reversible cancer is not reversible

7683839 monthly withdrawal bleeding just four times a year or not at all
7683840 in the last 10 years there really has been almost a revolutionary change in the opinions and the views of women regarding menstruation
7683841 its not just the more mature reproductive women desiring fewer withdrawal bleeds
7683842 now thats becoming a more common desire among even younger women seeking hormonal contraception and some women have liked their experience using these longer cycle contraceptives because they can treat the side effects of mensturation yet one more example of contraception treating a medical condition images can be added to this post mary jane gallagher s picture

7683849 a whopping 20 members of the 2008 signing class were listed three newcomers receiver julio jones juco nose tackle terrence cody and inside linebacker donta hightower were named starters receiver b j scott was the second string slot receiver behind mike mccoy who is also on the outside making scott something of a starter as well
7683850 now obviously the team that we play is going to be a tremendous test for us
7683851 on special teams theyve got both their specialists back and theyve been very sound and solid on special teams
7683852 nick fanuzzi has been talking to us for several days and hes decided to transfer nick is a fine young man he did an outstanding job here for us we certainly hate to see him leave the program because every characteristic every value that we try to instill in the program he certainly represents hes a great team player and did a really good job here and were sorry to see him go but at the same time we wish him well and we will help him every way that we can get some place where he feels he has a better opportunity to compete we wish him and his family both well
7683853 first of all julio did an outstanding job coming in here in camp he worked hard in the summer he was in good shape hes been able to sustain his performance hes consistently made plays in practice as well as both scrimmages and i think probably after the first scrimmage it was pretty evident that he was going to have some role as one of the three receivers that we use quite a bit and i think this last week he certainly solidified his position as a starter he and mike mccoy have been our two best receivers throughout this camp in terms of consistency how theyve competed how many plays theyve made so those two guys deserve to be the starters and he probably solidified that position this past week in practice
7683854 were going to use him on kickoff returns some with javier arenas but i think we have some other guys that we can use in that role he does a really good job of fielding the ball on punts so he is the back up punt returner right now kareem jackson can do that very well marquis maze has worked back there we have other players such as b j scott who have worked back there and who we will continue to develop as returners but right now if we played the game today he would go in there as the back up punt return guy
7683855 i think the first thing thats important is when theyve struggled to run the ball and make big plays thats when theyve had the least amount of success offensively even though they are a very balanced offensive team and they have a tremendous ability to make big plays throwing the football the whole synergy of their teams seems to center around those guys making great plays theyre also good pass receivers so its not like theyre void in the passing game but i think its pretty easy to show the defensive players that if we stop the run in this game this is going to give us the best chance to be successful on defense i think our players have a tremendous amount of respect for both these guys and what they do well we just have to prepare to do a good job of keeping leverage and staying in our gaps and tackling well and those are the things that usually contribute to being able to stop good runners and you certainly cant make mental errors and be in the wrong place
7683856 the basic one issue going into this game that i still think that because mike johnson has had so much experience at tackle that if we lost a tackle in the game we would move him out to tackle rather than playing one of the young guys right now were really impressed with the development of the young players but to throw them in the frying pan right now we might be better served brian motley has made really good progress especially since weve kind of been playing him at guard rather than center so thats been helpful to him david ross has also done a good job at right guard so even though we hate moving the guys around in the offensive line i think if something happened to a tackle mike johnson would give us the best option at back up tackle right now at this point in the season
7683857 the chris jordan move has worked out really really well as well in terms of being his back up but we also could move cory reamer back to that position if we needed to but thats not something that we would plan on doing right now
7683858 hes done very well for us i cant predict the future in terms of what he might do or what he might be but hes certainly been a very consistent player hes got great quickness hes got good understanding hes a great competitor he works hard every day hes probably one of the hardest working guys we have on the team hes got good instincts hes playing multiple positions corner and star which takes a lot more focus on his part because they are completely different position but hes done an outstanding job for us and hopefully hell have a great year for us playing both as a returner and as a starter in the secondary
7683859 i dont have any experience dealing with it ive known him ever since hes been back at toledo but past my time at toledo i think one thing he does a really good job of is they have a tremendous amount of multiples in their offense they use a lot of different personnel groups a lot of different formations utilizes the players that he has and when he has good skill players that makes him even more effective but this team probably when you take the cumulative effect of all that they do and they do a good job of executing so im saying this in a positive way that the way they present themselves each week is always a challenge to the defense from an adjustment standpoint in terms of how they use their players and the formations they use the multiples of this team are probably as great as anybody that we play
7683860 well they use three wide receivers and four wide receivers a lot so that usually puts you in that circumstance and situation
7683861 we feel like we have four running backs that have really made good progress throughout the course of camp roy upchurch has had a really good camp and done a really good job all the way around as a player also as a special teams players hes probably one of our core guys that is outstanding and we have total faith trust and confidence in him to play even though hes listed a little below the rest terry grant and mark ingram mark ingram has probably been the surprise of all the young players in terms of his maturity as a player hes elusive he has speed but he has power and tremendous toughness and hes a good receiver so hes a very very good all around guy youve seen a lot of terry grant you know what he can do and glen coffee is mr consistency for us in terms of being able to do just about everything whether its being a good receiver being a good blocker and being decent with the ball in his hands so we dont have a third down back in that bunch we feel like several of those guys can play that role and we certainly need to figure out ways to use these guys throughout the course of the season because we feel good about that group of guys this year

7683896 every one from the french to the indonesians worry that where english goes america will follow

7683923 ron evans a former special branch driver and a convicted fraudster made a number of allegations in the book
7683924 if the incident had been reversed and it had been an atheist that had physically assaulted a theist for postering for a theist event that would easily be considered a hate crime and it frequently is this is the exact reverse scenario
7683925 they are treating it not as a hate crime but as a dispute that arose and led to an altercation
7683926 we dont have anything that suggests that as far as im aware of i know mr trottier was talking about that but certainly from what i see it doesnt look like it falls within what our policies and procedures define as a hate crime

7683930 i think i discovered the hard way the boundaries of freedom of speech
7683931 the fact that an atheist should fear for his well being while advertising for a university event that seeks to promote free inquiry is alarming and though i feared for my life briefly ive never felt as strong about my atheism my colleagues and i have only strengthened our resolve to forge ahead with our agenda to push for secularism science and freedom of thought

7683982 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
7683983 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
7683984 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder

7683989 there is an agreement between the two sides that there will be no foreign soldiers in iraq after 2011
7683990 what i understand is that the iraqi parliament will not pass this agreement
7683991 at this moment the iraqi government and parliament are not ready for such a deal which will face a lot of hurdles
7683992 we cannot sign an agreement unless it will preserve the sovereignty and national interests of iraq
7683993 any foreign soldiers on iraqi soil must have a specific time frame and not be open ended and iraqi blood must be protected and cannot grant full immunity
7683994 we assure you that nothing will be concealed and that we are at the beginning of the restoration of our full rights and sovereignty and the aspirations of the agreement and security arrangement will be presented to the parliament

7684110 i am very grateful to sen reid for all the opportunities he has given me but i also feel very honored that sen obama has selected me to manage his operations among hispanics
7684111 i share sen obamas vision of hope and change i have seen him work in the senate and i can vouch for his commitment to the issues that concern latin families he will bring the change that the country and the world need
7684112 i came here to say thank you for the support you gave me
7684113 now we come together here in denver to pledge our support and to unify behind the next president of the united states barack obama

7684122 the slowdown in housing starts has been very painful for the industry but it is the necessary medicine to work down the inventory of unsold homes
7684123 we need for sales to outpace production so we can work down these inventories thats what has to happen before we can get this thing back on track

7684131 my point is that state run institutions may take a catalyst role in pursuing these kinds of deals
7684132 i think that kdb might have considered forming and leading a consortium to buy lehman brothers but it appears burdensome for a state run institution to play a leading role in the purchase of a foreign company and take risks which may be more than financial

7684141 there will be some self explanatory scenes where the audience goes wow

7684160 if we didnt blog people would start to wonder about us
7684161 its a phenomenal promotion vehicle for a company or a great crisis tool or a great customer service tool
7684162 were trying to be as open and disclose as much information as we can
7684163 we gave a very loud voice to the people who said they werent happy about this decision
7684164 the blog at least helps people see how we think about it
7684165 thats the importance of public relations of advertising of everything we do
7684166 it is the virtual substitute for bill marriott visiting every hotel

7684176 in het begin schiep god de hemel en de aarde en god schiep de mens als zijn evenbeeld als evenbeeld van god schiep hij hem mannelijk en vrouwelijk schiep hij de mensen en god zegende hen
7684177 want god had de wereld zo lief dat hij zijn enige zoon heeft gegeven opdat iedereen die in hem gelooft niet verloren gaat maar eeuwig leven heeft god heeft zijn zoon niet naar de wereld gestuurd om een oordeel over haar te vellen maar om de wereld door hem te redden over wie in hem gelooft wordt geen oordeel uitgesproken maar wie niet in hem gelooft is al veroordeeld omdat hij niet wilde geloven in de naam van gods enige zoon
7684178 maar omdat god zo barmhartig is omdat de liefde die hij voor ons heeft opgevat zo groot is heeft hij ons die dood waren door onze zonden samen met christus levend gemaakt door zijn genade bent u nu immers gered dankzij uw geloof maar dat dankt u niet aan uzelf het is een geschenk van god

7684185 any story that affirms and redeems us is sacred sacred stories sweep away the stones shove aside the boulders and clear a path through the dense sometimes confusing thicket of experience they rekindle hope bring us fully into the flow of life and remind us that god is on the journey with us
7684186 we all need stories from our past when you dont know who you are who your people are where you come from or what is expected of you it is tough to make good choices
7684187 children need many stories to tell them who they are espeically the ones that show them where they belong in the cosmos what it means to be born male female african american asian irish italian christian jewish muslim it is never enough to just know in an abstract way that they are any of these things they need to feel it expeirence it know in their blood and bones what it means

7684197 one of the big muckety mucks at the magazine read the story and sent a note around the office saying the characters talked like dictionaries and the lot had whiskers on it like spanish moss hanging from a live oak in a louisiana bayou obviously a frustrated writer himself they sent the story back but someone had inadvertently left the note between the second and third pages of the story and he typed with two fingers and when he pounded his skin off he just kept hammering away on the blood spattered keys finally he sent the story back and it was accepted mostly he suspected because the editors at black mask were so disconcerted by the whole incident

7684211 painting isnt just the visual thing that reaches your retina its whats behind it i paint using designs colors lines and forms not to solicit the audiences ideas but because with these elements i can add more things in my work such as anger drama love pain an image and any other ideas i may have about space through the audiences eyes the painting takes on another form a new idea or emotion it doesnt matter if its similar or different from mine as long as it comes from the painting which has its own intensity and integrity

7684269 although the use of cannabinoids as systemic antibacterial agents awaits rigorous clinical trials their topical application to reduce skin colonization by mrsa seems promising

7684280 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
7684281 if they think a patient will gain an extra year of life but it will cost more than 20 000 they think it is not cost effective yet if the patient wants to pay for it themselves they are denied nhs treatment its an outrage
7684282 the nhs was built on the foundation of caring for the community it was designed to help those who needed help care for those who needed care and treat those who needed treatment
7684283 those basic principles have been lost as the government takes us down a dangerous path that can only be a catastrophic meltdown of the system
7684284 ten years ago waits of 18 months were not uncommon but by the end of this year no one should wait longer than 18 weeks none of this would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of everyone working into he nhs
7684285 burden the original decision of the woman and the physician
7684286 would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute
7684287 as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved
7684288 if this is a child then this would be an antiabortion statute
7684289 obama is a father of two young girls you can bet that attacks like that will get him or any father riled up that language seems to be way over the top his critics can paint him as a pro choice liberal thats fair but to go any further is really beyond the pale is obama really sinister a monster
7684290 there would be no chance for mr heim to take control of his fathers money as long as there is no hint or proof for mr heims demise there is no legal basis for german authorities to declare him dead
7684291 i do not see any way the kids can inherit the bank account of their father
7684292 as long as we dont know he is dead we have to assume hes still alive
7684293 we are staying tuned to his case as we are talking about very cruel crimes
7684294 we cant make torchwood toys we cant market to children because its an adult show maybe we could do torchwood sex toys i will suggest it
7684295 so you cant ask for a better endorsement than the government actually pushing your product
7684296 we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7684297 raised on the south side of chicago by a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me
7684298 it really shook him up he and i both essentially went through high school and college fantasizing about christina applegate so at first he was really excited like dude i totally get to see christina applegate nude but i guess the trauma of realizing that he drove a dagger into the collective heart of men everywhere by cutting off the very things that helped him through the rough spots of puberty was just too much for him
7684299 it started out kind of funny actually she was lying there on the table unconscious he was joking around check it out im finally getting to touch kelly bundys boobs but then you could almost see a kind of black cloud of realization drift over him as i handed him the scalpel and he remembered the task at hand when it was all said and done he just stood there for awhile then screamed what have i done and ran out of the room crying
7684300 i also discovered that the first piece of gta downloadable content will be arriving in november as well very little details were given but i was assured it would be sizeable bringing roughly 15 hours of additional play time

7684306 i cant say much about what happened while i was in the year 2028
7684307 i was in the garage supergluing a patch onto the snowmobiles vinyl seat which had a hole in it
7684308 the phone rang in the house so i sat the tube of superglue on the snowmobile seat and went inside when i came back out i tripped over some clutter and i fell across the snowmobile seat the weight of my body squeezed the tube of superglue and my pants and shirt became stuck to the seat so i wriggled out of all my clothing to free myself but in the process my butt got stuck to the seat as i struggled i accidentally hit the start button and the time machine took me 20 years into the future then things really got embarrassing
7684309 oh geez officer i never looked at it like that
7684310 i never friend anyone i dont know and blah blah blah
7684311 look at me world everyone wants to be my friend but i am so wonderful i can tell them to fuck off and shame them because everyone loves me
7684312 i really love wales so its great to have the chance to play at a big festival here instead of taking the motorway we took the road up through the brecon beacons i feel at home here
7684313 bryn has asked me to be involved for a few years but because of filming ive never been able to
7684314 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show
7684315 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7684316 we have provided daleks and components for the tardis in the past and i think a one off move to the screen would be amazing
7684317 it would take dr who to the next level so should be very successful
7684318 i think david tenant is an excellent doctor who is perfect for the part because he is eccentric and a nice guy too
7684319 ya abba ya bapa tidak ada yang mustahil bagi mu ambillah cawan ini dari pada ku tetapi janganlah apa yang aku kehendaki melainkan apa yang engkau kehendaki
7684320 janganlah padamkan roh dan janganlah anggap rendah nubuat nubuat ujilah segala sesuatu dan peganglah yang baik jauhkanlah dirimu dari segala jenis kejahatan semoga allah damai sejahtera menguduskan kamu seluruhnya dan semoga roh jiwa dan tubuhmu terpelihara sempurna dengan tak bercacat pada kedatangan yesus kristus tuhan kita
7684321 roh tuhan ada pada ku oleh sebab ia telah mengurapi aku untuk menyampaikan kabar baik kepada orang orang miskin dan ia telah mengutus aku untuk memberitakan pembebasan kepada orang orang tawanan dan penglihatan bagi orang orang buta untuk membebaskan orang orang yang tertindas untuk memberitakan tahun rahmat tuhan telah datang
7684322 if they convey that sense of passion and focus and they bring their own stories into it the issues will take care of themselves
7684323 but too often democrats think its an intellectual debate about policy nuances that aint it and thats why weve lost in the past sometimes weve got to make sure people understand who these people are
7684324 there are lots of writers who stay away from politics and who are concerned mostly with their own responses as a measure of general human response
7684325 ludicrous as it seems to us now won the governor generals award
7684326 itll be an adventure for the kids and we want it to be fun but at the same time the kids will hopefully take some things home and apply it and share it and create a lifestyle that will be more environmentally conscious
7684327 itll be an adventure for the kids and we want it to be fun but at the same time the kids will hopefully take some things home and apply it and share it and create a lifestyle that will be more environmentally conscious
7684328 with our current solid waste situation i think everyone realizes that something needs to be done and recycling is one of the easiest ways everyone can contribute
7684329 the contestants had to make artwork out of recyclable materials and they did an awesome job
7684330 the best thing people can do is sell the house fast

7684332 the process for me was pretty painless it happened so quickly
7684333 what continues to concern our market is as the mortgage industry continues to tighten their regulations even with borrowers with good credit everythings scrutinized
7684334 this is affecting the ability of lenders to close quickly and making borrowers more wary of the process
7684335 were curious to see how the economic stimulus plan is going to come into play and how it is going to help our market its up to all of us to educate the consumers on that

7684353 obama claims hes looking out for our families in an economic downturn but ask yourself this if obama cares so much about your family why doesnt he take care of his own family first
7684354 barack obama lives in this house image of obamas double storey house wants to live in this one image of the white house while his own brother lives in this one image of george obama in front of his tiny shack
7684355 when you have a brother who wants to be the number one most important person in the world it obviously gives you a lot of inspiration
7684356 there was a long time when i was just taking a break doing nothing trying to find myself and what i wanted to do
7684357 now i am more focused on my future and i can say it is because i understand more about things because of hearing what barack is doing

7684379 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7684380 i have never seen behavior of a parent like the behavior jerichos mother exhibited wednesday night
7684381 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7684382 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
7684383 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play

7684387 a small and intimate setting steps away from the ocean
7684388 maui is such a beautiful magical low key destination which reflects our relationship we could not resist
7684389 you start to concern yourself a bit but we have shown we have a good quality of player here
7684390 weve scored three offensive touchdowns in 10 quarters and we need to move to a situation where we have a more mobile quarterback
7684391 i feel that ive been victimised and that what happened to me was unacceptable
7684392 for me to be prevented from speaking to my players in that way was shambolic and i believe it was personal the referee has made a pigs ear of it and hes embarrassed himself
7684393 over the weekend i took a lot of calls from people in the game i respect and they all came to that conclusion that it was personal
7684394 as a result ive given it a lot of thought and maybe its time i moved on and got out while the goings good im serious about that
7684395 there have been a lot of things going through my head recently its not just the incident on saturday
7684396 ive been in football for 25 years ive made a good name for myself and i dont want to tarnish it at no point in my career have i felt as low as this this has ripped the guts out of me and thats why it might be better for me to try elsewhere i think ive earned my stripes and that id be ready for the championship
7684397 i complained about us having too many rookie refs and i stand by that
7684398 i cant manage a team in the champions league or in the premier league until i gain my uefa licence so why should these referees use spl matches as a learning tool
7684399 i need to make a stand for the benefit of scottish football and for the other young coaches who are making their way because what happened to me was vicious
7684400 we need referees and we appreciate the job they do
7684401 there will be some of them who view what ive said as an attack on them but id like to think that there will also be one or two who will admire me for wearing my heart on my sleeve
7684402 ive taken my punishment without complaint in the past but on this occasion ive done nothing wrong
7684403 it was a fairytale at luton because we were so unfancied especially in the final against arsenal
7684404 wed ridden our luck a little on the way to the final where we were paupers against the princes arsenal were supposed to run riot but we always believed we could upset them especially with players such as steve foster ricky hill and mick harford in our ranks added to that on the big day we worked our socks off
7684405 wednesday were in the old second division then and were written off by the bookies but we knew wed be a match for united
7684406 i was up against bryan robson and they had a string of other top class players such as gary pallister paul ince mark hughes and brian mcclair in their team
7684407 but despite united being proverbial red hot favourites we knew we were going places with excellent players in the side like striker david hirst he was in his swashbuckling prime alongside the likes of sheridan and nigel pearson
7684408 we were always really well supported with 40 000 plus hillsborough crowds and that win gave us a lot of momentum we won promotion and before we knew it we were on a par with united for a few years
7684409 its a competition thats been kind to me and i suppose i know a thing or two about being massive underdogs
7684410 were in a classic nothing to lose scenario so well be relaxed and can go and cause an upset ill tell my players anything is possible in this competition and that yes it can be done
7684411 im as ambitious as anyone and want to take this club into the championship he said but we know that will be difficult given the size of our crowds which are hardly comparable with some of the other league one sides such as leeds and leicester
7684412 but that certainly doesnt mean you cant be successful weve got a small but very high quality squad but so far our results havent matched our performances
7684413 like tony mowbray at west brom i try to get my team playing good football so this has the makings of being a really enjoyable tie
7684414 we dont want to be instrumental in overthrowing any government we dont have any such intentions
7684415 this organization is a terrorist organization and created mayhem against public life
7684416 i think at the moment they definitely have the upper hand and we need to do something better
7684417 we are neither registered nor do we have any bank accounts
7684418 in the past more than 100 kids are dead and every day we hear about a shooting
7684419 its been ignored in the past and if people from south vancouver go further to go to the city hall we can change it
7684420 quero falar com paulo bento at final da semana ainda n o o fiz porque n o arranjei o n mero dele

7684428 you are as bad as the senegalese only increasing your increments by mere pennies
7684429 but i am senegalese i lived there for over 2 years and became a master bargainer
7684430 oy what are you doing in there dont you know that caves are dark and dangerous places to be avoided at all costs youd get out of there if you knew what was good for you
7684431 its not dark when you have a flashlight its actually quite bright in here its not dangerous either so long as you have a light source
7684432 are you mad caves are dark and dangerous didnt you hear about barley chriggs he went into a cave and got himself killed do you want to be killed just like him
7684433 barley chriggs didnt have a light source though did he
7684434 thats not the point the point is that he entered that dark cave and he died and so will you
7684435 not likely like i said its not dark in here when you have a light and barley didnt have a light so ill be fine
7684436 no you wont you are going to die because caves are dark and so many people not just barely have been just as deceived as you currently are you need to get out of that cave
7684437 deceived am i why dont you come down into the cave and show me why its so dangerous and dark when you have a light source it is not dark and not dangerous like you claim
7684438 im not going down there with you flaming madman thats where barley chriggs went and im nothing like that raving lunatic but i can see you are utterly deceived if you think its not dark and dangerous down there therefore i want nothing to do with you
7684439 nothing to do with me aye what are you going on about youre standing on the outside of the cave telling me that the cave is dark and dangerous while im standing in the cave and can clearly see that it is bright because of my light source and clearly not dangerous are you having a laugh
7684440 the only laugh im having is that you are so completely deceived that you actually think it is bright down there you are a raving looney
7684441 well im standing here looking at the brightness of the cave because of my light source why would i lie about that it makes no sense
7684442 you make no sense because you are deceived sooner or later you are going to drag more people into the cave with you is that honestly what you want to have a bunch of people lost or dead because of your tomfoolery
7684443 if people want to come into the cave then i see no problem with that so long as they bring a light source its actually quite safe if you have a light come and see
7684444 what it is safe and bright if you disagree then please come show me how it is dark and dangerous
7684445 when kenny got the call to go back to rangers he would have worked out the hassles and the problems and the difficulties involved
7684446 i dont think for one second he came back naively not knowing what to expect when youve kissed the badge of celtic football club and then join rangers its a no brainer
7684447 there will obviously be sections of the support who will keep that in their minds but kenny is a strong character hell ignore everything and concentrate on helping rangers win the match if he could get the winner against celtic then that would help the matter but hell have great support from within the club
7684448 its very hard to take yourself too seriously when you look at the world from outer space

7684464 political business or technology reasons there is always a time when i have to return when we look ten years into the future maybe yes i may well end up spending more time on the metal gear series
7684465 in mgs4 yes i put everything in the cut sequences which i kind of regret to some extent because maybe there is a new approach which i should think about
7684466 lack a kind of deeper storyline or the expression of the feelings of the characters
7684467 the people hes been around in his playing and coaching career give him new ideas to bring to the team and im very anxious to see him work on the field
7684468 ignoring the committees decision is only one in a growing list of ways the white house and its allies have politicized judicial selection
7684469 he did everything for her he created her career he handpicked her to go to the texas supreme court when he was trying to take over the texas supreme court
7684470 he was looking for people to groom and raise money for and have in his pipeline rove went and plucked her out of obscurity she was an unknown lawyer in houston
7684471 rove signed on giving the candidate the seal of approval from the states corporate establishment
7684472 he did everything he needed to to promote her hes the guy who brought her name up to bush for the federal appointment
7684473 is the latest reward of a partnership that began a dozen years ago when a prominent texas conservative introduced her to karl rove who was at the time a political consultant and emerging kingmaker

7684476 people in the past didnt think the same way as we do today so what you might find might not be what you expected dont get surprised
7684477 even before the convention and even before the complete reconciliation that we need
7684478 the nomination is decided we have a vice president were going to work together and go forward
7684479 but to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7684480 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7684481 we are going into the future what did i walk into a time capsule
7684482 democrats will leave this denver convention unified organized and stronger than ever to take america in a new direction with barack obama and joe biden as president and vice president

7684495 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
7684496 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
7684497 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
7684498 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
7684499 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
7684500 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
7684501 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
7684502 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
7684503 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
7684504 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
7684505 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
7684506 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that

7684508 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
7684509 knowing they will have a first lady who understands their challenges
7684510 back in june and july i truly thought he was going to blow mccain out of the water and carry 30 or 40 states
7684511 what has happened is that republicans mccain specifically have really twisted his great charisma this electric personality to discredit his ability his experience his capacity his judgment i fear they are about to do to him what they did to gore
7684512 obama has got to do some things that will shore up his ability to lead not just to charm but to lead theyve got to give credibility to his understanding of foreign policy his ability to deal with tough people and tough questions and his ability to be more explicit and convincing on his health care policies and energy policies
7684513 normally i might say these conventions are not so important but i dont think thats the case this year
7684514 i think in the case of mccain they need to frame him
7684515 viscerally my feeling is theyve got to come back at him hard
7684516 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
7684517 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
7684518 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
7684519 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
7684520 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
7684521 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
7684522 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
7684523 ive got my doubts but i like what he says and theres something about him i trust im going to take a chance on him
7684524 the survey suggests that this the economy is an umbrella issue covering many other concerns including those relative to health care
7684525 if i were designing a system from scratch i would probably go ahead with a single payer system
7684526 given that a lot of people work for insurance companies a lot of people work for hmos youve got a whole system of institutions that have been set up
7684527 i believe that every american has the right to affordable health care i believe that the millions of americans who cant take their children to a doctor when they get sick have that right we now face an opportunity and an obligation to turn the page on the failed politics of yesterdays health care debates its time to bring together businesses the medical community and members of both parties around a comprehensive solution to this crisis and its time to let the drug and insurance industries know that while theyll get a seat at the table they dont get to buy every chair
7684528 and nothing illustrates obamas failure so far to put some meat on his campaign than his inability to nail mccain on this issue and to speak specifically and powerfully about his own excellent plan which he announced early in the campaign
7684529 he was not as we all know the most ambitious student at the time but he was a person who was eager for knowledge
7684530 he would always tell me that he was going to be in public office i think he said he was going to be a senator and was going to try to become president
7684531 i rode down to delaware with my mom and dad and my brother and sister and it was not a good experience it was very difficult
7684532 bad things happen millions of people had it worse than me get up and keep moving i kept telling myself and be alive
7684533 he has grown in wisdom and knowledge as hes grown in age ive heard him described as the smartest man in the united states senate and theres a great deal to be said for that
7684534 when there are lots of competing males trying to fertilise the eggs of females males produce larger more competitive sperm that live for longer
7684535 similarly when females detect that there are too many males competing for her eggs too many sperm can kill the eggs of some organisms the females play hard to get producing smaller eggs that are harder for searching sperm to find
7684536 these changes make sense if youre stuck to a rock like sea squirts are
7684537 if you cant run away from a highly competitive environment you must therefore make your gametes more competitive in order to get a higher chance of successfully reproducing
7684538 we manipulated adult densities in the field by placing either one low density or 15 high density sea squirts in a cage for one month
7684539 this research tells us a little as to how sex evolved in the first place
7684540 specifically it gives us some insight into why sperm are so tiny and males make millions of them whereas female eggs are much larger and are produced in fewer numbers
7684541 because these organisms reproduce by the ancestral mode of reproduction it gives us an indication as to how competition between males led to all sorts of reproductive strategies including the one used by humans internal fertilisation
7684542 moreover since bill is not and has not been for years gainfully employed he will be scrounging around for cash everywhere but that wouldnt be exactly new would it
7684543 theyre in a different time than the rest of the guys because they could only be out there in helmets and we were out there in full pads today
7684544 hes still trying to get his feet back under him
7684545 im worried about the next day of practice right now
7684546 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
7684547 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
7684548 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
7684549 i have to put everything on the table i dont think its a good alternative but if they can prove that it is and they want to pay royalties to the taxpayer let us use those royalties to invest in renewable energy resources then we have something to talk about
7684550 oh were going to have elections were going to have them by october theyre going to be inclusive theyre going to be transparent theyre going to be fair and this or that
7684551 were not staying around for ever for you to get around to this you have to do it now overdue
7684552 help me out here madame speaker when does life begin
7684553 the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose roe v wade talks about very clear definitions of when the child first trimester certain considerations second trimester not so third trimester theres very clear distinctions
7684554 and if that in fact is a a a a good alternative then that is something that we should do
7684555 if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us
7684556 stands alone right now in the world in terms of power
7684557 don is one of the top names among young evangelicals
7684558 it could be good for the nation if other corporate companies could emulate what standard bank has done to work with undp on an issue that is of national and global concern
7684559 the presidents partner the first lady in the twentieth century
7684560 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7684561 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7684562 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7684563 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7684564 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7684565 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7684566 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7684567 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7684568 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
7684569 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7684570 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7684571 there used to be an organization for people who believed in a truly limited government limited taxes limited spending limited interference in individual lives and limited intervention in foreign affairs that organization was known as the republican party but the only one of those beliefs that still motivates the g o p establishment is limited taxes
7684572 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7684573 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7684574 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7684575 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7684576 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7684577 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7684578 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7684579 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7684580 the systems that generate elections and earthquakes are complex systems
7684581 they are not predictable by simple equations but after coarse graining averaging they become predictable
7684582 we didnt look at it as reagan versus carter or republicans versus democrats or liberals versus conservatives rather we looked at elections as stability versus upheavals
7684583 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
7684584 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
7684585 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
7684586 a religious war going on in our country for the soul of america it is a cultural war
7684587 hello george this is ron reagan id like to go over to the convention and announce that youre my choice for vice president if thats alright with you
7684588 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
7684589 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7684590 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7684591 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7684592 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7684593 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
7684594 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
7684595 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7684596 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7684597 family is shaping the content of the entire day and thats not been done before
7684598 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7684599 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7684600 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7684601 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7684602 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to
7684603 make people aware of the kind of sacrifice barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope
7684604 except in three cases that of their wives their daughters and their girlfriends
7684605 nancy unwilling to stand up for womens pro choice beliefs
7684606 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7684607 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7684608 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7684609 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7684610 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7684611 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7684612 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
7684613 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7684614 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7684615 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7684616 whether someone helps win you an election i think is kind of a side benefit you certainly want to pick someone who doesnt hurt you
7684617 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7684618 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7684619 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7684620 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7684621 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7684622 there comes a time when youve got to go to the barricades and let it rip both gore and kerry were eviscerated on personal grounds by their opponents campaigns
7684623 it is really important that obama responds to the charge that he is elitist democrats dont want the criticisms to take hold and affect public opinion
7684624 i sometimes struggle just to get the essentials you know the milk the bread the eggs
7684625 how can john mccain fix the economy when he doesnt think its broken
7684626 just because the other side is fighting dirty it doesnt mean we have to stoop to their level
7684627 if we are going to win this election then we have to live up to our promise that we represent a new kind of politics
7684628 these attacks can be unpleasant and a cause of anxiety but this exchange is important its very informative for voters the american public needs to know not only if obama can take a punch but if he can throw one the image of obama is that he is cerebral he needs to show that he has a gut instinct and that he can be a street fighter
7684629 heres one house american cant afford to let john mccain move into
7684630 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
7684631 the boston tea party supports reducing the size scope and power of government at all levels and on all issues
7684632 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7684633 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7684634 who will be the new vice president whoever you want thats who
7684635 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore
7684636 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7684637 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7684638 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7684639 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7684640 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7684641 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy

7684645 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7684646 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7684647 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7684648 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7684649 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7684650 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7684651 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7684652 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7684653 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7684654 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7684655 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7684656 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7684657 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7684658 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7684659 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7684660 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7684661 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7684662 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7684663 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7684664 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7684665 se o senhor n o parar de fumar o senhor vai morrer
7684666 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7684667 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7684668 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7684669 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7684670 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7684671 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7684672 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7684673 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7684674 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7684675 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7684676 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7684677 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7684678 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7684679 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7684680 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7684681 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7684682 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7684683 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7684684 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7684685 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7684686 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7684687 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7684688 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7684689 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7684690 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7684691 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7684692 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7684693 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7684694 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7684695 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7684696 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7684697 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7684698 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7684699 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7684700 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7684701 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7684702 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7684703 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7684704 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7684705 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7684706 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7684707 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7684708 franco battiato was an italian pop singer who for a span in the 70s made a string of very experimental albums battiato on all of these titles set out to create completely new musical forms and evolved from strange pop and rock realms to systemic and minimalist music before returning to pop music
7684709 al gore took a big risk when he called on us to get 100 of our electricity from cheap clean sources within 10 years
7684710 america must commit to producing 100 of our electricity from cheap clean renewable energy sources like solar and wind within 10 years
7684711 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7684712 but if we grab hold of that common thread and pull it hard all of these complex problems begin to unravel and we will find that were holding the answer to all of them right in our hand
7684713 let he who is without sin cast the first stone
7684714 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
7684715 the way to bring gas prices down is to end our dependence on oil and use the renewable sources that can give us the equivalent of 1 per gallon gasoline
7684716 it is of no little significance that the ipccs value for the coefficient in the co2 forcing equation depends on only one paper in the literature that its values for the feedbacks that it believes account for two thirds of humankinds effect on global temperatures are likewise taken from only one paper and that its implicit value of the crucial parameter depends upon only two papers one of which had been written by a lead author of the chapter in question and neither of which provides any theoretical or empirical justification for a value as high as that which the ipcc adopted
7684717 the solar fraud why solar energy wont run the world
7684718 why isnt algore fighting back on bad zoning policies that limit or even prohibit people from installing solar panels on their roofs
7684719 i was recently at the launch of the new high speed rail link from london to paris passengers boarded at eleven in the morning and arrived right in the heart of paris just 180 minutes later as the train slipped through the autumn countryside of southern england and northern france people talked face to face read the morning papers and ate and drank in comfort and quiet the people on eurostars tread lightly might not have known it but they were also doing the planet a favour each passenger going from london to paris by train is creating just a tenth of the climate changing emissions of someone making the journey by aeroplane for me that day was a moment of inspiration a reminder of how humanitys technical brilliance plus a dose of common sense can take us literally to places we once thought impossible this book is about a better life its about turning the challenge of climate change into a way forward for us all and coming out on the other side healthier fitter and happier and because we need to do something now rather than in 40 years time its about making that journey at high speed our starting point is the science whats happening to our world and why the story has been brilliantly told by others notably by the nobel prize winning scientists who make up the intergovernmental panel on climate change and former us vice president al gore we explain some key facts about whats going on and whats likely to happen if we let it chapters 1 to 3 before moving on to the big question what are we going to do about it imagine a home that you dont need to heat because the sun does it for you imagine your fridge running on the neverending power of the tides that beat at britains shores imagine buses so reliable and clean you actually want to leave the car at home imagine the end of fuel poverty better food fewer traffic jams and happier neighbourhoods imagine a new economic wave new jobs in new industries supplying whole new markets all this happens to be possible because the things that we need to do to stop climate change read about them in chapters 4 to 9 will also improve our quality of life the solutions are out there but whos going to make them happen from fitting low energy light bulbs to flying less and recycling more there are many things each of us can do lots of practical information in chapters 7 to 9 among the green selfhelp manuals around encouraging each of us to do our bit to take the stress off the planet few make this key point that even if each of us were to deal with the environmental impact of our home our travel and our shopping it would still not be enough yes i can turn off the lights but i dont run the polluting power station that makes the electricity i can use my car less but why should i if some gas guzzler is allowed to take up my space on the road report this comment posted by squarehead on jul 24 2008 3 36 am current rating not yet rated 1 poor i can insulate my loft and even install solar panels on my house but what about my neighbour who cant afford it and what about my kids school which uses far more energy than my family does most climate changing pollution is outside my direct control greenhouse gases are just part of how things work like the way food is produced public institutions are run our roads are built i can directly control only about a third of my own tiny share of britains carbon footprint someone has got to change the way things work on a big scale and fast in fact the science implies that the uk should cut its emissions of the main greenhouse gas carbon dioxide by at least 80 per cent by the middle of this century when you think about how dependent we are now on oil gas and coal this looks like a huge task whos going to do it as consumers we have a certain amount of muscle and we should use it nagging our shops and services for greener stuff helps to push them in the right direction being an ethical consumer also tells the politicians that were ready for change but were not just shoppers each of us is part of a family neighbourhood or town we can talk to our friends and family get things done in our clubs societies schools unions and associations to reduce their carbon footprint most important we have rights and a voice as citizens we can tell our elected representatives from the town hall to parliament that we want a greener life they should get on and make it easier for all of us to do the low carbon thing governments can ban cars with poor fuel consumption set tough standards for products and provide alternatives to flying governments can structure markets to make companies innovate obliging local authorities to specify clean green energy for all new homes for example would create a huge business opportunity and as other countries have shown do a lot to cut emissions but this scale of change will only happen if enough of us ask for it when i joined the staff of friends of the earth in 1990 one of the first things i did was to promote our findings on how halting deforestation would be good for the climate since then we have notched up a series of wins for the environment we have put green issues firmly on the political agenda sought broad changes to the way our economy works and persuaded politicians to take real steps to protect our communities and future generations and weve always done it with strong public backing the reason you have doorstep recycling is because thousands of people like you asked for it at about the time this book will first appear in the shops a new climate change act will be passing into uk law this will be the worlds first legally binding national framework for longterm reductions in greenhouse gas emissions if the government has done its job properly the law will set a target for cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 80 per cent by 2050 including emissions from aviation and shipping friends of the earths big ask campaign and the voices of hundreds of thousands of people have been crucial in securing this breakthrough it shows how powerful we are when we act together in all my years working on the environment i have never been so excited about the changes that were about to see changes that people like you have made possible theres a lot do but we are making real progress the book in your hands is one of the next steps it is the perfect companion for making the most of the opportunity created by the new climate change act the solutions are out there get on board and make them live none of us can deal with climate change alone we have to act together how can i stop climate change i cant but we can

7684787 this is a non cooperation movement as well as a civil disobedience movement this is why all the hill people must change the number plates by monday
7684788 many of us are also walking to our offices as and when possible
7684789 this is a clear government policy which we are strictly adhering to
7684790 we will organise pickets and if we spot such vehicles both private and government we will deflate the tyres seize the documents and send them to the central committee
7684791 under instructions from the central committee we distributed gl registrations to private and government vehicles today we have made it mandatory for vehicles originally registered in darjeeling to carry gl number plates in gorkhaland
7684792 several youths owning motorcycles however came forward on their own to express solidarity with our movement and took the gl registrations from us
7684793 the serial numbers are different for different locations those registering from our camp formed by the sukna and tindharia branches will get 02c the last four numbers would remain unaltered that is as it was in the wb plate
7684794 we had rung them up and told them to get the gl plates they are yet to come
7684795 we have six vehicles in sukna and some others in nearby ranges like panighata bamanpokhri sevoke and tenth mile

7684808 yeah there should be a time limit i think maliki probably realizes barack obama is going to win and that theyre gonna have to start paying some of the bills themselves most americans are going to feel its about time most americans except john mccain

7684827 bihar as a first step may try to procure these equipment for immediate plugging of a breach in an embankment during floods
7684828 the barrage is now merely 12km from the breach spot given the kosis characteristic fury it is not impossible that the in spate and marauding river breaches the barrage itself if that happens it will be a devastation of an unprecedented scale the surging waters of the roaring giant that kosi has become would simply drown huge portions of supaul saharsa araria madhepura katihar and purnea districts and these would include human settlements
7684829 if kathmandu was keen and so was new delhi some semblance of forward movement on the promise would have happened by now do not forget that the promised dams are not just about kosi but over a dozen rivers that enter bihar from upside nepal all eager to meet the ganga nothing is more devastating that surging river waters
7684830 for gods sake please dont call it a flood the description is not just wrong but it is also fraught with potentially serious consequences for those who view it just as a routine visitation
7684831 so far there is just one million cusecs of water in the area but the discharge in kosi in that part of its catchment area can cross nine million cusecs by the october 15 and that is the scale of devastation we are looking at
7684832 i have spent my last four days trying to ram home the point that people must leave for safer and higher places
7684833 what they are not able to appreciate that we may have god forbid a situation where water may submerge even the pucca structures i don t blame them but they need to understand it fast there is no time left even today there has been rain in the kosi region and nepal and that is a bad omen people must heed the warning there is still time nahin to bhagwan hi malik hai

7684844 obamas problem is that hes lived in the world of beating the democratic establishment for so long its hard to transition to being the democratic establishment
7684845 theres the pursuit of the last white man standing in pennsylvania
7684846 a continuous police build up that concerns me since then
7684847 all these horses on the mall its like st petersburg 1905

7684850 radicals of the 60s dont get credit for what has happened for good in the democratic party
7684851 all this talk about 68 because we have a fascination with round numbers

7684861 and thats why i walked back over to him to specifically ask him what did he say and if he had said doubting thomas that was his time to say it then
7684862 the president owes del marie an apology and he owes all the delegates an apology
7684863 if we can get hillary clinton supporters to support barack obama the ones who still arent the ones who are holding out he will win

7684890 lo que ha ocurrido hoy en santa cruz es el inicio de lo que parece ser un plan una escalada de actos violentos que ya lo han anunciado algunos dirigentes c vicos para el martes 29 de la pr xima semana convocando a un paro y dijeron que lo haran respetar por la fuerza de la violencia
7684891 los discapacitados fueron utilizados como punta de lanza de una movilizaci n y por detr s de ellos ven an los c vicos diputados de podemos y unionistas
7684892 estaban azuzando la violencia para agredir a una de las instituciones m s importantes del pa s como es la polic a nacional

7684907 we joined the coalition with full sincerity for the restoration of democracy unfortunately all the promises were not honored
7684908 ive been in this business for 30 years and i have never seen anything of this magnitude before
7684909 there is more to this picture than fewer miles driven we have changed the way we drive and hopefully on a permanent basis
7684910 im really mindful of the speed limit signs now because i know that is a lot slower than the way i normally drive
7684911 anyone who loves jay dee is going to flip out when they hear how young illa j represents for the yancey family for over a decade these beats have been waiting in the vault for this moment its like jay dee made these tracks with an extrasensory purpose so that illa j could rap and sing over them when the time was right well its that time its the yancey boys baby
7684912 i was trying to stay focussed as well as i could
7684913 its a matter of how fresh i can stay for this tournament
7684914 i want to get some rest and make sure i dont practise as much as i did in beijing i need to save some energy for this tournament
7684915 there have been some great performances from a lot of players this year but we dont have anything like justine who was able to win every single tournament
7684916 in the first set i felt like i was playing against a wall
7684917 in the second set i told myself to just play your game and dont give up
7684918 i may be a womanizer unable to balance a budget but let me tell you about my opponents pedophilia and crack addictions
7684919 what are the advantages and disadvantages of being a woman in your position
7684920 the advantages are that were naturally nurturing and were naturally multi tasking
7684921 the disadvantages are less now than they used to be
7684922 you can make the pictures you want to make which you cant do as a studio head
7684923 as a studio head theres always a fear that the woman is going to be softer in her choices than a man that shell choose with her heart rather than her head
7684924 the disadvantages women dont play team sports right so they get knocked they get hurt they take it personally they get sore they dont know how to come back after getting knocked off their feet
7684925 these are things men learn from being in the fray from playing team sports like rugby football women have to learn how to get up and smile that wasnt an enemy it was another player on the field its attrition that kills more women thats not a feminine feel then you have to do that and look good on a date
7684926 not in every choice its hard if you want it all if you want a career and a husband and a family its hard to find a husband who will share every aspect of parenthood with you women carry a great burden over motherhood
7684927 if you dont marry young the good guys tend to be gone the pickings are thin afterwards but not for men the world really celebrates the successful man the unmarried man but it doesnt celebrate successful women who are not married
7684928 men are acculturated both for marriage and for success so there are no hard choices for men to make i mean there are hard choices but there are no sophie choices for men
7684929 the life of a woman carrying the mans burdens without a man is not impossible it can be done but its a hard one they have no reinforcement for it from their families from the culture but there are rewards for it it is rewarding for the culture to tell you what they find interesting that meeting was fun a lot of men dont get that back
7684930 have you had to sacrifice work to be a good mother
7684931 only in the beginning of my career before all these great mothers and great fathers in the movie industry i was a young mother when i went to pta meetings at the center for early education id sneak out of my office to go there i couldve gotten in trouble then with my office they didnt approve of it at all whereas now you can take a whole day off its nothing you can take your kids to the office none of that existed when i was first raising oly i had to sneak around i had no reinforcement the moms at school were not nice to me because all the dads at school were at work thats something id like to do a television show about
7684932 the proof is in the pudding in that oly and i are best friends but clearly the marriage suffered and that had consequences on oly
7684933 i didnt go out i gave up a good portion of my social life in my thirties so i could be home during the week with oly for dinner i didnt introduce him to any of my boyfriends i got engaged once that was the only person he met
7684934 i did the best i could you figure it out as you go
7684935 what have been your high points and low points as a producer
7684936 the high point that i always refer to is the venice film festival for fisher king
7684937 i felt like i understood the direction of my future career
7684938 going to the golden globes with nora for sleepless in seattle because she was my best friend
7684939 every movie high point is the first day of production
7684940 when little movie magic moments like that happen on fisher king when we had a magic moment shooting the jump in scene when the grips were able to jerry rig the dolly on bungee cords
7684941 for me its not the moments of opening a movie like how to lose a guy in 10 days for 26 5 million i love the exhilarating movie making moments when something is laid out the way you wrote it and you can shoot the whole movie in one town and you never have to move
7684942 or youre shooting the fisher king and youre shooting a series of lights and you think it is going to be a disaster but it turns out better than you couldve imagined
7684943 power highs the high of 30 million openings cant compete with that
7684944 its not calm happiness its a jangly high everybody is being nice to you even though you know they dont like you just what i wrote in my book dont get addicted to the high numbers dont get addicted to the low numbers just move on
7684945 but those things that happen on set theyre like the highs you get from love they dont have the jangly effect
7684946 i work on my movies for an average of ten years i dont write any of them off
7684947 which of your movies were you there for the origin of the idea
7684948 i made up the sixties the siege hope floats contact one fine day this is my life flashdance interstellar i wrote the story how to lose it all fisher king i found the book someone like you i found the book
7684949 i would but first id have to get myself out of all the material im in right now i dont have an auteurs burning desire to direct
7684950 do producers get typecast too do you get tagged as the chick flick girl
7684951 a lot of people forget the siege and contact and the other movies ive made
7684952 mine take a long time i dont condescend to the genre when the genres done right the actors will come
7684953 if you can get three quadrants you can have a hit if you just think formula nobody wants to see them and nobody wants to be in them to me thats something in the zeitgeist i remain a journalist in that way
7684954 which of your movies would you call a creative success
7684955 how to lose a guy the siege hope floats contact one fine day sleepless in seattle fisher king adventures in babysitting flashdance the sixties but that was tv
7684956 what does it take for you to fall in love with a script
7684957 to be moved by it to laugh or cry im not dark im not consumed by dark things i would not have recognized the usual suspects or true romance i love batman but im not going to make dark movies im not a vampire girl im not going to make horror movies i could recognize a good thriller im not going to recognize the matrix i have to recognize something in my wheelhouse it has to be hilarious it has to have pathos it has to be something i know i can cast it has to be fresh i have to be riveted galvanized moved i have to be taken by the gut i so rarely find that so thats why i find ideas in the culture and hire great writers to write that or find books i remember reading the fisher king and bursting into tears at the staircase scene i have the most spectacular script about autism right now im going to try to get it made
7684958 exactly its like rainman its a buddy comedy thats what i said about the fisher king dont worry its a buddy comedy
7684959 you have so much energy right now how much are you like this
7684960 until i pass out thats probably why i get migraines too
7684961 how did you feel when buzz magazine named you one of the top ten bullies in hollywood
7684962 it made me aware that i mustve been tough on a couple of employees and it made me aware not to be tough on any employee i certainly didnt think it defined me and i was sad i was on the list but it made me conscious and anything that makes me conscious is ultimately good
7684963 she makes attilla the hun look humane i cant think of a more despised female producer by those who work with her mention lyndas name and you get a chorus of boos at paramount
7684964 there are reasons why blind quotes are frowned upon in journalism
7684965 its just the most radical thing ive heard its absurd and it discredits most of the page and youre better than that few producers stayed as long as i did at paramount every studio ive worked for ive stayed eight years i left there with great relations with brad westin and brad grey
7684966 i was never celia brady the non deplume of a notorious hollywood gossip columnist for spy magazine
7684967 when i do journalism i do journalism i write for huffpo ive written for harpers i had a column in new york magazine i wrote a book i have a book contract with simon amp schuster i had no reason to do that kind of alt journalism i came from the new york times the first thing i did here was to write for harold hayes and new west magazine he taught me how to write he taught me how to be a journalist why i would go from that to be celia brady and diss my friends that kind of schadenfreude that i inspired when i came to town as a person who was learning her job and a former journalist and a kind of sociologist a sociologist is not a secret gossip ive never been a secret gossip when i gossip its with a small group of friends i really care about the people i care about
7684968 so every single aspect of what was written up to this point was written with so much unbelievable contempt that it shocked me
7684969 the kind of behavior you describe isnt tolerated the town is too small the work is too hard the job is too hard there are too many people to collaborate with there are too many personalities so if what you describe were true i couldnt have survived this long i couldnt have been at paramount that long eight years i couldnt have been at fox for six years i couldnt have made movies with so many different personalities my job is to blend those personalities and come up with a compromise that works for the filmmakers and the studios
7684970 it was philosophy i know absolutely nothing about psychology particularly male psychology i know a lot about female psychology which is why ive done so many chick flicks but im really lousy with male psychology except when im helping my girlfriends but im terrible with my own
7684971 i studied the philosophy of science at columbia and thats the streak that you see in the science pictures i do
7684972 i did have the time of my life at the new york times
7684973 thats the kind of nonsense thats trailed me for years that i would at the new york times take a call from warren cowan honestly
7684974 the saddest thing about the david mcclintick book is that it says that the david begelman story by lucian truscott thats was why i left the paper
7684975 david got a job with simon amp schuster in los angeles and i either had to move with david or stay i had a baby i moved
7684976 peter guber offered me a job i ended up developing stories that became flashdance clue contact and taking care of my baby
7684977 david was lovely he later wrote a wonderful review of my book we later became friends
7684978 why did you not mention the david begelman episode in your book
7684979 it was a hollywood memoir it really began when i came out to hollywood i wasnt that personal about my private life i got married i got divorced few details it was a memoir about surviving in hollywood with some degree of integrity in tact
7684980 i developed the novel with carl when he moved out here i told him to start writing a novel because i would make it into a movie we all developed the novel we did the treatment together he sold it to simon amp schuster
7684981 warner brothers had me develop the script for contact i work shopped it with director george miller and carl and with various scientists and theologians we did hours of workshops over three years robert zemeckis made a movie close to that script
7684982 carl and i knew each other since around 1975 he met his wife annie on the same night as i met him and nora ephron the same party
7684983 again youre going to drive me to drinking with this come on god lighten up a few days for the birthday boys jesus come on talk to your dad for me okay thanks
7684984 emmiline vance you come down this instance its raining and im getting my new shoes wet

7684998 this is a potion to prevent the flu or a virus if you want it nod if you dont youll suffer
7684999 you really should stop acting like a brat and act like an adult
7685000 if you want to get better then youll start by treating me with respect second youll act like a young lady and thirdly until then you dont leave this room and trust me im very accomplished at waiting
7685001 next time that finger goes up youll pull back a nub
7685002 first of all and foremost i had and have no intention of sexually assaulting you i removed your wet clothes to help prevent you from getting sick second i will respect you if you respect me i dont want your grandmother
7685003 and the headmaster disappointed at us for acting like children were both reasonable adults we can manage to get along finally
7685004 youre not a man so you dont shave a lady like you doesnt cut the grass with this instrument because it is a harsh cut so the only reason coming to my mind in particular
7685005 miss vance theres no other reason that you would have this if in fact you are harming yourself you need to be helped surely there is a reason that causing you to inflict pain upon yourself
7685006 do you think that i would approach you first if i didnt care to know
7685007 miss vance i know what its like to be troubled with ah emotions i deal with students nine months out of the year though i am not the teacher they come to for comfort i am however aware of when they are troubled
7685008 why did you go in my bag anyway you have no right to do that
7685009 when i was looking for you a cloak of some sort i manage to cut my finger on your little ah razor

7685049 i think this convention is going to bring together all delegates from around the country both the hillary clinton delegates and the barack obama delegates
7685050 ive seen a lot of unity here were hearing rumors that hillary is going to release her delegates to vote for barack obama which i think would be a strong move to show the unity im feeling here
7685051 the best thing any clinton supporter can do to continue to carry the banner for what she believes is important in america is to support our nominee for president barack obama

7685181 when harry potter happened my first thought was to be slightly miffed yknow whoever this rowling is has cracked it and it should have been me but of course i was a huge benefactor from it because rowling changed the entire industry and changed the world of childrens books
7685182 it took me a very very long time to get established and become well known
7685183 i have to fight harder to hang on to my enthusiasm and my excitement writing is still a huge pleasure for me but if ever it doesnt become that if it becomes a chore if it becomes you know the demands of walker books for another book i think that would be the time to stop
7685184 was a disaster everybody hated it and in fact the last james bond books all of them have a sort of a tired desperate quality as he tries to avoid the formula that has made the earlier bond books so great one after another because they dont deliver
7685185 unfortunately i had to come clean in the end i couldnt sign the contracts under a false name but it was a good piece of work and it was partly good because it wasnt written by me
7685186 i obviously didnt have a particularly happy childhood despite being very upper class and privileged and wealthy and such and when i hear myself talking about an unhappy childhood i have to remind myself that many people would kill to have a childhood like mine therefore why in the hell should i complain im not really complaining though im just merely pointing out that my writing began because i was in a foul brutal sadistic school where i was being psychologically trounced and crushed by a collection of perverts and sadists who these days wouldnt get a look in at school quite right too one of the ways i think society has improved is in childrens rights to not be buggered and bullied so my whole writing began as an escape from that and the tension weird family weird parents weird upbringing foul school and stories and books as the lifeline out of it i guess it has continued throughout my life that ive never been particularly comfortable with who i am in the sense of the posh accent and the jewish background and all the rest of it that the stories are always about escaping from who and where and what i am and remain so to this day theres a sense of desperation to the writing the sense that lets get out of life and into a book
7685187 if i can change and you can change then everyone can change
7685188 these mist covered mountains are home now for me but my home is the lowlands and always will be
7685189 now the suns gone to hell and the moons riding high so let me bid you farewell every man has to die

7685243 once family members know of a relatives hiv status they abandon them very often relatives dont even claim the body after death
7685244 we continue to live with stigma and face discrimination from an indifferent society and unsympathetic relatives many of us live without dignity and die stigmatised
7685245 often relatives furnish fake details while admitting a hiv positive patient at gmc once the patient dies the police have difficulty in obtaining a no objection certificate to dispose off the body
7685246 its not easy to change the mindset people are aware about hiv but find it difficult to accept if a family member is infected with hiv
7685247 the jacketing of the river proved to be disastrous the rivers flow was controlled but there was no way to check the resulting siltation this has complicated matters

7685249 im not a huge fan of trying to punish your consumer albeit these people have clearly stolen intellectual property i think there are better ways of resolving this within our power as developers and publishers
7685250 yes weve got to find solutions we absolutely should crack down on piracy people put a lot of blood sweat and tears into their content and deserve to get paid for it its absolutely wrong it is stealing
7685251 but at the same time i think there are better solutions than chasing people for money im not sure what they are other than to build game experiences that make it more difficult for there to be any value in pirating games
7685252 if we learned anything from the music business they just dont win any friends by suing their consumers speaking personally i think our industry does not want to fall foul of what happened with music

7685257 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7685258 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7685259 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

7685271 it belongs to the town of chatham its their history and want it to be preserved and the people in that town are very passionate about it and i thought this is the best way to preserve it
7685272 if we had lots of money we would love to have that facility
7685273 i dont see where itd be a financial burden i dont think theyd wanna go restore it all at once
7685274 they feel like the county is dumping an unwanted and almost unfixable building on the town
7685275 its a gift if they want to utilize it and use it theyre welcome to it and if they dont i guess itll just stay with the county
7685276 thats not a good gift when you give someone thats gonna cost them more then the value then thats not a good gift thats a burden
7685277 two kids were saved at the end of the day
7685278 well why did you let them get in danger in the first place
7685279 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7685280 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7685281 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7685282 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7685283 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7685284 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7685285 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7685286 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7685287 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7685288 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7685289 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7685290 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7685291 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7685292 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7685293 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7685294 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7685295 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7685296 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7685297 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7685298 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7685299 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7685300 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7685301 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7685302 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7685303 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7685304 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7685305 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7685306 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7685307 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7685308 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7685309 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7685310 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7685311 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7685312 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7685313 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7685314 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7685315 who are open to doing something on the production side
7685316 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7685317 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7685318 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7685319 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7685320 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7685321 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7685322 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7685323 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7685324 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7685325 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7685326 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7685327 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7685328 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7685329 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7685330 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7685331 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7685332 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7685333 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7685334 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7685335 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7685336 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7685337 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7685338 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7685339 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7685340 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7685341 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7685342 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7685343 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7685344 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7685345 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7685346 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7685347 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7685348 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7685349 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7685350 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7685351 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7685352 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7685353 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7685354 i didnt know a single person moving up to raleigh and now i have plenty of contacts of people to hang out with socially or for business
7685355 when i was getting ready to graduate i wanted to make sure i had a contact coming from wilmington to the triangle area and found out there wasnt really any structure as far as a chapter goes

7685390 getting out our side of the story is much easier if youre in denver rather than 2 000 miles away
7685391 were just trying to provide a little bit of balance and some republican perspective
7685392 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7685393 we made two roster moves today you know one of them jay feely the kicker and the other is michael merritt hoyt we let go and trevor johnson we let go weve got to do some more things tomorrow by 3 oclock and well make those decisions then
7685394 no wed like to take two guys into the next game
7685395 we signed him and weve got to make a decision which two guys we keep between now and game time
7685396 hes been a good kicker in the league you exhaust all your avenues and this was one that became available and so we decided to bring him in here
7685397 just because you get a veteran kicker doesnt mean you wont struggle wed like to have a kicker opening day whos our kicker youre exactly right we dont want to conduct a kicking contest every other week
7685398 i dont know that so much we need a guy whos consistent and you talk about inside the 30 yard line you get to the 30 yard line thats about a 43 yard field goal some guys are comfortable from there and some guys you need to get a little closer to the 28 or 27 thats ok but youve got to have a consistent kicker especially when you are putting in a new offense and all points are important
7685399 last year i think he missed two and one was blocked he was pretty consistent for the most part i think his longest was 53 yards he got a 54 yard one blocked hes been a pretty good kicker and he was up in new york when i was there with the jets well see
7685400 we would hope whoever those two guys are we will be in position to kick some field goals but then again wed like to score some touchdowns too im not going to give up the ability to score touchdowns to kick field goals
7685401 i felt good about them driving the ball all the way down in the third quarter
7685402 you can look at it a lot of ways we didnt play well in certain occasions in that game there are some things you take out of it positive too
7685403 yeah and last year it wasnt that way i thought going into last week we played pretty well now our second game we didnt score a lot of points but we moved the ball offensively but defensively we have played pretty consistent for the most part when you think about the last three games
7685404 the thing about pre season is you want to get better you want your players to get better its an evaluation process i think were much better than we were last year at this point in time now weve only won one game but i think our team is a lot better theres hope to continue to get better to me thats the difference and a big difference
7685405 its tough because you dont know who the practice squad players are going to be who are going to be those eight and are you going to take 25 on offense and 25 on defense what numbers are you going to take are you going to take 26 or 24 thats the kind of juggling act you go through and it has a lot to do with when guys get injured if good guys get injured you cant cut them youve got to put them on the 53 and now all of a sudden your squads a little short but there are some roster spots to be had
7685406 thats a key when you look at our team there are four rookies that we drafted that didnt play cottam is one of them charles is one of them will franklin is the other one and our left tackle brandon albert those guys can help us and theres a reason we drafted them they have to play for us theyre not backup guys they are guys who are going to participate in the games a lot
7685407 i anticipate he will play but ill see where hes at he practiced
7685408 this is it for us its walk throughs the next few days you cant ask the guys to practice coming off a saturday night game and getting home at 3 oclock in the morning this was good enough today
7685409 hes got a little nick on this thigh he probably wont play this week but next week he should go
7685410 hes got the finger injury but he wont play this week hell be ready for the opener
7685411 hes got a little bit of a groin injury and a shoulder thats sore we might hold him out too
7685412 hell get better this is one of those deals where its a short week if it was a long week he would probably go franklin i dont know how many weeks
7685413 confidence wise hes more confident he takes care of the ball better he had the fumble and interception in the two minute vs miami but other than that hes doing what hes asked to do i think he feels comfortable in the offense
7685414 right now absolutely no doubt in my mind thats the way were going thats our guy thats what we said were going to do were not going to change our mind after three pre season games we said this is what were going to do and now its going to happen were not going to blink we have a conviction on how were going to form this team and what kind of team were going to build were playing a lot of young guys and there will probably be some games in the season that are similar to the ones that we just played but thats part of it you know that these kids want to win theyre very hungry to be coached theyve got great attitude

7685527 its hopeful to see the presidential contenders from both parties responding to the widespread public outrage over the problem of excessive executive pay but their solutions fall short both support boosting shareholder power over executive compensation this reform known as say on pay could shame some boards away from offering truly obscene pay packages but it has had limited effect in other countries real executive pay reform demands tougher legislative action and step one should be to plug the tax loopholes that currently encourage and subsidize runaway pay we need to be asking our lawmakers how much longer are you going to allow our tax dollars to wind up in the pockets of top executives
7685528 my job as president would be to try to make sure that we are tightening the screws diplomatically on iran that weve mobilized the world community to go after irans program in a serious way and to get sanctions in place so that iran starts making a difficult calculation

7685537 the increase in insurers appetite to take on longevity and sponsor risk means that there is now a wide range of solutions available to companies wishing to transfer liabilities away from a final salary pension scheme
7685538 this of course does not mean that 60bn will be written but is a demonstration of the explosion in interest from companies in the buyout route

7685597 18 june 2008 one distinguishing aspect of langs posts about oil is the lack of reference or even apparent awareness of the vast expert literature about these issues for a small sample see
7685598 19 july 2008 here we see the triumph of an amateur making a successful single short term market forecast made with 50 50 odds
7685599 22 july 2008 the world is so simple when one has a master narrative explaining events that rendering one superior to experts who see the world in terms of many complex dynamics this is one of the most common sources of error often folly on blogs
7685600 24 july 2008 peak oil is described by experts as a process taking place over years or decades lang calls it off based on a few weeks decline in prices what might be who knows just a correction in the rise of prices extending back to 2001 or 1998 depending on ones perspective
7685601 drill drill drill so that the futures traders will flee
7685602 4 august 2008 the confidence langs exhibits in the first line below is classic americana
7685603 approval of drilling will frighten the futures traders out of the market and the price will go a long way down
7685604 15 august 2008 like most people not familiar with the operation of markets lang shows no awareness of the normal volatility of markets nor the need to describe their direction on the basis of long term trends not short term movements

7685622 ha habido algunos informes ltimamente que sostienen que el m nimo solar est durando m s de lo que deber a eso no es cierto el actual per odo de calma relacionado con la cantidad de manchas solares se encuentra dentro de las normas hist ricas para el ciclo solar
7685623 el sol se encuentra ahora cerca del punto bajo de su ciclo de actividad de 11 a os
7685624 a esto lo llamamos m nimo solar es el per odo de calma que separa un m ximo solar de otro
7685625 pero creo que precisamente estamos olvidando cu nto puede durar un m nimo solar
7685626 el per odo promedio de un ciclo solar es de 131 meses con una desviaci n est ndar de 14 meses el decayente ciclo solar 23 que estamos experimentando ahora ha durado hasta ahora 142 meses dentro de la primera desviaci n estandar y por tanto para nada anormal la ltima cantidad de manchas solares disponible tomada en un promedio de 13 meses fue 5 70 esta cifra es mayor que el 12 de los ltimos 23 valores correspondientes a los m nimos solares
7685627 el m nimo en curso no es anormalmente bajo o largo
7685628 ya hemos observado algunas manchas solares del siguiente ciclo solar
7685629 esto sugiere que el ciclo solar est teniendo lugar normalmente

7685636 speciaal uit studio 100 overgekomen mijn co presentatrice geef haar een warm applaus
7685637 its not really a huge surprise for me because we are just building on the success we had at the end of last season
7685638 obviously as a newly promoted side anything more than just staying up this season would be good
7685639 he has to get the team to play successful good football as we are used to
7685640 the club has done everything to make his job comfortable juergen has turned many things upside down now we need the results otherwise the changes and the investment are useless
7685641 we dont keep anyone against their will at this club
7685642 slavery was abolished a long time ago he can leave as early as possible but he must accept the consequences of rescinding a contract which has two years to run
7685643 transfers take place when competitions are over not five days before the season starts it is a lack of respect for the club its history and the supporters
7685644 we need to get this matter resolved before the transfer deadline

7685648 when we saw it on thursday it was hard to read
7685649 it can be 9 05 or 9 15 but it cant be 9 30 or 10 oclock
7685650 she hired a strong staff and they were able to handle a late nominee and invesco field and there hasnt been a hiccup in the operation
7685651 makes your kids much safer than they otherwise would be
7685652 lets not kid ourselves this campaign is about race white voters over 45 have traditional attitudes about race while young whites dont care whether obama is black or blue
7685653 they vote in large numbers and he needs a lot of em
7685654 older white women and older white men in general including older white democrats are the demographics that obama really has to continue to try to bring home there is still lots of work to do to reach and convince this key demographic in important states that have lots of them pennsylvania and ohio are two good examples
7685655 but the really is white blue collar women over 45 this is the make or break group in the election if obama carries them by traditional democratic margins in the swing states he wins if mccain peels some away the outcome is really tight
7685656 this election needs to be about the economy for obama
7685657 the better he does with this group the better he will do in the states he needs to pick up
7685658 generically surveys indicate that whites over 45 are a key target yet looking at the electoral map obama will need to shore up his support among blue collar workers if he is to capture the winning tally in the electoral college pennsylvania ohio missouri and virginia are among the states to focus time and effort on to woo these important voters
7685659 blue collar workers including as well however white males over 45
7685660 it is one thing to talk about an economic plan but it is another to have voters believe that you truly understand and feel their pain that is essential for an obama win
7685661 they dont relate to harvard law school honest tea and hawaiian vacations
7685662 for the simple reason that this farce of a vice presidential selection process exposed for all to see that the strongest and most qualified candidate was left by the wayside they didnt even vet her
7685663 women are the biggest problem they arent coming over in massive numbers
7685664 senator obama needs to consolidate women voters particularly clinton supporters during convention week so he can move on to older voters and blue collar voters after labor day
7685665 women however all of the groups are an important ingredient to his success and he must do a better job at recruiting them
7685666 we were yelling and cheering it was really a lot of fun half of us were crying
7685667 i was in awe he just amazed me at that young age
7685668 my husband died at 7 oclock in the morning and my plane saturday took off at 7 oclock
7685669 im flying out to denver which is his favorite place and joe biden has just been nominated for vp so it cant be a bad day thats the way i looked at it
7685670 i said you represent more people as a county councilman than you do as a state senator why would you want to do that and he said no john i mean the united states senate
7685671 i dont know if it will mean anything but ill make my point
7685672 i got spat on i got mooned i got a sheet thrown on me i got death threats at work
7685673 you cannot possibly imagine i got death threats on my e mail
7685674 its outrageous to imply that i am a racist because i dont support a young man with no legislative record
7685675 the one thing i will go to my grave never equivocating on is racial justice
7685676 i dont make boatloads of money it is the election of my lifetime i dont begrudge one penny that i spent on her behalf
7685677 he has a good foreign policy record a great human rights record and is author of the violence against women act
7685678 the obama campaign continues to be so rude and disrespectful to the clinton people that the thought of working with them through the general election is completely distasteful to me
7685679 i hope that will change after the convention maybe biden will knock some sense into the obama people
7685680 you dont snap your fingers and get on the unity bus
7685681 i like joe biden i think hes a great guy it doesnt make me any more confident in barack obama he has to show that he deserves our vote
7685682 what obama has to do and hes smart enough to do it he has to figure out how to acknowledge her respect her honor her work in the campaign and not be condescending
7685683 well see what happens but i feel like theyve tried thats for sure to make sure people are protected
7685684 se focarmos apenas no elemento religioso acrescentar biden chapa democrata foi uma manobra extremamente inteligente
7685685 biden tem la os com um estado eleitoralmente indeciso muito importante a pensilv nia onde os cat licos s o o maior eleitorado em disputa
7685686 h um grupo mais amplo de cat licos que t m simpatias pr vida contra o aborto mas que n o vota exclusivamente em torno dessa quest o e nesse caso biden pode ser um candidato atraente
7685687 o fato de ser contra o aborto tardio lhe d alguns argumentos que obama n o tem
7685688 onde o voto cat lico pode fazer uma diferen a real s o a fl rida ohio e louisiana
7685689 conven o n o deve alterar inten es de voto
7685690 acho bom mesmo a igreja ficar fora da pol tica leiam bem a igreja e n o seus membros a cidadania direito e dever de todos
7685691 at hoje depois de 35 anos de convers o estou para ver um crist o que tenha entrado na pol tica e que n o tenha sofrido uma metamorfose ou melhor uma metan ia mudan a de mentalidade para pior
7685692 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
7685693 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
7685694 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
7685695 are a bad reflection on him as a human being
7685696 we have to communicate that that there now arent enough democratic senators to pass barack obamas agenda
7685697 and we will make the argument that we have an excellent crop of candidates
7685698 our advice to the great majority of them is to be back home with their constituents
7685699 its hurting a lot of people their lives have changed not only just losing a job the value of their dollars gone down and theyre having a hard time going to college with the cost of education theyre looking for some leadership and franklin delano roosevelt provided that type of leadership and i think barack obama can really talk to the american public and have a plan an agenda and get it done as quickly as possible i believe thats the only way to come out of this recession there has to be a huge infrastructure bill just like we did coming out of the earthquake in san francisco where we waive federal laws and rules and regulations that hamper the spending of the money and get it out there as quickly as possible bring business and people back to work
7685700 i talked to him right after he lost and i told him you know i lost to harold washington never give up you have your principles you have your ideas you want to accomplish things so dont give up you learn from defeat some people dont learn from defeat they go away mad and mean and upset with a lot of people but he came away in a positive way
7685701 with every word being carefully examined to see if they are willing to sublimate their own interests to those of the party and obama the clintons will have to go the second mile in praising obama
7685702 sen clinton knows that her political future rides on her being a good soldier for barack obama she will concentrate on praising obama because she wants to create a positive image for herself and obama she is also friendly with mccain in the senate so she wont spend much time ripping him
7685703 for the sake of the party obamas strength in the fall election as well as her own political viability hillary would be wise to boost his candidacy and qualifications and leave to others the negative blasts against mccain sen clinton can be obamas lbj on the hill and she needs to stake her claim as one of obamas most significant insider players and one who can be trusted to carry his message both inside the halls of congress and in the public arena
7685704 she wants him to win and knows her base is critical for him
7685705 hillary loves the democratic party and will work hard as she already has to elect their nominee
7685706 she needs to be seen as a team player attacking mccain is part of that but she needs to be seen as supporting obama
7685707 her supporters need to hear electing obama matters to her from her lips again and again and again over the course of the fall
7685708 she needs to focus on barack if she wants a future particularly if he doesnt get elected this time she can spend an equal time on going after mccain but should spend little time on the clinton image
7685709 for her and the country i hope she uses the convention to get on board the obama bandwagon big time
7685710 she should praise obama but in usual clinton mode it will be about her
7685711 regrettably and perversely because it is simply part of the clinton dna to first extol themselves
7685712 shell do just enough positives of obama and just enough negatives of mccain to escape huge criticism from the party but she is and always will be more focused on herself then anything else shes still got her surrogates whining about her not being vetted for vp and every other slight they can think of
7685713 attacking mccain mostly but that and praising obama is the way she burnishes her image
7685714 sen clinton will help her future and sen obama the most by taking on john mccain and the republicans on the economy directly and aggressively clinton should not do a self indulgent valedictory speech
7685715 its the best and most honest thing she can do
7685716 attacking mccain is the way to both be a good soldier and demonstrate that she would have been a better nominee
7685717 she is a pro and needs to do it all
7685718 shes going to attempt to have her cake and eat it too

7685742 some guys are going to have to take extra reps but youve got to just go ahead and take it so just get it out of your head take the extra reps and get better and just wait for the guys to come back
7685743 you get a lot of players hurt all around the team early in the preseason and the poor devils that are left take too many plays and now theyre more apt to get hurt and its just a vicious cycle

7685756 i was wondering if maybe solar cells could be made with carbon nanotubes david said in a soft voice his head barely rising above the bottled water next to his box lunch
7685757 i mean carbon is cheap and ive seen self assembling molecules so i think it would be easy to make
7685758 ever since he was little david was a disassembler she said not a smasher
7685759 his first wish was to meet al gore said his dad derek a computer programmer
7685760 we said al gores just a spokesman for these ideas wouldnt you like to meet with the people doing the real work
7685761 todays visit to the lab is only one of seven visits david will be making to companies doing work in this area said bong suh a board member of the foundations local chapter who was on hand for davids day long brainstorming session with fellow big thinkers

7685775 i tried to bunt just to tie the game on the visitors side thats kind of weird
7685776 ive never seen anything like that and hopefully we never see that again especially when you lose a game when you wait this long
7685777 its frustrating because i want to be here and help the team but for me not being 100 percent to go out there its not just hurting the team its me not being 100 percent
7685778 i was told nothing could make it worse which is why i wanted to pitch through it it just hasnt gone away
7685779 weve all seen john maine even without his best stuff if im not mistaken he had a pretty good game in pittsburgh
7685780 but the bottom line is we cannot risk his long term health in the midst of this pennant race which means that guys are going to have to step up
7685781 well watch him play watch him perform watch the level the team is playing at with him performing and see where we are

7685785 what were spending on law enforcement in iraq now is more than everything were spending here
7685786 this is the front line as far as im concerned
7685787 this is what she does she hands out checks to fire departments for money that came from bills she voted against
7685788 she talks at the va about the importance of the gi bill congress just passed that she voted against she talks about the importance of renewable energy but shes voted against every renewable energy bill thats come up

7685792 we have an opportunity to struggle again to save the south central farm and restore it to its original function in the community
7685793 for a project of this magnitude i think its a good process to go through
7685794 if they convey that sense of passion and focus and they bring their own stories into it the issues will take care of themselves
7685795 but too often democrats think its an intellectual debate about policy nuances that aint it and thats why weve lost in the past sometimes weve got to make sure people understand who these people are
7685796 even before the convention and even before the complete reconciliation that we need
7685797 the nomination is decided we have a vice president were going to work together and go forward
7685798 but to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7685799 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7685800 we are going into the future what did i walk into a time capsule
7685801 democrats will leave this denver convention unified organized and stronger than ever to take america in a new direction with barack obama and joe biden as president and vice president
7685802 republicans say john mccain has experience we say john mccain has the experience of being wrong

7685804 its just something everyone loves you walk in schools and smell that bacon frying and the kids go crazy
7685805 the benefits of the program accrued very quickly and are very large
7685806 when adults stop smoking you see immediate benefits in heart disease with impacts on cancer and lung diseases starting to appear a year or two later
7685807 the numbers are relatively small but the important thing is that these deaths are preventable
7685808 every year a number of patients die in the bath so convincing people to take showers would be life saving
7685809 were not saying that people shouldnt swim but that they need to be aware of the risk and to go with someone who can help if they have problems
7685810 we always need to do whatever we can to ensure seizure control

7685823 our goal is to get the iphone client out as quickly as possible because it does represent a significant percentage of the devices touching our network
7685824 the apple guys are really smart and they have a beautiful phone
7685825 we think the logistics of getting such a deal done are very challenging particularly with amds equity value and cash position falling everyday after all why would a firm want to do a deal with amd today when it can just wait a little longer and do the deal even cheaper
7685826 she was pulling the dogs ear and pulling the dog on the ground
7685827 the dog retaliated with a snap and caught her ear unfortunately
7685828 it was very unfortunate but it was not a dog attack
7685829 im annoyed this dog a pitbull staffy cross caused so much pain to my granddaughter and was allowed to live
7685830 once theyve done it once theyll do it again a well trained dog doesnt attack anybody
7685831 i rushed straight to palmerston north hospital to find my granddaughter with half her ear hanging off
7685832 while my granddaughter was being born i was viciously attacked on the street

7685835 his name when he was given to us was wallace even though thats a strong solid scottish name vice was easier to bark out wallace didnt really fit the mould i found
7685836 he has a natural tracking ability he wanted to track from the moment i got him hes got a beautiful nature and he easily switches from work to home
7685837 hes grown up with my older kids and ive got a 1 year old at home and we have no problems other than hes a big dog and knocks things over
7685838 youd be amazed at what they can smell if you back them they will quite often surprise you
7685839 they are still aligned to the basic principles but we advance them we find dogs with a bit of extra stickability perhaps not the hardest biting dog but they need a fit handler
7685840 its good training for the guys that are into it and its certainly a buzz when you find real life people

7685846 this shocking incident underscores the terrible dangers and threats that continue to face journalists in somalia
7685847 we call for them to be set free immediately the somali authorities must act urgently to see our colleagues come to no harm
7685848 we are worried about their safety as we have had no contact with anybody saying they are holding the journalists and their driver

7685852 the u s and india stand shoulder to shoulder in their desire for a clean exception and we will continue to work with our indian partners to persuade the nsg countries that such an exemption is in the international communitys best interest
7685853 continue our vigorous joint advocacy for the initiative at the highest levels of nsg governments
7685854 substantive amendments with a view to increasing the level of comfort with the proposed exemption
7685855 are based on concepts already enshrined in u n security council resolutions in domestic legislation of nsg participating governments and in bilateral nuclear supply agreements which nsg states have concluded over the years
7685856 i saw when the judges blatantly stole fights from two cuban boxers in the semifinals

7685873 once this work is done cabinet will be able to make some firm decisions on how to progress waterview

7685879 good architecture doesnt have to cost a lot of money
7685880 he said he wanted input but what it amounted to was we got to pick the bathroom color
7685881 he was a meek shy person but when it came to his design he would not compromise
7685882 he designed a lot of churches where he had to work with building committees theyd want to cut off a roof overhang and he was really committed to that design he would spend weeks in turmoil and agony
7685883 fight for them suffer for them defend them against a mediocre materialistic uninformed society
7685884 was a case of arrogance and ego with my dad it was just idealistic he was a purist
7685885 we are concerned by indiscriminate weapons fire by sudanese government forces on the kalma internally displaced persons camp in south darfur sudan
7685886 attacks on vulnerable populations in sudan are deplorable and violate international law
7685887 the benefits of the program accrued very quickly and are very large
7685888 when adults stop smoking you see immediate benefits in heart disease with impacts on cancer and lung diseases starting to appear a year or two later

7685890 it has always been our dream to have our own place but it has been really hard to save for a deposit
7685891 so when i was reading the paper and realised that my numbers matched lottos winning numbers i asked my wife do you want to buy a house this week
7685892 i think the only conclusion to draw from this is that if you cant run an opposition its pretty hard to argue you should be running a government within the next three months
7685893 weve laid out our principles quite clearly in relation to using private sector capital for roading projects and for investment in infrastructure
7685894 we havent actually agreed what those projects might be or what the level of toll might be but they have to fit certain conditions and well be meeting those conditions

7685914 earlier the casualty ward received between 100 to 150 patients only today the number has increased to 800 the challenge is greater but resources insufficient
7685915 i had always been passionate about giving something back to my society which is why i chose to do medicine when i joined as a medical officer in 1989 and witnessed the poor condition of state run hospitals i decided to work towards a change i wanted to uplift the ward i was given charge of and prove that the government sector can also deliver if provided with the funds and opportunity this i was able to do over the years
7685916 the emergency ward at the jpmc karachi is possibly the only ward in the country where doctors are constantly busy if there is no political clash or bomb blast we are dealing with deaths from epidemics rain and what not
7685917 there were about 250 injured brought to the hospital and the chaos was unimaginable
7685918 in an urban city like karachi where suicide bombings clashes and political killings are common it is difficult to remain stress free but with time we learnt to handle one difficult situation after another

7685943 i have no idea why i am on the list and theyre not telling officially that im even on the list
7685944 unfortunately it is a problem that is shared by countless individuals who have no connection to terrorism have no connection to crime and dont belong on this list

7686129 we did not take action at the august 13 meeting because we had insufficient information
7686130 what was supposed to be a cordial meeting turned into what i feel was a deliberate partisan attack on the director of elections who has no vote in the decision you made as a board to not have additional sites at your last meeting
7686131 i was embarrassed for myself as well as both of my employees who heard parts of this loud one sided discussion through the closed wooden door of my office
7686132 i am outraged that our director was cornered in her own office to sit through a loud abusive attack by a political office holder for doing the job we directed her to carry out
7686133 i am embarrassed that we have permitted our director to be abused and berated by office holders

7686136 i must have been in a different meeting none of the accusations in the letter took place when i was in the meeting it is unfortunate that this has been blown out of proportion
7686137 i didnt intend to offend her in any way but she has taken personal offense and notified quite a lot of people it has turned what had been a cordial professional meeting into a highly charged confrontation
7686138 this has been blown into a highly partisan debate but it was really not at all partisan we just happen to both be of the same party
7686139 we anticipate that a tremendous number of people will be voting in upcoming election
7686140 we feel these voters especially in rural areas should have an opportunity to vote with some convenience there are a lot of elderly people with limited transportation that was the only intent as i know it that we went to speak about

7686160 were trying to do as much as we can while the roadwork is going on so we dont end up tearing up a perfectly good sidewalk later
7686161 youre also talking about a significant amount of money maybe another two million dollars that wed have to spend if we put this off and did it later that just doesnt make good sense
7686162 we want to do this so that we dont interfere with what dot is doing
7686163 if theyre on one end we want to be on the other one the only reason wed need to contract is if we were somehow going to hold up what they were doing
7686164 these are the bases for the streetlights and the transformer and switchgear
7686165 but putting the bases in now means well only have small effects on the sidewalk later and we wont have to rip up a brand new road in a year or two

7686167 president bush has set our country on the course of recovery at home and strength abroad we are safer today because this president has had the backbone to follow terrorism where terrorists are and go after them and they have failed to strike us again on our own shores since 9 11 president bush represents economic recovery and american leadership
7686168 smith had a responsibility to investigate the iraq threat and failed then he criticized people like me who opposed the war from the beginning smith says he read a book in july of 2006 that made him change his mind about the war but after changing his mind smith did nothing about it imagine a u s senator decided the iraq war was wrong and did nothing about it for seven months not until six of his republican colleagues lost reelection in 2006 did smith decide to speak out and even then refused to take a tough stance to bring our sons and daughters home america needs leaders who believe in what they fight for and will fight for what they believe in some times that is politically inconvenient but that is what real leadership is all about

7686189 the u s intelligence community buckled sooner in 2002 than previously reported to bush administration pressure for data justifying an invasion of iraq
7686190 the documents suggest that the public relations push for war came before the intelligence analysis which then conformed to public positions taken by pentagon and white house officials
7686191 surge is a success in the context of a devastated population in an obliterated nation lacking in the most essential supplies and services a nation where death continues on a shopping spree
7686192 a recently declassified draft of the cias october 2002 white paper on iraqi wmd programs demonstrates that that the white paper long pre dated the compilation of the national intelligence estimate on iraqi capabilities
7686193 bush administration and the tony blair government began acting in concert to build support for an invasion of iraq two to three months earlier than previously understood
7686194 a comparison of the cia draft white paper with its publicly released edition shows that all the changes made were in the nature of strengthening its charges against iraq by inserting additional alarming claims in the manner of an advocacy or public relations document
7686195 the draft and final papers show no evidence of intelligence analysis applied to the information contained august 22 2004
7686196 baghdad for now appears to be drawing a line short of conducting terrorist attacks with conventional or cbw against the united states fearing that exposure of iraqi involvement would provide washington a stronger cause for making war
7686197 iraq probably would attempt clandestine attacks against the u s homeland if baghdad feared an attack that threatened the survival of the regime were imminent or unavoidable or possibly for revenge
7686198 if were really going to move the needle to encourage people to change their commuting habits it seems to me its less about building trails and lanes to far flung
7686199 all those things they want to implement that would make it so much nicer said warren jenkins who rides his single speed green schwinn from downtown to his job at recycle bookstore on the alameda
7686200 the way things are going with cars and gasoline prices human power is going to be a lot more prominent its part of the solution right
7686201 bike share program similar to token operated luggage carts at airports would allow commuters to use a token or credit card to borrow bikes from a light rail station to get to work then return it when they get on the train home
7686202 every year were seeing more people get on their bikes she said
7686203 whats happening is that the transit facilities were built to handle a certain number of riders the demand is surpassing that
7686204 largely uptapped federal funding as well as valley transportation authority money to build the network of barricaded bike lanes
7686205 the cost will depend on how many corridors we identify and for how many miles
7686206 i dont really understand why other ro players really like to place their names with decorations
7686207 if they would be baptized at the prontera church they would be smacked by the priest due to the difficulty of pronouncing their names authors note the same can be applied for prospective grooms and brides
7686208 according to some people ive talked to one reason why theyre using those decorations is for them not to be easily pmed
7686209 according to others someone else before them has used their names of choice and they were running out of options so they had no choice but to put the special characters
7686210 others just say that they really want to have decorative names well it cant be helped if using flowery names is in their personality
7686211 but they dont realize that for every special character they use their names lose their identity
7686212 amidst the myriad of flowery names in pro how many of those with proper names can you see
7686213 only a few i cant write the exact figures but try walking along prontera and notice the names of the players there consider yourself lucky if you can spot a player with a proper name
7686214 those players are rare they have originality their names are truly theirs these are names that carry their unique personalities
7686215 the average person who is going to a salad bar is overeating
7686216 high freshman enrollment numbers are the result of enhanced recruiting efforts by the university including visits to more high schools more mailings of university literature and increased out of state recruiting

7686218 tristan thats the olympic torch the flame is handed off from runner to runner all the way around the world
7686219 so its absolutely essential for those who have been affected in the past or are affected now to just come along and tell us their stories

7686231 i dont know just a plane it was on the radio
7686232 we took 2nd avenue all the way down upon arrival towers one and two were both ablaze the second plane had hit the second tower already both towers were totally engulfed people were jumping out of the buildings there was airplane fuselage and landing gear around the site body parts victims remains on the floor there were some injuries on the street some cars were on fire
7686233 we did see part of i didnt see it but jeff johnson told me later on he did see part of the landing gear actually fell right through the roof and it was in one of the jacuzzis in another room
7686234 we parked on west street and i guess about albany west street and albany got out of the car and started going up west street and there were body parts in the street
7686235 when we passed 10 and 10 theres a bridge that runs i guess into one of the buildings directly south of trade center no 2 theres a pedestrian walkway as we passed that we came into the debris field
7686236 an explosion goes off actually this was the second plane impact rep i immediately tell everyone to get out of the car and hide somewhere go underneath something its interesting because as we were there there was a police car i guess on vesey on the corner there and some debris comes down from whatever this explosion was at the time we really didnt know and it just crushes it i mean crushes the top front of the police car which really scared me at that point q could you tell if it was airplane parts a it looked like an airplane part afterward yes it did it looked like part of an engine it was pretty big it was probably the size of the hood because it kind of hit it bounced and then rolled off
7686237 we heard the plane briefly the earth shook the buildings shook a tremendous fireball overhead i thought there was a bomb or an explosion
7686238 i figured as long as we didnt get hit by the plane we were ahead of the game the next thing i was worried about was getting hit by the parts
7686239 the four of us got out of the car we started to cross broadway and the second plane went into the other tower
7686240 by the time we got near 2 world trade center people were jumping off the roof like crazy landing near the hotel and the street was littered with body parts i dont know if it was from the plane or what but there was just body parts all over the place chunks of meat
7686241 i saw airplane parts on west street q how did you know they were airplane parts a it looked like pieces of a plane skin of a plane i mean they werent really discernible i couldnt say this was this part of a plane or that was that part just knowing a plane had hit the building and i looked and i saw it looked like the skin off a wing or a fuselage or wherever it came from q clearly not building material a no the building material was sort of gray and you could see it you know how it differed from the plane
7686242 the other thing that was actually evident though is what appeared to be some plane parts like some circular pieces of a plane and lots of shoes i dont know if that was women jumping out of their jumping out of their heels to run but there were just impressed me there were no you know there were no injuries on the street at that point but there was lots of shoes all over the place and plane parts it was the same thing in both directions
7686243 we just passed a compact car where the engine was running and the door was open which looked to me like the driver had escaped
7686244 there were people dead people everywhere dont know if you want to know that what did you do you know you can say it whatever you saw you know they the people were just
7686245 our initial response was seeing body parts and airplane parts all over the west side just traumatic to see
7686246 we were coming across and we walked down we had to go down to the command center we carried all our tools the bottles everything and as were walking down
7686247 like i remember walking by with the chief and i remember seeing the airplane engine you know pieces of you know obviously trade center all over
7686248 i parked soon thereafter on west street geared up and walked along west street
7686249 once we started taking off i guess 30 feet in front of us there was a lady on the ground by the curb and she was just waving her arms thats all she could wave her legs were crushed apparently she got hit by part of the landing gear one of the tires of the airplane there was a large tire next to her the person who was next to her i guess worked with her said something hit her it may have been the landing gear it was a large piece of metal that was so sharp it slit her whole back open buttocks her legs were exposed bones we boarded her as fast as we could there was nowhere to grab her she was too slippery so i grabbed the hip bone that was exposed we just kind of picked her up put her on the long board and we strapped her up put her on the stretcher and took as much flesh as we could it was just hanging all over the place put it between her legs put her in the ambulance and rushed her to beekman
7686250 plaintiffs claim that a terrorist attack was not responsible for the destruction of the world trade center complex
7686251 the defendants knowingly participated in the fraud of furthering the false claim that two wide body jetliners hit the world trade center on 9 11 01
7686252 all defendants moved to dismiss the lawsuits as being frivolous and for lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim pursuant to fed r civ p 12 b 1 and 6 respectively the motions to dismiss are granted and all three complaints are dismissed with prejudice
7686253 plaintiffs maintain that the alleged fraudulent nature of the investigation has furthered the deception perpetrated upon the masses that the wtc was demolished as a result of terrorists plowing two commercial airplanes filled with thousand of gallons of jet fuel directly into the twin towers at a high rate of speed
7686254 are operational in earth s orbit at high altitude low altitude at sea and on land ranging in lethality from the capacity to do great damage such as that of destroying the world trade center twin towers in less than 10 seconds each as occurred on 9 11 01 down to and including imposition of a disabling stun on human beings for crowd control and or other psy ops psychological operations purposes
7686255 plaintiffs understandably offer nothing more than conjecture and supposition to support their claim that the towers were struck by high powered energy beams their personal hypothesis about what should be concluded from publicly disclosed information does not qualify either of them as an original source of information in order to sustain an individual fca claim on behalf of the government
7686256 plaintiffs theories about the cause of the 9 11 disaster completely fail to state a cognizable claim for relief
7686257 fellow citizens 9 11 was a false flag operation by an international war crimes racketeering organisation to provide a pretext to engage in a genocidal and ecocidal depleted uranium bombing of central asia afghanistan and iraq in order to secure vast oil and uranium reserves to roll out a terror based national security state system worldwide and to implement the final stages of a world depopulation policy
7686258 its obvious to me that you have to consider all the possible alternatives
7686259 you cant exclude any lest as you proceed in your investigation and eliminate hypotheses you eliminate the true hypothesis because youve never allowed it to be considered

7686283 the survey showed that 76 percent of women who supported senator hillary clinton in the democratic primaries now say they will vote for obama
7686284 kohut said polls show obama running better among women than the 2004 democratic nominee senator john kerry was at this point in the race but kohut cautioned there is one group of women that is not supporting obama
7686285 the problem is most difficult for obama with older women
7686286 although surveys show the presidential race could be a squeaker barack obama is winning women 51 to 39 percent
7686287 these 44 to 62 year old women are diverse younger boomers are working and raising families while older ones are in retirement or approaching it
7686288 senator john mccain who watched from a prison camp as america failed to deploy the overwhelming force necessary to win the vietnam war seized the moment after republicans lost congress in 2006 to push
7686289 if we are not willing to provide the troops necessary for victory however victory itself will be impossible
7686290 he obama does not understand what is at stake here
7686291 and he chose to take a political path that helped him get the nomination of his party i took a path in backing the surge that i knew was unpopular because i knew we had to win in iraq and we are winning in iraq and if we had done what senator obama wanted done it would have been chaos genocide increased iranian influence and perhaps al qaida establishing a base again in iraq
7686292 not an attempt to embarrass the president its an attempt to save the president from making a significant mistake with regard to our policy in iraq
7686293 is designed to let the president know that there are many in both parties democrats and republicans that believe a change in our mission to go into baghdad in the midst of a civil war as well as a surge in ground troops is the wrong way to go and

7686300 the governments usual position is to suggest the claims are far reaching and absurd but our fisherman see this time and time again

7686331 the president is on the cusp of conserving more territory than any leader has ever done thats an amazing legacy to leave the nation
7686332 these areas are host to some of the worlds most biodiverse coral reefs and habitat and some of the most interesting and compelling geological formations in all of our oceans
7686333 many areas in the proposed central pacific islands monument remain in a nearly pristine state
7686334 a recent study of kingman reef part of the proposed monument found a picture perfect healthy coral ecosystem that contained more fish than any other coral reef ecosystem in the world
7686335 the study also found that the area contains the worlds greatest proportion of top predators including sharks a key indicator of ecosystem health healthy reefs like those of the central pacific are also more resilient to changing climate
7686336 monument or sanctuary designation by itself does not necessarily convey a high degree of protection and could allow a host of activities including commercial and recreational fishing and deep sea mining among others
7686337 however if the president establishes these new sites as no take reserves where no extractive activity is allowed it would be one of the most significant environmental achievements of any u s president

7686416 paula is a contestant sympathizer and some people just dont like that as it doesnt provide the entertainment they need last season i carefully observed the judges comments and paula was using the richest language by a wide margin
7686417 great now we have to listen to even more judges talking instead of contestants singing
7686418 id say paula has less to worry about than randy
7686419 straight up now tell me are going to kick me off the show
7686420 i didnt love it but im not mad at you either
7686421 you were sharp during the first part of the song

7686425 ten years ago the future was the very athletic very dynamic offensive shortstop a rod jeter nomar tejada
7686426 now the wave of dynamic offensive players dominating the game are second basemen
7686427 but kinsler is the engine that makes that offense go
7686428 this kid is going to have a better career than craig biggio
7686429 ian was a good player but i cant think of anything
7686430 the first couple games of the season i played well
7686431 but then we hosted a tournament early in the season four games in four days i played like crap
7686432 its just weird no one really has understood it at the all star game they would think oh they played together in college now theyre together at the all star game theyre friends pedroia went to asu was a pac 10 player of the year was a second round draft pick and made the big leagues its pretty simple for me lets just say it was a process it took me a while to figure things out
7686433 one time the ball took a bad hop and hit him in the mouth
7686434 from the day ian stepped through the doors here you could see it on his face he was on a mission
7686435 i kept checking baseball america box scores and every night hes going 2 for 3 3 for 4
7686436 he didnt bulk up and he wasnt huge but he did look stronger
7686437 and the swing was different more compact quick through the zone so quick that he was able to keep the barrel in the hitting zone for so long
7686438 but ian still drives in five or six runs with three or four extra base hits
7686439 he wanted the deal done before our bus got back to our camp
7686440 i felt he would come down to earth until i faced him again
7686441 hes one of those guys you have to really mix it up on most hitters have a location that you can exploit this guy has trouble with fastballs in this guy has trouble with breaking balls down kinsler doesnt have a hole like that
7686442 he handles a variety of pitches and he can really drive the ball
7686443 as he gets more experience and starts to define what pitchers are trying to do to him hes going to become a tougher and tougher out
7686444 kinsler goes from first to third faster than anyone because he has that god given ability to read the ball so well off the bat
7686445 id toss him fly balls when he was four and hed get under them like hed been doing it his whole life
7686446 everyone was like what are you doing it was one of my warden moves dont roll your eyes or youre going into lockup
7686447 one game were up by six runs in the ninth the pitcher fell 3 and 0 on me i swung and fouled it off he comes up to me after the game and says man you dont need to be swinging 3 and 0 with a six run lead so we argued about it
7686448 i think mike likes to take him under his wing because he sees a lot of himself in ian hardworking humble ian just follows him around like a pup
7686449 he said he had more power than hudson was a more well rounded player than phillips
7686450 he was a little stumped with cano and actually impressed by the numbers but by then we decided throwing him comparables wasnt getting us anywhere ian fancies himself as a unique player as a one of a kind and thats what hes proven himself to be
7686451 sorry dustin pedroia but you aint got nothin on ian kinsler
7686452 if i had to pick a single conference to go to this one would be it

7686499 the government should be doing it but we are fortunate the community has because of our lack of government support

7686512 these councillors have criticised another councillor for not acting with authority
7686513 what authority did they have in writing to the crown solicitor the general manager mr burns has the operational authority to write on these matters not these councillors
7686514 the respective councillors elected to misrepresent the facts on these matters
7686515 this is not acting honestly and by knowingly signing the letter armed with this clarification the group of councillors have attempted to mislead the crown solicitor to the detriment of councils case the act of writing the letter may constitute an act of misbehaviour in that it was detrimental to the pursuit of the councils charter and was unethical
7686516 the group have indicated there was no formal proposal to either pay the new england regional art museum debt or set up a future fund and such has not been brought to council for consideration
7686517 these councillors have used council information to push their own personal views and opposition to the matter at hand

7686544 once this work is done cabinet will be able to make some firm decisions on how to progress waterview
7686545 the way that that is constructed is quite important in terms of final outcome whether it is a good deal from a government perspective
7686546 i think the only conclusion to draw from this is that if you cant run an opposition its pretty hard to argue you should be running a government within the next three months
7686547 weve laid out our principles quite clearly in relation to using private sector capital for roading projects and for investment in infrastructure
7686548 we havent actually agreed what those projects might be or what the level of toll might be but they have to fit certain conditions and well be meeting those conditions
7686549 the agenda was secret until maurice blurted it and the prospect of having the 50 extra tax cut they promised the average worker snatched away by the weekly toll bill of course makes it clear their policies are all about taking with one hand giving with the other

7686575 reading through the book of psalms is like going through one of gods jewelry drawers the psalms paint a true picture of all human emotions from sadness anger fear longing and confusion to praying resting rejoicing singing and laughing they offer gods help and blessings for any and every situation and emotion of life in the lovely pages of beautifully pinned promises a woman will discover truths of god that will poignantly touch her heart and provide her with promises to hold on to and call her own

7686577 this is planetary destabilization and its already begun the question is how do we arrest this before it gets to the point of catastrophe
7686578 the earth could be free of arctic summer ice within our lifetime
7686579 this has not happened as far as we know in 130 000 years as long as human beings have existed on the planet
7686580 if you had a gauge in your car reading in the red zone how long would you feel comfortable driving down the highway like that thats where we are now
7686581 he said you dont understand were going to ban the sale of new automobiles in this country
7686582 if we were to move to the most efficient lighting technologies available today we could reduce electricity demand by 12 percent
7686583 in the new energy economy we see 40 percent of the worlds electricity coming from wind
7686584 that would require building roughly a million and a half wind turbines over the next dozen years now a million and a half may sound like a lot but we make 65 million cars a year
7686585 i mention that just to give a sense of how much renewable energy there is out there three states in the u s kansas north dakota and texas have enough energy capacity to power the whole country
7686586 from being a nation of energy consumers to being a nation of energy producers
7686587 wouldnt it be nice if you put solar panels on your house you got a check in the mail farmers in germany now have a new revenue stream
7686588 we have the solutions we just need to come up with the political will to get those technologies out there even faster
7686589 we believe in using nonviolent civil disobedience at times when its necessary to incite change it takes me to jail sometimes
7686590 as i look around the room i see some of the people ive been to jail with here today
7686591 we cant have half measures we dont have time to lose we have to hit the ground running
7686592 now is the time to speak the truth and bring new people into the political process
7686593 are we going to have the biggest political failure in the history of the world
7686594 are we going to create a human wave that knocks down the doors of congress and knocks down the doors of the white house or are we going to do just a little bit

7686598 where would i want to play wherever they ask me
7686599 it doesnt matter to me i enjoy doing everything and i think that they see that too
7686600 i love playing football and anytime i get a chance to get out and make any kind of play on either side of the ball its fun i love what i do
7686601 i guess im just trying to literally learn every day and hopefully make some plays whenever i get a chance
7686602 we used ray last year on the practice squad to run routes for the defense as an offensive receiver and he really did a good job
7686603 i think he can play both receiver and defensive back at a competent level
7686604 he is a tough kid he runs hard he catches the ball well and he showed up in the kicking game his versatility is his number one strength at this point but when he does play he has been productive in defense special teams and offense he is a unique guy
7686605 i dont think you can worry about all the stuff you cant control
7686606 this is not going to be the year that we make big changes
7686607 inclusive candidate who understands that our party needs to reach out to all americans to win this election
7686608 if they convey that sense of passion and focus and they bring their own stories into it the issues will take care of themselves
7686609 but too often democrats think its an intellectual debate about policy nuances that aint it and thats why weve lost in the past sometimes weve got to make sure people understand who these people are
7686610 it looks to me that it would be governor minner unless we go into the january 20 scenario
7686611 if the loser is carney its very easy to see governor minner who has endorsed him as her successor appointing him if he would like that office its a little harder to see if the loser is jack markell
7686612 but i guess i dont have any control over the game so theres no sense being nervous but i am
7686613 it doesnt rain on cardinal country lets go down to dolphin stadium and turn into papa johns south weve got the best fans in the world
7686614 this is not just a great day for louisville but a great day for the commonwealth
7686615 if your football team is as good as your band were in a lot of trouble
7686616 if wake forests vaunted pass defense can hold brian brohm and his receivers in check that could keep the demon deacons in the game until the fourth quarter at that point anything can happen but i really dont think the cards defense is going to allow wake to score enough
7686617 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
7686618 i think its fair to say that the cw has been a bad actor particularly when it comes to gossip girl
7686619 but i think that the cw has already demonstrated that theyll stoop to any level in a rather desperate attempt to build buzz
7686620 it stands to reason 90210 is going to be a similar type show
7686621 withholding the advance screener has nothing to do with content concerns

7686623 media buyers hate groups like the ptc and they want to be able to ignore them

7686631 with kara by her side paula finally has some back up and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7686632 i think simon is pretty spot on most of the time
7686633 im just somebody whos really honest and gives my opinion and if i feel the need to be hard with someone in order to get that across i will be and if i feel i need to be softer and more nurturing with some of the contestants ill be that
7686634 its not about vocal acrobatics its about being unique and doing things that are identifiable to you
7686635 what makes an artist is when their song comes on the radio i know exactly who it is
7686636 i dont care how much those suckers cost i will even take a loan out and i will buy a vending machine
7686637 because of the growing demand for our product and services and with the success of our initial call we felt this was the perfect time to allow individuals to get involved
7686638 we also know many people are beginning to look for jobs more locally to subsidize the rising cost of gas
7686639 this is not just an opportunity to make money it is an opportunity to make a difference
7686640 we have provided a vehicle for individuals to help their families friends their communities etc by offering the companys inventory know how to the general public we have moved our knowledge of inventory from the warehouse to the living room

7686652 peking hat der welt ein china bild gezeigt das die wirklichkeit im innern ausblendet diese olympischen spiele glichen einem tanz auf dem vulkan verbl ffende sportliche leistungen eine perfekte organisation moderne voll besetzte stadien und ein olympisches dorf das die athleten begeisterte
7686653 die spiele von peking waren spiele unter einer glocke ihre widerspr che m nden in offensive resignation
7686654 inszeniert wie sie waren haben die spiele in peking unfreiwillig auch irritierende eigenheiten der chinesischen gesellschaft und ihres regimes offengelegt das land feiert seine medaillen aber mit wenigen ausnahmen kaum seine sportler
7686655 die regierung tat alles um ihr land in m glichst gutem licht erscheinen zu lassen welchen preis das chinesische volk daf r zahlen musste blieb den besuchern allerdings verschlossen
7686656 das wirkliche china haben wir nicht erlebt wie das postolympische china aussieht wohl eher so wie vorher
7686657 unbestritten bleibt dass im reich der mitte vieles nicht zum besten bestellt ist doch der sport und seine weltweit gr te veranstaltung sind nicht nach china gekommen um dies zu ndern der sport hat im gegenteil eigene ungel ste probleme das gr te ist und bleibt der dopingmissbrauch
7686658 h tten diese olympischen sommerspiele auf dem mond stattgefunden dann w re man restlos begeistert gewesen
7686659 nun zieht die olympische fahne nach westen der kurzauftritt bei der stab bergabe sah mehr nach den swinging sixties aus als nach der weltstadt des 21 jahrhunderts wenn das eine absichtserkl rung der 2012 organisatoren ist nicht peking in gr e und spektakel nachzueifern und stattdessen auf flair und witz zu setzen ist das lobenswert
7686660 als er die olympische fahne w hrend der aufwendigen abschlussfeier im vogelnest stadion entgegennahm versprach b rgermeister boris johnson dass london auf gro britanniens witz flair fantasie und einfallsreichtum setzen werde um an den erfolg der pekinger spiele anzukn pfen tats chlich m ssen die spiele bei einem budget das etwa die h lfte pekings ausmacht neu erfunden werden
7686661 die chinesische supermacht hat die spiele benutzt um ihre neue macht zu demonstrieren was die spiele f r den rest der welt gro artig gemacht hat war schlicht und einfach der sport
7686662 spa ist der schl ssel in acht verr ckten brillanten minuten hat london die frage der welt beantwortet wie werden wir an pekings spektakul re olympische spiele ankn pfen nicht indem wir versuchen chinas gnadenlos durchorganisierten fehlerfrei pr sentierten das bankkonto sprengenden exhibitionismus nachzuahmen so toll das auch anzusehen war wir werden auf spa setzen
7686663 china der gigant der 100 medaillen in der schlussfeier bejubelt china seine erfolge aber wir d rfen nicht vergessen was sich hinter der fassade der perfekten und fr hlichen spiele zum beispiel in tibet abgespielt hat
7686664 der vorhang ist gefallen china ist der gro e sieger seiner ersten spiele
7686665 china siegreich auf der ganzen linie die freude am letzten tag der spiele war sp rbar aber auch die erleichterung die freiwilligen helfer weinten vor gl ck die polizisten wirkten ersch pft
7686666 wie ein feuerwerk nach 16 tagen hervorragender wettk mpfe sind die 29 olympischen spiele in einem gigantischen fest zu ende gegangen china ist mit 100 medaillen davon 51 goldmedaillen olympischer weltmeister geworden seine athleten tapfere sportliche soldaten haben ihre aufgabe erf llt
7686667 die organisation war ohne fehl und tadel die sportanlagen die er ffnungs und abschlussfeier waren beeindruckend dennoch kommt man nicht umhin die festnahmen ausl ndischer aktivisten zu bem ngeln die gegen die lage in tibet protestierten
7686668 die olympischen spiele in peking waren ein unbestreitbarer erfolg f r china und sein totalit res regime f r den westen bleiben ein bitterer beigeschmack und das gef hl des scheiterns was die freiheitsrechte in china betrifft hat man absolut nichts erreicht
7686669 london wird es schwer haben die spiele von peking zu bertreffen
7686670 auf wiedersehen an die etwas zu perfekten spiele man wird sich an peking als pr chtig erinnern aber ein volksfest war das bestimmt nicht
7686671 ob wohl auch das staatlich kontrollierte lachen der chinesen mit der schlussfeier in peking erloschen ist
7686672 china inszenierte alles selbst das wetter kritische stimmen geh rten nicht dazu daf r wurde der welt ein roter teppich ausgerollt
7686673 zwei wochen lang schaute die welt in das lachende gesicht eines vorz glichen gastgebers china eroberte viele herzen
7686674 niemand kann china aufhalten die olympischen spiele in peking hat die kommunistische partei chinas gewonnen der westen hat verloren
7686675 das vogelnest voll l chelnder gesichter china hat sich mit den olympischen spielen in peking die stellung als eine gro macht gesichert dass china die meisten goldmedaillen gewann ist ein symbol f r den aufstieg des landes
7686676 die olympischen spiele zeigten china in der zeit des wandels
7686677 es war schlicht unm glich so viele eindr cke aufzunehmen in einem einzelnen k rper war nicht gen gend platz f r einen derartigen wasserfall von gef hlen
7686678 mi objetivo es el r cord de espa a y la final

7686680 puede que llamarlo tristeza sea una manera de humanizarles pero s lo as podemos entender su comportamiento ante la ausencia de una prueba emp rica
7686681 los hom nidos gorilas orangutanes y chimpanc s sienten un afecto por sus cr as m s all de lo hormonal y un cari o humano por sus compa eros de manada
7686682 su comportamiento cambia al fallecer uno de ellos y eso significa que entienden la muerte
7686683 los procesos son m s complejos cuanto mayor es la inteligencia
7686684 pero ser a un grave error juzgar como acto de maldad que una gorila mate a su cr a porque no podemos extrapolar conceptos morales a la conducta animal
7686685 cuidar de los hijos no es instintivo se aprende de los padres
7686686 los animales son mucho m s complejos de lo que creemos
7686687 in our view this data is a strong indicator that performance of the mobile carriers network is affecting the iphone 3g more than the handset itself
7686688 altogether this furthers our thesis that its highly unlikely that apple is going to wave a magic wand and say 3g problems be gone with a software update
7686689 whilst we are pleased with the momentum in the business we are mindful that discretionary spending continues to be influenced by macro economic factors such as inflation fluctuating petrol prices interest rates and lower consumer confidence levels
7686690 australian food and liquor continues to perform well and big w petrol and consumer electronics have had a good start to the new financial year
7686691 new zealand supermarkets has experienced tight trading conditions as in the fourth quarter
7686692 our current focus is to maintain a capital structure that will preserve our capital strength and give us the flexibility to pursue further growth opportunities
7686693 our balance sheet debt profile and strength of our credit ratings ensure we are very well placed for future growth both organically and through acquisition
7686694 any international expansion would have full oversight from the board be undertaken in a prudent and disciplined fashion and meet the hurdles required for all our capital investment decisions
7686695 hope s this will serve as a useful data point for other independent developers we can make games that are unusual experimental or personal and theres a substantial audience out there who will play and enjoy them
7686696 his team should be getting 70 of the revenue from braid as of now that would be 577 500
7686697 if braid sold 100k copies it would net about 1m for the developers 400k to pay back loans another 400k to finance the next game and a 200k
7686698 the inflation figure of the first eight months of the year is still comparatively high particularly because of the increase in the prices of oil and gas
7686699 high inflation is now a global problem and vietnam is not an exception
7686700 thy shalt not look cock eyed at women that passeth by thee
7686701 hopefully by going digital with our music we can do our part to save a few trees in the process
7686702 if i invite others towards deen it would mean that i am better than them and more practical upon aspects of deen whereas the opposite is true

7686799 there are no doubts about who was the aggressor georgia attacked tskhinvali
7686800 america was arming georgia for five years and georgia tripled its military budget
7686801 the americans sent the wrong signal so that saakashvili could feel secure and unfortunately he still does today america supports him regardless of what he does
7686802 however we will use all our means to support them and make sure they can live in security and independence
7686803 the question of georgian nato membership is not something that has to just be decided in tbilisi but in all the capitals of the nato states it is a decision by all of nato a decision on what relations it wants with russia in the future
7686804 there is no more reliable supplier than russia sometimes transit countries dont behave but we have always met our commitments and kept our promises
7686805 all we are hearing at the moment are threats how russia will be kept out of the wto or kicked out of the g 8

7686857 the council has said they didnt want to have layoffs but personnel is 83 percent of the police departments budget
7686858 if the departments can cut their budgets a minimum of 5 percent maybe we can use reserves to stem the tide a while until we get a handle of whats going on
7686859 the council has eliminated some items and added others that werent included in the budget

7686874 my point is that state run institutions may take a catalyst role in pursuing these kinds of deals
7686875 i think that kdb might have considered forming and leading a consortium to buy lehman brothers but it appears burdensome for a state run institution to play a leading role in the purchase of a foreign company and take risks which may be more than financial

7686891 with todays molasses prices being what they are we are struggling to make the 5 percent ethanol

7686893 as it stands today the main criteria is certainly an economic one
7686894 to some extent manufacturers will produce less ethanol at the present molasses price
7686895 the newer technologies all utilize enzymes or bacteria to break down cellulose and generate ethanol from that

7686906 the government had given the freedom for them to go on even without having been licensed

7686908 that is going to create more problems in terms of the rumors that get spread

7686914 for us as caregivers to horses it is critically important to recognise these very high rates of heat storage
7686915 even though we may perceive that warm humid conditions are not producing undue stress or strain in us they may certainly be resulting in strain in horses
7686916 horses are capable of producing large amounts of heat at high rates but compared to humans are a severe physical disadvantage in dissipating that heat
7686917 when heat stress periods are short the thermoregulatory abilities of the horse easily cope despite high rates of heat storage
7686918 however when body heat storage is prolonged such as can occur during prolonged exercise or transport dehydration ensues due to sweat losses of water and electrolytes
7686919 if continued heat stress can develop into heat strain which severely compromises health and well being and may be life threatening
7686920 the combination of high sweating rates and high sweat ion concentrations contribute to very high rates of ion losses during periods of heat stress
7686921 these losses need to be directly addressed if we are to sustain a state of high performance in equine athletes
7686922 based on the sweat data it is clear that prevention of dehydration during exercise requires ingestion of about 15 litres of water an hour with an appropriate mixture of electrolytes
7686923 but we have observed elite endurance horse rider combinations to be successful in achieving this over 100 mile 160km distances
7686924 getting a horse to drink a balanced electrolyte solution can be a challenge
7686925 initially the horse can be weaned on to a dilute electrolyte solution made by dissolving a small amount in the drinking water and this provided as the sole drinking choice
7686926 the concentration of the electrolyte solution can be gradually increased over a period of weeks
7686927 when riding longer distances and a rest break for drinking is desirable similarly prepare an electrolyte solution and remain until the horse has taken a drink the horse will learn that the activity will continue once a drink has been taken
7686928 patience and diligence are required on the part of the rider

7687002 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7687003 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7687004 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions

7687007 he said the situation with the symphony is different because council was asked to cough up 15 000 to support that feasibility study and he is connected to the process because of his previous role on the armouries re use subcommittee

7687009 there could even be expropriation so council will have a very active role
7687010 but hatfield said tuesday that councillors had sufficient opportunity to be apprised of the marina canal proposal at the mayors invitation before it became public knowledge

7687016 the federal government has been using its system of border checkpoints to greatly expand a database on travelers entering the country by collecting information on all u s citizens crossing by land compiling data that will be stored for 15 years and may be used in criminal and intelligence investigations under the system officials record name birth date gender date and time of crossing and a photo where available for u s travelers returning to the country by land sea or air
7687017 because of privacy concerns washington state earlier this year opted for the queries only approach
7687018 there was absolutely no way they should have the entire database
7687019 once you have data in a database you dont need it lends itself to unauthorized use
7687020 becker cautions however that despite good news there remain significant financial challenges associated with the consultant recommendations for the deck overlays when they are considered with other expected major bridge projects
7687021 the bridge deck is in excellent condition due to the diligent preventive maintenance program in place at the international bridge administration iba
7687022 our iba maintenance staff is to be commended for the great job they do to get the full service life out of the bridge deck
7687023 when we consider all of the combined costs for scheduled projects to keep the aging bridge and support facilities structurally sound and safe we are looking at expending over 60 million in the next 15 years
7687024 given that nearly 4 5 million of the 6 million annual toll revenue goes into the day to day operation and maintenance of the bridge we have little opportunity to put funds in reserve to meet these future needs

7687036 this study shows a consistent 20 increase in the risk of diabetes
7687037 it is important to stress that the reason for this is still not understood although it is possible that the caesarean section itself is responsible perhaps because babies born via that method are first exposed to bacteria originating from the hospital environment rather than to maternal bacteria
7687038 type 1 diabetes in childhood has become more prevalent across europe recently and the rate of this increase suggests that environmental factors are the cause
7687039 however despite much investigation these actual factors remain largely unknown
7687040 the findings of this study indicate that the way a baby is delivered could affect how likely it is to develop this condition later in life
7687041 the type of person we will be looking for is someone whose cup is always half full never half empty
7687042 someone who can laugh at themselves a strong team player who sees this as a lifetime opportunity and can tell a good joke to keep spirits up
7687043 above all else we want a candidate with a relentless passion to succeed whatever the adversity

7687054 i baptize you with water for repentance but after me will come one who is more powerful than i whose sandals i am not fit to carry he will baptize you with the holy spirit and with fire
7687055 jesus full of the holy spirit returned from the jordan and was led by the spirit
7687056 if you then though you are evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your father in heaven give the holy spirit to those who ask him
7687057 but the counselor the holy spirit whom the father will send in my name will teach you all things and will remind you of everything i have said to you
7687058 but when he the spirit of truth comes he will guide you into all truth he will not speak on his own he will speak only what he hears and he will tell you what is yet to come he will bring glory to me jesus by taking from what is mine and making it known to you
7687059 and with that he breathed on them and said receive the holy spirit
7687060 but you will receive power when the holy spirit comes on you and you will be my witnesses in jerusalem and in all judea and samaria and to the ends of the earth
7687061 when the day of pentecost came they were all together in one place
7687062 are not all these men who are speaking galileans then how is it that each of us hears them in his own native language parthians medes and elamites residents of mesopotamia judea and cappadocia pontus and asia phrygia and pamphylia egypt and the parts of libya near cyrene visitors from rome both jews and converts to judaism cretans and arabs we hear them declaring the wonders of god in our own tongues
7687063 fellow jews and all of you who live in jerusalem let me explain this to you listen carefully to what i say these men are not drunk as you suppose its only nine in the morning no this is what was spoken by the prophet joel in the last days god says i will pour out my spirit on all people your sons and daughters will prophesy your young men will see visions your old men will dream dreams even on my servants both men and women i will pour out my spirit in those days and they will prophesy
7687064 when the people heard this they were cut to the heart and said to peter and the other apostles brothers what shall we do peter replied repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit
7687065 we are witnesses of these things and so is the holy spirit whom god has given to those who obey him
7687066 when the apostles in jerusalem heard that samaria had accepted the word of god they sent peter and john to them when they arrived they prayed for them that they may receive the holy spirit because the holy spirit had not yet come on any of them they had simply been baptized into the name of the lord jesus then peter and john placed their hands on them and they received the holy spirit
7687067 and hope does not disappoint us because god has poured out his love into our hearts by the holy spirit whom he has given to us
7687068 the mind of sinful man is death bu the mind controlled by the spirit is life and peace
7687069 in the same way the spirit helps us in our weakness we do not know what we ought to pray for but the spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express and he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the spirit because the spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with gods will
7687070 for the kingdom of god is not a matter or eating and drinking but of righteousness peace and joy in the holy spirit
7687071 may the god of all hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the holy spirit
7687072 to be a minister of christ jesus to the gentiles with the priestly duty of proclaiming the gospel of god so that gentiles might become an offering acceptable to god sanctified by the holy spirit
7687073 now to each one the manifestation of the spirit is given for the common good to one there is given through the spirit the message of wisdom to another the message of knowledge by means of the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit to another gifts of healing by that one spirit to another miraculous powers to another prophecy to another distinguishing between spirits to another speaking in different kinds of tongues a and to still another the interpretation of tongues
7687074 and do not grieve the holy spirit of god with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption get rid of all bitterness rage and anger brawling and slander along with every form of malice
7687075 do not get drunk on wine which leads to debauchery instead be filled with the spirit

7687094 we will keep the best football players the ones that help our football team the most
7687095 whoever they are if we would keep four quarterbacks i would think we could keep five running backs
7687096 we have good competition there with players that have different skills and different styles of play they have all been effective for us in the past or given the opportunity lamont has had in his time here he has shown to be effective
7687097 heath laurence sammy kevin and lamont have all been productive with the ball in their hands either running it or catching it and in some cases returning it
7687098 it gave me a little bit more confidence in myself to let me know that once i put my mind to it i can go out and be a good back in the nfl
7687099 its just the point of being patient and going out there and doing what i do best
7687100 i didnt have doubts but it gets kind of frustrating knowing that you have the ability to play more than you have been playing its basically just sitting back and waiting my turn and waiting for when they called my name

7687105 cheney certainly has had a tougher view on russia than some others in the administration
7687106 would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community

7687108 tend to take a hard line in talking about the separation of church and state but their idea of separation often seems to work one way
7687109 in fact some officials also seem comfortable in the role of theologian nailed it and that warrants some interest not as a political issue but as a matter of accuracy and justice

7687111 as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
7687112 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation which is what pelosis ever so informed observations were based on even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
7687113 the blunter words of the great lutheran pastor dietrich bonhoeffer
7687114 the destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder
7687115 i love this keep repeating that you can hear the stiletto sliding across a rib will quickly learn from the historical record that from apostolic times the christian tradition overwhelmingly held that abortion was grievously evil in the absence of modern medical knowledge some of the early fathers held that abortion was homicide others that it was tantamount to homicide and various scholars theorized about when and how the unborn child might be animated or ensouled but none diminished the unique evil of abortion as an attack on life itself and the early church closely associated abortion with infanticide which some candidates apparently dont have a problem with but i digress in short from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong
7687116 we now know with biological certainty exactly when human life begins thus todays religious alibis for abortion and a so called right to choose are nothing more than that alibis that break radically with historic christian and catholic belief
7687117 abortion kills an unborn developing human life it is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it archbp chaput just called pelosis catholics who make excuses for it whether theyre famous or not fool only themselves and archbp chaput just said that she committed the sin of public scandal of those catholics who do sincerely seek to follow the gospel and live their catholic faith
7687118 the duty of the state and its officials is to
7687119 if an agency cant even supply for inspection a copy of its own internal policies for such things as how meetings are to be held something appears wrong with the way records are kept
7687120 unilaterally increased its hourly rates over the years without the authoritys formal approval and without applicable contract modifications
7687121 we believe the attorneys failure to effectively perform contracted services and reviews added to the problem of the authority improperly awarding over 3 3 million in contracts for goods and services and the resulting unnecessary financial and legal risks
7687122 terminate all of its current contracts with geiger rudquist nuss coon amp keen llp

7687157 in our view this data is a strong indicator that performance of the mobile carriers network is affecting the iphone 3g more than the handset itself

7687159 they are playing with fire because if they punch holes in the budget surplus the end result is it is harder for the reserve bank to reduce interest rates
7687160 there are a number of small and important measures to which we are opposed and as a matter of principle we will oppose them
7687161 are not narrowly tailored and therefore significantly chill core political speech protected by the first amendment

7687165 by my count thats about 20 pages to read and about 30 calls to make but after four days and counting mr ofarrell still hasnt uttered a word
7687166 hes either making no effort at all or simply misleading the public either way hes taking the community for granted
7687167 the greens felt very strongly that this will be a highly significant test of the opposition environmental and economic credibility

7687169 getting that many guys together for a concentrated time of worship bible time and connecting in small groups is no small challenge once again our retreat point man todd swank did an amazing job thanks rt along with all the members of his team the worship time was
7687170 and he was so passionate about it i asked him to do the middle part of the talk
7687171 this year we decided to have the guys do something as a group so we divided them into 12 groups we gave each group 400 cash

7687173 if were really going to move the needle to encourage people to change their commuting habits it seems to me its less about building trails and lanes to far flung

7687176 bike share program similar to token operated luggage carts at airports would allow commuters to use a token or credit card to borrow bikes from a light rail station to get to work then return it when they get on the train home
7687177 every year were seeing more people get on their bikes she said
7687178 whats happening is that the transit facilities were built to handle a certain number of riders the demand is surpassing that
7687179 largely uptapped federal funding as well as valley transportation authority money to build the network of barricaded bike lanes

7687188 i was wondering if maybe solar cells could be made with carbon nanotubes david said in a soft voice his head barely rising above the bottled water next to his box lunch
7687189 i mean carbon is cheap and ive seen self assembling molecules so i think it would be easy to make
7687190 ever since he was little david was a disassembler she said not a smasher
7687191 his first wish was to meet al gore said his dad derek a computer programmer

7687199 another problem well have with sending an astronaut to mars is their exposure to radiation thats something else you might think about
7687200 he has a wonderful imagination chu said after the lunch
7687201 these are really excellent ideas and we want to do everything we can to encourage his inventiveness
7687202 i dont know how much of that will be filled with words as opposed to applause kidding kidding
7687203 shes just a great friend and a really great person
7687204 last summer we stayed at the wynn for what seemed like a lifetime close to three weeks
7687205 we met at a banquet we got to talking and she really understands the game i told her id make a deal with her that if we won the gold medal id give it to her she thought i was kidding but i told her i had one already and the way they treated us at the wynn it was the least i could do

7687210 we were talking about it this morning you can be out there in one play and it can be over for you just like that

7687218 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7687219 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7687220 everything was going good until he started messing around on me

7687229 i think gold is finding its base here its mostly technical support holding prices above 820 any dips below 820 are seen as a buying opportunity
7687230 i guess the 800 psychological level support will come into play again i believe physical demand for gold is likely to remain good and perhaps the shortage may support the market a bit
7687231 if we start moving below 810 we will probably move to 800 very soon and perhaps gold could retest to the 770s again
7687232 near term support for platinum should come in around the 1 350 level and if we do move below those levels we could see another bout of selling towards 1 250 to 1 300
7687233 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7687234 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7687235 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7687236 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7687237 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7687238 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7687239 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7687240 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7687241 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7687242 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7687243 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7687244 your family history boasts a multigenerational line of composers musical performers and writers which has been traced in an unbroken line as far back as the 1600s
7687245 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7687246 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7687247 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7687248 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7687249 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7687250 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7687251 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7687252 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7687253 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7687254 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7687255 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7687256 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7687257 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7687258 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7687259 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7687260 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7687261 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7687262 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7687263 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7687264 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7687265 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7687266 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7687267 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7687268 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7687269 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7687270 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7687271 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7687272 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7687273 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7687274 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7687275 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7687276 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7687277 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7687278 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7687279 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7687280 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7687281 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7687282 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7687283 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7687284 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7687285 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7687286 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7687287 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
7687288 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
7687289 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
7687290 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7687291 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7687292 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7687293 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7687294 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7687295 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7687296 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7687297 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7687298 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7687299 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7687300 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7687301 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7687302 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7687303 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7687304 in order to make your little nose clearer more beautiful and full of happiness this product is necessary for your nose
7687305 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7687306 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7687307 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7687308 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
7687309 no one works for someone we all just work together
7687310 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
7687311 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7687312 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7687313 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7687314 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7687315 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7687316 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7687317 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7687318 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7687319 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7687320 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7687321 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7687322 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7687323 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7687324 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7687325 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7687326 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7687327 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7687328 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7687329 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7687330 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7687331 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7687332 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7687333 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7687334 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7687335 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7687336 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7687337 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7687338 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7687339 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7687340 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7687341 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7687342 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7687343 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7687344 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7687345 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7687346 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7687347 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7687348 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7687349 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7687350 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7687351 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7687352 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7687353 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7687354 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7687355 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7687356 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7687357 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7687358 this is a planning took where all things are going
7687359 je demande pardon aux supporteurs de laek mais je ne pouvais pas refuser une telle proposition
7687360 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
7687361 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7687362 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7687363 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7687364 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7687365 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7687366 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7687367 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7687368 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7687369 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7687370 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7687371 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7687372 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7687373 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7687374 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7687375 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7687376 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7687377 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7687378 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7687379 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7687380 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7687381 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7687382 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7687383 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7687384 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7687385 back at the hotel she got fussy again m figured out she is too action oriented for the hotel anymore so back out we went we walked quite a bit sometimes she would walk and sometimes we would carry her we found another item on our shopping list while we were out we also found some pretty vietnamese dresses we might buy thanh showed interest in the shopping center on the way back and since it is air conditioned we were all for it she really wanted to go up the down escalator she was so upset with me trying to pry my hand away and sitting down on the floor and refusing to leave at the bottom of the escalator we ran her over to the top of the escalator and she loved it but then she wanted to go back down it and so it continued
7687386 essentially we combined two critical messages into one simultaneous priority
7687387 the educational agenda was designed to help corporations and suppliers maximize cost savings and growth opportunities in the current economic environment while raising awareness of the worlds eco structure and social environment and the industrys responsibility to both
7687388 mainstreaming csr in business travel management the strategic role of the corporate travel industry
7687389 the time has come to set up an industry standard by which we can measure each vendors carbon footprint to enable corporate buyers to make informed purchase decisions
7687390 the process begins by gathering data on your institutions carbon footprint analyzing it to form the basis of a carbon management program which would include a travel emissions management strategy which then becomes the basis for benchmarking future emissions gains or reductions
7687391 trafficking in persons is an issue of public and private concern and private sector companies including those in the corporate travel industry have a key role to play in addressing this challenge the international organization for migration recommends that companies develop a corporate strategy for an anti trafficking policy that permeates all of their activities ensure that their personnel comply with the policy and encourage their business partners including suppliers to do likewise
7687392 specific preventive actions would include raising public awareness and instituting training programmes for personnel to improve identification of and responses to trafficking situations
7687393 specific actions to protect victims may include the provision of skills training employment opportunities and or the allocation of material resources to support their sustainable rehabilitation and reintegration
7687394 the early bird special offers travellers exceptional value for money especially for families during the second half of the christmas holidays
7687395 the bridge is a symbol of a much larger issue it symbolizes the need for renewal
7687396 ive never had someone make this kind of claim the facts are clear the congress street bridge has never been a priority of the city in the end its the citys decision
7687397 we met with shays personally he stated that it was a waste of money

7687400 when we began planning ie8 we took a hard look at our customers concerns about privacy on the web as evidenced by some of the comments on this blog during the ie7 days many users are concerned about so called over the shoulder privacy or the ability to control what their spouses friends kids and co workers might see

7687410 over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7687411 i had a pretty good suspicion that people who were well motivated would do well with the technique but you have to be committed to learning it for it to benefit you i suspected most folks might not be that committed and so we might not show terribly much
7687412 this is a good large trial it is good enough evidence for people to take it seriously
7687413 but at the moment the alexander technique is not available on the nhs
7687414 later he would get to the touchier part about how the minute changes in organisms that drive biological change arise spontaneously without direction
7687415 why is it that creationists always look so un evolved

7687420 there was discussion about the fact that the market has become increasingly competitive and that for us to be able to continue to maintain our level of competitiveness in australia we need to work with the government on future transitional assistance programs
7687421 mr mulally reiterated the significant investment that ford has made in australia over the past 82 plus years including recent significant investment such as the development of the all new falcon and the fact that australia is the global engineering lead of the corporations next global light pick up truck
7687422 that re emphasised our commitment to australia and that it is an ongoing commitment
7687423 this isnt a debate about interpretation its an error by the productivity commission

7687425 hospitality executives these days are very driven and want to learn how to practically apply theory
7687426 i had a lot of questions when it came to the revenue management control aspect especially the maintenance aspect which we take for granted the course showed me how to analyze the numbers to see how much better we can maximize our opportunities to make money

7687435 our overall goal was to build a stronger business and to improve shareholder returns by focusing on these key areas
7687436 flt continues to increase its scale in all countries while also developing a broader foundation
7687437 in addition to being one of the worlds leading leisure travel providers the company is now a significant and emerging presence in global corporate and wholesale travel
7687438 we see our diversity of both brands and geography as a platform for the future and a real strength
7687439 while some retailers in other sectors have reportedly encountered a shift in consumer sentiment demand for international travel remains buoyant
7687440 to capitalise on the opportunities we have identified we will continue to work closely with our global supplier network to develop and promote attractively priced product
7687441 flt starts the new financial year with significant momentum from 2007 08 a strong balance sheet and with foundations in place for further growth
7687442 while we do not expect to replicate the 30 40 per cent increases we have achieved in each of the past two years we will be disappointed if we do not increase pretax profit by 10 15 per cent
7687443 initially fuel surcharges were small additional charges that customers were required to pay to airlines to reflect unexpected and temporary fuel price increases
7687444 following years of accumulated rises fuel surcharges now amount to hundreds of dollars on most international routes and in various cases cost more than the actual airfare
7687445 surely the time has come for airlines to follow emirates lead by removing fuel surcharges completely and simply returning to the traditional system of incorporating fuel into the cost of the base airfare

7687460 the laws of time are bent millions of pounds spent on editorial bootcamps and truth and values waterboarding sessions are rendered unto dust and once again british television industry comes crashing to its knees
7687461 in relation to footage shown at the edinburgh television festivals alternative mactaggart lecture in a news package of the events surrounding liu xiangs olympic 110m hurdle heats and his subsequent withdrawal from the event due to injury a sequence of editing was mistakenly broadcast in the wrong order on some bbc news bulletins
7687462 after the event pictures showing the athletes intense frustration were sent to the news desk without time coding and were mistakenly edited into the report
7687463 while this did not alter the editorial direction of our reports we regret that these pictures were not shown in chronological order in the sports coverage of the event shots were shown in the correct order

7687468 one british soldier and we will make sure he is killed
7687469 the way to really show we are serious about providing products to them that are useful is through software

7687479 we have just opened a new runway at manchester and that took us almost 10 years
7687480 we would need another investor like an infrastructure group or sovereign fund we have made contacts with a few but have not yet held formal talks
7687481 i have seen valuations and not ones done by us of 380m for glasgow i think we would be somewhere in the middle
7687482 gatwick would only get that kind of valuation if it were unregulated and not subject to price controls with regulation even 2bn may be over egging it
7687483 its because of our use of stop and search and points of entry you would expect more arrests because were searching more people
7687484 it has all been going to plan and weve built on last years success
7687485 its a challenge but for many officers policing the carnival is something different to do for two days its a different challenge we want to stop the small minority from coming and spoiling it for everyone else
7687486 and we discovered an area where the countryside just looks similar to england with oak trees and other familiar locations
7687487 there may be issues with cost and the odd telegraph pole in the background but surely with the technology they have and a bit of camera work this wouldnt be a problem
7687488 fields have been enclosed railways built the english landscape has been completely transformed
7687489 obviously we had an unbelievable summer were just trying to make sure that one of us ends the summer off with a bang thats where it is now
7687490 i can only say that weve been working hard and hopefully our hard work will pay off
7687491 im all about my results and wish everyone the best of luck but im really down with me winning this tournament
7687492 im not used to it i still cannot really take a breather and realize whats going on im coming in and in a dreaming situation right now
7687493 when you want to win the goal is still the same and the pressure is still the same the goal is still continuing to improve my tennis and continuing to play a very good tournament thats the only goal
7687494 it will be interesting to see how he handles being the top seed
7687495 for five years i was expected to win every tournament i entered maybe now it changes a little bit rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7687496 we arent wiped out as a species in the span of a week
7687497 what would have happened if the president had gone and said right after 9 11 i have an energy policy

7687499 the success of beijing and the anticipated success of vancouver and london both of which are very attractive host locations set the bar for the next round of tv negotiations
7687500 i would anticipate that there will be serious bidding for the rights to future olympics
7687501 i dont think you really know if you are ready or not to win a grand slam
7687502 ive never been past the quarter finals before so whether im ready or not i dont know but ive put in enough work off the court to feel like i can do it physically now it just comes down to putting the game together for the whole two weeks
7687503 its not just because it was the final of a masters series but because it was against him who has got such a good record in finals especially on the american hard courts
7687504 when i come into these tournaments now i go on the court and im not worried so much about the outcome i know i can win against him and i can just go for it
7687505 my record against the top guys bar nadal is pretty good so whether my ranking is top five or not a lot of the other players im sure think that im one of the top players now and that for me is the most important thing
7687506 i dont think im particularly far away from beating him
7687507 each time ive played him on hard courts ive felt comfortable ive never felt that i was outclassed this is my best surface and once i do get stronger physically and my games going to get better over the next year or two years im sure ill beat him sooner rather than later
7687508 to try to win grand slams is the ultimate goal ive set myself
7687509 i dont think im ready to just breeze through a slam like a federer or a nadal but sometimes the seeds go out early and there are some upsets and you just have to make the most of it so yeah i think this is my best chance for winning a slam

7687521 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
7687522 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
7687523 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
7687524 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
7687525 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
7687526 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
7687527 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
7687528 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
7687529 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
7687530 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
7687531 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same

7687565 with this new data the predicted fastest 100 meter time would probably go down a little bit
7687566 the record then was about 9 79 and the model predicted these crazy times that by 2009 itd be down in the high 9 6s
7687567 i thought thats crazy its not going to progress that fast every day that i think about that i kick myself thats my penitence for doubting the numbers
7687568 predicting it is fine for the sake of kicks but its not a scientifically valid approach
7687569 you have to assume that everything that has happened in the past will continue in the future

7687572 the limits will be largely set by the rules of the ioc
7687573 its kind of an arms race with the regulators of the sport and the people trying to push the technology to the limits at some point here there must be a d tente where technology cant push us any further and the rules will restrict it

7687580 were happy for it to be in australia but i think everyone will miss rally new zealand
7687581 its hard to pull such a good rally out of the championship id prefer them both to be in instead of one of them missing out each year but thats the way the rules are
7687582 rally australia has always been a great event too and one of the favourites with the drivers its quite a different rally to new zealand but they are both so good to drive
7687583 i think its the nature of the roads its always good fun to drive its fast and flowing and its usually the fastest guy that wins
7687584 i would rather be fighting for first but its good to be in this position first is a long way away and weve set our goals for third in the championship
7687585 financials on both sides of the border mainly in the u s are leading the parade of the red side today
7687586 you need investor confidence that the financial system is intact and today its being questioned
7687587 we seem to have a lack of faith in the financial institutions that weve come to rely on over the last 40 or 50 years
7687588 it benefits the whole community we get half of the ticket sales and that goes to the three schools two fire brigades and the local club

7687596 within the legal boundaries of the country and keeping the project intact i am eager to have direct discussion with you so that a solution acceptable to all can be found out with an aim to safeguard the interests of the affected landloser families
7687597 i still believe the singur project will come up and opposition should come out and join hands with us for the sake of the youth of our state
7687598 come and talk on anything for the sake of development and industrialisation the project will create jobs it has not happened for a long time in west bengal
7687599 hes been saying i want to go to the big school
7687600 by the end of the day some of them are real cranky like us
7687601 my arms are hanging at my side im standing straight and tall my eyes are looking straight ahead im ready for the hall
7687602 if you cant open your milk youre going to raise your hand
7687603 are you sure youre supposed to be in kindergarten are you sure youre not supposed to be in first grade
7687604 you could have been married by now with three kids
7687605 in 31 days i will become the luckiest guy for the rest of my life you are and always will be my world
7687606 hes used to hanging out with me for a couple of hours before his sisters get home im going to have to make sure he gets enough sleep to handle school
7687607 i liked web because it showed me how long it takes to get from one end of campus to another and that we have plenty of time between classes
7687608 the best part of orientation was getting to meet the seniors who showed us around campus and got us pumped up about the school
7687609 its bad i dont even want to go to work
7687610 i was happy at first but now i dont want to leave him
7687611 i think the parents are as nervous as the children
7687612 it helps a lot when were at their house it allows them to show us some of their things
7687613 its good to give them a buddy and let them know they have a friend
7687614 its our first day of school and were happy youre here
7687615 i want to say a special welcome to our kindergarteners
7687616 thats really good you can color in the lines already can you color that tree what color are trees
7687617 kindergarten is fun because you get to learn a lot of things to read and learn how to count
7687618 in this grade you can see more growth than any other grade
7687619 and they always remember their kindergarten teacher so you want it to be a positive experience
7687620 i dont care about his beer i care about his intelligence
7687621 when the institutions rules are not followed then i will take immediate and appropriate action
7687622 all to learn from not doing right and make positive contributions to our program this season
7687623 when the network closes and it will well have jobs immediately because of the work we are making right now
7687624 do you mind your dancing while your dancing master is with you as you will be often under the necessity of dancing a minuet i would have you dance it very well remember that the graceful motion of the arms the giving of your hand and the putting off and putting on of your hat genteelly are the material parts of a gentlemans dancing but the greatest advantage of dancing well is that it necessarily teaches you to present yourself to sit stand and walk genteelly all of which are of real importance to a man of fashion a lady cannot refuse the invitation of a gentleman to dance unless she has already accepted that of another for she would be guilty of an incivility which might occasion trouble she would moreover seem to show contempt for him whom she refused and would expose herself to receive in secret an ill compliment from the mistress of the house ladies should avoid talking too much it will occasion remarks it has also a bad appearance to whisper continually in the ear of your partner in giving the hand for ladies chain or any other figures those dancing should wear a smile and accompany it with a polite inclination of the head in the manner of a salutation at the end of the dance the gentleman reconducts the lady to her place bows and thanks her for the honor which she has conferred she also bows in silence smiling with a gracious air a lady will not cross a ball room unattended a gentleman will not take a vacant seat next to a lady who is a stranger to him if she is an acquaintance he may do so with her permission never wait until the signal is given to take a partner for nothing is more impolite than to invite a lady hastily and when the dancers are already in their places it can be allowed only when the set is incomplete
7687625 the bottom line from my perspective is the surgery went well
7687626 right now its a rough day for him but everything went well
7687627 he was fixing to be a big part of this team and to go out there on that field and see this kid laying there after what he went through was tough
7687628 we were talking about it this morning you can be out there in one play and it can be over for you just like that
7687629 i talked to cedric the other day and he told me how well hes doing
7687630 were rooting for him and i just cant wait to see him walk through those practice gates
7687631 i think the guy will do a great job of managing our team and the team has responded really well to him and thats where we are going
7687632 weve worked extremely hard over the last two weeks and im proud to be a miami dolphin
7687633 i mean he doesnt know any of us from the man on the moon right now but he comes into the huddle and says give me your eyes
7687634 we didnt break the huddle good one time and he was like nah nah nah next time weve got to stand and break the huddle just stuff a veteran with great leadership would do its pretty exciting
7687635 he brings management skills to the table he can manage a game really well hes a little bit calmer in there hes seen more situations
7687636 nationwide its too new for us to go from a slap on the wrist to the death penalty
7687637 there had to be an intermediate step and thats what weve chosen here
7687638 it was kind of like if you foul a guy under the basket you get thrown out of the game
7687639 were proud of it and were going to live by it
7687640 obviously this is not the way you want it to happen but its an opportunity for a lot of guys and i am one of the guys who has to step up and take advantage of it
7687641 im more concerned with the team that we have right here in our locker room and that this team mentally prepares itself as best we can
7687642 as always well continue to research all of our options
7687643 i havent heard from anybody else so to say if i would or wouldnt is premature
7687644 as i know it he is probably on a beach somewhere sipping on some pina coladas so i doubt football is the first thing on his mind today
7687645 he has not been bouncing back and forth like brett favre
7687646 id say we still have to be careful with him and make sure hes ready to go in the regular season
7687647 weve waited a good while weve been real cautious with it were going to make sure hes 100 percent
7687648 the tape of the game will sway us one way or another or keep us on whoever we thought it should be in the first place
7687649 theyll be all right theyre playing around three pro bowlers so theyll be all right
7687650 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7687651 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7687652 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7687653 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
7687654 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower
7687655 there are a lot of beginners this is not a high powered league this is a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport
7687656 i have never seen behavior of a parent like the behavior jerichos mother exhibited wednesday night

7687691 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
7687692 if you thought you couldnt afford a hasselblad think again
7687693 we took care of what we felt it was necessary for our kids
7687694 that isnt what south garland has been about and is not what south garland will be about
7687695 in north america we lacked consistency and quality when we decided to elevate sheraton we wanted a brand that can compete with hilton or marriott
7687696 there was a time when sheraton was one of the leading brands
7687697 but it lagged in introducing new design and service concepts and developed a level of inconsistency
7687698 it took time to come up with a comprehensive plan to apply to so many properties
7687699 i find the sheraton brand to be old dull and totally run over
7687700 we found that sheraton has a higher percentage of women customers than any other starwood brand
7687701 we wanted a natural gathering place women travelers who wouldnt sit in the bar alone will be comfortable sitting in the link
7687702 could i ask a question and i really do respect your right to disagree and speak out
7687703 earlier in your speech you said abortion is murder of a baby supposing you get your wish and abortion is re criminalized should a woman who aborts her baby be subject to capital punishment
7687704 so why then would you support the death penalty for the murderer of a five year old girl but not for the murderer of a five month old womb baby to use your terminology it seems to me you really do think abortion is a lesser crime than murder
7687705 hey everybody raise your hands if you wanna kill a baby see no hands
7687706 margaret sanger was a racist and planned parenthood wants to lead a black genocide through aborting lil black babies
7687707 excuse me is it your position that the first african american candidate for president supports exterminating his own race
7687708 you mentioned that barack obama supports the killing of babies in the womb and you expressed your belief that the zygote is a full human being with all legal rights at the moment of conception right
7687709 that any reproductively fertile woman who is having unprotected sex without birth control has many of her eggs fertilized by sperm by your definintion sir every fertilized egg is a baby now most of those fertilized eggs get flushed out of the womans system during menstruation so are you trying to tell me you believe that every woman who ever soiled a kotex is a mass murderer
7687710 so it seems to me that my pro choice position in your opinion results in the death of one and your pro life position results in the death of three interesting

7687717 there has been a significant amount of what i would call hand holding and advisory services in guiding our tenants on the choices available should they need to make a decision
7687718 were having some very interesting conversations with clients in terms of whether they should be expanding in place and renew or relocate to a side street or go south a bit and try to save money
7687719 they took two floors got two terraces and saved 18 a foot
7687720 you have to take a risk that the tenant might not like it this turned out to be a home run
7687721 when recessionary language starts to buzz sublet space becomes more than a trickle on the market
7687722 were starting to see free rent in the picture we havent seen that phenomenon in six or seven years
7687723 the landlords are being a lot 2 0more aggressive a lot easier to deal with
7687724 three years ago a landlord would say were not doing anything other than carpet and paint if you want anything else you will have to pay for it free rent was non existent its changing
7687725 as brokers were trying to help them understand the expenses specifically of the buildings trying to negotiate the expense pass throughs or get a cap on those pass throughs
7687726 our research group projected the vacancy rate will increase to 18 percent by the end of the year from16 percent
7687727 part of the challenge i have with my clients is is now a good time to do an early lease renewal or wait awhile to see if the market deteriorates thats the kind of conversation im having with my clients companies are really looking for advice they want to know what is your strategy whats going to happen two to three years down the line
7687728 if you have a need now this is the time to get out into the markets

7687733 we sought some relief in the current broadcasting regulatory regime to allow multi channelling for our coverage of the olympic games
7687734 would we have jumped head first in multi channelling the olympic games if wed been allowed yes
7687735 we see our partnership with yahoo 7 as creating an online experience that complements our broadcast television business
7687736 the site was not designed to be a television channel for the olympic games
7687737 the capacity for free to air broadcasters to show anti siphoning listed sports on their digital multi channels is an issue that will be discussed in the 2009 review
7687738 the review is expected to take into account the changes brought about by emerging digital platforms

7687742 but thankfully i always carry a bible with me and that stopped the bullet clearly god saved me from being murdered by the socialist democrats
7687743 they want to recreate 68 which is a reference to the 1968 riots that took place
7687744 stop the torture stop the war so where is the propaganda fox actually got right in the middle of the march they only cut away when the crowd started chanting the f word which cant be used on live tv
7687745 to deprave or corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall
7687746 whether to the average person applying contemporary community standards the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest
7687747 this is ridiculous does faux news not understand what a protest demonstration is marching and chanting and carrying signs should be enough of a message unless of course griff cant read which is certainly possible

7687785 nesta diversa assembl ia de democratas um testemunho da for a e unidade do nosso partido e da frui o da nossa estrat gia de levar a disputa interna a todos os 50 estados
7687786 somos afinal todos democratas ent o pode demorar um pouco n o somos um partido que exige todos na linha somos diversos mas n o se enganem somos unificados
7687787 estou absolutamente convencido de que tanto hillary clinton quanto bill cinton entendem o que est em jogo
7687788 um l der em cujo bom senso e experi ncia possam confiar
7687789 the best thing here is there is no problem between different groups
7687790 if you ask people they say well we want to get away from that
7687791 but also they tend to live in a certain degree of separation you go to saida zeinab it will be not exclusively but mainly shias you go to jaramana its a lot of christians and some sunnis they tend to stay within their own communities
7687792 its been very clearly the policy of the syrian government not to encourage any sectarian problems by favoring one group over another
7687793 there is no difference between shia and sunni here we are all one heart in iraq only is where there are problems
7687794 in times of change learners inherit the earth while the learned find themselves equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists
7687795 well i cant leave a person alone right after she just tried to jump off a cliff
7687796 have you ever wondered how to make money online every day and on autopilot 24 7
7687797 the one on wheelers lane was the first one we did work to and we think it is important to have these facilities for dog owners
7687798 it encourages people to play with their dogs and the one in south dubbo is located right near a barbecue facility and playground so the entire family can get out and be involved
7687799 we have done a lot of work to the two facilities to ensure there is something there for the dogs to run around and enjoy because it is healthy for them to do that but by law they need to be restrained in public areas
7687800 we are more than happy with the success the local teams have had because it gives us a chance to put our facilities on show
7687801 group 11s commitment to having its grand finals at apex oval for the last few seasons has ensured it is the home of rugby league in the region and while we dont take that commitment for granted we are happy to have such a facility available
7687802 i understood that they ran out of money last december
7687803 at some point we have to say enough is enough at some point we have to ensure we get paid
7687804 i have no gripe with the hospital staff we have been working with them for a long time
7687805 sincerely apologised to creditors who have not received payment within agreed terms
7687806 gwahs endeavours to pay all of its creditors within agreed terms
7687807 however gwahs acknowledges that some creditors have not been paid within those terms as agreed
7687808 gwahs acknowledges the importance of local suppliers in providing services to their local health service
7687809 its not fair that the state government expects small businesses to fund the health system large businesses have lots of leverage and all the right contacts but small business is left to fend for themselves and secure payments
7687810 the rangers have been going around and getting people to take the rubbish off the footpath if they have placed it out too far in advance
7687811 this limits the amount of untidiness due to windblown litter and litter generated by scavenging
7687812 reduced significantly over the past five years such that it appears it is at a stable level
7687813 the clean up is obviously having the desired effect on rubbish reduction for residents since it is always a well supported service
7687814 the reality is sometimes a family doesnt have control of the child
7687815 if there are four or five kids and one is acting up i dont think its fair to take their payments
7687816 in walgett truancy was quite high but different programs were put in place and theyve had a real turnaround through positive reinforcement
7687817 we need to look at withdrawing payments from negligent parents who are not encouraging their children to attend school
7687818 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7687819 we will not accept to put the lives of our sons on the line by guaranteeing absolute immunity for anybody whether iraqis or foreigners
7687820 without the approval of the iraqi government and american forces
7687821 i dont know if they saw i saw a difference in them whereas they might have seen one in me when i talked to them about this is game week
7687822 man this is what its all about this is fun you know two a days are over our off season is over and were ready to go this is why you play football and you cant get excited in game week then youre in the wrong business
7687823 so i didnt give them a chance to show me what they had as much as i wanted to explain what this was all about how excited they should be
7687824 he gets down there and defensive end mike bennett had already left so now he is mad because mike left
7687825 he wasnt saying much anyways so he went back inside and i was sitting out there talking to associate athletic director for football operations tim cassidy like did i do something
7687826 i wasnt sure what was going on but cassidy was like nah its just game week hes going to be like that
7687827 im doing work now but wednesday or thursday itll start to hit me a little bit but you know its fun i mean its why we do this and you know you lay it out on the line out there and hope your preparation beats their preparation hope your coaching beats their coaching your players beat their players i will say this theyre a very well coached football team in all phases offense defense and special teams this is a good challenge for us
7687828 i tell you theyre not going to be intimidated coming into kyle field
7687829 theyve had opportunities in the past every year they play top teams in the country theyve played in front of a lot of great crowds going to tennessee or going to austin and playing games and playing well so that part of it wont happen theyll be ready to play theyre very well coached
7687830 from my perspective we are going to have to play our best game
7687831 they are not going to be intimidated by who we are or this place or anything
7687832 they play big time schools every year and play them well their best games of the year seem to come against the best teams this is the first game of the year so they are healthy they are excited and they are going to have a lot of energy we know its going to be a great contest
7687833 se espera que produzca acumulaciones de lluvia de entre cinco y siete pulgadas 12
7687834 if they convey that sense of passion and focus and they bring their own stories into it the issues will take care of themselves
7687835 but too often democrats think its an intellectual debate about policy nuances that aint it and thats why weve lost in the past sometimes weve got to make sure people understand who these people are
7687836 we are here for one purpose to give the party momentum going into the general election so that come november barack obama will become the president of the united states
7687837 now in a first for me im supporting a republican john mccain i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment
7687838 im here to tell you my name is hillary clinton and i do not support this message
7687839 if he wants to win the election he needs to get the vast majority of hillary supporters her strongest support is where hes weakest white working class men and women
7687840 they have to make those voters comfortable with barack obama have to make them think hes part of the american dream
7687841 there is no stronger surrogate for sen obama among senator clintons supporters than senator clinton
7687842 so we are confident as we come through this convention that our party will come together it might take a little time for some people to come around but we cant let the few voices distort the vast majority of her supporters that i do believe support senator obama
7687843 many are coming our way it will take a little longer

7687872 after working in the clinton administration in the department of commerce on internet privacy and online commerce issues hunter consulted for five years as an expert on these very same issues at a time of enormous expansion in online banking
7687873 he was not a lobbyist for mbna and his work had absolutely nothing to do with the bankruptcy bill zero nothing
7687874 took plenty of knocks from the largest employer in his state because he demanded changes
7687875 sen biden improved the bill for low income workers women and children there were times when he believed amendments on both sides would have blown up a bipartisan compromise backed by three quarters of the senate at those moments sen biden had to make the tough calls and he voted to pass a bill

7687884 now we just have to meet her said ilana goldman president of the womans campaign forum which recruits women to run for public office
7687885 was a tremendous success in showing the knowledge stamina intellect the political savvy that a woman can run for president come very close to winning and that the american people are ready for a woman president
7687886 my success as speaker of the house and the bigger step that hillary clinton has taken as president of the united states are not just about us theyre about breaking marble ceilings opening doors and leading the way for many many more women
7687887 i attribute it a great deal to the hillary factor
7687888 and her competence and resiliency and capacity have removed forever the question im shocked at how much it did remove it
7687889 i wonder if a woman could appear out of nowhere like barack obama and be taken seriously i somehow doubt it
7687890 hillary clinton has put the picture of a female president into peoples head but the bar for her is still higher
7687891 but the questions are gone we know a woman can be our commander in chief

7688001 they are for big oil and of big oil we are for new clean energy to create a new economy for the usa
7688002 it would mean for example in this current financial year a surplus of 20 billion instead of 21 5 billion
7688003 lets not be lectured by the labor party about fiscal rectitude they have nothing to tell us
7688004 they certainly dont have a mandate for these completely unjustifiable tax increases
7688005 what the government is actually doing is taxing australians now in an unjustifiable way in order to spend it later in order to buy their way back into office in 2010
7688006 but we are not going to vote for tax increases that we dont think the government has made the case for that are unjustifiable and simply increase prices for ordinary australians

7688008 since speaker pelosi has in her words studied the issue
7688009 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
7688010 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder
7688011 maybe ana lucia busted l a based ghost hustler miles during her pre crash lapd days and now the freighter folkster is seeing visions of the late tailie on the island

7688023 to make the faithful aware of the scope of this political instrument the constitution in the light of catholic convictions
7688024 is broad and detailed teaching on the foundations of our faith so that christians may understand and direct their lives by it
7688025 has neither the governments publicity apparatus nor the presidents popularity
7688026 the scenario is a complicated one for the president because if he makes comments denigrating or offending the church in any way he may hurt the feelings of believers

7688029 i would say to everybody whos listening the simple way to make sure no one ever experiences a welfare suspension is for people to comply with what i think is a parental obligation a legal obligation a moral obligation to enrol their child at school

7688040 the advantage of open source is that no single entity has authoritative control over a project
7688041 but one argument says open source is less secure and people can put bad things in it and thats true too

7688049 the savings they will get doing away with lunch in business class they will lose more than that when corporations yank business the challenging thing about business is that whether things are good or bad you have to invest in your product for the sake of keeping customers and to make it harder for competitors to catch up with you this does nothing to encourage people to pay more because you give more they really make me question whether the inmates have taken control of the asylum

7688158 a lot of the younger generation dont know anything about the miners strike or what happened at orgreave history is written by the victors
7688159 its part of our history and i would not be averse to the idea of some sort of plaque while its now known as waverley everybody knows it as orgreave
7688160 we want to leave it to local people to decide
7688161 the miners strike took a lot of forgetting they were not good days and a lot of miners never worked again what we really need to do is forget it
7688162 the coke works was the backdrop to the stand off between margaret thatcher and the national union of miners led by arthur scargill in 1984 known as the battle of orgreave
7688163 this important part of the sites history will be reflected through sensitive reminders so that the community that is created is rooted but not stuck in its past
7688164 we received the request for assistance from the humane society of parkersburg and the woods county sheriffs office on saturday after they executed a search warrant at the whispering oaks kennels we immediately began readying one of our er waggins for deployment to the scene
7688165 we are receiving a growing number of requests for emergency relief waggin support of these types of rescues as operators of low quality large scale breeding facilities are forced to relinquish dogs due to licensing violations cruelty charges or their desire to exit the business
7688166 hopefully the publicity generated by these types of events will educate prospective pet parents about the source of many pet shop puppies and prompt them to make more educated choices or consider adopting when choosing to bring a puppy into their home

7688172 la grande marcia della distruzione intellettuale proseguir tutto sar negato tutto diventer un credo e una posizione ragionevole negare le pietre della strada diventer un dogma religioso riaffermarle e una tesi razionale quella che ci vuole tutti immersi in un sogno sar una forma assennata di misticismo asserire che siamo tutti svegli fuochi verranno attizzati per testimoniare che due pi due fa quattro spade saranno sguainate per dimostrare che le foglie sono verdi in estate noi ci ritroveremo a difendere non solo le incredibili virt e lincredibile sensatezza della vita umana ma qualcosa di ancora pi incredibile questo immenso impossibile universo che ci fissa in volto combatteremo per i prodigi visibili come se fossero invisibili guarderemo lerba e i cieli impossibili con uno strano coraggio noi saremo tra quanti hanno visto eppure hanno creduto

7688179 if the leathernecks can stroll into the noisy fargodome and escape with a victory it would be a huge step toward westerns first valley championship since 2002
7688180 roehl a 5 foot 10 232 pound senior from west fargo n d is no 4 on the running back list he replaced steady kyle steffes and rushed for 1 431 yards and 21 tds as a first time starter in just 10 games he had three games of 200 or more yards including 263 against minnesota where he also showed off his speed a powerful tackle breaking runner between the tackles roehl finished eighth in payton award balloting
7688181 jangula a 6 foot 2 248 pound senior from williston n d jangula has earned a well deserved reputation as the lead blocker for roehl he also has developed into a capable receiver with 35 catches for 449 yards and five tds jangula was slowed by a knee injury early in 2006 limiting him to three games but was back at 100 last season he originally played linebacker for the bison before moving to fullback as a redshirt freshman
7688182 mertens has waited patiently behind four year starter steve walker and now appears ready to lead an offense with plenty of weapons mertens is considered to have a stronger arm than walker but he must prove his leadership ability to meet the high expectations the bison have this season

7688187 well i think malikis responding obviously to the domestic pressures and realities inside iraq
7688188 but the important point is that sen barack obama has been saying for years now that we need to set a clear predictable timeline that he believes we can responsibly withdraw our forces within 16 months and do so safely the iraqis are now saying theyre going to also insist on a timetable the bush administration has had to accommodate that position and john mccain is the outlier insisting he wants to stay in iraq indefinitely in permanent bases regardless of what the what the iraqis think
7688189 i cant just give you the rights you seek i wish i could i agree with everything youve said to me now go out and make me do it
7688190 the way to really show we are serious about providing products to them that are useful is through software
7688191 from what i gathered it made it easier for people to find their pictures and just various programs they installed and common things they used i have no problems doing that
7688192 on top of windows vista that enhances the customer experience
7688193 you can point to apple and see what can happen when you customize your software to hardware and create a unique experience
7688194 it gave me some ideas i wouldnt have tried on my own
7688195 i thought it was cool and it was a neat little discovery to find on my computer
7688196 shes the best stepmom sam lola and cassandra could ever hope for seeing her love and affection with those three i know she ll be an amazing mom
7688197 this is a massive amount of carbon emissions even for a top celebrity icon
7688198 however these emissions will be swamped by those caused by the crowds of concertgoers
7688199 nationals plans appear as far as anyone can tell is a giant leap backwards
7688200 the government has no opposition in principle to public private partnerships its a question of who pays and at what level
7688201 the question is how much bang you get for your buck its important to strike the incentives right
7688202 it is becoming more and more difficult to make money in fashion specifically in womens
7688203 by having collections at mass retailers the designers can use this income to fund their higher priced collections
7688204 can help expose plenty in a market that might not currently be familiar with it
7688205 rather than aiming to make clothes that no one has ever seen before kawakubos h amp m collection is very much comme des gar ons goes to its roots
7688206 they design for the runway and we do our work to commercialize the product we make the product look great but for a value price
7688207 what they represent is our vision to democratize fashion and design and bring it to the world
7688208 they have positioned themselves as the destination for the next big trend
7688209 to all of our family and friends we are pleased to announce that our little princess anja louise ambrosio mazur was born on sunday august 24 at 7 32 p m she is 6 3 pounds 2 86kg and absolutely perfect
7688210 she hasnt cried once except for a second when they pulled her out we have now felt a new kind of love and joy that we never knew existed
7688211 eventually theyll have to start sweeping a couple of series but i think the minimums got to be two out of three
7688212 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7688213 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7688214 the vice president will be delivering the word of americas support
7688215 that sends the message to the kremlin that it risks international isolation
7688216 mr cheney is widely viewed by the russian political elite as the toughest hawk on russia in the bush administration
7688217 it hasnt gone unanswered in fact id say its been loudly answered
7688218 i dont think theres any question that russias reputation has suffered since it took these disproportionate military steps in georgia
7688219 you have to remember that brazil took its biggest ever delegation to the olympics including the biggest number of women athletes
7688220 i think brazils performance was reasonable obviously as brazilians we want the country to win as many gold medals as possible however others also wanted to win
7688221 yo no dejo de conmoverme cada vez que recorro el pa s
7688222 hace un instante visit una peque a producci n caprina familiar cuando uno recorre el pa s profundo puede conocer en serio a los peque os productores agropecuarios y comprende entonces la diversidad y la complejidad de un pa s tan desigual en sus regiones
7688223 no tener que estar pendiente del cami n que viene esas cosas que no se conocen en las grandes ciudades pero que se sufren en el pa s profundo al que le falta siempre casi todo
7688224 tal vez ustedes como tantos otros habitantes de la argentina profunda tendr an que estar enojados reclamando pero no siempre est n apoyando y diciendo adelante a no aflojar a seguir trabajando
7688225 claro que s los santiague os y los salte os y todos los hombres y mujeres que aman profundamente a su pa s porque saben qu ustedes adem s de amar a santiago se sienten orgullosos de ser argentinos
7688226 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
7688227 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and senator st augustine said at three months we dont know
7688228 the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose roe v wade talks about very clear definitions of when the child first trimester certain considerations second trimester not so third trimester theres very clear distinctions this isnt about abortion on demand its about a careful careful consideration of all factors and to that a woman has to make with her doctor and her god
7688229 the catholic church at the moment feels very strongly that it begins at the point of conception
7688230 given that they have so far shown little willingness to fund programs outside the traditional purview of public health
7688231 if we could prevent these infections in the first place or detect them sooner we might one day be able to prevent some of these premature births
7688232 to find that this amniotic compartment which we have traditionally viewed as somewhat sacrosanct is infected significantly more often than we thought is a little shocking
7688233 weve become very good at growing some bacterial species what might be called the weeds of the microbial world
7688234 but many other species cant be cultured by current methods
7688235 although we know now that humans should respect and even cherish their microbial symbionts
7688236 this type of infection reflects a situation in which our microbial companions have overstepped their bounds something has gone awry with this balance
7688237 the next generation cannot be saved without changing the generations who have already reached adulthood
7688238 we dont understand the purpose of sleep but it must be important because all animals do it
7688239 the very fact that dolphins have developed the remarkable specialization rather than merely getting rid of sleep altogether should count as evidence that sleep must serve some essential function and cannot be eliminated
7688240 sleep may be the price you pay so your brain can be plastic the next day
7688241 while there may still be no consensus on why animals need to sleep it would seem that searching for a core function of sleep particularly at the cellular level is still a worthwhile exercise
7688242 the benefits of the program accrued very quickly and are very large
7688243 when adults stop smoking you see immediate benefits in heart disease with impacts on cancer and lung diseases starting to appear a year or two later
7688244 we confirmed these results with a wide range of model reliability tests and sensitivity analyses to make sure that the findings we found were not a result of some unobserved third factor
7688245 for example including differences between california and the control states on a variety of risk factors did not materially affect the results
7688246 the methods in this study can be used to forecast future costs and will provide important additional means for validating program evaluations that previously did not exist
7688247 large scale tobacco control programs should be an integral part of the medical cost containment that everyone agrees must be part of any health care reform
7688248 the advantage of open source is that no single entity has authoritative control over a project
7688249 but one argument says open source is less secure and people can put bad things in it and thats true too
7688250 although the major mechanism of bluetongue virus spread is undoubtedly that of culicoides midges feeding on infected ruminants growing the virus and then transmitting it to further susceptible animals other mechanisms may also be at work these may assume greater importance during the midge free season winter such as we in northern latitudes experience
7688251 experiments have revealed a toolbox of possible mechanisms with the potential to interact with and complement one another
7688252 before weaning the mother has the monopoly on providing resources directly to her offspring
7688253 after weaning the father directly provides a greater share of resources to his offspring
7688254 i dont have any sense that this will somehow lead to a cure for pws but it does present a new area for those interested in the disease to study and hopefully a new understanding of how the disease functions

7688260 i lived alone my mind was blank i needed time to think to get the memories from my mind
7688261 i like that you were listening to it while i was out
7688262 this study shows a consistent 20 increase in the risk of diabetes
7688263 it is important to stress that the reason for this is still not understood although it is possible that the caesarean section itself is responsible perhaps because babies born via that method are first exposed to bacteria originating from the hospital environment rather than to maternal bacteria
7688264 type 1 diabetes in childhood has become more prevalent across europe recently and the rate of this increase suggests that environmental factors are the cause
7688265 however despite much investigation these actual factors remain largely unknown
7688266 the findings of this study indicate that the way a baby is delivered could affect how likely it is to develop this condition later in life
7688267 profitability in the service sector is clearly under pressure this pressure initially confined mainly to consumer services such as hospitality and travel has spread to the professional and business services sector this reflects much tougher trading conditions for business and professional firms after a period when business trends had been holding up in the face of the slowing economy
7688268 obviously andys got the talent that the rest of us havent but its all relative to where we are at
7688269 not everything is just about the men there are girls working hard doing the same thing we are all busting our backsides we are all trying hard and we are all trying to achieve the same things
7688270 im like infatuated with the guy now we were in stamford and i had no idea who michael phelps was the whole olympic swimming team was in the same hotel as us before i even realised he was michael phelps i was like yeah he is hes really cute and i was having breakfast next to him on the next table but i just couldnt bring myself to say anything to him i was just in awe of him
7688271 i think each time i play a grand slam i always think that oh this could be my last time playing here
7688272 ive obviously learned that i have no idea what the future kind of holds and what will happen and i dont make decisions for the future any more from this day that im living in but sure im here i mean im so excited to be back here
7688273 i didnt think i would be back playing you never know how many more chances youll get to be playing here
7688274 we have never sent from these shores such a talented well resourced well prepared team of athletes
7688275 i have never seen such team spirit its a historic day for us the best result for team gb in 100 years
7688276 we were in first class chilling sipping the champers reclining on the seats
7688277 compared to the previous two olympics the atmosphere was better because of the range of medals we were getting from all different sports
7688278 it has been brilliant to try to compare this to what we might do in london casts a negative energy over it we achieved full stop we can look at what we might do in london in 2012 if it is less than what we did here so be it
7688279 in a months time i will have to get my head down and get training again with 5am starts so its more hard work
7688280 i blame myself for not saving mohammed but where i come from we are not used to this kind of thing happening at home we never need to defend ourselves like that
7688281 after i asked them to leave i noticed a police car pull up outside so i went over and spoke to the officers i asked them to keep an eye on the boys and they said they would then left less than an hour later mohammed who was like a brother to everyone here had been beaten the attack was completely unprovoked and without reason
7688282 this incident will be disastrous for britains relationship with the united arab emirates what parent will want to send their children here for the summer when they know things like this are happening
7688283 we are all deeply shocked at whats happened mohammed was everyones friend we cannot believe something like this could happen we will never come back here
7688284 the young man was a visitor to hastings and his death is tragic our thoughts are with his family

7688310 he was outstanding what a left foot he was just amazing
7688311 no one can take a free kick like con in the a league right now i dont care if youre joel griffiths or whoever no one could take a free kick like con
7688312 i didnt always score from free kicks i believe 20 or 30 were free kicks i think one of the best was against marconi at bob jane stadium i was nearly 40 metres out
7688313 exciting times and its good to pass on your knowledge now to the next generation
7688314 no one really knows what ive been doing for the last two or three years
7688315 i was up and down from melbourne to the gold coast but now i live here now ive got coaches who work for me and run the melbourne operation
7688316 i see my role is to get the message across to help the coaches help the kids perform technically
7688317 now what we have to do is we have to invest in good coaches my vision is how can i produce a player that will play world cup standard and how can i help him take the right steps
7688318 but you cant just train tuesdays and thursdays and expect to be a footballer i pride myself on telling the truth and the truth is if you want to get results youve got to put in the effort
7688319 mike peterson was a great coach he understands football and he played under cruyff and played with van basten
7688320 i was more of a technical player we still have fairly decent technical players but we do lack that especially at a young age
7688321 the biggest problem we face is that we dont have enough expert coaches and i consider myself expert in the area so i teach the basics but not just the basics but also the bio mechanics of it teaching both sides of the body
7688322 its never an easy one because of the generations you need to watch both
7688323 in my opinion the best national league team would probably dominate the current leaders of the a league were talking about the melbourne knights and adelaide city teams of the 1990s that was most of the national team certainly the backline
7688324 i played against adelaide city at middle park and you had alex tobin milan ivanovic paul shillabeer tony vidmar at the back and robbie zabica
7688325 i remember in the old nsl we had four or five teams like marconi melbourne knights south melbourne and adelaide city and youd look around and the whole field was stilted with a grade players and it was a great game
7688326 i dont think weve got that at the moment and weve got just eight teams i dont think weve got the same quality as we did before its very interesting
7688327 i dont know exactly why it is and why it isnt but thats the way i see it and a lot of people are a little bit scared to say it but the reality is thats how it is
7688328 i think i had a love hate relationship with the fans at south melbourne they loved me when i was there but hated me when i played against them
7688329 i think my career has given me happy and memorable moments which are special to me
7688330 i played with eidur gudjonsson and others at bolton and that was a great experience i won championships and played for my country
7688331 when i played i felt that i entertained people theyd go home and say wow but were not producing enough of that magic quality in players
7688332 i think we need a bit more of that these days
7688333 were here to tell people dont put all your hopes in obama
7688334 theres one candidate about change and the other ones not
7688335 the common message people have is that parties arent responsive to us
7688336 my father was a shift worker a worker for the city all his life
7688337 no silver spoons no magic just parents who tried their best to leave the next generation just a little bit better off i think our stories are the quintessential american stories
7688338 will demonstrate to all americans why we need barack obama and joe biden his vice presidential running mate in the white house
7688339 youll have a sense of who she is and what our values are and how were raising our kids and i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us he comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care they had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids
7688340 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7688341 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7688342 it would have been the same way if i had won and barack was here supporting the unity of the party
7688343 i think it recognises the importance of her race of 18 million people voting for her
7688344 he is going to have to reinforce his capacity for leadership
7688345 we will be looking for cues in what she says
7688346 the last few times she expressed support for obama people picked up that she still wants delegates to fight for her
7688347 my sense is that we will lose hundreds of delegates
7688348 i think after the election many of her supporters were in mourning
7688349 im not going to raise funds im not going to phone bank for him but i will vote
7688350 do not treat yourself for longer than 3 months without checking with your doctor so that your doctor can check your treatment is correct some products state this in their information leaflet but it is a sensible precaution for all of them
7688351 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
7688352 tenemos una larga deuda social y cultural con el pa s profundo
7688353 i wont be ruthless about trying to push on i dont want to hang on too long
7688354 i really enjoy it so providing i can hold my spot i will definitely be playing more one day cricket
7688355 its not like ive played 300 games i came late to one day cricket and have played about 150 161 games
7688356 i want to finish off the desire i have to play one day cricket without being selfish because its important the team has plenty of time to prepare for the next world cup
7688357 thats still a long way off but i wont be ruthless about trying to push on i dont want to hang on too long
7688358 in the short term its disappointing but in the longer term its really good because it gives me extra time to get right for india
7688359 india is a hugely challenging and iconic series there have been a lot of distractions lately with the rise of twenty20 cricket but the premium product is still test cricket and one of the premium events is playing india
7688360 how to get what money cant buy personal peace in a world of unrest
7688361 to know the peace of god in your life is one of the most wonderful things in the world yet many folk these days are seeking to find it by turning to eastern gurus and the new age movement
7688362 i am astonished that this wonderful message is not written about more and preached more often
7688363 nosso grande refor o est no departamento m dico temos de cinco a seis jogadores em recupera o e temos que esperar a volta deles o que n o pode num momento dif cil como este a gente se precipitar e trazer jogadores que somente ir o inchar o grupo
7688364 fiquei muito chateado com a atua o do time a equipe do atl tico mg n o um bom time e n s esper vamos um bom resultado
7688365 a sul americana n o prioridade e acho que o m rio s rgio deve at poupar alguns jogadores contra o s o paulo quarta feira
7688366 quem est falando deste jogador a imprensa em nenhum momento n s falamos em contrat lo nunca saiu de dentro do clube qualquer coment rio sobre ele
7688367 ap s o p ssimo resultado de hungaroring trabalhamos muito durante a pausa de ver o por isso esse p dio muito bom para todos da equipe esse foi o quinto p dio de kubica na temporada e o oitavo da equipe
7688368 we have continued to refine our brand proposition with significant investment in price merchandise range and quality during the year
7688369 we continue to make gains in market share with sold increases in key measures such as customer traffic basket size and items sold
7688370 in real growth terms this is an improvement on last year
7688371 motivational products create unrealistic expectations raising hopes only to dash them
7688372 we created our soul crushingly depressing demotivators designs so you can skip the delusions that motivational products induce and head straight for the disappointments that follow
7688373 when i choose to sin its like taking a spoonful of death because sin and death go together
7688374 40 year old cuddly bear who is looking for a buddy friend for fun
7688375 its like growing normal rice but uses up to 50 per cent less water
7688376 the privileges are not only in the economic sector but also in education and government administration
7688377 this is evident in article 153 of the constitution and should not be questioned
7688378 the achievement of bumiputeras cannot be separated from government policies like the new economic policy
7688379 people of other races also benefit either directly or indirectly as malays have to depend on others who had mastered the sector earlier
7688380 other races as minorities are focused and cooperate among themselves to think of ways to boost their achievement and they have succeeded they are bold in looking after and fighting for their rights
7688381 malays must think like a minority but at the same time must not be shy in showing their talents and excellence as the majority
7688382 the doctor must come forward and say that he is the one who has written it but he cant be contacted
7688383 this means you have to rule it out it does not confirm anything
7688384 of course the doctor has put his findings there and we respect his findings
7688385 he is the person who examined the patient and we do not question his findings but at the end of the day he advised the person to go to the kuala lumpur hospital
7688386 the hospital is to be blamed if people feel insecure about going there hospitals must ensure the security of patients records
7688387 malaysias forensic chemistry is certified by the us federal bureau of investigation
7688388 this is the first time i am hearing of this the dna lab reports
7688389 i dont know about it pending court cases should not be discussed especially on the evidence this would be contempt of court
7688390 i dont know why these people are talking about this issue it is not fair for me to comment or even speculate on it
7688391 it took me about 10 years to learn fiqh alone and i still refer matters to the hasyiah lanah al talibin which is consulted by muslim scholars worldwide it originates from mecca
7688392 whoever makes a decision on hukum without referring to credible authorities has a place in hell ready for him
7688393 it is not the mubahalah oath as stated in surah al imran verse 61 because that requires the consent of the two parties
7688394 the lifetime occurrence of depression in any country is between eight and 10 per cent and about nine per cent of malaysians suffer from major depression
7688395 like all other psychological conditions there is a stigma associated with the disease therefore people choose to ignore or keep quiet about it
7688396 this programme helps doctors realise that they need to have empathy and be sensitive when talking to depression patients depression patients tend to be very sensitive the programme also is an eye opener for patients family members and friends who are unaware of what they are suffering from like any form of chronic disease depression requires treatment
7688397 they view depression as a short term disorder when in actual fact treatment must continue for a very long time
7688398 patients should stop taking their medication only on doctors orders if the situation arises where they have been taking a particular anti depressant for a long time but no longer feel the effect of the medication instead of dropping it entirely they should consult their doctor first
7688399 the higher risk in women may be due partly to hormonal changes brought on by puberty menstruation menopause and pregnancy another high risk group are the elderly who have to adjust to being weaker and more prone to illnesses or who are lonely
7688400 women in the urban areas who are depressed experience marital discord and are less capable of mothering children
7688401 by the way part of being in the farm business is to make a business of it
7688402 it does not make sense for a special branch member to be detained under the isa the rumours have been around since the day he was arrested this is nonsense
7688403 i dont know why waytha moorthy is making such allegations it is only causing friction among the detained leaders which would lead to the destruction of the movement
7688404 waytha moorthy wanted to call off the rally but it was my husband who insisted it go on from then there was bad blood between the two
7688405 he wanted to play safe and avoid being implicated for organising or leading the rally
7688406 he ran away and allowed the other hindraf leaders to languish in jail
7688407 if he is going to accuse my husband of anything i challenge him to come back here and do it not from a foreign land
7688408 for the kota alam shah seat i had campaigned for my husband with my children
7688409 we have yet to receive a reply from the mbs office we are not against the project what we want is for the project along with current pig farm operations to be relocated to a more suitable location
7688410 this project is right in the middle of 17 or 18 malay villages even with the current operations there are already 600 000 pigs being reared there are more pigs than people in the area
7688411 we are proposing that the farm be relocated to an island such as pulau ketam or even pulau babi
7688412 i take the elevator when im leaving for work but i take the stairs when i get home thats a great cardio workout then i do a round of sit ups which i repeat in the morning
7688413 plus our environment isnt exactly how it was 15 years ago we have to take care of ourselves
7688414 i am sad that a malay would make this call what is our fault now uitm graduates are becoming victims when we were only defending our rights as enshrined in article 153
7688415 it can surpass 13 000 with the latest twist of events
7688416 only the older voters are split in choosing anwar the younger voters are solid
7688417 a lot of them think their rights are eroding under bn
7688418 you never know what hes going to do next he can reduce you to a giggling wreck because hes just so funny on screen and off
7688419 mike is great fun to work with but he also works incredibly hard writing making sure the jokes work understanding how he wants the movie to be shot looking at wardrobe how the film looks everything
7688420 he is such a master at this genre and it was a great pleasure to be there and see how he does it i learnt so much
7688421 hes a guy who is kind of into the self help business like a love doctor
7688422 being diverse and making diverse choices helps me not get pigeon holed doing horror comedy playing a superhero it mixes it up and people never know what to expect and it appeals to different demographics it is also interesting to try new things
7688423 in drama you can get people to put fake tears in your eyes and you can yell and scream and take it to this level but in comedy if its not funny its just not funny and then its dead silence
7688424 i play jane who owns a hockey team she has to be quite tough because shes around men all the time and one of our star players is having some romantic troubles and we call in the love guru to help with hilarious consequences
7688425 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7688426 and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
7688427 because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7688428 next time your students will do the same to you
7688429 the one thing you learn at the end of every lesson
7688430 the three warnings about serious adverse events associated with use of atypical antipsychotic agents in elderly people with dementia had a limited effect on the prescription rates of these agents
7688431 we also found that the overall rates of use of these drugs actually increased between the first warning in 2002 and the end of our follow up in 2007
7688432 this finding highlights the limited impact of warnings and suggests that more effective approaches are needed to protect vulnerable populations from potentially hazardous medications
7688433 health care warnings should provide accurate explicit and complete information about the risks and efficacy of the identified treatment in addition to providing the same information on alternative treatments
7688434 meiyou lutou de laoku zhiyou zaijia de xiangshou tak ada susahnya perjalanan cuma ada nikmatnya rumah tinggal
7688435 kalau menurutku amerika tak bakal menyerang iran iran itu kuat wilayahnya luas apalagi nanti malah memancing negara negara arab akan bersatu
7688436 betul itu sejak irak diserang timur tengah sudah mulai mengawasi gerak gerik amerika
7688437 kalau china sudah kuat taiwan pasti juga tunduk separatis xinjiang bungkam negara negara tetangga pun takut india apa lagi mereka harus mendapat pelajaran
7688438 i told him he would always be welcome in france
7688439 coinciding with the olympic games theres a certain kind of extremely brutal repression that continues to reign
7688440 wah anda hebat tapi saya belum jelas sebenarnya apa sih yang dikerjakan oleh seorang konsultan itu
7688441 wah susah menerangkannya soalnya memang bukan pekerjaan yang lazim tapi saya akan kasih anda contoh praktis saja biar jelas sekarang anggap saja saya konsultan anda oke
7688442 begini pertama tama saya perlu bertanya dulu apakah anda punya akuarium
7688443 nah kalau anda punya akuarium logisnya anda punya ikan kan
7688444 kalau pada binatang aja anda sayang apalagi pada anak anda anda pasti sangat menyayangi anak anda
7688445 betul sekali kegirangan saya mencintai anak saya lebih dari ikan
7688446 anda kok tahu saya memang punya istri yang cantik jelita
7688447 tentu saja saya tahu itu semua logis saja nah sekarang kesimpulannya jika anda punya istri dan anak berarti anda tidak impoten betul
7688448 tadi itu seorang konsultan saya diajari pekerjaan konsultan sebagai logic thinker
7688449 wah susah menjelaskannya soalnya bukan pekerjaan yang lazim sih saya berikan contoh prakteknya saja ya lagaknya kumat begini lho pertama tama saya perlu bertanya dahulu kamu punya akuarium nggak
7688450 building of approach roads may prove to be a tough task for the sjda as there are many houses and shops surrounding the basti
7688451 surveys are going on and the engineers are trying to find a way out once the problems are sorted out sjda will start the construction work
7688452 they have been facing problems commuting as there is no direct road between gurung basti and sevoke road
7688453 the construction of the 4th bridge would take excessive traffic burden off the 3rd mahananda bridge
7688454 with siliguri fast becoming the target of several high profile entrepreneurs there is a resultant swarming of people from outside and we cannot remain complacent as far as the transportation problem is concerned
7688455 we noticed that in order to avoid using gl number plates government departments are using passenger taxis since these taxis belong to our syndicates we will remove them from tomorrow the officials should either take out their own vehicles and use gl plates or come walking to office
7688456 we gave them enough time to replace the wb plates with gl number plates though most vehicles are using gl plates others are still adamant our picketers would blacken wb number plate on vehicles seen from tomorrow
7688457 government vehicles without gl plates are plying but this is not in response to their statement since government officials need to be ferried to and from the office these vehicles will ply tomorrow too as for their declaration we will look into it as and when the situation arises
7688458 how many pumas does it take to change a light bulb
7688459 when you get to the top of the mountain remember me
7688460 you have to remember that brazil took its biggest ever delegation to the olympics including the biggest number of women athletes
7688461 i think brazils performance was reasonable obviously as brazilians we want the country to win as many gold medals as possible however others also wanted to win
7688462 the first round is always difficult hopefully i will play better in the next round
7688463 i didnt play well here last year but in 2006 i played fine hopefully i will play better this year
7688464 i was trying to stay focussed as well as i could
7688465 its a matter of how fresh i can stay for this tournament
7688466 i want to get some rest and make sure i dont practise as much as i did in beijing i need to save some energy for this tournament
7688467 there have been some great performances from a lot of players this year but we dont have anything like justine who was able to win every single tournament
7688468 the welcome was absolutely fantastic as we pulled up the whole right side of the plane moved across to the left to see family and friends waving
7688469 on the war in iraq a catastrophic mistake that has cost thousands of lives and billions of dollars barack obama is right and john mccain is wrong
7688470 the bottom line from my perspective is the surgery went well
7688471 right now its a rough day for him but everything went well
7688472 he was fixing to be a big part of this team and to go out there on that field and see this kid laying there after what he went through was tough
7688473 we were talking about it this morning you can be out there in one play and it can be over for you just like that
7688474 i talked to cedric the other day and he told me how well hes doing
7688475 were rooting for him and i just cant wait to see him walk through those practice gates
7688476 hi just a quick update our new unit the modulator should be ready to go in about a week ive got the panel designed attached file and i was curious which people would prefer for interface jacks 1 4

7688478 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
7688479 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
7688480 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
7688481 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
7688482 well when ones lost i suppose its good advice to stay where you are until someone finds you but whod ever think to look for me here
7688483 the bottom line from my perspective is the surgery went well
7688484 right now its a rough day for him but everything went well
7688485 he was fixing to be a big part of this team and to go out there on that field and see this kid laying there after what he went through was tough

7688487 i talked to cedric the other day and he told me how well hes doing
7688488 were rooting for him and i just cant wait to see him walk through those practice gates
7688489 what do you plan on doing with your law degree
7688490 did you know you could do this or that without a law degree so attending law school isnt even a must for you
7688491 i think letter grades are more of a universal understanding
7688492 i grew up in a family where we always had newspapers and magazines all over the house and talked about current events at the dinner table
7688493 current events have been a part of my life for as long as i can remember
7688494 if were going to go by stereotypes these werent the kinds of people i would expect to have my back
7688495 these were people of all different faiths and walks of life it was moments like that that you remember
7688496 robert borks america is a land in which women would be forced into back alley abortions blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters rogue police could break down citizens doors in midnight raids school children could not be taught about evolution writers and artists would be censored at the whim of government and the doors of the federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens
7688497 would oppose the nomination and would lead the fight in the senate

7688499 divine breath was fierce in transit to my donna psyche sell gold bricks self
7688500 divine breath was fierce in transit to my donna psyche sell gold bricks self
7688501 divine breath was fierce in transit to my donna psyche sell gold bricks self
7688502 i may be wrong but i do think theyre avoiding the specifics of it
7688503 theyre running away at this point we have our challenger candidates talking about the issue
7688504 everybody in the state should have coverage at least as good as a legislator has
7688505 healthy wisconsin still might be the plan in the end but its clear that some people have concerns about the specifics
7688506 i believe healthy wisconsin will happen but thats the distant future
7688507 the problem weve always had is everyones second choice is nothing and thats unacceptable because the status quo is unacceptable
7688508 im not sure if this has been confirmed already or not but i was told the new dashboard would arrive in november
7688509 we have not yet announced the timing of the fall update
7688510 divine breath was fierce in transit to my donna psyche sell gold bricks self
7688511 reports are that she approached the ips iraqi police saying she had the vest on and didnt want to go through with it
7688512 if she was forced to put on the vest or if she did it voluntarily that is still being reviewed
7688513 the surrender of the suicide bomber indicates that the iraqis are continuing to reject al qaeda and its practices
7688514 what does it mean when i say i love someone what is love to me
7688515 it looks to me that it would be governor minner unless we go into the january 20 scenario
7688516 if the loser is carney its very easy to see governor minner who has endorsed him as her successor appointing him if he would like that office its a little harder to see if the loser is jack markell
7688517 we will not rest until all of the prisoners are released
7688518 the prisoners message is that they should not be forgotten
7688519 i will continue the struggle for our national goals the establishment of a palestinian state and the release of prisoners
7688520 releasing prisoners especially those involved in terrorist attacks is not simple
7688521 but we understand the importance of this to palestinian society and we hope to strengthen the moderate and pragmatic leadership
7688522 we continue to have the same goal which is to reach agreement by the end of the year
7688523 there is a lot of work ahead to do that and obviously its a complicated time but you know its always complicated out here
7688524 adjust your radios im fin to school ya yeah im a youngin yo but im about to move ya promise
7688525 my 40 year career as an english teacher and headmaster was rewarding i have a loving family and i live in one of the most beautiful places in the country
7688526 an important dream of mine has always been to write a novel
7688527 a friend gave me a copy of wittgensteins vienna an old victorian era guide book and that led me to my basic story which is about a contemporary character in san francisco who after getting hit on the head finds himself in turn of the century europe
7688528 even though i kept polishing my drafts i got more than my share of rejections
7688529 i received nine passes by publishers that year but kept my focus
7688530 when a new york agent accepted my book early last year i was both surprised and stunned
7688531 it is hard to categorize my book since some readers think it is a travel book others a piece of science fiction or a historical novel
7688532 but it doesnt really matter since the plot and characters seem to have connected with the public and for that i am extremely pleased and humble
7688533 i have always been surrounded by strong forceful women in my life mother sister wife and daughters in my 40 year career in education i have of course worked side by side with indelible women models and i can think of dozens of women in literature and movies who have enthralled me
7688534 hes truly humbled by the outpouring of support and wouldnt miss it for anything in the world
7688535 i was holding the medal for three days to make sure its not a dream its real
7688536 the trip gives us an opportunity to move forward both here in the u s government and also with our counterparts in europe who want to support georgias economic and military reconstruction
7688537 developments lately in georgia have increased the importance of this visit
7688538 to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7688539 cheney certainly has had a tougher view on russia than some others in the administration
7688540 would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
7688541 russias reputation has suffered since it took these disproportionate military steps in georgia
7688542 most of these dead bodies were children and women it took all morning to collect them
7688543 they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes
7688544 it was pretty clear cut for me that frankie is the guy
7688545 weve been interested in danny for a while now i consider him the best midfielder in the russian league and he can become a very useful member of our team i see danny as an attacking midfielder or winger
7688546 andrei is still with zenit and i am still not sure if he is going away
7688547 democr tico y participativo para salvar el pa s y la revoluci n de una posible revuelta social
7688548 poner al ser humano en el centro de la vida nacional
7688549 un conjunto de compa eros preocupados por el futuro del socialismo en cuba
7688550 al ser humano no al estado en el centro de la vida nacional
7688551 algunos que todo lo complican y entorpecen parecen interesados en que esto se hunda
7688552 la resistencia natural del tejido burocr tico s lo se le ha permitido presentar medidas aisladas algunas contraproducentes para perfeccionar el estatismo asalariado que se han unido al tradicional discurso de m s trabajo y sacrificio
7688553 to win in three sets is always a good result
7688554 i had some difficult moments but thats going to help me in the pressure moments
7688555 but i helped him a little bit today i played with a little bit less intensity than the last few months
7688556 i try to go round to round im not thinking any further than the second round right now
7688557 im a little bit more tired than usual the thing is to try to be good mentally and physically i think i am playing good tennis no
7688558 the problem is i played toronto cincinnati beijing then come back here so two times in two weeks ive had 12 hours of jet lag
7688559 bryan has been around a number of years now and he has been a good defenceman for quite some time
7688560 im excited about bryans willingness to come here on a tryout it will certainly pick up the competition level of what is going to take place in training camp
7688561 i have a lot going on but whenever im called on whenever the usta or whether its wimbledon or any of the grand slams call and they were having all the past champions get together to celebrate and have a parade or whatever i just love doing things like this
7688562 its part of my past that i want to still have it be part of my future too
7688563 i didnt have the pressure of playing at wimbledon as an english player i could come here and get on with it
7688564 the first year i got a wild card into the main draw and i had played juniors before thinking that i was out of league and that i was just so fortunate to be able to walk on the grounds
7688565 becoming a champion of it and then becoming a player with really good results and now coming back as a mom and as a former no 1 and the champion i mean its just all overwhelming
7688566 i thought i played pretty well considering i havent really played since april and had been injured
7688567 i knew i drew a tough opponent in the first round so im happy to have played the way i did and get through in the scoreline in the fashion i did
7688568 all of a sudden just right before the olympics it seemed to turn a corner
7688569 i have no idea what happened but it feels better now
7688570 now that ive started to work really hard off the court you go into the matches with sort of no excuses no worries
7688571 its a complete waste of time going on the court and finding reasons why you might lose the match and what have you you just go out there and fight for every single point because thats a complete waste of time putting the work in if youre not going to use it out on the court
7688572 havelocks behavior is shocking and there must be some type of psychological testing
7688573 i am glad that she made the decision to do a psychological evaluation because it was out of character for him
7688574 im just happy the judge is taking the time to set it right
7688575 you have destroyed the futures of my children so now i will reciprocate in kind
7688576 it will be swift and bloody no one destroys my dream no one
7688577 i think a lot of things go into having the ability to win a slam
7688578 talent gets you to a certain level and then the hard work starts to kick in and if youre not putting in the hard work youre not going to get the opportunities to win a grand slam
7688579 ive really stepped up my work load off the court and started travelling with a fitness trainer i think thats the big difference in my game and the reason why i have the potential to come through and win a slam
7688580 i think even though federer was still the favorite for wimbledon there were still guys that had a chance of doing some damage there
7688581 i think its really exciting for tennis theres obviously quite a few guys that have the potential to win it
7688582 id still say federer is one of the favourites but in terms of being unbeatable i think thats a mindset that isnt great if youre going on the court believing that you cant win against someone
7688583 i think its taken a few of the top guys to see federer lose to lower ranked players to start believing they can win against him
7688584 bryan has been around a number of years now he has been a good defenseman for quite some time
7688585 im excited about bryans willingness to come here on a tryout it will certainly pick up the competition level of what is going to take place in training camp anytime you can add a player like him
7688586 this is kind of an out of the blue thing it just kind of popped up over the last week to 10 days we are looking forward to seeing how he does
7688587 basically my agent tommy laidlaw talked to paul holmgren and thought that this was something that we felt would be a good situation for me to show what i have
7688588 i thank the flyers for giving me this opportunity to try out i am really looking forward to this i have been around for a while training camps are nothing new for me i like to come in and compete at a high level i want to show them that i can play and hopefully make the team and to be able to contribute and help out in any way i can
7688589 ill always remember it but the most important thing was that it earned us a big three points
7688590 after last week starting with a defeat at hull we really needed something from this game
7688591 of course i am frustrated but when you lose a game it is not always the solution to buy
7688592 we did not create enough chances and have to look at why and how we can do it better i didnt feel we were into the game right from the start and you cant be like that
7688593 we had problems as well to win our early games last year but we did win them and it made things easier now we have to respond
7688594 we had 60 minutes to respond after fulham scored but we did not create a lot and i dont know why
7688595 but lets not make comparisons with this team and last seasons team because it is not a lot different if it is better only the future will tell us that
7688596 im half black and half japanese i dont look very asian but have never not even as a child questioned that i am as much japanese as i am black american i was born in japan and moved to the us permanently in the first grade i describe myself as an obama campaign groupie following it from new hampshire to six other states ending in kentucky after i became involved in the obama campaign i joined my local democratic town committee and was recently appointed to my towns fair rent commission this is my first convention and my first campaign experience
7688597 wow this is real cool i have had a genuine earthquake experience
7688598 joes the american here with no earthquake experience ill shake things up in his office a bit so he really gets and idea of the real thing

7688603 first successful attempt to show how organic molecules might have been produced on the early earth
7688604 first successful attempt to show how organic molecules might have been produced on the early earth
7688605 when modern scientists changed the experimental conditions to reflect better knowledge of the earths early atmosphere they were able to produce most of the same building blocks
7688606 everything about the origin of life on earth is a mystery and it seems the more that is known the more acute the puzzles get
7688607 researchers are linking these cambrian groups using not only fossils but also data from developmental biology
7688608 pattern of macroevolution that is change from the form of a common ancestor is called morphological divergence homology is a similarity in one or more body parts in different organisms that share a common ancestor homologous structures provide very strong evidence of morphological divergence
7688609 similarity in characteristics resulting from common ancestry is known as homology and such anatomical signs of evolution are called homologous structures comparative anatomy is consistent with all other evidence in testifying to evolution
7688610 homology many organisms exhibit organs that are similar in structure to those in a recent common ancestor this is evidence of evolutionary relatedness
7688611 structures with different appearances and functions that all derived from the same body part in a common ancestor
7688612 internally similar structures are called homologous structures meaning that they have the same evolutionary origin despite possible differences in function studies of comparative anatomy have long been used to determine the relationships among organisms on the grounds that the more similar the internal structures of two species the more closely related the species must be that is the more recently they must have diverged from a common ancestor
7688613 common ancestry is inferred based on many sources of evidence
7688614 clarification of the phylogenetic i e evolutionary relationships of the major animal phyla has been an elusive problem with analyses based on different genes and even different analyses based on the same genes yielding a diversity of phylogenetic trees
7688615 the more recently species shared a common ancestor the more similar their embryological development
7688616 are radically different in such fundamental properties as egg size fertilization mechanisms cleavage patterns and gastrulation movements
7688617 the more recently species shared a common ancestor the more similar their embryological development
7688618 we do i think have the right to be both astonished and ashamed by the century of mindless recycling that has led to the persistence of these drawings in a large number if not a majority of modern textbooks
7688619 wellss claim that supposed ancestors are younger than archaeopteryx is false
7688620 the intervals of time that separate fossils are so huge that we cannot say anything definite about their possible connection through ancestry and descent
7688621 there is little persuasive evidence to support this explanation at the present time
7688622 alone invalidates kettlewells experiments as moths were released by placing them directly onto tree trunks
7688623 the scientific method consists of forming a hypothesis testing it and coming to an conclusion in order to examine the scientific method in more detail we will consider research performed by british scientist h b d kettlewell
7688624 it might take only between 12 and 20 droughts to change one species of finch into another
7688625 if droughts occur about once every ten years on the islands a new species of finch might arise in only about 200 years
7688626 a particularly compelling example of speciation a technical term for the origin of new species
7688627 throughout 150 years of the science of bacteriology there is no evidence that one species of bacteria has changed into another
7688628 when our leading scientists have to resort to the sort of distortion that would land a stock promoter in jail you know they are in trouble
7688629 a vivid example of one way mutation can provide variation for natural selection to work on
7688630 are such evident freaks that these monsters can be designated only as hopeless they are so utterly unbalanced that they would not have the slightest chance of escaping elimination
7688631 are a vivid example of one way mutation can provide variation for natural selection to work on
7688632 there is no encompassing theory of human evolution alas there never really has been
7688633 scientists have been trying to arrive at a consensus about modern human origins for more than a century why havent they been successful
7688634 between about 10 and 5 million years ago several thousand generations of living creatures can be fitted into a small box
7688635 a completely human invention created after the fact shaped to accord with human prejudices
7688636 evolution is not directed toward a final goal or state
7688637 humans represent just one tiny largely fortuitous and late arising twig on the enormously arborescent bush of life
7688638 are fundamentally not exceptional because we came from the same evolutionary source as every other species
7688639 darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist
7688640 i view all beings not as special creations but as the lineal descendants of some few beings
7688641 descent with modification from common ancestors is a scientific fact that is a hypothesis so well supported by evidence that we take it to be true the theory of evolution on the other hand is a complex body of statements well supported but still incomplete about the causes of evolution
7688642 the concept of evolution actually has two faces one fact one theory if we ask how all the organisms on earth have reached their present forms the answer is that they have evolved this answer is based on such an enormous coherent body of evidence that we must take it as a fact by contrast the other face of evolution the complex body of ideas about how evolution occurs is a theory
7688643 modern organisms descended with modification from pre existing life forms
7688644 virtually all biologists consider evolution to be a fact although debates still rage over the mechanisms of evolutionary change exceedingly few biologists dispute that evolution occurs why because an overwhelming body of evidence permits no other conclusion
7688645 over the course of human history two approaches have been taken to the study of life and other natural phenomena the first assumes that some events happen through the intervention of supernatural forces in contrast science adheres to the principle of natural causality all events can be traced to natural causes
7688646 by coupling undirected purposeless variation to the blind uncaring process of natural selection darwin made theological or spiritual explanations of the life processes superfluous
7688647 that provided a crucial plank to the platform of mechanism and materialism

7688658 through a glass darkly conceptual issues in modern human origins research
7688659 which i felt was denied or was it intentionally skipped
7688660 it will surely reflect the kind of publication ethics that an organization have and maintain
7688661 if they convey that sense of passion and focus and they bring their own stories into it the issues will take care of themselves
7688662 but too often democrats think its an intellectual debate about policy nuances that aint it and thats why weve lost in the past sometimes weve got to make sure people understand who these people are
7688663 theyre not going to listen to much on issues unless they feel that they know both of these candidates

7688685 what really fascinated me was that the photograph that defined him that won him the pulitzer and made him famous was the photograph that really plagued him
7688686 he felt that in taking that photograph he had vilified a decent man
7688687 he would always say nicky you and me our pictures stopped the war
7688688 those are the three most important war pictures ever taken
7688689 those are seared into the mind of anyone who has ever seen them and will be forever those pictures will be as powerful 200 years from now as they were at the time
7688690 like a lot of us who have made pictures of that nature you didnt ever want to have to make that picture in your life
7688691 im sorry i had to make it but it had to be done i think eddies thing was the same
7688692 if you got in his way woe to you because he would just run you over

7688700 the movie is supposed to teach us that the education of our children will mean the future of our planet all the action scenes had a goal they were supposed to be driven by either a metaphysical point of view or experience for the characters instead parts of the movie are like a bad episode of 24
7688701 we are going to be able to attract a certain level of talent but it will be in queens with queens prices
7688702 real estate is getting to the point now in manhattan and large chunks of brooklyn that small independent artists cant afford to live much less produce there
7688703 this is an area that is sorely in need of being cleaned up
7688704 the developers we feel have no interest in working with this community or even being a part of it and have no interest in assuring that kew gardens remains a great place to live
7688705 they only want a profit and to continue what has become the overdevelopment of queens
7688706 our building is not necessarily in the best of shape and we are concerned because of this construction
7688707 the zoning for this particular site is wrong the zoning should be changed to better reflect the character of the neighborhood and the traffic patterns that are here

7688746 today sites that people dont know they visited are in a position to create a profile about where and how they browse

7688750 in such a meeting we would be delighted to hear the governors suggestions as to how we can further improve to fulfill the governors challenge to us

7688754 agriprocessors has been in contact with the iowa department of labor ever since it raised the issue early this year it repeatedly asked the department to advise it of underage workers who may have fraudulently presented documents to work at the plant
7688755 the department did its own audit in april and did not find any underage workers the company policy is clear no one under 18 may be employed at the plant when it did learn of several underage workers in the plant they were immediately dismissed

7688817 even as both panels address the problems caused by the goverments deliberate mishandling and bad faith on the moa ad they should also discuss ways to immediately de escalate hostilities and ensure that human rights and international humanitarian law are respected in the midst of the armed conflict
7688818 the grp through the commission on human rights chr should conduct investigations on alleged violations of the armed forces of the philippines afp including indiscriminate arial and artillery bombings in milf controlled communities
7688819 as a liberation movement they are expected to adhere to conventions and protocols on human rights and international humanitarian law
7688820 historically and up to the present the afp has been the biggest violator of human rights and international humanitarian law
7688821 the latest escalation of the conflict is directly attributed to the governments lack of sincerity in the talks particularly its insidious plan to use the moa ad to push for charter change
7688822 defend every inch of our liberties and democratic rights from arroyo
7688823 arroyo is the real butcher of the bangsamoro people she has ployed on their genuine plight for self determination to propel her own political agenda the toiling masses and oppressed people of mindanao are now caught in a war field that arroyo and cohorts have instigated in the first place
7688824 arroyo is bound to unleash in full scale her war machine that is willing to destroy not only all what is left for the bangsamoro but all dents of democracy the filipino people have fought for
7688825 arroyo with the united states backing is setting up the grand stage to uphold and justify her urge for chacha and martial rule
7688826 it is up to us now to put a stop to this grand plot that will only perpetuate oppression and exploitation of the filipino people its time to unite to rise up and to crush our common enemy that is arroyo war machine

7688832 it was so easy for the ca justices to issue the temporary restraining order tro and eventually the writ of preliminary injunction how come theyve been so slow to decide on the constitutionality of the ordinance what gives
7688833 we do not want to lose faith in the countrys justice system but it seems that the ca justices in cagayan de oro are taking their own sweet time at the expense of our safety and the future of our children we are aghast at how lightly they treat this case when lives are seriously at stake
7688834 looking back at the timeline it is quite obvious that it was easy for the ca to come up with decisions that favored the interest of pbgea there was no single decision that ca gave in favor of the people opposed to aerial spraying and to the city government who passed that ordinance

7688853 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish and through trial and error i finally settled on the best type of spit for the task at hand
7688854 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing

7688864 razboiul a transmis o unda de soc prin intreg spatiul postsovietic si a declansat o dezbatere aprinsa despre rolul pe care rusia si occidentul il au in regiune
7688865 chiar daca negocierile vor fi reluate o transnistrie mult mai increzatoare in legitimitatea proprie sustinuta de rusia il va obliga pe voronin sa plateasca un pret mult mai mare pentru un acord inaintea terminarii ultimului sau mandat in martie
7688866 rusia si a justificat operatiunile militare din georgia prin faptul ca este de datoria sa sa isi apere cetatenii de peste hotare numerosi vecini ai rusiei se tem de faptul ca a fos creat un precedent periculos in contextul in care exista un numar semnificativ de pasapoarte rusesti prin tot spatiul ex sovietic inclusiv in statele baltice
7688867 in loc sa adopte masuri punitive ue ar trebui sa raspunda la demonstratia de forta oferita de rusia cu un angajament mult mai puternic pentru democratie prosperitate si securitate in zona in tot acest timp masurile dure impotriva moscovei ar trebui tinute pe masa in caz ca rusia rezista
7688868 dupa ce conducerea georgiei si a pierdut mintea toate problemele s au agravat si un conflict militar a izbucnit
7688869 si consider ca ar trebui sa gestionam si alte conflicte existente in acest context
7688870 multumesc lui dumnezeu in toti acesti ani am avut suficienta minte pentru a nu permite o deteriorare similara a situatiei
7688871 conflictele inghetate sint un adevarat vulcan care poate erupe oricind de aceea a lua in considerare ce s a intimplat in alta parte este util daca exista suficienta intelepciune sa nu permitem repetarea unor astfel de lucruri in tara noastra

7688874 the 4x100 metre relay holds a special place in my heart so to gear up with the team was very exciting once we saw our lane draw for the semifinal lane two against the jamaicans and brits everyone initially gulped but after some reflection and study of our previous races both individually and as a team we knew that we were capable of making the final waiting for the first semifinal to finish was nerve wracking to say the least not to mention having to watch four of the eight teams either be disqualified or drop the baton either way we knew that regardless of what happened in that section we had a plan and a goal and a little rain bad karma and 91 000 fans screaming in your ear wouldnt get in the way of accomplishing those goals once our first runner was called to the blocks was when i began to actually feel butterflies in my stomach truthfully for the first time since being at the olympics i felt no nervousness before the 200 metres runs the gun fired and the race was off after that everything is a blur once i handed it off to pierre our anchor leg i knew we were in the final and a tremendous wave of relief passed over me and a strong sense of belonging really set in after the race we went through the normal media mix zone where the press asked us all what our chances would be in the final and essentially we all answered the same way a medal
7688875 we saw the lane draw early that morning and instantly were excited lane six outside trinidad and jamaica and inside japan a perfect opportunity to get in the mix for a medal it seemed like the whole team was in good spirits and excited about the opportunity to show the world what we had to offer we had some great practice hand offs at the warmup track outside the birds nest and we knew we were ready to go once the final check in call was announced as we entered the marshalling tent the energy inside from the other teams was terrific the brasilians were shouting portugese war cries the jamaicans were all dancing the germans were still a very neat insight into how athletes from all around the world get pumped up when the officials brought the teams into the stadium the crowd noise was electrifying especially considering the chinese team snuck in for the eighth qualifying spot the day earlier as each member dispersed to their respective zones i knew that this was what ive always dreamed about an olympic final as the race time drew near i prepared my checkpoint and ran a few acceleration runs and felt great the gun was raised the runners became set and bang the race was off being on third leg never allows you much opportunity to evaluate the race there is really no time to however i knew something was a bit off between hank and anson and their exchange seemed delayed once anson reached my checkpoint we had really gotten out of the mix and behind the rest of the field i did everything i could to make up some ground on japan to the outside of us but once i handed it off to pierre the rest of the field had really began pulling from us jamaica went on to smash the previous world record by three tenths of a second which is a mile in track and field we finished with a seasons best of 38 66 and were sixth overall certainly not reflective of what our true potential was in the end i continue to count my blessing and thank my family friends coaches for the all support and time invested into myself and to this team making an olympic final was sensational now as a team we must go back to the drawing board to prepare for the world championships in berlin germany next july its been a wild ride and even after the race i couldnt think of a place id rather be then inside the olympic stadium

7688891 pacienta de 19 ani nu este un caz singular am mai avut pacienti cu diabet care aveau trei sau patru ani aceasta boala poate aparea oricind
7688892 am in gradina acasa de toate cum sa nu intind mina sa iau si eu un fruct sau ceva fac mincare pentru copii gust mereu pentru ca nu pot altfel
7688893 daca o fi sa mor atunci prefer sa mor cu piciorul meu nici cel mai rau dusman sa n aiba asa ceva
7688894 la un moment dat pacientii diabetici ajung la stadiul de neuropatie diabetica distrugerea ramificatiilor periferice nervoase ceea ce duce la anularea simturilor sfatul meu este ca toti pacientii diabetici sa si examineze picioarele cu mare atentie si sa evite sa umble descult sau cu papuci cu talpa subtire in aceasta boala picioarele sint cele mai importante pentru ca provoaca cele mai multe probleme picioarele trebuie protejate cu orice pret pentru ca am avut zeci de cazuri de amputari
7688895 ghinionul pacientului este ca diabetul este o boala lunga care nu doare decit foarte tirziu de asemenea plagile se vindeca foarte greu mai ales daca sint extinse de multe ori problemele la picioare duc la amputari din aproape in aproape nici pentru medici nu este usor
7688896 luam bataie de la sotul meu de cel putin trei ori pe zi iar in anul in care am gasit boala mi am ingropat mama tatal si fratele mai mic
7688897 m a si vazut la groapa insa am supravietuit si tot el s a dus inaintea mea am luat boala in ris ca sa nu o iau razna pina la urma am reusit sa ma obisnuiesc m am mai casatorit de doua ori nimic nu faci insa fara credinta in dumnezeu
7688898 din nefericire in ultimul timp a aparut o categorie noua de internati diabeticii parasiti de familie sint pacienti batrini din mediul rural care au copii plecati la munca in strainatate sau nu au pe nimeni aici care sa i ingrijeasca e o tragedie copiii ingrijesc batrini in spania pentru bani in loc sa si ingrijeasca propriii batrini
7688899 avem inregistrati pina acum aproximativ 30 000 de diabetici nu putem sti numarul exact pentru ca dintre acestia mai sint care au iesit din program au plecat in alte judete sau in strainatate sau din alte motive de asemenea aproximativ 25 30 dintre bolnavi folosesc insulina avem insulino dependenti cei care au folosit insulina din momentul descoperirii bolii si mai sint cei insulino tratati pacientii care au trecut la insulina dupa ani de tratament medicamentos o alta categorie este reprezentata de cei care au nevoie de insulina doar in anumite momente in special cind sufera diverse plagi
7688900 i heart lamp is a super size sculpture of grandmas living room floor lamp more than 30 feet tall the lamp sits on the playa as a reminder of the cushy living rooms that are the american dream for the mainstream but with a twist to fit other dreams made from a scavenged douglas fir pole and recycled box pipe and lumber this lamp besides being surrealistically large does not contain an electric light bulb this lamp is lit by a propane fire cannon that turns on the same way the light would when someone pulls the chain hanging from under the lampshade almost 20 feet in the air

7688906 arginine plays a role in numerous bodily functions l arginine reacts to form nitrogen monoxide no which is required to widen the lymphatic vessels and hence regulate blood flow through its ability to form no l arginine can also help regulate blood sugar and blood lipid levels tests have revealed that l arginine can also contribute towards improving the hearts pumping capacity l arginine also plays a key role in the hormone metabolism it is required for the release of growth hormones and insulin amino acids also contribute to an efficient immune system
7688907 the amino acid glycine also plays an important role in brain activity as well as being involved in the formation of vital biologically active compounds i e purine nucleotides heme creatine etc this amino acid also acts as a neurotransmitter inhibitor while controlling the formation processes of the fine motor systems of plastic processes and tonicity reactions in muscle tissue
7688908 this is why the preparation is widely used by neurologists for relieving increased muscle tonicity
7688909 as is the case with other amino acids the concentration of proline after application of the culture medium fell significantly due to the effects of igf i and insulin 52 the significant 15 n enrichment in 15n proline and the 15n transfer rate to 15n proline following the infusion of 2 15n glutamine correlate well with the described proline synthesis from glutamate and proline decomposition into glutamate 69 75 some 38 of proline is absorbed by the portal vein drained organs during the first passage 76 and some 80 90 is transformed into ornithine citrulline and arginine in the enterocytes 75 77 contrary to the previous notion it can therefore be assumed that proline is an intermediary product of the glutamine glutamate metabolism in the intestinal mucosa is subject to a higher metabolic rate and constitutes an important substrate for the synthesis of arginine ornithine and polyamines

7688911 interview with coach raphael lima age group coach of team weston aquatics
7688912 ambele societati sint vinovate dar din punctul meu de vedere luxten este cea mai vinovata la meciul cu steaua a fost o problema la instalatie au avut timp doua saptamini sa vada care este problema si sa o remedieze puteau sa faca toate procedurile expertul a spus ca proiectul este bun iar lucrarile au fost bine executate dar sistemul de functionare lasa de dorit
7688913 au fost manevre inutile si gresite facute inclusiv de hari orenstein expertul trebuie sa stabileasca daca in momentul in care reprezentantul luxten a intervenit era sau nu tensiune sint prea multe coincidente care conduc spre o intentie
7688914 de la breazu venea energie dar reprezentantul luxten nu trebuia sa decupleze si sa treaca pe manual daca ar fi lasat pe automat sistemul ar fi trecut total pe celalalt punct de la breazu in citeva minute si nocturna s ar fi reaprins asa mi a explicat expertul
7688915 sint fabulatii care nu au nici un punct de vedere tehnic s a semnat un process verbal unde am aratat exact ce s a intimplat mi am spus punctul de vedere eu ma aflam la stadion pentru asistenta tehnica primaria trebuia sa desemneze o persoana care sa intre in postul de transformare eu am vrut sa ajut nu am apasat butoane la intimplare am 33 de ani de experienta in domeniu cind am ajuns eu totul era decuplat nu era tensiune puteam sa joc si fotbal acolo am facut teste si am vazut ca nu este tensiune
7688916 cei de la e on ar fi trebuit sa fie acolo s a trimis o adresa de pe data de 21 august prin care solicitam asistenta tehnica apoi s a descoperit ca pe instalatia de alimentare a nocturnei de la parhon se alimenteaza si un cartier de locuinte e on ar fi trebuit sa ne ceara avizul pentru a face acest racord dar nici macar nu ne au anuntat nu au respectat contractul este posibil ca de acolo sa fi pornit problema
7688917 am constatat ca singurii care stiu adevarul sint cei de la pdl toata lumea cauta face verificari dar ei stiu deja au politizat totul fara nici un argument este o lipsa de fair play eu sper ca meciul sa fie reprogramat iar cheltuielile echipei farul sa fie suportate de luxten si e on
7688918 an de an legislatia contabila ne obliga sa facem reevaluarea datoriilor in valuta creditele noastre sint toate contractate in euro iar refinantarea pe care am facut o la mijlocul anului 2007 a ajuns la diferente de circa 15 fata de sfirsitul anului acestea insa inseamna pierderi financiare numai scriptic din punct de vedere operational sintem pe profit
7688919 cursul se actualizeaza in ultima zi lucratoare a anului de la momentul contractarii creditelor si pina la finele anului am avut parte de un curs nefavorabil daca la mijlocul anului trecut un euro era 3 1 lei la sfirsit acesta a ajuns la 3 6 lei intrucit acum a scazut din nou o sa iesim pe plus diferentele sint date de evolutia cursului valutar

7688987 why has ireland never produced an artist of the calibre of caravaggio
7688988 a possible answer slowly emerged as i followed the research of two young art historians their task was to check the provenance of two paintings by st john by caravaggio and their research took them to the archives of the mattei family here they unearthed a network of support and patronage that made it possible for an artist like caravaggio to create significant work in ireland this simply could not have happened after the battle of kinsale the old irish chieftains like the oneills and the odonnells left ireland for the continent the flight of the earls saw the end of the power exerted by those families who had been continuous leaders in ireland for many centuries its worth noting that as the oneills and the odonnells were preparing to leave ireland the mattei family who provided support for caravaggio when he first arrived in rome and commissioned many of his major works were consolidating their position as one of the richest and most powerful families in rome

7688999 were aggressively pursuing this senseless act of vandalism and were asking the community to help us out by providing any information they might have no matter how insignificant they might believe it to be
7689000 its unimaginable what motivates individuals to do something so senseless
7689001 i feel confident well receive information from the community that will lead us to an arrest
7689002 because of the nature of the case and because of all the publicity the case has gotten so far its one that cries out to be tried in front of a jury in a public forum
7689003 a lot of people have raised that particular issue and so we want to take the politics out of it and give her her day in court in a proper manner
7689004 i dont know how much of that will be filled with words as opposed to applause kidding kidding
7689005 i did until i ripped this little hole in it last month
7689006 minor has failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that he is not likely to pose a danger to the community if released
7689007 ignoring the committees decision is only one in a growing list of ways the white house and its allies have politicized judicial selection
7689008 he did everything for her he created her career he handpicked her to go to the texas supreme court when he was trying to take over the texas supreme court
7689009 he was looking for people to groom and raise money for and have in his pipeline rove went and plucked her out of obscurity she was an unknown lawyer in houston
7689010 rove signed on giving the candidate the seal of approval from the states corporate establishment
7689011 he did everything he needed to to promote her hes the guy who brought her name up to bush for the federal appointment
7689012 is the latest reward of a partnership that began a dozen years ago when a prominent texas conservative introduced her to karl rove who was at the time a political consultant and emerging kingmaker
7689013 a judge should avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all activities
7689014 i am writing to you because you are the only people who can help me prove that the bush justice departments prosecution of me and justice oliver diaz jr and judges wes teel and john whitfield was politically motivated
7689015 over the past few months it has become increasingly clear that karl rove political strategist for bush and other republicans conceived a strategy to dry up political money to democratic candidates which included using the justice department as an instrument to prosecute prominent democrats particularly trial lawyers
7689016 allegations of selective prosecution in our federal criminal justice system
7689017 for testimony about the politicization of the department of justice
7689018 that such a hearing would also end with an evidentiary confrontation against the white house itself
7689019 the appearance of impropriety even if none exists is as bad as actual impropriety
7689020 if clear wrongdoing by mr rove can be established then it would be time to take a closer look at those political ties
7689021 as more becomes clear about the strength of the relationship or roves involvement in wrongdoing then there is cause perhaps to revisit
7689022 i do think that the nature of the case comes into play and i do think extra care is warranted when the case is already under close public scrutiny
7689023 owen can sit on the appeal and a bail application unless roves conduct is an issue in either decision
7689024 for that to happen someone in the case would have to inject it most likely the defendant otherwise roves relationship to the case is just background noise so far as the law is concerned
7689025 courts sometimes say the perception of justice is as important as justice however the fact that owen has ties to rove owes her job to him perhaps is not sufficient to create a disqualifying perception if nothing rove did or did not do ever arises in the case as a subject for the court to address
7689026 when we followed her on the texas supreme court she was an activist jurist that was results oriented
7689027 her record suggests that she was keenly aware and sensitive to what side her bread was buttered on she threw out precedent out again and again to deliver decisions that benefited the business community that paid her bills
7689028 one thing that always troubled me about the prosecution of justice diaz was that i never understood what he was alleged to have done wrong
7689029 there were studies into whether cats and guinea pigs can be infected this was done when the original outbreak occurred in 1994
7689030 we did a survey of bat carers and tested them and none showed any exposure to the hendra virus
7689031 bats wont be culled they are a protected species and are an important part of the ecosystem
7689032 we are far better looking at how horses catch the virus
7689033 we are studying how the virus travels in bat populations and how it is related to the reproductive cycle
7689034 it would mean for example in this current financial year a surplus of 20 billion instead of 21 5 billion
7689035 lets not be lectured by the labor party about fiscal rectitude they have nothing to tell us
7689036 they certainly dont have a mandate for these completely unjustifiable tax increases
7689037 what the government is actually doing is taxing australians now in an unjustifiable way in order to spend it later in order to buy their way back into office in 2010
7689038 flight centre starts the new financial year with significant momentum from 2007 08 a strong balance sheet and with foundations in place for further growth acting chief executive shannon obrien said
7689039 while we do not expect to replicate the 30 per cent to 40 per cent increases we have achieved in each of the past two years we will be disappointed if we do not increase pre tax profit by 10 to 15 per cent
7689040 flight centre continues to increase its scale in all countries while also developing a broader foundation mr obrien said
7689041 in addition to being one of the worlds leading leisure travel providers the company is now a significant and emerging presence in global corporate and wholesale travel
7689042 we see our diversity of both brands and geography as a platform for the future and a real strength
7689043 whilst we are pleased with the momentum in the business we are mindful that discretionary spending continues to be influenced by macro economic factors such as inflation fluctuating petrol prices interest rates and lower consumer confidence levels it said
7689044 this investment continues to deliver gains in market share he said
7689045 australian food and liquor continues to perform well and big w petrol and consumer electronics have had a good start to the new financial year
7689046 new zealand supermarkets has experienced tight trading conditions as in the fourth quarter it said
7689047 our current focus is to maintain a capital structure that will preserve our capital strength and give us the flexibility to pursue further growth opportunities
7689048 our balance sheet debt profile and strength of our credit ratings ensure we are very well placed for future growth both organically and through acquisition
7689049 any international expansion would have full oversight from the board be undertaken in a prudent and disciplined fashion and meet the hurdles required for all our capital investment decisions it said
7689050 the july number that we just have hot off the press our internal inflation number in supermarkets in australia was 2 5 per cent mr luscombe said today
7689051 so its dropped mainly on the basis of extreme deflation in produce at the moment

7689053 global trading conditions for wine continue to be competitive but the category remains in solid growth mr johnston said
7689054 we have not been immune from industry wide pressures including an economic slow down in key markets and higher grape prices
7689055 foreign exchange movements in the 12 months to 30 june 2008 cut wine earnings by approximately 70 million and wine growth by 14 6 percentage points
7689056 put simply financial returns from wine have not met our expectations
7689057 we are making good progress with our wine review but wont be commenting on our analysis or conclusions until the review is completed
7689058 the impairment charges reflect revised growth expectations and the impact of exchange rate movements on the australian wine business the company said
7689059 the charges include write downs to intangibles inventory agriculture assets and property plant and equipment
7689060 the write down to bulk wine in australia and california adjusts the carrying value of inventory to net realisable value
7689061 continues with a rigorous process reporting directly to the chairman
7689062 the scope of the review is comprehensive and will amongst other things consider the optimal structure and operations of fosters wine business
7689063 fosters continues to expect the review to be completed by the end of 2008

7689099 the only way i can make any sense of this death to make any good come from this death is to make sure senator obama is our next president
7689100 he had an obligation to his country by attending west point and he would honor it he did say that if he had to go to iraq he was going to go do the best job he could and he did a damn good job

7689115 sen biden improved the bill for low income workers women and children there were times when he believed amendments on both sides would have blown up a bipartisan compromise backed by three quarters of the senate at those moments sen biden had to make the tough calls and he voted to pass a bill
7689116 what about him turn into a ball and roll around then u can really play bowling
7689117 i had a lot of things kind of open up for me and when the role of kenickie was offered its something that ive always wanted to do as a kid
7689118 when you give players creative control you have to expect theyre going to do the unexpected
7689119 some of its really good for what they were shooting for its amazingly explicit especially when those creations are animated we just have to make sure those people arent messing up the experience for others
7689120 you can play through the entire game without killing anything
7689121 its very challenging but its also very beneficial when the game initializes the relationships of other creatures or tribes or civilizations for the next level many of those relationships have to do with how aggressive those creatures perceive you to be
7689122 we werent thinking of the sims as a brand we were thinking of it as an offbeat computer game with spore we had the confidence that the players would always exceed our expectations if we gave them more creative control from day one weve been thinking about spore as a brand
7689123 you can apply that to almost any format i dont want to limit spore to just games theres a lot of other activities including books movies tv or whatever you can imagine that we could take it in if we think of it as a brand what that could look like is yet to be determined
7689124 spore on almost any platform is going to be different and tied to the unique aspects of that platform
7689125 sitting in front of a console is very different from sitting in front of a pc whether youre using a mouse or a ps3 controller or a wii wand that right off the bat is arguing for a somewhat different design
7689126 i bet serena will wear a lot of chunky jewelry because she always wears those simple tees with a pair of skinny jeans and boots
7689127 truthfully that generation the 14 to 18 year olds have kind of taken over
7689128 its all about them the consumer trends the music anywhere from the general trends on the street really gets translated into what women are wearing
7689129 im pretty confident that designers are looking at it its like theyre young beautiful and rich thats totally what those designers are designing for
7689130 a lot of denim high waisted denim and it had the influence of this super chic young girl upper east side that is very elite and privileged
7689131 i just saw a zara window that is totally imitating chuck basss looks from upcoming episodes that have been previewed on the web
7689132 blair is moving in a very art deco feel mirroring the paintings of tamara de lempicka
7689133 and serena feels like a klimt to me chuck bass ed westwick as a young sean connery circa hitchcocks marni
7689134 its unbelievable to me how the headband has made a resurgence
7689135 it goes with the whole preppy thing especially i think you see that on blair
7689136 the deep purple plum colour family is really really strong for fall
7689137 what i hope that teens watching the show will come away with as far as fashion inspiration is freedom to experiment with proportion colour and texture
7689138 jenny is the downtown girl but she doesnt have the money to wear the expensive clothes so she remakes them in her own cool way
7689139 like youre going to see a giant hair bow on blair or youre going to see a micro something
7689140 skinny skinny jeans skinny jacket a cool t shirt underneath
7689141 lets just get past her its easy i dont know why we never thought of it before

7689148 the allergic potential of these newly introduced microbial proteins is uncertain unpredictabel adn unstable
7689149 volatile memories such as sram and dram lose their information upon power off
7689150 that is why you have to wait some time during your pc is booting during that time the pc is reading the information from the hard disk and writes it into the non volatile chips on your pc
7689151 in our work we show that one can optimize the programming of the bits by proper selection of the parameters of the current pulses used for programming the bits
7689152 this allows devices to reliably write the bits by pulses of only one nanosecond duration using this technique future st mram spin torque mram could operate as fast as the fastest volatile memories
7689153 in the future st mram has a very broad field of applications
7689154 they are fast have a high storage density and are non volatile present memories do not offer this combination of features
7689155 here first gigabit prototypes have been produced however these st mram are not yet in production
7689156 like in all new technologies some technological issues still have to be solved before market introduction
7689157 if they convey that sense of passion and focus and they bring their own stories into it the issues will take care of themselves
7689158 but too often democrats think its an intellectual debate about policy nuances that aint it and thats why weve lost in the past sometimes weve got to make sure people understand who these people are

7689161 georgia back in the third century the king of georgia converted to christianity you see churches there that date back to the fourth and fifth century
7689162 even before the convention and even before the complete reconciliation that we need
7689163 but to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive

7689165 we are going into the future what did i walk into a time capsule

7689167 the last alice moore recordings were made during four sessions in 1937

7689175 este lbum es la mejor m sica que hicimos en los pasados 15 a os muchos de los lbumes que hicimos despu s del lbum negro ramos nosotros tratando de alejarnos de un sonido percibido de metallica eso fue lo correcto para nosotros en ese momento pero no sentimos que tengamos que hacer m s eso y para ser honesto es divertido tocar r pido ser heavy ahora todos estamos en el mismo canal con respecto a ello incluso ir m s a fondo diciendo que extra bamos tocar de esa manera creo que todos sabemos el peligro de convertirse en una banda que existe en el pasado creo que cualquier banda que ha estado ah tanto como nosotros tiene que enfrentarlo pero death magnetic va a probar a la gente que nunca perdimos nuestra habilidad de hacer un lbum como ste s lo elegimos que no y sostengo esas palabras

7689185 gentlemen we are going to relentlessly chase perfection knowing full well we will not catch it because nothing is perfect but we are going to relentlessly chase it because in the process we will catch excellence i am not remotely interested in just being good

7689190 in the livermore valley the smoke cleared quickly and did not accumulate the same weather patterns that bring the fog in from the bay also serve to clear the air of smoke thus there was imperceptible impact from the smoke
7689191 as for frost i saw my first frost damage in livermore in my 8 harvests here that too was minimal and the shoot tips grew through the frost and we have seen no yield or quality impact in our vineyards
7689192 in our monterey vineyards as in the livermore valley arroyo seco has windy afternoons which bring in cool air from the pacific clearing the air and all of our vineyards are on the banks of the arroyo seco river or reliz creek where cool air drains to the water protecting us from the frost

7689198 if we could prevent these infections in the first place or detect them sooner we might one day be able to prevent some of these premature births
7689199 to find that this amniotic compartment which we have traditionally viewed as somewhat sacrosanct is infected significantly more often than we thought is a little shocking
7689200 weve become very good at growing some bacterial species what might be called the weeds of the microbial world
7689201 but many other species cant be cultured by current methods
7689202 although we know now that humans should respect and even cherish their microbial symbionts
7689203 this type of infection reflects a situation in which our microbial companions have overstepped their bounds something has gone awry with this balance
7689204 during the summer wed kick three days in a row instead of seven like weve done in camp i overdid it at the start i should have upped it at the end of the summer

7689217 we are now in the budget planning process for 2009 and we hope to avoid a budget shortfall like we saw this year
7689218 unexpected rises in gasoline utilities and food have played a major role in our budget as well as with all our neighbors
7689219 its our business to be there when these situations occur but unfortunately we are faced with the same issues
7689220 we have 21 programs all together that help people with the costs of prescriptions with medical issues like diabetes and even with rides to the doctors office
7689221 the idea behind hope is its a clearing house of services information and assistance
7689222 we do what we can for people but if we cant help them ourselves we have the contacts and the resources to help them get the help they need
7689223 thats why we are offering contributors a chance to donate on a monthly basis
7689224 some folks might be able to do more month to month than they could all at one time
7689225 monthly contributions can help provide a sustainable income for funding our many programs and services
7689226 in our 17 years of helping people our greatest resource has been the support of generous people in our community we are reaching out again to ask our friends to help our less fortunate friends

7689243 we received the request for assistance from the humane society of parkersburg and the woods county sheriffs office on saturday after they executed a search warrant at the whispering oaks kennels we immediately began readying one of our er waggins for deployment to the scene
7689244 we are receiving a growing number of requests for emergency relief waggin support of these types of rescues as operators of low quality large scale breeding facilities are forced to relinquish dogs due to licensing violations cruelty charges or their desire to exit the business
7689245 hopefully the publicity generated by these types of events will educate prospective pet parents about the source of many pet shop puppies and prompt them to make more educated choices or consider adopting when choosing to bring a puppy into their home

7689260 so if you assess a point value for each year then the average starter this season is 4 38 a year ago that average is 3 92 so the starting lineup is almost a half year older across the board

7689262 in three years usf will be the best team in the conference
7689263 and best of all they dont have to clean up the mess a dog would leave on a public sidewalk or park
7689264 because dats can leap onto tables and countertops just like a cat they can get into pantries and gobble up your food
7689265 so its best to have child proof locks on your cabinet doors

7689268 holding the olympics was good in terms of china taking a more democratic path we believe this is an irreversible path
7689269 while the reformist open door policy is said to be making progress in china it is not always leaping forward
7689270 i think our friends in china have hosted a highly successful olympic games
7689271 lets remember that these games have been free of violence and this is a very uncertain world that we live in
7689272 i dont know of a single olympic games in recent history which has not generated controversy of one sort or another
7689273 when the chinese leadership sees the system questioned it does not respect basic freedoms as we know them that is why i am strictly against saying it is all good
7689274 the city has opened up and people are mixing like they did in moscow when i was there in 1980
7689275 it was maybe an opportunity missed for the chinese to demonstrate their willingness to be more open and to allow more freedom of speech freedom of religion while the world was watching
7689276 the chinese authorities and the ioc had an opportunity to demonstrate human rights improvements but in most respects they failed to deliver
7689277 forced evictions detention of activists and restrictions on journalists should not blight another olympics
7689278 the games was a historic climax of three decades of china opening to the world
7689279 it was also a moment for the world to take a new look at china
7689280 these intense rains may produce life threatening flash floods and mudslides
7689281 if we fail this time well quit and surrender the country to them when people dont care about us we wont have to care about them let others take over the country
7689282 as prime minister i am duty bound to keep law and order in the country demonstrations must be kept within legal limits if they go beyond those limits the law enforcers will take action
7689283 todays protest is an extraordinary one we will do everything possible to make sure the state mechanisms stop working but we will not do anything to cause trouble to the people
7689284 people have started to panic this is too much but i will try my utmost to be patient
7689285 police units will be in place to facilitate movement not to break up the rally
7689286 we will wait to see the situation before making any move
7689287 i am very certain that people at fifa and the confederation of african football caf are understanding enough not to sanction such a match
7689288 if anything we will still be mourning our president since the period has now been extended to 21 days
7689289 its our prayer as government that our request will be heard
7689290 i believe in his ideals and his proposals to lead this nation hes been a fighter for the hispanic community and i know hes the best candidate because hes been a fighter for the immigration issue
7689291 along with all the things that parents know are important for helping keep their kids healthy like washing hands and getting enough sleep flu vaccination should be right up there but this survey shows us that we still have a lot of educating to do
7689292 as a community we need to do a better job spreading the word about how important a yearly flu vaccine can be in helping protect kids and ourselves from influenza
7689293 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
7689294 hey buddy you gotta get that son of a outta here its going to bite one of my customers and im going to get sued
7689295 no no no its a tame alligator ill prove it to you
7689296 see i told you it was a tame alligator anybody else want to try it
7689297 yah id like to try it but i dont think i can hold my mouth open that long
7689298 after silence that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music
7689299 double dipping is not right because a phony dishonest way for lawmakers to give themselves pay raises is not right
7689300 it creates an almost impossible situation for the lawmaker to do whats right for his or her constituents
7689301 absolutely not unless the governor believes that every legislator that has any other source of employment should have that outlawed including his wife who now has a job that is paid for by state funds the level of hypocrisy is just unbelievable
7689302 the governor has been one to use political influence over peoples jobs that he controls when he sees fit to do so
7689303 but the governors idea would say its ok for a state legislator for example to be a doctor at northwestern memorial hospital but not at county hospital
7689304 she was doubting things about barack and i said come on board
7689305 he laughed and grabbed me and started laughing and i said no no what did you say
7689306 the idea that the litmus test for being black is whether you support barack obama im insulted by that
7689307 and thats why i walked back over to him to specifically ask him what did he say and if he had said doubting thomas that was his time to say it then
7689308 the president owes del marie an apology and he owes all the delegates an apology
7689309 if we can get hillary clinton supporters to support barack obama the ones who still arent the ones who are holding out he will win
7689310 even before the convention and even before the complete reconciliation that we need
7689311 the nomination is decided we have a vice president were going to work together and go forward
7689312 but to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7689313 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7689314 we are going into the future what did i walk into a time capsule
7689315 democrats will leave this denver convention unified organized and stronger than ever to take america in a new direction with barack obama and joe biden as president and vice president
7689316 republicans say john mccain has experience we say john mccain has the experience of being wrong
7689317 its a little dirty it still good its still good
7689318 its a little wet its still good its still good
7689319 its a little air born its still good its still good

7689327 we are looking forward to finding many block trading opportunities to help achieve superior results for our fundholders
7689328 we are so excited to have lifetimes involvement in what will be a historic caucus said mame reiley democratic womens caucus chair
7689329 that i live in a house owned by all the american people and that i have been given their trust
7689330 barack obama knows that we cant rebuild our economy without a well educated workforce he knows we wont find new sources of energy or discover a new cure for cancer unless we train the next generation of scientists and researchers he knows that nea is not for the status quo as our world has changed so have we and together we must change public education when barack obama is president he will expand access to early childhood education so all children are prepared to learn when they enter kindergarten hell help local school districts make class sizes smaller so every child receives individual attention he will tear down the financial barriers that prevent students from attending college he will work with teachers and other educational personnel treating us as allies instead of adversaries and he will support programs that help parents get involved barack obama knows we must hold schools accountable but he also knows the world is too complex and diverse to judge students by a single multiple choice high stakes test he understands that public education helped make this country great and he knows our nation cant afford to continue the failed policies of the past seven years

7689336 in our family hell always be known as uncle teddy more than any senator of his generation or perhaps any generation teddy has made life better for people in this country and around the world for 46 years he has been so much more than just a senator for the people of massachusetts hes been a senator for all who believe in a dream thats never died
7689337 i aint pro human because all humans aint pro black
7689338 on jan 20 2009 when senator obama becomes the next president of the united states it will be the second anniversary of my sons death
7689339 the only way i can make any sense of this death to make any good come from this death is to make sure senator obama is our next president
7689340 he had an obligation to his country by attending west point and he would honor it he did say that if he had to go to iraq he was going to go do the best job he could and he did a damn good job
7689341 theyre going to grow up without their father and thats probably my lifes mission with them to make sure they grow up to be a strong responsible man and woman
7689342 if we have a president with a heart and a brain yes

7689363 los pol ticos se est n percatando de que somos un buen grupo de votantes y que nos necesitan expres ernesto ackerman uno de los miembros de la directiva de la cl nica

7689365 ch vez apareci con la palabra cambio no lo investigaron adecuadamente y terminamos con ese desastre alega carmen teresa luengo miembro de la directiva del ivac y vecina de kendall la mayor a de los venezolanos de aqu reviven esa experiencia cuando oyen a obama

7689368 dado esperanza pero no ha escuchado lo mismo de obama
7689369 todos han notado que la oposici n al acuerdo es solamente una maniobra pol tica de los dem cratas para perjudicar al presidente bush dice varela
7689370 tengo fuertes convicciones dem cratas pero eso no quiere decir que estoy ciega frente a lo que est pasando
7689371 ese viaje es hist rico porque no puedo recordar que ning n candidato presidencial de estados unidos haya visitado latinoam rica durante la campa a dice nelson hincapi un dem crata local que tambi n piensa votar por mccain
7689372 estoy en la cerca en lo referente a mi voto pero me inclino hacia mccain debido a lo del libre comercio tengo muchas amistades que dependen de eso
7689373 est empezando con obama finalmente lo apoyar n porque el partido dem crata es un partido de inmigrantes apunta

7689375 lo dif cil en la primera ronda no es ganar si no jugar bien
7689376 siempre hablamos de la dificultad de las primeras rondas pero al final casi nunca se pierde para m lo realmente dif cil es jugar bien estos partidos porque aunque vengas con confianza cuando llegas a un torneo nuevo necesitas un periodo de adaptaci n porque las condiciones son distintas
7689377 en algunos momentos he jugado de manera correcta el saque ha estado bien pero creo que me ha faltado esa intensidad que es la manera en la que me gusta jugar

7689380 ive been well rested i pitched in lancaster last week and i started feeling good finally im stretching myself i came from korea and i threw almost 90 innings over there and now im feeling real good i know im not going to throw 95 mph again but im starting to pitch again if i keep the ball down im going to be good
7689381 ive got a lot of good memories from the atlantic league
7689382 i want to get a ring you see guys play 20 years and never get a ring and you see guys who get a ring their first year its disappointing sometimes
7689383 wow one thing is to be yourself ive also learned a lot of other things what i did in houston was great but then i struggled and they kicked me out never fall in love with a ballclub thats the way it is that the one thing i learned do not fall in love with a team because when youre not performing well finger snap they get you out of there i think thats the biggest thing i love the game but you cant get too comfortable with a ballclub manny ramirez is a good example i dont think theyre boston going to win anything now big papi cannot hit because hes got nobody protecting him youve got kevin youkilis dustin pedroia and mike lowell and i know one guy cannot win a championship but it takes one guy to create that fear i think theyre in trouble now tampa bay for me theyre for real thats my opinion
7689384 you can convey what you feel if you look each other in the eye when you talk
7689385 you wont understand how people youre talking to feel if you dont look them in the eye

7689389 the art of pickling predates recorded history its roots probably go deep into chinese culture we know that laborers on the great wall of china ate lunches of salted vegetables cleopatra valued pickles as a secret of beauty and health she introduced them to julius caesar and soon he added pickles to the daily diets of the roman legions and gladiators thinking pickles would help keep the men in top physical condition the new world was even named after a spanish pickle dealer americus vespucius early puritan settlers believed that pickles should be served daily as a sour reminder to be thankful for the sweet gifts of the land
7689390 vitamin a content of fresh produce is actually increased through the pickling process even though some of the vitamin c is decreased pickles still retain richer deposits of the vitamin than other processed foods vinegar prevents oxidation which allows the vitamin to escape from cut surfaces

7689394 this is bizarre but when you think about it it makes training so much more fun
7689395 the sport is also a symbolical mental liberation from the restraining yoke of being constantly within reach
7689396 its our nature to create fun happenings probably because our summers are so short
7689397 at first it was difficult to promote them as they were small local events where people did not speak any foreign language
7689398 but now they are raising the interest of foreign press and visitors probably because they are so different from anything else going in their own countries

7689467 the actions and efforts of our cadets exemplify their commitment to our coast guard and their country
7689468 they are learning now that life as a coast guard officer requires sacrifice and commitment but the rewards of saving a life or keeping drugs off our playgrounds are immeasurable its a pleasure to work with a dedicated and inspiring group of young men and women im proud of all they have accomplished during their short summer

7689470 sing a song of sixpence four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie
7689471 when the pie was opened the birds began to sing wasnt that a dainty dish to set before the king
7689472 in all likelihood those birds not only sang but flew briskly out at the assembled guests
7689473 certainly any pie eaten as the first meal of the day qualifies at the risk of adding a new chapter to the saga of the pie i offer the following response
7689474 work toward a professional parliament that will represent the true wishes of the people of zimbabwe
7689475 the beginning of power sharing not by consensus but by issue of the electoral weight
7689476 it gives them a significant amount of power to build the legislative assembly into a strong force for accountability one which is really going to force the executive mugabe to find a way to work with a parliament which may be led by hostile forces
7689477 it would be illegal for anyone to be arrested while they were proceeding to parliament
7689478 zanu pf are in a desperate attempt to try and stop or abort our victory
7689479 we are seeing a growing trend of people in early alzheimers who really retain the capacity to contribute
7689480 these are the voices of our mothers fathers sisters and brothers husbands and wives and they are telling us that alzheimers is a significant but not insurmountable problem
7689481 alzheimers is like a monster under the bed you have two choices you can either look under the bed and scope out the monster and see what tools you have to fight him or you can sit there and wait for him to come theres so much you can do if you know early on
7689482 it will almost certainly be these early stage patients who will lead the way toward new drugs since they are poised to benefit from them
7689483 have weakened the progressivity of their income taxes since the 1990s
7689484 providing enormous tax cuts to the very wealthy and leaving a lasting legacy of structural budget deficits
7689485 restoring some of the new york tax systems lost progressivity
7689486 should be part of the states effort to balance its budget

7689497 he was probably my favourite one because i felt he had a particular personality
7689498 trott was also very intuitive and his team had confidence in his decisions
7689499 walking along delivering the mail creates a kind of rhythm in thinking that may have helped him in cricket
7689500 he had one sleepy eye and that was something that attracted me to him
7689501 the other eye was kept focused on the job and i tried to capture this
7689502 its interesting how you can read something in a face and have it confirmed later by reading
7689503 he was a doctor born with a silver spoon in his mouth whereas trott was very humble
7689504 i became very aware of the difference between the two characters while working on this project

7689506 biden has been so critical in the past of obama not of him personally but of his foreign policy background and experience i certainly think thats going to be an issue i think senator bidens words during the primary will be looked at very closely and carefully now that he is barack obamas vp candidate

7689522 chevron and the other partners believe there will synergies that can be achieved by exxon operating the project
7689523 they already have a significant staffing component in atlantic canada and experience in operating in atlantic canada by virtue of their operation of the hibernia offshore oil project
7689524 all the partners are in agreement that we need to move as expeditiously as possible
7689525 maybe in a future update it will be fixed but its just
7689526 there is a lot of work occurring with relevant state government departments and with the council at cloncurry
7689527 i will be holding a meeting this week with the local member betty kiernan and relevant state government agencies to pull that work together so there are options being looked at but there is no overnight solution
7689528 theres been some studies apparently by previous governments of this i havent seen them which has said it may not work
7689529 but we want to have another look at it because its a positive constructive idea lets see if it works
7689530 when it comes to sports funding its not either or either community sport or elite sport well be doing both

7689532 at the moment three horses remain there one has tested positive to the virus
7689533 i would say to everybody whos listening the simple way to make sure no one ever experiences a welfare suspension is for people to comply with what i think is a parental obligation a legal obligation a moral obligation to enrol their child at school
7689534 if there is a welfare suspension people can fix that immediately and be back paid everything that theyve missed out on by getting their child enrolled and at school
7689535 we also know when we look at low education attainment in this country it tends to be correlated with low socio economic status
7689536 we didnt have a truancy problem when the state governments were enforcing truancy laws
7689537 thats the way it ought to be thats the way it always was
7689538 this is a half baked kevin rudd scheme to remedy the defects of the state labor governments
7689539 there were a lot of points raised which the ministers took down and have taken away and were going to have a good discussion in the caucus committee about it
7689540 certainly this issue of short term accommodation is an issue right across the northern territory and we are looking at how we can meet the needs of people who are moving in from remote communities particularly as a result of the federal intervention
7689541 it is really our concern that we dont want to turn alice springs into something like an aboriginal las vegas where you come to town and party on and you will be ok in winter cause you will be warm and ok in the summer because you will be cool because people have short term accommodation

7689561 is now the seat of individuals who were appointed illegally and that means that in the minds of many people the court symbolizes illegality
7689562 the fact that the process was flawed does not mean that the immigration judges selected through that process are unfit to serve
7689563 any judge who was appointed through a process that was not impartial should step down and go through the process again to make sure they should be reappointed
7689564 the so called loyal bushies that they stuffed into these positions will also have gotten away with it and will be there essentially indefinitely protected by civil service protections that they dont deserve

7689566 im excited about bryans willingness to come here on a tryout it will certainly pick up the competition level of what is going to take place in training camp
7689567 the welcome was absolutely fantastic as we pulled up the whole right side of the plane moved across to the left to see family and friends waving
7689568 it is an issue and its come about because of the change of priorities of women
7689569 a generation ago women were content to live in rural australia and marry the guy next door
7689570 what they wanted out of life was to get married and have kids the age of first confinement for women was 23 a generation on the age of first confinement is 31
7689571 women have gained eight years of freedom in their 20s and they arent hanging around rural australia they are travelling into cities for tertiary education and to develop and establish careers and when they migrate out of country towns it upsets the gender balance
7689572 i dont think guys these days have good manners they dont necessarily know how to be respectful
7689573 there are guys out there but the ones that approach you arent necessarily the ones you want but in defence of guys its really difficult for them some girls like old fashioned ways whereas others take offence to that these days the courting comes second to sex sadly
7689574 i used to be good looking but now i am not so maybe thats why i am single
7689575 we have shared a 20 year sister city relationship with chengdu and it is inspirational to see how the phoenix community came to the aid of our sister city during this difficult time
7689576 we were all affected by the chengdu earthquake and wanted to show our support in chinas relief efforts
7689577 in keeping with our corporate social responsibility charter to help children we chose to focus on supporting the rebuilding of schools with a donation to chengdus sister city phoenix to aid in this critical effort
7689578 donations will support current and future generations by helping to rebuild schools damaged in the earthquake
7689579 you cant be president the outrageous barriers to democracy in america
7689580 destructive national delusion that widespread up from the ground truly popular democracy both political and economic really exists in america

7689586 like most australian financial services companies our results for the last financial year were directly and indirectly impacted by external events he said
7689587 however underlying business performance and momentum was maintained and we are well placed to ride out any further deterioration in the market as well as take advantage of any improvement in the industry cycle

7689592 were not a price setter we usually follow so well follow appropriately
7689593 they obviously had a go at iag and they seem to have moved on from than he said
7689594 they recently bought pmi a mortgage insurer so i dont know what their strategy is with regards to acquisitions now
7689595 we wouldnt comment on market rumour but were quite confident that our business is performing strongly
7689596 based on the outlook and continuing good progress on integration the board anticipates the groups ordinary dividend for the full year to june 2009 will be maintained at 107 cents per share suncorp said
7689597 while i understand shareholders will be disappointed by the headline result management responded well to the external challenges we faced our business remains fundamentally sound and the outlook for the current financial year is positive he said in a statement

7689619 may their service not have been wasted and may they be forever remembered
7689620 my grandfather was born in bendigo and after the war was a schoolteacher who taught in bendigo schools and also at ravenwood north and lockwood
7689621 on good days he would ride his horse but if it was raining he took his jinker

7689623 then he was placed in charge of the hospital ship that came back to australia
7689624 we are so excited to have lifetimes involvement in what will be a historic caucus said mame reiley democratic womens caucus chair
7689625 barack obama knows that we cant rebuild our economy without a well educated workforce he knows we wont find new sources of energy or discover a new cure for cancer unless we train the next generation of scientists and researchers he knows that nea is not for the status quo as our world has changed so have we and together we must change public education when barack obama is president he will expand access to early childhood education so all children are prepared to learn when they enter kindergarten hell help local school districts make class sizes smaller so every child receives individual attention he will tear down the financial barriers that prevent students from attending college he will work with teachers and other educational personnel treating us as allies instead of adversaries and he will support programs that help parents get involved barack obama knows we must hold schools accountable but he also knows the world is too complex and diverse to judge students by a single multiple choice high stakes test he understands that public education helped make this country great and he knows our nation cant afford to continue the failed policies of the past seven years
7689626 that i live in a house owned by all the american people and that i have been given their trust
7689627 at the last political convention in denver 100 years ago women didnt have the right to vote
7689628 i thank lifetime cosmogirl and every woman counts for this awesome opportunity to learn from the real frontrunners and further my chances of being one in the future getting a woman in the white house is more possible now than its ever been
7689629 this is to remind us of the promise of what we want our country to become
7689630 at the last political convention in denver 100 years ago women didnt have the right to vote
7689631 when lifetime started the nonpartisan every woman counts campaign five election cycles ago the idea of a woman running for president seemed impossible to have witnessed it this year was unbelievable its great to have the young leaders of tomorrow here with women who are blazing the trail for the next generation
7689632 you hit on an important issue we have to increase education opportunities my mom worked in a sweatshop the place was dark and dirty and so noisy filled with women trying to make a living she wanted me to take advantage of education so i didnt need to do work like she did when women get involved in politics they change the agenda come on girls lets make ourselves heard dont be afraid to stand up
7689633 im blown away by the caliber of the future frontrunners and the depth of wisdom offered by visiting members of congress surely these winners will make large contributions to our world i say watch out
7689634 orbis approach is to tailor each of its programs to the educational needs of its hosts and the eye care needs of the local people
7689635 this residency specific program is an exciting new venture that will allow orbis to train the next generation of sight saving doctors and help china further grow its pool of human resources for fighting preventable blindness in the region

7689637 the three warnings about serious adverse events associated with use of atypical antipsychotic agents in elderly people with dementia had a limited effect on the prescription rates of these agents
7689638 we also found that the overall rates of use of these drugs actually increased between the first warning in 2002 and the end of our follow up in 2007
7689639 this finding highlights the limited impact of warnings and suggests that more effective approaches are needed to protect vulnerable populations from potentially hazardous medications
7689640 health care warnings should provide accurate explicit and complete information about the risks and efficacy of the identified treatment in addition to providing the same information on alternative treatments
7689641 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life
7689642 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7689643 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7689644 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7689645 nuns are above all women and beauty is a gift from god
7689646 this contest will be a way to show there isnt just the beauty we see on television but also a more discrete charm
7689647 you really think all nuns are old stunted and sad this isnt the case anymore thanks to the arrival in our country of young and vital nuns
7689648 i hope the next pageant wont just take place online but that we can organize a real show that can take place during the miss italy contest
7689649 its an initiative that belittles the role of nuns who have dedicated themselves to god
7689650 akhirnya ketika nabi yunus keluar dari perut ikan kaumnya sudah berubah amp mau beriman kepada allah
7689651 under republic act 9369 it is the policy of the state to ensure free orderly honest peaceful credible and informed elections and other similar electoral exercises by improving on the election process and adopting systems involving the use of an automated election system
7689652 while there is still room for improvement with respect to the system currently in place with the unprecedented voter turnout and speed with which the recent elections in the armm was conducted not to mention the diminished number of skirmishes during election day we have achieved a considerable part of the objective of the automation of elections
7689653 the aircraft has been missing since last night our search is concentrated in the davao area
7689654 the presence of the international community in afghanistan must be reviewed through a mutual agreement
7689655 the authorities and responsibilities of the international forces in afghanistan must be regulated through a status of force agreement consistent with both international and afghan laws
7689656 air strikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians must be stopped
7689657 unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids
7689658 arkansas needs to affirm the importance of married mothers and fathers
7689659 we need to publicly affirm the gold standard of rearing children whenever we can the state standard should be as close to that gold standard of married mom and dad homes as possible
7689660 were going to work very hard to defeat this because it is just bad policy for children
7689661 whys it so hard to love one another whys it so hard to love

7689667 trials may come to make me strong i must endure i must hold on yet still i rise never to give up
7689668 i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us and let me state what i think about their tactics and these ads i am hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7689669 i dont spend a lot of time worrying about stuff like that
7689670 we have to remember that whales are descended from a common ancestor of cows so this is not a surprise given what we know about whales

7689674 actually akala ko nga next month pa pero biglang lumabas na nga raw like sa yes magazine september 2008 issue pero yung tvc yata hindi pa i think isa yun sa dapat na abangan nila kasi maganda yung concept ng commercial we have to look for the next ponds girl were in search for two women and ide date namin sila
7689675 yung mga ganoong incident pero ngayon lang talaga kami nagkasama for one project
7689676 maganda nga ngayon kasi nagkakaroon ng fusion ng two different networks much more that he piolo has already established his name his career his personality so noong sinabi nila sa akin na ill be working with him para sa akin isang magandang opportunity siya so without hesitation talaga i was excited about the project
7689677 well it is on the producers perception yun ang tingin ng mga kliyente dahil siguro nakikita nilang swak kami doon sa hinahanap nilang image ng produkto siyempre ayaw ko rin namang sabihin on top or hottest siguro its just good to say that we just fit doon sa hinahanap nilang qualities
7689678 siyempre kapag nasa set kami ng dyesebel ikinukuwento niya direk joyce sa amin si piolo alam nyo yung immediately meron na kaming common tao na kilala na parehong malapit sa amin although mas malapit talaga siya piolo kay direk joyce dahil best friend sila
7689679 ano ako e practice what you preach ako kung ano ang sinasabi ko ginagawa ko talaga so lahat ng mga endorsements ko wala naman akong hindi pinapaniwalaan doon

7689684 unless the state government puts such a proposal the dialogue may turn into a meaningless exercise
7689685 the respective stands of the centre and the state government on one hand and that of the gorkha jana mukti morcha on the other vis vis the protracted darjeeling tangle are well known how can we expect a thaw if the state government does not come up with a positive suggestion at the impending tripartite dialogue on the sensitive issue
7689686 what else could be the basis for the negotiation the chief minister mr buddhadeb bhattacharya convened the all party meeting to define a clear stand on the tangle and he endeavoured to evolve a consensus mr dasmunshi himself was present at the meeting as the representative of the congress
7689687 the state government cannot conjure up a definite proposal from nowhere to make the tripartite dialogue appear as a success our stand on the issue is crystal clear the chief minister has been spelling out the stand repeatedly
7689688 all issues can be discussed at the tripartite meeting but we would not allow any divisive agenda

7689696 we are working hard to have the road ready at the earliest
7689697 it brings us together as a group kind of like therapy to see something growing and flourishing

7689703 en un pa s democr tico es el propio estado quien debe mostrar su inter s y diligencia para garantizar la celeridad de los procesos penales y con mayor rez n de un caso que es de clamor popular ante la necesidad de hacer justicia
7689704 por eso nuestra preocupaci n de que ma ana puedan salir por los fueros de una extinci n penal todo en aras de evitar la sanci n contra los autores de los delitos de genocidio o garantizar la impunidad de los autores

7689723 riff on doctor who if it were more demonologically oriented and written for very juvenile adults with a sick sense of humor wormwood is really just me having fun and trying to throw in as many disgusting perversions of my old childhood influences
7689724 those influences include the science fantasy cosmos of h p lovecrafts old ones and the work of h r giger
7689725 por ejemplo la sgae ha conseguido que las radios paguen a los artistas por poner canciones sin embargo hay cosas en las que coincides m s y que te parecen mejores otras que te parecen una chorrada el canon y todo esto

7689732 my first concern is for the safety of people in this province and i am concerned about the length of time it took to notify the public about this escape
7689733 these people are considered dangerous and could possibly be armed so we are asking the public please do not approach them
7689734 originally posted by lost go yourself we are very friendly
7689735 there are so many books that hit the shelves these days that covers just start to blend together into one big mottled wallpaper so it was a mild surprise when i encountered the stark black and minimalist cover designs
7689736 the theme is originally inspired from business weeek website this is a three column theme having spots for advertise block a featured video and other functionalities i might improve the theme in future but for now you will have to do with this
7689737 superfresh is a 3 columns theme based on natural green color it contains 2 widget ready sidebars custom templates with a featured post section on the main page its compatible with wordpress 2 6 and has been tested in firefox internet explorer 6 amp 7 opera and safari
7689738 it is a theme for wordpress that makes building customizing and maintaining a web site as simple as possible a free wordpress theme that extends wordpress software with premium features making it as simple as possible to manage a web site
7689739 yeah but look what i am doing now it is nothing
7689740 must i shoot a simple minded soldier boy who deserts while i must not touch a hair of a wily agitator who induces him to desert
7689741 i think that in such a case to silence the agitator and save the boy is not only constitutional but withal a great mercy
7689742 his vallandighams arrest was made because he was laboring with some effect to prevent the raising of troops to encourage desertions from the army and to leave the rebellion without an adequate military force to suppress it
7689743 he was not arrested because he was damaging the political prospects of the administration or the personal interests of the commanding general but because he was damaging the army upon the existence and vigor of which the life of the nation depends
7689744 he was warring upon the military and this gave the military constitutional jurisdiction to lay hands on him
7689745 congressmen who willfully take action during wartime that damage morale and undermine the military are saboteurs and should be arrested exiled or hanged thats what president abraham lincoln said during the war between the states
7689746 he continues to totally agree with the message of the statement
7689747 to stress what chavez described as a defeat of the united states
7689748 confronting the hegemonic and imperialistic ambitions of the elite that now governs the united states and is massacring the people of iraq
7689749 national security cannot take a back seat to world trade
7689750 not willing to recognize that there are chosen people who are above others
7689751 venezuelan president hugo chavez wants spanish defense minister jose bono to personally sign the deals in caracas to stress what he described as a defeat of the united states
7689752 confronting the hegemonic and imperialist ambitions of the elite that now governs the united states
7689753 as an instrument which we shape for our own purposes
7689754 if thought corrupts language language can also corrupt thought a bad usage can spread by tradition and imitation even among people who should and do know better
7689755 how strangely will the tools of a tyrant pervert the plain meaning of words
7689756 alongside words that electrify society with their freedom and truthfulness we have words that mesmerize deceive inflame madden beguile words that are harmful lethal even

7689765 the reason the armed operation was called operation iraqi freedom and not operation iraqi liberty was that the acronym for operation iraqi liberty would have been o i l and that o i f was more misleading
7689766 our enemies have skillfully adapted to fighting wars in todays media age but for the most part we our country our government has not adapted

7689787 as to the encouragement to the hessian officers i wish it may have the desired effect perhaps it might have been better had the offer been made sooner
7689788 the quarrel between the colonies and the british government seems to grow more serious every day
7689789 it may prove the most fatal blow to the authority of the metropolis
7689790 it is necessary for america to have agents in different parts of europe to give some information concerning our affairs and to refute the abominable lies that the hired emissaries of great britain circulate in every corner of europe by which they keep up their own credit and ruin ours
7689791 planted stories in a dutch newspaper gazette de leide intended to give the united states a favorable rating in the dutch credit markets
7689792 the use of political means to compel an opponent to do ones will political being understood to describe purposeful intercourse between peoples and governments affecting national survival and advantage political war may be combined with violence economic pressure subversion and diplomacy but its chief aspect is the use of words images and ideas commonly known according to context as propaganda and political warfare

7689805 developments lately in georgia have increased the importance of this visit
7689806 to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7689807 cheney certainly has had a tougher view on russia than some others in the administration
7689808 would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
7689809 russias reputation has suffered since it took these disproportionate military steps in georgia

7689819 lets not be lectured by the labor party about fiscal rectitude they have nothing to tell us
7689820 they certainly dont have a mandate for these completely unjustifiable tax increases
7689821 what the government is actually doing is taxing australians now in an unjustifiable way in order to spend it later in order to buy their way back into office in 2010
7689822 if they decide to be spoilers then we will seek to negotiate with the minor parties to make sure these essential budget bills are carried senator evans told abc radio

7689831 weve had an anti urban anti city president for eight years
7689832 for our cities to be as vibrant as they can be were going to have to focus on public safety
7689833 we want to be as tough on crime as we are on the root causes of crime

7689841 i asked dick why he didnt tell me he had to use the restroom again dick stated that he did not want to knock on the window like a caged animal
7689842 im just hootin and hollerin its not like im really out there raping and killing women
7689843 the guide shouted run fast run fast it didnt make any noise
7689844 if we could prevent these infections in the first place or detect them sooner we might one day be able to prevent some of these premature births
7689845 to find that this amniotic compartment which we have traditionally viewed as somewhat sacrosanct is infected significantly more often than we thought is a little shocking
7689846 weve become very good at growing some bacterial species what might be called the weeds of the microbial world
7689847 but many other species cant be cultured by current methods
7689848 although we know now that humans should respect and even cherish their microbial symbionts
7689849 this type of infection reflects a situation in which our microbial companions have overstepped their bounds something has gone awry with this balance
7689850 the benefits of the program accrued very quickly and are very large
7689851 when adults stop smoking you see immediate benefits in heart disease with impacts on cancer and lung diseases starting to appear a year or two later
7689852 we confirmed these results with a wide range of model reliability tests and sensitivity analyses to make sure that the findings we found were not a result of some unobserved third factor
7689853 for example including differences between california and the control states on a variety of risk factors did not materially affect the results
7689854 the methods in this study can be used to forecast future costs and will provide important additional means for validating program evaluations that previously did not exist
7689855 large scale tobacco control programs should be an integral part of the medical cost containment that everyone agrees must be part of any health care reform
7689856 given that they have so far shown little willingness to fund programs outside the traditional purview of public health
7689857 the next generation cannot be saved without changing the generations who have already reached adulthood
7689858 before weaning the mother has the monopoly on providing resources directly to her offspring
7689859 after weaning the father directly provides a greater share of resources to his offspring
7689860 i dont have any sense that this will somehow lead to a cure for pws but it does present a new area for those interested in the disease to study and hopefully a new understanding of how the disease functions
7689861 we dont understand the purpose of sleep but it must be important because all animals do it
7689862 the very fact that dolphins have developed the remarkable specialization rather than merely getting rid of sleep altogether should count as evidence that sleep must serve some essential function and cannot be eliminated
7689863 sleep may be the price you pay so your brain can be plastic the next day
7689864 while there may still be no consensus on why animals need to sleep it would seem that searching for a core function of sleep particularly at the cellular level is still a worthwhile exercise
7689865 with utter disappointment with no signs of hope i have to say with great sorrow that pakistan muslim league nawaz pml n is pulling out of the coalition
7689866 continue the struggle for restoration of judges and genuine democracy in pakistan
7689867 we dont want to be instrumental in overthrowing any government we dont have any such intentions
7689868 i am confident we will win but we are fighting an entire government machinery which has spent millions of dollars in an attempt to deny me a victory
7689869 we are safe if we get a majority of 10 000 or more
7689870 before weaning the mother has the monopoly on providing resources directly to her offspring

7689873 it may be safe for women who have taken oral anticoagulants for 5 7 months after an unprovoked venous thromboembolism to discontinue therapy if they have 0 or 1 of the following hyperpigmentation brown discoloration edema swelling or redness of either leg a d dimer level blood clotting test of 250ug l or more while taking warfarin bmi body mass index 30kg m 2 and aged 65 years or more
7689874 it appears all men are at high risk of recurrence
7689875 aung san suu kyi is one thing the international community should talk about how to bringdemocracy to myanmar and focus on the constitution and the elections
7689876 the fact that these animals dont die and are restored to normal health despite a total lack of insulin is hard for many researchers and clinicians to believe
7689877 many scientists including us thought it would be a waste of time to give leptin in the absence of insulin weve been brainwashed into thinking that insulin is the only substance that can correct the consequences of insulin deficiency
7689878 but if we gave them the leptin gene within two weeks the terminally ill rodents were restored to full health without any other treatment
7689879 my hope is that you could give leptin for one type of action glucagons suppression for example and insulin for another or perhaps give a substance other than insulin entirely
7689880 what would be a tremendous advance would be the ability to give an oral agent that suppresses glucagon without injections
7689881 one of the things that happens when a child gets type 1 diabetes is their growth is stunted until theyre given insulin
7689882 the same is true with these mice however we found that if you take a diabetic rat thats not receiving insulin and make it hyperleptinemic it almost catches up growthwise
7689883 this is a general three minute video of london in which an artwork by marcus harvey very fleetingly appears
7689884 the video is not for general public use and has been used many times over the last few years to show to the tourism trade
7689885 there has never been a complaint made about the video up until this point however if any offence has been caused we will withdraw it from use with immediate effect
7689886 he is even more adamant now because this is his love and he wants to show people he is really committed
7689887 no this is not yet my inter my inter finish the match at the right time they win 2 0 and not by a narrow margin
7689888 i hope okto will be a part of the everyday life of each and every singaporean
7689889 in fact while the federal government provides historic tax credits for multi unit residences such as apartments and condominiums as well as for commercial buildings federal historic credits cannot be applied to single family residences what does the federal government know that missouri doesnt
7689890 this will ensure a certain degree of transparency and accountability applies to both local and overseas polling stations and preclude any allegations of vote rigging foul play or other unfairness
7689891 there is no law compelling any party to send anyone to the polling station we dont see the need to spend public money to send polling agents to an overseas city
7689892 as previously said this is important for voter anonymity especially in smaller constituencies
7689893 as more singaporeans venture abroad to for work or studies we will strive to ensure that they remain connected to singapore
7689894 four year effort to cover up his full role in killing legislation to protect born alive survivors of abortions
7689895 a reasonable likelihood of sustained survival of the fetus outside the womb with or without artificial support
7689896 really did object to a bill merely because it defended the proposition a live child born as a result of an abortion shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law and it is that reality that he now desperately wants to conceal from the eyes of the public
7689897 nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm deny expand or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive as defined in this section
7689898 a live child born as a result of an abortion shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law
7689899 nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm deny expand or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive as defined in this section
7689900 nothing in this section shall be construed to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion
7689901 was not the bill that was presented at the state level
7689902 illinois and federal born alive infant protection acts did not include exactly the same language
7689903 exercise the same degree of professional skill care and diligence to preserve the life and health of the child as would be required of a physician providing immediate medical care to a child born alive in the course of a pregnancy termination which was not an abortion
7689904 australia is a good country as a manufacturing and supply chain base for expanding its food business in the asia pacific area
7689905 as the various material costs are increasing expanding the business will help kirin improve efficiency and cut costs
7689906 we had to constantly break down barriers and perceptions of what women can do
7689907 i think that was really an important action that will help solidify the party
7689908 if they really want to win this is the way we have to do it
7689909 i just think its a tremendous occasion for all americans especially women
7689910 this is not between hillary clinton and barack obama its between john mccain and barack obama
7689911 hey whats even better than being turned on being even more turned on
7689912 my father had a brain haemorrhage in 1979 i slept in the hospital most nights he recovered but i thought i should work in the hospital
7689913 there were many objections they said its a ladies job even the moh guy asked me if i was sure as its a tough job
7689914 i was and am a hands on father when my kids were babies i bathed them washed their hair cleaned their eyes and ears and did their oral hygiene
7689915 even when my wife was tired i would encourage her to breastfeed i would clean the breast pump the milk store it in the fridge then warm it up and give it to my children today they are runners breastfeeding is good because it creates a bond with the child
7689916 iron their uniforms polish their shoes make sure they take their vitamins
7689917 children to me are a gift of god you must have them or else youll be so lonely
7689918 he said that it was his first beat that hed done since the untimely passing of his mom
7689919 he said it was the first beat that he went in the studio to do i just happened to be the beneficiary of it
7689920 one of the hottest beats of the year if not the hottest beat of the year
7689921 more could be done to give the less well off an extra boost to rise to the very top
7689922 the students environment plays a large part in whether they make it into scholar ranks
7689923 there were a lot of problems with the creating of a business entity i had to get my mom to start a limited liability partnership
7689924 our budding entrepreneurs must understand that contractual rights come with contractual liabilities they may not set up a company or a business with a legal suit in mind but they must know that they may be sued if they fail to perform their part in any contracts that they enter into
7689925 i wonder if the authorities are anticipating a flood of young women entrepreneurs since most of our young men aged between 18 and 21 will be in national service
7689926 studying the desirability of lowering the age of contractual capacity
7689927 the government agrees that the current laws place unnecessary restriction on young people wishing to undertake business and should be revised as part of the broader efforts to support an entrepreneurial society
7689928 it really worked for me i felt fresher and not as leaden with toxins
7689929 i stopped taking it when my bridal gown designer told me to stop losing weight by then my wedding gown was becoming too loose for me
7689930 sufficient research and evidence to prove that it is effective for weight loss
7689931 as the name suggests it is highly acidic so it is important to always dilute apple cider vinegar with water consuming pure apple cider vinegar can damage the tooth enamel and tissues in your mouth and throat
7689932 if youre already low in potassium or have osteoporosis talk to your doctor before you start taking apple cider vinegar
7689933 we will monitor the cost of living we will monitor every item we should also bear in mind that we should not overdo it
7689934 i do agree that its not very comfortable but its manageable
7689935 but if you lend me some more labor and put your name on paper we just might catch a breeze
7689936 leaders in asia tend to practise a more authoritarian leadership style they tend not to empower their subordinates to make decisions so their subordinates constantly have to refer back to them
7689937 in contrast business leaders in the united kingdom tend to be more collaborative in their leadership styles and include employees in the decision making process
7689938 less than the amount found in a common smoke detector
7689939 confident that there was no adverse impact on public health marine life or the environment
7689940 potential exposure to the reported leak is 100 000 times less than exposure from natural radiation in a year
7689941 so low that it was below the threshold that it was designed to detect
7689942 as a matter of logic factual proposition and legal proposition it would be absurd to suggest that simply because you get acquitted in a criminal trial no one can say that you actually did it
7689943 there is no intention to question or qualify that principle in any way i am surprised that any doubt should have arisen about this
7689944 an acquittal does not mean that an accused is innocent
7689945 a duty to acquit the accused regardless of whether the court thinks he may have in fact committed the offence
7689946 it is not something we are considering at this point in time
7689947 dragged through a lengthy trial process and at great costs
7689948 prosecution should have been commenced in the first place and not whether one is factually innocent
7689949 do we want to impose a further layer of caution by telling him the attorney general that if he gets his decision wrong hes got to pay costs
7689950 i think whatever our prosecution in singapore is accused of it is not accused of flippant prosecution
7689951 whatever the parties may think it is for the courts to decide whether it is an appropriate case for costs and also whether the defence should pay
7689952 the rules will be interpreted reasonably if theres no way to stop him well look at that
7689953 we work very much on the basis of trust we are not going to do screening and make sure you speak on what you said you will speak on but if you give information you must know youre accountable for it
7689954 what if someone puts on the website that hes going to do bad things
7689955 dispel the perception that theres a preponderance of police presence
7689956 there are no limits to the protests subject to public safety for example the crowd is so big that it obstructs the public
7689957 an attempt to return control over something the government wont be able to control
7689958 their stand against demonstrations wont hold up in real democracies
7689959 our primary motivation is to keep speakers corner for use in as well maintained conditions as possible if theres a need to make good on anything we can follow up

7689967 were looking for producers interested in either diversifying their current operations or entering some form of value added or marketing venture
7689968 our hope is that we get some good applications from growers or producer groups interested in pursuing forms of value added enterprises or marketing cooperatives
7689969 the oaed board of directors is especially interested in the most creative types of proposals
7689970 this program is unique in that by its very design it can help get some unconventional marketing projects perhaps the kind that regular financial institutions would be afraid to invest get their start
7689971 no no no they come in all sizes shapes and ages now

7689981 changes in temperature and humidity cause the blood vessels in the nose to dilate resulting in nasal congestion and excessive mucous production
7689982 the cold air acts as a physical trigger its like when cold air triggers broncho spasm a sudden constriction of airway muscles wheezing in asthmatics
7689983 occasionally the food one eats may also make rhinitis worse
7689984 avoiding or reducing exposure to sudden temperature and humidity changes
7689985 wearing appropriate clothing like a sweater when you go to a colder environment as well as maintaining the temperature of an air conditioned room at about25 celsius can help as well
7689986 complications like infection of the sinuses and middle ear when the swelling of the nasal mucosa blocks the opening of the sinuses and eustachian tube
7689987 on the inflation front oil seems quite well behaved below us 120 per barrel
7689988 even malaysia has announced that they are going to cut petrol and diesel prices
7689989 if third quarter momentum remains very weak we cannot discount the possibility that we have a technical recession or even that full year growth is going to undershoot the 4 per cent lower threshold of the official forecast
7689990 realistically we cannot seek to protect every manufacturing job or prevent job losses when the industry restructures but we can reduce the effect by ensuring we have a strong pipeline of investment some existing jobs will be lost but new and better paid jobs will also be created
7689991 inflation is likely to remain a long way away from the kind of inflation that the central bank will be comfortable with 1 1 5 per cent and until then it will be difficult for mas to take its foot sustainable off the brakes
7689992 my mother has been handling the money we did exactly as mother instructed and didnt ask any questions
7689993 its difficult to estimate the impact of the tax change on the companys costs because the size of the increase is still unknown
7689994 coal prices are unlikely to repeat the recent big increases
