7570004 our short term suggestions alone wont bring the system back to the intent of obra 87 achieving optimal quality based resident centered care but they will tide the system over until broad systemic change can occur

7570029 yes there is major progress on the issue of the negotiations on the security deal

7570139 hace unos siete u ocho a os cuando un asistente editorial de marvel cuyo nombre no recuerdo me llam para preguntarme si estaba interesado en realizar un especial titulado iron man the end bob se puso en contacto conmigo y pens que podr amos ofrecer una propuesta intrigante con el personaje algo que no se me hab a ocurrido hacer antes
7570140 desde la oficina editorial de entonces pusieron algunas objeciones a nuestra propuesta y ofrecieron lo que a sus ojos eran cambios menores sin embargo bob y yo pensamos que aquellos cambios podr an alterar el positivo impulso que hab amos puesto ambos en la historia y muy a nuestro pesar renunciamos al encargo a finales del 2006 las circunstancias cambiaron y el proyecto fue recuperado hicimos algunas alteraciones menores con las que todos pod amos vivir y el resultado lo podr is ver en un par de meses

7570144 the field of cardiovascular genetics is exploding with exponential increases in scientific investigations and manuscripts
7570145 these rapid advances bring with them the urgent need for continuous education of cardiologists scientists and practitioners the pages of circulation cardiovascular genetics will constitute a premier forum for scientific debate where experts can weigh in on issues that challenge the field
7570146 as such it represents the one stop journal to both publish findings and read the literature that is specifically of interest to cardiologists and scientists with a focus on cardiovascular medicine

7570149 as high priority manuscripts seek a home in the leading journals in the field we expect that our journal will become one of the pre eminent publications for cardiovascular scientists
7570150 biologists have known that in these beetles there is an investment trade off between secondary sexual characters and primary sexual characters
7570151 as horns get bigger copulatory organs get smaller or vice versa what was not known was how frequently and how fast this can occur in nature and whether this can drive the evolution of new species
7570152 in terms of the integrity of a species its important for these things not to change too much
7570153 so there is a lot of evidence suggesting that within species or within the populations of species natural selection maintains genital characters but if these primary sex characters are linked to other characters that can change readily then youve got what we think is a very exciting mechanism that could prime populations for reproductive isolation
7570154 if this is all it takes to change genitalia it may be easier to make new species than we thought
7570155 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar

7570194 in order to increase revenues and thus profitability saint josephs engaged in a widespread and systematic scheme to admit to inpatient status patients who did not otherwise meet inpatient admission criteria and then issue charges and bills for such inpatient services accordingly
7570195 well known to saint josephs management administration staff and contractors if not also its board of directors moreover saint josephs management and administration actively concealed such practices
7570196 patients came to saint josephs trusting that they would receive appropriate care not expecting to be deliberately overbilled by saint josephs extending their hospital stay in a pretense of needed care ms rivard and mr lamb and many people like him from throughout georgia and elsewhere were inappropriately admitted and improperly billed

7570334 the resurrection sharply defines what it must mean to have faith in christ because christ has been raised from the dead we are not putting our faith in merely a historical event but in a living death conquering and reigning savior our faith is based on something in the past but it is placed in one who is very much alive today notice how the apostle paul speaks of faith in terms of a living christ i have been crucified with christ it is no longer i who live but christ who lives in me and the life i now live in the flesh i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me galatians 2 20 paul is living by faith in the living christ and he prays that this would be our normative christian experience that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his spirit in your inner being so that christ may dwell in your hearts through faith ephesians 3 16 17
7570335 principle 20 but in fact christ since has been raised from the dead the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep 21 for as by a man came death by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead 22 for as in adam all die so also in christ shall all be made alive 23 but each in his own order christ the firstfruits then at his coming those who belong to christ 24 then comes the end when he delivers the kingdom to god the father after destroying every rule and every authority and power 25 for he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet 26 the last enemy to be destroyed is death 3 has put all things in subjection under his feet

7570382 i feel that the prefects only want money and do not want to touch the political question
7570383 if we interpret the sentiment expressed through the recall referendums the bolivian people want profound changes in the structural and especially in the political sphere that is why i have come to the conclusion that the bolivian people want autonomy and a new constitution

7570387 vital signs is an international and interdisciplinary conference organised by real life methods it will provide a major forum for the discussion of approaches to researching real lives in complex worlds
7570388 his plenary session is entitled bringing things back to life creative entanglements in a world of materials vital signs plenary session tim ingold tuesday 9th september 2008 2 15pm bringing things back to life creative entanglements in a world of materials the creation of things according to aristotle involves a bringing together of form morphe and matter hyle in the subsequent history of western thought the hylomorphic model of creation has become ever more deeply embedded contemporary discussions in fields ranging from anthropology and archaeology to art history and material culture studies continue to reproduce its underlying assumptions the aim of this lecture is both to expose these assumptions and to replace the model with an ontology that assigns primacy to processes of formation as against their final products and to the flows and transmutations of materials as against states of matter the argument has five components first the inhabited world consists not of objects considered as bounded self contained entities but of things each a particular gathering of the threads of life secondly life has to be understood not as an interior animating force but as the generative capacity of that encompassing field of forces and materials wherein forms arise and are held in place this notion of life should not be confused with the concept of agency which is a product of the same reduction that reduces things to objects thirdly a focus on life processes required us to attend not to materiality as such but to the fluxes and flows of materials we have to follow these flows tracing the paths of form generation fourthly to understand how these paths are creative we must read creativity forwards as an improvisatory joining in with formative processes rather than backwards as an abduction from a finished object to an idea in the mind of an agent finally the pathways along which improvisatory practice unfolds are not connections between one thing and another but lines along which they continually come into being thus the entanglement of things has to be understood literally and precisely not as a network of connections but as a meshwork of interwoven lines of growth and movement

7570393 the chess world owes him no less than the enjoyment chessplayers derive from chasing and earning the elo numbers
7570394 i feel very sentimental about the friendship and rapport that we have established over these few years here we are half a world apart never having met face to face of different race and different cultural background and we communicate as brothers or as father and son it is truly touching i treasure this friendship now especially when my life has reached such a low ebb
7570395 it is rarely that one receives such appreciation for ones work during his lifetime so i am naturally gratified that you found my book a significant contribution to the literature of chess as well as of statistics
7570396 the 1935 elo fine game was a sloppy exhibition with no credit to either player and best forgotten
7570397 could be classed as a grandmaster draw agreed when the game had no bearing on the standings
7570398 the search for errors in any manuscript follows the law of exponential decay if on the first reading one finds a certain percentage of errors say 80 then on the second reading one will find only the same 80 of the remaining errors so there would always be a residual number of errors after any number of readings this law of exponential decay really enters our lives in all sorts of curious ways take for example the dishes one uses in everyday living if a newly wed couple received a wedding gift of a set of dishes the breakage rate of those dishes will be percentage wise constant throughout the lifetime of the dishes at first the breakage will be high in numbers but by the time of the golden anniversary of the couple there will still be at least one piece left around of the original set and which seems to lead a charmed existence by defying every effort to break it
7570399 i have always been rather na ve politically in the mistaken belief that meritorious work or service will receive the proper recognition and acceptance and i always thought that my work would speak for itself and become apolitical but this was not to be either in the uscf in the 1960s or in fide in the 1970s it seems to be part of human nature to turn every advance whether in science or religion into a political issue
7570400 i dont think it is dictatorial policies which have produced the alienation from the europeans but rather the shift of power within fide from the europeans to the chess developing countries after all the late folke rogard was the strongest dictator fide ever had and who acted as an absolute monarch but then he was a european ruling europeans now the europeans still see themselves as the chess powers in playing strength but see the power within fide politics controlled by non europeans
7570401 just reading about the various opinions concerning the conduct of the recent championship matches convinces me that the only thing to which two chessplayers could agree is that a third one is over rated

7570610 well its great to be here on the steps of the old state house in the land of lincoln president lincoln once instructed us to be sure to put your feet in the right place then stand firm today springfield i know my feet are in the right place and i am proud to stand firm for the next president of the united states of america barack obama folks barack and i come from very different places but we share a common story an american story he was the son of a single mom a single mom who had to struggle to support her son and her kids but she raised him she raised him to believe in america to believe that in this country there is no obstacle that could keep you from your dreams if you are willing to work hard and fight for it i was different i was an irish catholic kid from scranton with a father who like many of yours in tough economic times fell on hard times but my mom and dad raised me to believe its a saying barack you heard me say before my dad repeated it and repeated it said champ its not how many times you get knocked down its how quickly you get up its how quickly you get up ladies and gentlemen thats your story thats americas story its about if you get up you can make it thats the america barack obama and i believe in thats the american dream and ladies and gentlemen is there no ordinary times and this is no ordinary election because the truth of the matter is and you know it that american dream under eight years of bush and mccain that american dream is slipping away i dont have to tell you that you feel it in your lives you see it in your shrinking wages and the cost of everything from groceries to health care to college to filling up your car at the gas station it keeps going up and up and up and the future keeps receding further and further and further away as you reach for your dreams you know ladies and gentlemen it is not a mere political saying i say with every fiber of my being i believe we cannot as a nation stand for four more years of this we cannot afford to keep giving tax cuts after tax cuts to big corporations and the wealthiest americans while the middle class america middle class families are falling behind and their wages are actually shrinking we cant afford four more years of a government that does nothing while they watch the housing market collapse as you know its not just the millions of people facing foreclosure its the tens of millions of your neighbors who are seeing the values of their homes drop off a cliff along with their dreams ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night before you put the kids after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at folks again its not political sloganary when i say we literally cant afford four more years of this non energy policy written by and for the oil companies making us more and more dependent from hostile nations on our ability to run this country and literally not figuratively literally putting americas security at risk we cant afford four more years of a foreign policy that has shredded our alliances and sacrificed our moral standing around the world ladies and gentlemen thats the bad news but there is good news america we dont have to have four more years of george w bush and john mccain the next president of the united states is going to be delivered to the most significant moment in american history since franklin roosevelt he will have such an incredible opportunity incredible opportunity not only to change the direction of america but literally literally to change the direction of the world barack obama and i believe we believe with every fiber in our being that our families our communities as americans theres not a single solitary challenge we cannot face if we level with the american people and i dont say that to say it history history has shown it when have americans ever ever ever let their country down when theyve had a leader to lead them ladies and gentlemen we believe that our tomorrows will be better than our yesterdays and we believe well pass on to our children an even better life than the one we lived that literally has been the american way and it can be that way again but theres a big missing piece the missing piece is leadership in all my time in the united states senate and i want you to know theres only four senators senior to me but barack theres still 44 older than me i want you to know that part but all kidding aside of all my years in the senate i have never in my life seen washington so broken i have never seen so many dreams denied and so many decisions deferred by politicians who are trying like the devil to escape their responsibility and accountability but ladies and gentlemen the reckoning is now and the reality the reality is that we must answer the call or we will risk the harshest version and verdict of history these times call for a total change in washingtons worldview these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader a leader who can deliver a leader who can deliver the change we need ill say straight up to you john mccain and the press knows this is genuinely a friend of mine ive known john for 35 years he served our country with extraordinary courage and i know he wants to do right by america but the harsh truth is ladies and gentlemen you cant change america when you boast and these are johns words quote the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush ladies and gentlemen thats what he said you cant change america when you supported george bushs policies 95 of the time you cant change america when you believe and these are his own words that in the bush administration weve made great progress economically you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security you cant change america and give our workers a fighting chance when after 3 million manufacturing jobs disappear you continue to support tax breaks for companies who ship our jobs overseas you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have end of quote ladies and gentlemen you cant change america you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency my friends yes we can my friends i dont have to tell you this election year the choice is clear one man stands ready to deliver change we desperately need a man im proud to call my friend a man who will be the next president of the united states barack amer you know you learn a lot of things being up close with a guy let me tell you about obama you learn a lot about a man when you campaign with him when you debate him 12 or 13 times when you hear him speak when you see how he thinks and you watch how he reacts under pressure you learn a lot about his strength of his mind and i think even more importantly the quality of his heart ladies and gentlemen no one knows better than i do that presidential campaigns are crucibles in which youre tested and challenged every single day and over the past 18 months ive watched barack meet those challenges with judgment intelligence and steel in his spine ive watched as hes inspired millions of americans millions of americans to this new cause and during those 18 months i must tell you frankly ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swiftboat politics that he so once so deplored and folks campaigns for presidents are a test of character and leadership and in this campaign one candidate one candidate has passed that test barack has the vision and what you cant forget you know his vision but let me tell you something he also has the courage the courage to make this a better place and let me tell you something else this man is a clear eyed pragmatist who will get the job done i watch with amazement as he came to the senate i watch with amazement he made his mark literally from day one reaching across the aisle to pass legislation to secure the worlds deadliest weapons standing up to some of the most entrenched interests in washington risking the wrath of the old order to pass the most sweeping ethics reform in a generation but i was proudest i was proudest when i watched him spontaneously focus the attention of the nation on the shameful neglect of americas wounded warriors at walter reed army hospital ladies and gentlemen i know im told i talk too colloquially but theres something about this guy theres something about this guy theres something about barack obama that allows him to bring people together like no one i have worked with and seen theres something about barack obama that makes people understand if they make compromises they can make things better its been amazing to watch him but then again thats been the story of his whole life i end where i began this is a man raised by a single mother who sometimes was on food stamps as she worked to put herself through school by grandparents from the prairies of kansas who loved him a grandfather a grandfather who marched in patons army and then came home and went to college on the g i bill and a grandmother a grandmother with just a high school education started off working in a small bank in the secretarial pool and rose to be vice president of that bank ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen these remarkable people gave barack obama the determination and drive and yes the values to turn down that big job on wall street to come to chicagos south side where he helped workers help themselves after the steel mills had been shut down and the jobs disappeared ladies and gentlemen my wife jill who youll meet soon is drop dead gorgeous my wife jill who youll meet soon she also has her doctorate degree which is a problem but all kidding aside my jill my jill my wife jill and i are honored to join barack and michelle on this journey because thats what it is its a journey we share the same values the values that we had passed on to us by our parents and the values jill and i are passing on to our sons beau and hunter and ashley ladies and gentlemen im here for their future im here for the future of your kids im here for everyone i im here for everyone i grew up in scranton pennsylvania whos been forgotten and everybody in claymont delaware in wilmington where i lived im here for the cops and the fire fighters the teachers and the line workers the folks who live the folks whose lives are the measure of whether the american dream endures ladies and gentlemen this is no ordinary time this is no ordinary election and this may be our last chance to reclaim the america we love to restore americas soul ladies and gentlemen america gave jill and me our chance it gave barack and michelle their chance to stand on this stage today its literally incredible these values this country gave us that chance and now its time for all of us as lincoln said to put our feet in the right place and to stand firm ladies and gentlemen its time to elect barack obama president its our time its americas time god bless america and may he protect our troops
7570611 denmarks parliament on monday approved the construction of a 400 megawatt mw offshore wind turbine park in the kattegat arm of the north sea between jutland and the island of anholt in 2012 the park will be the biggest offshore park in denmark and provide electricity for about 400 000 homes the danish climate and energy ministry said in a statement denmark is home to vestas the worlds biggest supplier of wind turbines
7570612 as probably the whole country knows by now john mccain does not know how many homes he owns but the number seems to be between seven and 12 depending on whether you count his sedona ranch as one house or six given how conservatives beat up vice president gore for the supposed energy excesses of his one nashville home i cant wait until they start running tv ads attacking mccains climate hypocrisy note to self dont hold your breath after all mccain fashions himself as a leader on global warming just like gore but his combined homes have a considerably larger square footage than gores and thus presumably a much larger energy use that said the energy use of mccains homes is infinitely less relevant than their greenhouse gas emissions
7570613 beware the capitulators republicans are chortling over the fact that their drill drill drill campaign seems to have forced barack obama and nancy pelosi to backtrack and agree to relax by no means eliminate entirely the ban on offshore drilling beware what is contained in the trojan horse the illinois senator and the congresswoman from san francisco are offering as a peace token to the republicans and to americans who are appalled that congress continues to prevent the development of our oil resources while crude oil and gasoline prices although softening in recent weeks remain high enough to contribute to the forces that are pulling the economy perilously close to recession

7570658 coach mckay has built our volleyball program into an annual contender for the conference title
7570659 we want to be assured that she has the resources in place to continue to attract high quality student athletes compete at a regional level and sustain a high level of success
7570660 i am most excited about this contract because of the positive effects that it has on the program
7570661 it shows a high level of dedication to the volleyball program and womens athletics when i compare the status of the program when i came on board to today it is jawdropping to see the level of improvement in facilities student athlete experience and other resources these enhancements could not have happened without the efforts and visions of dr van alstine and vice president dr garry johnson
7570662 my contract is a small but integral part of a division i programs success and it will assist the program in present and future situations especially recruiting
7570663 it has been a pleasure leading the volleyball program toward the top of the summit league athletically and academically and i look forward to continuing to work hard to surpass these levels
7570664 as the dominant news story moves from obamas vp pick to the democratic convention in denver ross mackenzie offers this fun piece to read reminding us there are other things going on in the world besides this election
7570665 the honor could be interpreted as a wholesale endorsement of friedmans free market ideology
7570666 9 years is a pretty long time to do anything
7570667 ive never loved and lost like that you know so it was one of those things i kinda had to make myself sad in other ways like the night before the video and the day of the video i just looked up i looked up some horrible footage on youtube about animal abuse i know that sounds awful but i further educated myself for my cause as well
7570668 are you strong enough to be my man or my president
7570669 what im hearing from sen obama is a lot like what we heard from robert kennedy
7570670 no matter what campaign ad we see or how its spun hope is important its what this country was based on
7570671 that tag that sen obamas been given is a campaign ploy obviously by the republican party
7570672 i dont see him hanging out i have yet to see him at any celebrity events
7570673 this is the first time that a political convention of any sort has been surrounded with the awareness of environmental issues
7570674 yeah and regardless of what political affiliation you want to align yourself with this is an issue its real no matter which side you decide to attack it from
7570675 its like honey what do you want to be a pariah what do you want to be crucified its a good thing in this country we dont have to tell anybody its no ones business who we vote for
7570676 regardless the company has converted to new fedora signing keys
7570677 it is important to note that the effects of the intrusion on fedora and red hat are not the same accordingly the fedora package signing key is not connected to and is different from the one used to sign red hat enterprise linux packages furthermore the fedora package signing key is also not connected to and is different from the one used to sign community extra packages for enterprise linux epel packages
7570678 just make sure that every step you take is headed in that direction
7570679 ive been a fan of rubbing sticks together since i learned how to do it several million years ago and i dont see why anyone would do anything differently i cant imagine how anyone could come up with a more flexible or powerful method of starting fires
7570680 for the first time china has won more gold medals than them
7570681 nuking massive cities to cut off their supply of men being the only strategy that could actually defeat that country

7570684 the anticipation of the olympic games intensified world scrutiny of korea during a time of political crisis as political demonstrations emerged in june 1987 the possibility of jeopardizing hosting the olympic games contributed to the june 29 declaration which issued president chun out of power and led to direct elections in december 1987 citation needed the desire not to taint the olympic games with military dictatorship and riots served as an impetus for koreas transition to democracy
7570685 a totalitarian regime crushes all autonomous institutions in its drive to seize the human soul
7570686 joining the military and getting totally screwed over by lack of benefits
7570687 nothing is more frighten than desperation out of hunger and poor
7570688 because i do it this way in my own home so while i am in your home you must change your way of doing things to accommodate me
7570689 but very few of them understand why the approval rate of the chinese communist party is higher than 85 in china

7570743 who do people say that the son of man is
7570744 you are the messiah the son of the living god
7570745 blessed are you simon son of jonah for flesh and blood and so i say to you you are peter and upon this rock i will build my church 13 and the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it i will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven 14 whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
7570746 it is possible to speak from a solid foundation about human experience moral experience or religious experience and if it is possible to speak of such experience it is difficult to deny that in the realm of human experience one also finds good and evil truth and beauty and god god himself certainly is not an object of human empiricism the sacred scripture in its own way emphasizes this no on has ever seen god cf jn 1 18 if god is a knowable object as both the book of wisdom and the letter to the romans teach he is such on the basis of mans experience both of the visible world and of his interior world this is the point of departure for immanuel kants study of ethical experience in which he abandons the old approach found in the writings of the bible and of saint thomas aquinas man recognizes himself as an ethical being capable of acting according to criteria of good and evil and not only those of profit and pleasure he also recognizes himself as a religious being capable of putting himself in contact with god prayer is in a certain sense the first verification of such a reality
7570747 thesis 1 according to the testimony of holy scripture the center of the life and person of jesus is his constant communication with the father
7570748 the christian confession of faith comes from participating in the prayer of jesus from being drawn into his prayer and being privileged to behold it it interprets the experience of jesus prayer and its interpretation of jesus is correct because it springs from a sharing in what is most personal and intimate to him
7570749 thesis 3 since the center of the person of jesus is prayer it is essential to participate in his prayer if we are to know and understand him
7570750 we are at a decisive milestone jesus is setting out on the journey to the cross and issuing a call to decision that now clearly distinguishes the group of disciples from the people who merely listen without accompanying him in his way a decision that clearly shapes the disciples into the beginning of jesus new family the future church it is characteristic of this community to be on the way with jesus what that way involves is about to be made clear it is also characteristic that this communitys decision to accompany jesus rests upon a realization on a knowledge of jesus that at the same time gives them a new insight into god the one god in whom they believe as children of israel
7570751 regardless of how much his body was seen or touched only faith could fully enter the mystery of that face
7570752 some say john the baptist others say elijah and others jeremiah or one of the prophets
7570753 you are the christ the son of the living god
7570754 flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father who is in heaven
7570755 and the word became flesh and dwelt among us full of grace and truth we have beheld his glory glory as of the only son from the father
7570756 he waits for us everyday in the laboratory in the operating theatre in the army barracks in the university chair in the factory in the workshop in the fields in the home and in all the immense panorama of work understand this well there is something holy something divine hidden in the most ordinary situations and it is up to each one of you to discover it
7570757 we can put it even more simply when jesus speaks of the kingdom of god he is quite simply proclaiming god and proclaiming him to be the living god who is able to act concretely in the world and in history and is even now so acting
7570758 god is really god which means that he holds in his hands the threads of the threads of the world in this sense jesus message is very simply and thoroughly god centered the new and totally specific thing about his message is that he is telling us god is acting now this is the hour when god is showing himself in history as it lord as the living god in a way that goes beyond anything seen before kingdom of god is therefore an inadequate translation it would be better to speak of gods being lord of his lordship
7570759 our customers are telling us i want volvo to give me the most fuel efficient truck possible we need every bit of help we can get to survive the escalation in diesel prices
7570760 but we realized we can give them far more than the truck fuelwatch is our way to bring volvos deep knowledge of fuel economy to customers in a way that delivers these benefits throughout the entire life and operation of their trucks
7570761 we think the days of inexpensive fuel are over and the trucking industry must adapt to this new reality
7570762 fuelwatch is not a switch that fleets can throw or a part they can bolt on a truck this is a partnership between volvo our customers and our dealers involving a comprehensive approach to improving fuel economy tailored to the individual customer

7570767 like going 100 miles an hour down the freeway only the freeway youre driving on is covered with ice there is a lot of slipping and sliding and moving around
7570768 when those chutes open its like hitting a brick wall with your car at 30 miles an hour so it gets your attention but its a good feeling too because you know youre slowing down
7570769 its a real busy 90 seconds when youre in these cars
7570770 there is not a lot of time to look around and enjoy the scenery there is an awful lot going you really have to concentrate
7570771 i probably enjoyed the designing fabrication and building of the car more than actually racing out here
7570772 my dad and i we have such a good time in the shop building all this stuff and working on it
7570773 racing is kind of the necessary evil of building them because you cant find a customer who will come into the shop buy one of these things and bring it out here and race it so you have to do it all
7570774 we were still on the access road we hadnt gotten back to i 80 yet and we started talking about what we wanted to do next
7570775 we asked each other do we want to put more power into this car and go a little faster or do we want to step up

7570791 from the caribbean to the caspian weve had one bullish headline after another and the market cannot generate a sustained rally
7570792 it certainly doesnt bode well for anyone who owns commodities
7570793 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7570794 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries
7570795 it will illuminate what fountainbridges most famous former milkman thinks of many aspects of scottish culture and life including sport architecture and of course the gothic tendency in scots literature
7570796 theres just too much uncertainty out there creating all this volatility and whats adding to the volatility is were entering this holiday period the swings are exaggerated by the light volumes

7570809 i think all the players were raving this week about what wonderful a venue ridgewood was to host the barclays
7570810 its obvious from the players reactions and the success of the event that we certainly would like to come back here
7570811 its just a matter of how soon the club would be willing to host this again
7570812 if they would like to come we would like to have them
7570813 when that depends on so many things we have to see how much the support stays with the membership
7570814 i talked to some of the skeptics who werent really in favor of having the event here
7570815 and they said im glad i was here this is a wonderful event everything is great and it was the right decision
7570816 are we going to have any damage from the structures they put up
7570817 i know they are going to try not to damage it we dont think it will it will be cleared out in two to three weeks
7570818 we lost our range all year because we had the tent village out there and we had bad weather the restoration was hard
7570819 the weather certainly has helped us out considerably having the cool temperatures at night relatively decent temperatures during the day allowed us to firm the greens up without doing a whole lot of damage to them
7570820 its going to take a couple of weeks to get things repaired here but everything will be right in a month or so and be back to normal
7570821 the pga tour is going to be off the property in two weeks and i dont think there theres going to be many footprints left once they leave
7570822 as well as they put it up i think theyre going to take it down
7570823 this week could not have gone better id love to do it again with an extra six to eight months to plan for sure then it would be even better
7570824 you couldnt ask for a better situation than that to be able to park and walk in adjacent to the property its just wonderful it just makes the whole process of not having to deal with buses and shuttles a much better experience for spectators
7570825 i think all the players were raving this week about what wonderful a venue ridgewood was to host the barclays

7570847 an austere conception of news values continued to govern the selection of material for broadcasting

7570849 countries have their own identity their own patriotism it has been mooted for a number of years by fifa at the world cup that great britain has a team it would be impractical in that sense scotland northern ireland wales even england all have their own identities so i dont think it is a starter

7570854 tons of molten metal was found 21 days after the attack
7570855 steel doesnt begin to melt until 2 700 degrees which is much hotter than what these fires could have caused

7570857 we conducted the study without bias without interference from anyone
7570858 we have only one single minded goal in this effort

7570860 if water had been available it is likely that sprinklers would have operated and the building may still be here today

7570863 arabic discussions of obama sometimes mention his middle name as a code with no further comment needed
7570864 i want to see the president of the united states succeed in iraq his success is americas success and his failure is americas failure
7570865 this disconnect i believe is fueling cynicism that is undermining the single most important weapon we need to give our troops to be able to do their job and that is the unyielding support of the american people that support is waning

7570868 biden has carved out a niche as the democratic presidential candidate most willing to publicly rebuke antiwar sentiment
7570869 that there is any possibility in the lifetime of anyone here of having the iraqis get together have a unity government in baghdad that pulls the country together that will not happen it will not happen in the lifetime of anyone here
7570870 acceptable perhaps even satisfying conclusion to the great veep search
7570871 when biden went after john mccain with a vigor and yes a venom that has been missing from obamas stump speaking it was a tonic for the troops who have been waiting for a campaign that is more prepared to throw punches than take them
7570872 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbour occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
7570873 nato is trying to make a victim of an aggressor and whitewash a criminal regime save a collapsing regime and is taking a path to the rearmament of the current leaders in georgia
7570874 the u s intelligence community buckled sooner in 2002 than previously reported to bush administration pressure for data justifying an invasion of iraq
7570875 the documents suggest that the public relations push for war came before the intelligence analysis which then conformed to public positions taken by pentagon and white house officials
7570876 surge is a success in the context of a devastated population in an obliterated nation lacking in the most essential supplies and services a nation where death continues on a shopping spree
7570877 a recently declassified draft of the cias october 2002 white paper on iraqi wmd programs demonstrates that that the white paper long pre dated the compilation of the national intelligence estimate on iraqi capabilities
7570878 bush administration and the tony blair government began acting in concert to build support for an invasion of iraq two to three months earlier than previously understood
7570879 the draft and final papers show no evidence of intelligence analysis applied to the information contained
7570880 baghdad for now appears to be drawing a line short of conducting terrorist attacks with conventional or cbw against the united states fearing that exposure of iraqi involvement would provide washington a stronger cause for making war
7570881 iraq probably would attempt clandestine attacks against the u s homeland if baghdad feared an attack that threatened the survival of the regime were imminent or unavoidable or possibly for revenge
7570882 i live in terror that some big things going to happen that i dont see coming

7570888 obama intends to make florida one of the premier battleground states
7570889 a walk through the seating floor of the pepsi center at the democratic national convention in denver yields some quick evidence that sen barack obama intends to make florida one of the premier battleground states of his campaign
7570890 a mountain of a paper trail is building in florida as elections supervisors order hundreds of thousands of pounds of the stuff for the first statewide use of optical scan voting
7570891 a hefty trail of paper 90 tons of ballots piling up in palm beach county alone
7570892 the financial crisis that grips florida government now knows no modern precedent but nearly as alarming as the plunging forecasts are the numbingly casual reactions in the capital
7570893 to this news key political leaders have reacted by pulling rhetoric off the shelf crist is behaving as though the 1 8 billion number was made up
7570894 after being slapped by the national party and shunned by the presidential candidates the florida democrats and their 27 electoral votes are now the belles of the ball
7570895 treasure coast democratic delegates ready for their part at national convention
7570896 crist won national praise last year when he sped up floridas much maligned clemency process and returned the right to vote to hundreds of thousands of ex convicts crist said it was the right thing to do winning praise from civil rights groups stymied for years by the states refusal to reform a reconstruction era system they contended was designed to keep blacks from gaining political power florida was one of only three states that did not automatically restore a felons right to vote hold job licenses serve on juries and other rights after serving prison time but in the 15months since crists announcement and 10weeks before a historic presidential election only a tiny fraction of those ex convicts have registered to vote
7570897 some of the ex convicts clearly never made the effort to register but the reasons also include state budget cuts bureaucratic indifference and a failure by crist and his administration to follow through on the changes the governor ordered
7570898 for a governor who hunted down miscreants as attorney general charlie crist seems to have lost his sense of smell so lets help him
7570899 condoleezza rice could hardly get called on for her daily reminders that it is time for russians to get out of georgia and her warning that there will be
7570900 how do you stop the spread of aids in a country where its a crime to admit to homosexuality or in areas where women and children are typically treated as chattel
7570901 cheaper is rarely better its just cheaper for the time being but quite possibly much more expensive down the road with our economy in tatters and new constraints on public spending elected officials in florida face more difficult challenges than ever how with reduced revenue streams and a wave of anti tax sentiment sweeping the state do they see past the bleak present and still find ways to invest in a more hopeful future clearly it requires the courage to set priorities that will make some people and interest groups bitterly unhappy and the vision to realize that we cant continue to use a long term strategy of sandbagging
7570902 i discovered that democrat is now a euphemism for black id be talking about somebody and say hes a democrat and people would say oh no hes white its not socially acceptable to be white and a democrat
7570903 so commenced the single most destructive myth of contemporary american politics the notion that the century long democratic solid south had morphed practically overnight into an equally solid and enduring republican south
7570904 i think this right here will be contagious and it will rub off on a lot of people
7570905 but the good news is this unsolicited five or six of these guys have already said they want to be part of what we do going forward but we have plenty of time to sort through it they need some time off they really do
7570906 this has been an incredible experience from the day we had our first meeting so i think were all just going to get together one day and see whats next
7570907 you live in a bubble in the village and really have no idea what is happening at home

7570911 as you know i sat for five and half years in a house in n vietnam and let me say
7570912 thanks for asking that since georgia is not that far from a place called hanoi where i spent five and half years
7570913 the bill of rights wasnt mentioned at all when i spent five and half years in the hanoi hilton
7570914 senator mccain will you cut taxes on the middle class
7570915 i know a little about taxes since it was very taxing for me to spend five and half years as a guest of the n vietnamese so im in favor of cutting that kind of taxing
7570916 senator mccain do you have anything original to say to americans
7570917 let me say that the five and half years i spent at the hanoi hilton was very original and americans need to understand that
7570918 uhh that depends on what you mean by adult at times in my five and half years spent in hanoi
7570919 it doesnt happen every day but occasionally theyve told me that im dirty to be with a dirty mexican
7570920 i dont want people to say that she married me so i could get my papers
7570921 there are a lot of barriers you have to break everything from food to clothing and music it isnt easy but fortunately my husband has been able to adapt to my culture well
7570922 loving more responsible and have a clear concept of family and also prefer working two shifts so they can be home caring for their children
7570923 this second rescue effort has been planned because a survey of the remaining aquatic habitat inside prospect island has revealed a larger than expected number of fish that survived the dewatering of the island in 2007 as the available habitat has shrunk due to evaporation its ability to support these fish has also diminished
7570924 most of the fish likely to be transported on monday are introduced species like carp and sunfish but it is likely a few sacramento blackfish and possibly other native minnows will also be removed
7570925 ill be back in sacramento today and i am committed 100 percent to the rescue as soon as i get home
7570926 if we save any fish its a lot better than doing nothing
7570927 the reason why the state and federal governments are doing the rescue this time is because of the big stink that we made about the fish kill last november
7570928 zulu is a true warrior panther a servant of the people like herman and i he has fought a good battle for so long unrecognized unsupported this must stop just as all of the many freedom fighters fight everyday just to breathe without any support this must stop now so many political prisoners prisoners of war and prisoners of conscious have sacrificed their lives and freedoms because they believed in the people but somehow the people have stopped believing in them
7570929 cuando montesquieu y los autores de la constituci n estadounidense articularon la concepci n de una constituci n limitativa que se hab a desarrollado en inglaterra establecieron pautas que desde entonces fueron seguidas por el constitucionalismo liberal su objetivo central consist a en proveer salvaguardas institucionales a las libertades individuales y el dispositivo en el que depositaron su confianza era la separaci n de poderes en la manera en que conocemos esta separaci n entre el legislativo el judicial y el administrativo no se ha logrado la meta que se supon a lograr a en todas partes los gobiernos han obtenido poderes por m todos constitucionales que aquellos hombres se propusieron denegar el primer intento para salvaguardar la libertad individual por medio de constituciones ha fracasado

7570963 this musical is coming from the mind of dana marschz the teacher and he doesnt think its funny and hes not trying to be offensive
7570964 the joke of it is that hes so damaged and hes trying to be so honest with his feelings but hes so limited with his abilities that it ends up being completely inappropriate
7570965 hes the son of god and i think thats cool
7570966 so why do i feel like ive been raped in the face
7570967 it maybe came out of frustration because we had seen so many musicals and we were trying to do something that was really funny
7570968 im not pretending these songs are as good as any musical ever

7570976 locally stores wind energy using a hydraulic accumulator in conventional high pressure pipeline storage banks enabling its use as on demand peak power
7570977 if you choose your components correctly it turns out its possible to store as much as a few hours worth of energy at the side of the turbines how we do that i would leave as a secret for a little while but the notion is that in the end all of what were using are elements of technology already commonly found in alberta its not like weve discovered some new vanadium cell or some speculative thing its a case of using good engineering principles and novel integration

7571000 symbolically the restoration of the full vote does mean a lot to people
7571001 it enables democrats to put that behind us and move on to whats most important which is electing a democratic president
7571002 you can challenge the system which doesnt work well and you can land on your feet
7571003 for bringing the sun back out in this process for florida
7571004 we had no candidates no campaign no addressing of michigans issues by the presidential candidates at the time
7571005 because of the early state pledge barack obama is not as well known to the people of florida as he is in a lot of other states or as john mccain is to people in florida
7571006 if the dnc had shown some leadership instead of allowing the leaders of the early states drive the train we could have preserved the historical early states and also prevented the mess

7571060 skyeteks historic success in developing an embedded rfid reader platform for use in field based products allows us to uniquely understand the requirements of a turn key application that provides real time visibility to inventory and employees throughout the sales chain
7571061 our decision to add a business application to our existing portfolio was driven by our installed base of customers who need software to fully leverage the new data streams created from deploying readers onto their customers premises
7571062 many rfid vendors and market observers continue to focus on technological minutiae but the users weve surveyed and interviewed tell us loudly and clearly that to them rfid is about real time fully integrated data they can use to improve their businesses
7571063 skyeteks metafi solution responds to the top challenges facing rfid users easing the integration and maximizing the business value of rfid generated data to help turn that data into higher revenues and better business processes

7571077 rather than by the christian memory and heritage of the vast majority of member states
7571078 generally positive towards the european project and its founding ideals
7571079 as the recent referendum on the lisbon treaty in ireland suggests at least some of those who were previously enthusiastic about the founding aims of the eu both social and economic are now expressing unease
7571080 a fairly widespread culture in european affairs which relegates manifestations of ones own religious convictions to the private and subjective sphere
7571081 this trend within the eu and its impact on people of faith has inevitable political and social consequences not least on levels of support for the project itself
7571082 why it may be important for the eu to look again at a prevailing pragmatic attitude that compromises on essential human moral and social values on the basis of the lowest common denominator
7571083 the experience of many christians within the eu is that this lowest common denominator invariably coincides with the secular and relativist tradition within europe that which denies moral absolutes with an objective basis rather than the religious view
7571084 being denied the right to intervene in public debates or at least having their contribution dismissed as an attempt to protect unjustified privileges such as for example the right to employ people who support the ethos of a christian institution
7571085 successive decisions which have undermined the family based on marriage the right to life from the moment of conception to natural death the sacredness of the sabbath the right of christian institutions to maintain and promote their ethos including schools these and other decisions have made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive commitment to the european project
7571086 a culture which prides itself on the separation of church and state and on its diversity
7571087 intrigued to discover last weekend that it was quite natural to expect the us presidential candidates to answer direct questions about their commitment to faith their willingness to support faith based organisations their position on moral issues and how it would affect their appointment of public officials
7571088 to the day we have the same level of openness and choice in our own elections here in ireland and in europe
7571089 without respect for its christian memory and soul i believe it is possible to anticipate continuing difficulties for the european project these will emerge not only in economic terms but in terms of social cohesion and the continued growth of a dangerous individualism that does not care about god or about what the future might have in store

7571122 recent further price increases in raw materials have been larger than tmcs cost reduction efforts are able to offset
7571123 ive been concerned with that over the years but ive been content to say my piece at the ballot box
7571124 i think baby boomers are going to be a big part of this election more so than young people
7571125 were wondering where the heck is the electric car what kind of a legend are we going to leave our grandchildren and we are a big voting bloc
7571126 the boomer generation is going to come out in large numbers and vote and thats clearly very important
7571127 i dont want to worry about bombs falling on our heads
7571128 i believe that john mccain will keep our country much safer than senator obama
7571129 boomers and older voters are historically the most reliable dependable voting bloc
7571130 you can be sure that any campaign manager worth his salt is trying to figure out how do we get the 50 plus voter
7571131 as a show of unity and in recognition of the historic race she ran
7571132 are very concerned not so much with making money as keeping
7571133 but i think for the boomers in particular whove had the wind kind of at their economic backs since they came out of college thats their big concern
7571134 theyre feeling the economic squeeze and three quarters of them say that government isnt doing enough to help them
7571135 theyre feeling it at both ends at a time when theyre also probably hitting the backstretch of their career
7571136 a bad economy skyrocketing health care food and gas costs all occurring at a time when were living longer theyre dealing with it all
7571137 trying to generally pigeon hole a large group such as baby boomers which is vast is always problematic
7571138 i think there are many factors that influence them what precise stage of life theyre at where they might live could have an impact what type of work theyve done theyre a very varied group
7571139 i dont think its so much that senator obama reminds people of a particular individual i think he represents something that people felt very strongly about and passionate about a sense of this country coming together they remember that time and how powerful an influence it was on their lives i think its affecting how baby boomers view him and how the children of baby boomers view him
7571140 we havent seen it since j f k and bobby kennedy
7571141 ive been concerned with that over the years but ive been content to say my piece at the ballot box

7571161 we make sandwiches fresh daily and most days this corner of the store has a nice bacon odor
7571162 when we opened the first store we were just beer and wine
7571163 i felt like we needed to do something bigger and thats when we got into cheese and it just snowballed from there
7571164 we designed a wine bar and information center as the hub of the store so when you walk in thats where you go if you need help
7571165 there we taste wine seven days a week and from real glassware
7571166 we went with a wood interior wooden floor wood ceiling wood displays a bunch of barrels around
7571167 when you go to a winery there are barrels everywhere to me thats much more appealing in a wine store than wire racks and carpeting
7571168 when we were picking out wines we went out to meet with as many winemakers as possible to develop relationships
7571169 so some of the folks we buy from are so small that no ones ever heard of them but they make delicious wines too
7571170 i was just over at best cellars with founder josh wesson that guy does it different
7571171 ive been through wine stores all over the world and you wont find another store like his
7571172 everybody knows what their taste preferences are but often when it comes to wine they cant connect their palate preferences with a specific bottle or type of wine because theres a cork between them and the product
7571173 this system is just a way of looking at the world of wine how it should be by taste not label because taste is ultimately what really matters
7571174 ive been doing this in various locations for almost 30 years
7571175 so i can offer a level of intimacy that you dont get in a large store
7571176 i have an old following of customers i know their palates i know what they like
7571177 so when i go to a wine tasting i almost know when certain people are going to like a certain wine im out there buying for those people when you go into a box store they dont even know your name
7571178 i love this but i love it at this scale
7571179 business might be better in a bigger space but thats not for me that would take all the fun out of it
7571180 we make sandwiches fresh daily and most days this corner of the store has a nice bacon odor

7571404 there is nobody in our church who is not in some small group
7571405 you couldnt find any better people than our elders or our members
7571406 this is not a very prosperous area and people have offers to leave monroe but they choose to stay here because of the church and its elders
7571407 the other ministries are still vital and necessary but this emphasis has made us a lot more relational and more connected which was our goal
7571408 we have responses just about every sunday and when people come forward no one ever comes down alone
7571409 anywhere from five to 25 people come down with them
7571410 i am in a great place to direct my clients to resources every day
7571411 i can send them into these groups because they are going to meet four or five guys including an older and more mature christians and they are going to know their names and start looking for them at the meetings
7571412 we started with a goal of reaching one hurting person and ended up being the largest local outreach in our congregation
7571413 but mac put me in touch with a group of people who realized that life was definitely not about the stuff but about their walk with the lord
7571414 it is neat to see so many people who are now christians involved in church who never were involved before
7571415 the lord has taken the ashes of our lives and turned them into something beautiful
7571416 we cant stop telling other people what god has done in our lives
7571417 they started this church with a burning desire to reach out and touch people with the compassion that jesus had
7571418 but soon it was all gone members were seeing the changes and they were saying what a wondrous thing
7571419 its remarkable that this tiny christian college in a small idaho hamlet has produced a wealth of church leaders most of them in the west
7571420 virtually all of our alumni are faithful christians and most of them remain married
7571421 in itself this represents magic valleys most important legacy and enduring value
7571422 a healthy doctrine promotes evangelism and evangelism promotes healthy doctrine
7571423 while some want to live outside the box we want to live inside the scriptures
7571424 our motivation is to encourage the church to remain loyal to the word of god and the principles of new testament christianity
7571425 our prayer would be that when people leave this weekend they would be very enthusiastic about their commitment to the word and feel renewed and revitalized to evangelize their communities
7571426 a lot of people make this workshop a part of their vacation
7571427 it lifts me up when im around a lot of christians

7571441 why if it was using mvc then a select wouldnt even lock
7571442 the most powerful computational force known to parascience bistromathics is a way of understanding the behavior of numbers just as einstein observed that space was not an absolute but depended on the observers movement in time so it was realized that numbers are not absolute but depend on the observers movement in restaurants the first nonabsolute number is the number of people for whom the table is reserved this will vary during the course of the first three telephone calls to the restaurant and then bear no apparent relation to the number of people who actually turn up or to the number of people who subsequently join them after the show match party gig or to the number of people who leave when they see who else has turned up the second nonabsolute number is the given time of arrival which is now known to be one of those most bizarre of mathematical concepts a recipriversexclusion a number whose existence can only be defined as being anything other than itself in other words the given time or arrival is the one moment of time at which it is impossible that any member of the party will arrive recipriversexclusions now play a vital part in many branches of math including statistics and accountancy and also form the basic equations used to engineer the somebody elses problem field the third and most mysterious piece of nonabsoluteness of all lies in the relationship between the number of items on the check the cost of each item the number of people at the table and what they are each prepared to pay for the number of people who have actually brought any money is only a subphenomenon in this field numbers written on restaurant checks within the confines of restaurants do not follow the same mathematical laws as numbers written on any other pieces of paper in any other parts of the universe
7571443 how the he l did that happen were not even in a transaction
7571444 i get that but i dont understand why simple read selects need to lock at all i mean maybe if that database was storing my bank account balance in which case transactional orders are hugely important
7571445 row locking on update is a hint to the server not an instruction
7571446 ok but why doesnt sql server re issue the transaction on my behalf then
7571447 except when a database is being recovered snapshot transactions do not request locks when reading data snapshot transactions reading data do not block other transactions from writing data transactions writing data do not block snapshot transactions from reading data

7571690 the new products are being met by increased consumer demand
7571691 according to the usda almonds lead the nations increase in tree nut consumption americans increased their consumption of tree nuts by 23 percent between the mid 1990s and mid 2000s with almonds being among the favourites
7571692 research links consumption of nuts or dried fruit with numerous functional benefits such as improved cardiovascular urinary tract neurological and even dental health
7571693 consumption can also be directly linked to reducing risks for cancer and diabetes as well as lowering cholesterol and helping in weight maintenance as media and the industry promote such findings sales for nuts and dried fruit escalate
7571694 formulations like that at once inflate a minor business decision and trivialize something too important and complex to be reduced to a high school civics lesson about the glories of the first amendment

7571706 nos quedamos m s tranquilos pero no es probable que realicemos estas inspecciones cada vez que un md 82 presente una incidencia

7571711 so youre going to spank me to get me to stop crying yeah that will work
7571712 i am at the end of my own rope and rather than figure out how to help you it will be faster and easier to threaten or spank you into submission and make you be quiet
7571713 worthy are you for you were slain and by your blood you ransomed people for god from every tribe and tongue and language and people and nation
7571714 consistent with the previous findings showing that such set of snps may explain only a small fraction 2 3 ofthe trait variation saxena et al 2007 we have also found that the predictive value of these findings is relatively limited for most individuals the genotypic information will only modestly alter their baseline risk to develop t2d only for a small fraction of the population about 3 the genetic information may indicate a decrease or increase of the baseline risk by twofold upwards or downwards consequently at present the use of genetic information by clinicians for the identification of patients at risk to develop t2d does not seem too relevant nevertheless it is important to emphasize that the value of gene discovery lies primarily in the understanding of the disease as a means to develop efficient therapies

7571718 we waren de betere ploeg en ik ben best tevreden over mijn wedstrijd
7571719 zo raar is dat niet want ik speelde daar vroeger altijd voor ik naar belgi kwam pas in lierse werd ik op de flank gezet
7571720 maar we verliezen twee punten gent is ene goede ploeg maar dit hadden we niet uit hande mogen geven we hebben twee fatale fouten gemaakt
7571721 en dan viseer ik niemand want op de corver was iedereen teruggeplooid
7571722 legear moet zijn kans op de 3 0 afmaken en dan is de wedstrijd gespeeld na die gemiste kans ging bij ons niets meer en gaven we in 15 minuten de wedstrijd gewoon weg na de rode kaart kwamen we met elf tegen tien te staan toen hadden we afstand moeten nemen
7571723 we laten onze doelman niet gaan voor een appel en een ei
7571724 ik zou liefst van al hebben dat silvio een jaartje uitgeleend wordt ik heb hem op het hart gedrukt dat ik wil beschikken over drie goede keepers en dat hij nu niet de foute keuzes mag maken
7571725 often patients think psoriasis is just a rash but it is a systemic inflammatory disease with far reaching affects
7571726 patients should be aware of that and understand that controlling that systemic inflammation can help with other diseases
7571727 it really has made life much more tolerable for patients
7571728 theyre similar to chemicals or compounds we already have in our system they help lessen immune responses they help soak up or diminish the extra inflammatory compounds
7571729 dave barry slept here a short history of the united states

7571734 its well known that when you drink you get a buzz but a couple of hours later that initial impact at least is gone
7571735 there is always a very delicate balance between newly formed cells and dying cells
7571736 its a very active period of that balance because usually you develop a surplus of tissue then later melt it back down to acquire a specific shape
7571737 the digits form because the inter digital tissue dies if it did not die we would have paddles instead of hands with fingers
7571738 you have to make people aware of the science behind the risk
7571739 we are not saying that every pregnant woman who drinks three or four glasses of wine in a short period will have a baby with birth defects but it elevates the risk
7571740 ive never stumped before but i want to be a part of this

7571746 physical therapists strongly recommend tummy time for improving infant development
7571747 codeine itself doesnt have any pain relieving effects but our body changes it into morphine and thats what combats the pain
7571748 the problem is that your genetic makeup makes more or less of it
7571749 so this is where the risk lies because you cant know in advance what that predisposition would be unless you would do a genetic test which is not standard routine at this point so while it would not be a problem in all cases i would say that codeine cannot be considered a safe drug for some mothers who are breast feeding their infants
7571750 the basic nature of this finding does not surprise me given that this is where science is going with a huge effort being made to better understand the interaction of ones genes with exposure to various substances and its not unheard of for this kind of science to lead to an altering of ob gyn practice it should be said for example that it wasnt so long ago in the 60s and 70s that women were actually given alcohol to stop premature labor so the possibility that this is true does create a burden to do the appropriate testing before we make such prescriptions
7571751 my mom died when i was 16 and my dad was a truck driver so my family knew little bit about meeting a budget and some economic and family challenges
7571752 that stands in contrast to his opponent barack obama who has proposed a whole bucket load of tax increases increases that will directly affect our small and medium sized businesses in the country
7571753 you shouldnt have to have your health insurance at risk every time you change jobs
7571754 if you have a democratic congress and barack obama is president theyre going to put that into law
7571755 the best sermons arent preached but lived obamas got a lot of pretty oratory but when you shut the teleprompter off its not so hot
7571756 biden has been so critical in the past of obama not of him personally but of his foreign policy background and experience i certainly think thats going to be an issue i think senator bidens words during the primary will be looked at very closely and carefully now that he is barack obamas vp candidate
7571757 i know how stephanie would be so proud of that
7571758 this is the most diverse political convention in the history of the united states
7571759 so many of you have made major sacrifices to be here to be a part of something bigger than yourself part of diversity part of changing the direction of this country
7571760 you have made that commitment with time and money and sacrifice to be here
7571761 betrayal of the middle class with energy policy written by oil companies
7571762 dont tell me what you believe show me what you do

7571764 biden has been so critical in the past of obama not of him personally but of his foreign policy background and experience i certainly think thats going to be an issue i think senator bidens words during the primary will be looked at very closely and carefully now that he is barack obamas vp candidate
7571765 she made quite an impression around the state of ohio
7571766 she was the kind of person that you like to be around
7571767 biden has been so critical in the past of obama not of him personally but of his foreign policy background and experience i certainly think thats going to be an issue i think senator bidens words during the primary will be looked at very closely and carefully now that he is barack obamas vp candidate
7571768 its an overstatement but field reports are a dime a dozen
7571769 theres no emotional association with them but when youre in a medical environment like an operating room all your senses sight sound smell taste are working its a totally different experience than reading a field report
7571770 what was wrong was that the system wasnt getting quality information from the operating room to engineering quality control and manufacturing the people who could fix the problems people dont want to pass on bad news and engineers can be in denial about a problem
7571771 i said if thats the case youre working on the wrong things
7571772 hoje todo mundo pensa que eu sou um monstro mas n o bem assim

7571793 increase of tobacco consumption and reduction of the physical activity practice level in spanish adolescents avena study
7571794 one of the chief reasons for the great variation in case fatality in different groups is undoubtedly the nature and relative abundance of secondary invaders the excessively high mortality in certain army camps on certain transports and in particular hospitals or barracks seems most readily explicable in this way
7571795 1 the influenza virus weakens the resistant power of the pulmonary tissues so that various bacteria are able to play the role of secondary invaders 2 the precise nature of the secondary and tertiary invaders is largely a matter of accident dependent on the occurrence of particular bacteria in the respiratory tract of persons at the time of infection and in the case of group outbreaks on their occurrence in contacts 3 the character of the resulting pneumonia clinical and pathologic is largely determined by the nature of the secondary invaders whether pfeiffer bacillus streptococcus pneumococcus or other organisms 4 there seems little doubt that the influenza virus besides depressing the general pulmonary resistance also acts directly on the pulmonary tissues causing capillary necrosis edema and hemorrhage 5 it seems to be true therefore that the fatal outcome of influenza pneumonia is determined partly by the degree to which the influenza virus depresses local and general pulmonary resistance and partly by the virulence and nature of the bacteria which invade the tissues in the wake of the specific virus
7571796 the development of this site will enable us to continue expansion of our silicon business in the most cost efficient manner and will consequently support rec s further growth downstream as well as our ambitious long term cost target

7571800 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7571801 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries
7571802 the buckskin mesa project provides falcon with the potential for near term gas production in one of the most productive unconventional gas deposits in the continental u s
7571803 the transaction structure ensures that the commitment to develop the field is only made when there is a high degree of certainty that gas can be extracted on an economically attractive basis

7571809 going through tax reform was a tough thing to do
7571810 no matter how good the package might have been if we couldnt get an agreement from the democrats that any future increases needed a two thirds vote of the legislature we couldnt agree to support it thats what happened
7571811 a reduction in spending is the other half of the equation
7571812 we need tax reform but we also must reduce the increase in spending it has to go hand in hand or it wont work
7571813 i think were getting close one of my biggest disappointments was the passage of the tax to support dirigo i truly believe thats money raised on the backs of maine people and spent on a program thats a failure we need to cover these people but we need to do it by opening up the free market to insurers by eliminating the guaranteed coverage for all mandate we came very close to passing that in the last term
7571814 several of the books accusations are in fact unsubstantiated misleading or inaccurate
7571815 the iphone pricing in inida is so steep that several potential customers were massively disappointed even outraged going by local media reports the princely sum of 31 000 rupees 720 for the 8 gigabyte iphone and 36 100 rupees 840 for the 16 gb version was too high for even such a cool gizmo
7571816 additionally bharti is asking for a deposit of 5 000 rupees while vodafone is reportedly seeking twice as much whats worse india has yet to auction the frequency spectrum required by mobile operators to start offering 3g and a formal 3g launch is estimated to take up to a year so even the rich cool dudes who manage to get themselves an iphone will only be able to enjoy the low speed applications that they had access to anyway on their phones earlier
7571817 during the april june quarter bharti earned 350 rupees a month as average revenue per user implying that the companys average customer can continue using the old phone for 9 8 years more if he or she decides against buying a 16 gb iphone at a cost of 41 100 rupees phone cost of 36 100 plus deposit of 5 000 rupees
7571818 put another way a fresh graduate recruited by one of indias leading software companies will have to pay 1 6 times his or her pretax monthly salary of 25 000 rupees to satisfy an impulse to own the iphone needless to say apple needs to rework its iphone pricing in india if it hopes to attract a respectable number of customers in this poor but rapidly growing economy even if it doesnt other mobile operators and other handset makers probably have much to gain from the iphones launch anyway
7571819 all industry players not just bharti and vodafone will gain from the iphone whether or not apple does

7571835 obesity is occurring at epidemic rates in the u s and worldwide and that impacts the risk and prognosis of many diseases
7571836 we hope this study can be translated into applications to help treat or prevent obesity
7571837 white fat cells are the conventional form of fat designed to store energy by contrast the main role of brown fat is to burn calories by generating heat brown fat cells largely disappear by adulthood in humans but their precursors still remain in the body
7571838 diet and exercise are still the best approaches for weight reduction in the general population
7571839 however for people who are genetically predisposed to obesity these approaches may have very little effect
7571840 as we learn more about the controls of brown fat development medical interventions to increase energy expenditure by brown fat inducing agents such as bmp 7 may provide hope to these individuals in losing weight and preventing the metabolic disorders associated with obesity

7571843 although there was a clear muslim majority in kashmir before the 1947 partition and its economic cultural and geographic contiguity with the muslim majority area of the punjab in pakistan could be convincingly demonstrated the political developments during and after the partition resulted in a division of the region pakistan was left with territory that although basically muslim in character was thinly populated relatively inaccessible and economically underdeveloped the largest muslim group situated in the vale of kashmir and estimated to number more than half the population of the entire region lay in indian administered territory with its former outlets via the jhelum valley route blocked

7571853 if the timing is off the brain wont set up its circuits properly
7571854 the eye is telling the brain when to become plastic rather than the brain developing on its own clock
7571855 the idea that this class of molecular messenger is passed from cell to cell is considered unorthodox in cell biology
7571856 early excitatory input is important to make first contacts between neurons
7571857 the nervous system is recycling an embryonic factor to induce brain plasticity
7571858 the buyers dont even know the source evian spelled backwards is naive
7571859 if you bought and drank a bottle of evian you could refill that bottle once a day for 10 years 5 months and 21 days with san francisco tap water before that water would cost 1 35 the price of a bottle of evian put another way if the water we use at home cost what even cheap bottled water costs our monthly water bills would run 9 000

7571863 all we had was a recommendation from the building and grounds committee that this be approved and it was just a memo from terry ingram to carrol thomas they the committee evaluated four firms and made a recommendation ranking the top three it was my assumption that the building and grounds committee looked over what was submitted by terry ingram and then that information was presented to the full board obviously i was incorrect
7571864 lets say i have received suggestions that i not ask a whole lot of questions but i am going to do it anyway

7571867 hay que preguntarse cu l es el concepto de seguridad y de mantenimiento
7571868 no se puede permitir que de manera reiterativa una empresa deje a consumidores en el suelo y con problemas

7572102 freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction we didnt pass it to our children in the bloodstream it must be fought for protected and handed on for them to do the same or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our childrens children what it was once like in the united states where men were free
7572103 you need to come back for treatment until you run out of money then and only then are you cured
7572104 yea i say unto you my son that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains yea and again i say unto you my son that on the other hand there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy
7572105 the worst day was when they found a spot on my wifes breast x ray all the worry and fear that goes with the possibility of it being a malignant tumor the best day was when we found out nothing was wrong same day
7572106 the weekend will showcase a wide collection of styles salsa cuban son mariachi brazilian baile funk samba rock and hip hop
7572107 it is more about him mendis if he bowls a bad ball then punish him and build up pressure on him
7572108 if you continue to defend him then you know he will also be on top
7572109 it is very important that whenever he bowled a bad bowl we will get runs out of them so that you know he mendis gets under a bit of pressure
7572110 until now he was never under any sort of pressure so he was bowling at his best
7572111 when you are playing with an extra batsman you need to score over 250 runs to put pressure on the opposition team
7572112 on these sort of wickets we need to click especially the top order batsmen one out of the three or four batmen has to carry the innings and others can rotate around him
7572113 only then can we achieve big scores in games like this
7572114 from a team point of view it was the worst display we have had for probably two years
7572115 we have had some time to sit down and reflect and get into the nets to practice but it is more of a mental change than a skills type of thing
7572116 the guys will come out and you will see a different side tomorrow
7572117 we arrived at the game and played it without really thinking about it you cant do that at this level
7572118 certainly not to the standard we have played over the last two years
7572119 you cant perform against top sides in the world at 65 70
7572120 you have to be close to 100 if you want to beat those sides especially the way england played such a good game all round
7572121 it has been nice that i have contributed with the ball
7572122 i didnt think i would make such a contribution with the ball i thought it would be with the bat
7572123 hopefully i can turn things around in the one day series and get some big runs
7572124 the whole tour i have never felt badly out of form i have got a few good nuts along the way and a couple of balls i didnt see which is an interesting combination
7572125 i am not out of nick so there is no reason i cant get some big runs again
7572126 but we have to come out and not worry about the opposition but our game
7572127 that has been our strength over the last two years and if we play the kind of cricket we know we can there is no reason we cant turn it around
7572128 every cricketer goes through a bit of hiccups in one or two games
7572129 but these are quality players i am sure they will find form we just need to handle these situations better
7572130 trailing 1 2 is a tough position to be in but it is a good challenge for us
7572131 you dont want to lose a series while playing at home
7572132 we have analysed our mistakes and we now know where we are going wrong hopefully we can get it right
7572133 its in the bag all we need is confirmation about the one hand one bounce rules and its as good as settled which ball shall we give em then
7572134 does it matter theyre just going to start whingeing again when it gets scuffed up anyway whats for lunch oh i hope its a spot of curry
7572135 french cricket is clearly the way forward especially for developing nations
7572136 in french cricket one doesnt need expensive things like wickets and large fields plus you can play with a tennis ball so if you hit it over the fence its not an issue to have it replaced
7572137 well just have to be careful when it comes to ball tampering balls will have to be checked regularly to ensure they retain their fuzziness
7572138 i are just luving kivin he are my hero i fink everyone in engeland jus luv him
7572139 if kp come anywar near annie i will gif him a pk
7572140 i didnt do it nobody saw me do it you cant prove anything

7572200 die problematik ist gro und juristisch hochbrisant die sperren sind ausgesetzt bis zur entscheidung in der hauptsache der vergleich ist im wesentlichen darin begr ndet dass es formfehler gab
7572201 wir freuen uns sehr im rahmen der er ffnung unserer neuen heimat den eishockeyfans in ganz deutschland und nat rlichen unseren eisb renfans ein highlight wie dieses pr sentieren zu k nnen
7572202 es wird ein tolles match und man wei nie vielleicht gewinnen wir sogar
7572203 berbiete das die spiele von peking endeten so spektakul r wie sie begonnen haben
7572204 die bergabe hat mehr an die zeiten des swinging london als an die kosmopolitische finanzmetropole die sie heute ist erinnert wenn das ein statement der organisatoren war sich nicht mit der gr te und dem spektakel von peking zu messen sondern stattdessen auf flair und witz zu setzen so ist das empfehlenswert
7572205 wir sollten etwas skurril britisches bieten mit einem langanhaltenden erbe und ohne schrecklichen kater als die spiele von peking zu einem spektakul ren ende kamen gab londons b rgermeister boris johnson einen grellen vorgeschmack auf den individuellen stil der in vier jahren erwartet werden kann die schrullige show stand im kontrast zu der perfekt abgestimmten extravaganz der chinesen in gigantischen dimensionen au ergew hnlichen farb effekten einem bombardement von feuerwerk und atemberaubender artistik
7572206 london kann es nur mit einer kollektiven anstrengung schaffen und einem enthusiasmus den viele wom glich f r unzeitgem oder v llig unbritisch halten
7572207 als die nationalhymne gesungen war kam londons chance die welt zu beeindrucken wo peking auf unermessliche zahlen von darstellern setzte nutzte london seinen weltruf und die popul rkultur
7572208 au er den technischen dingen kann london nur sehr wenig von peking lernen nie wieder wird eine nation das geld und den politischen willen aufbringen um olympische spiele diesen ausma es hervorzubringen
7572209 wir m ssen es auf unsere weise tun der traum von london 2012 ist jetzt realit t geworden und in den n chsten vier jahren wird sich die bohrende aufmerksamkeit der welt nach gro britannien richten wenn wir irgendetwas von peking gelernt haben dann ist es nicht noch einmal zu versuchen was hier in china gemacht wurde f r diese spiele waren die kosten unz hlbar
7572210 wenn es irgendwelche zweifel gab dass die spiele 2012 in london anders sein werden als die in peking sind sie mit dem auftritt von londons b rgermeister boris johnson verschwunden ein frecher schuljunge unter erwachsenen
7572211 die ordnung und der pomp der er ffnungsfeier wurde ersetzt durch leichtigkeit frivolit t und spa die schlussfeier erinnerte an eine gigantische party
7572212 vom entz nden des olympischen feuers im vogelnest am 8 august bis zur schlussfeier diese spiele geh rten zu den erinnerungsw rdigsten und spektakul rsten berhaupt aber das berragende thema dieser spiele war kontrolle nach all den aufrufen zu frieden und harmonie nach all den hoffnungen die mit der vergabe der spiele an peking in sachen offenheit und menschenrechte verbunden waren hat es china nicht geschafft die erwartungen zu erf llen
7572213 die spiele waren ein zweifelhafter triumph f r china die welt bewunderte die organisation und die finanziellen mittel von den sportst tten bis zu den verschwenderischen zeremonien auf der anderen seite war es bei allem zu viel der organisation
7572214 fast perfekte organisation rekordflut legend re leistungen die ersten olympischen spiele in china waren ein gro er jahrgang der dem asiatischen riesen erlaubt hat seine kraft unter beweis zu stellen der aber auch die grenzen seiner toleranz aufgezeigt hat
7572215 china auf der ganzen linie siegreich die organisation war perfekt die opposition wurde erstickt und der sportliche erfolg hat sich eingestellt
7572216 china die neue supermacht der gastgeber hat die usa in der welthierarchie entthront auch wenn nicht alle legenden dieser spiele aus china kommen
7572217 china ein koloss mit 100 medaillen die schlussfeier hebt die sportlichen erfolge des landes hervor sie ist zwar informeller als die er ffnungszeremonie sie ist aber trotzdem magisch gigantisch und perfekt
7572218 die olympischen spiele sind zu ende und china ist ein bisschen n her ger ckt
7572219 das china der spiele siegt ber die menschenrechte die welt hat keine klare politische orientierung gezeigt welche china bei den menschenrechten zu einem politikwechsel zwingen k nnte man hat den chinesischen drachen nicht einmal durch fernbleiben bei der er ffnungsfeier in verlegenheit bringen wollen
7572220 rogge behauptet die internationale gemeinschaft habe etwas von china gelernt und china von der internationalen gemeinschaft angesichts der wiederholten schweren verst e gegen grundrechte wie pressefreiheit und meinungsfreiheit durch die chinesische regierung im rahmen der olympischen spiele ist die rede rogges eine schande f r den ioc
7572221 die gigantische sensations show die sommerspiele 2008 bertrafen alles was organisation ablauf und pr zision betrifft
7572222 bye bye peking eine farbenfrohe und stimmungsvolle abschlussfeier china hat zum abschluss der olympischen spiele noch einmal sein leistungsverm gen demonstriert
7572223 peking schlie t die spiele mit einem sehr britischem akzent ab jetzt sind die engl nder dran die besten spiele der geschichte zu organisieren
7572224 die pause hat mir gut getan meine volle konzentration gilt nun meiner weiterentwicklung
7572225 food security and nutrition are key to the overall well being and health of our people and communities in general
7572226 to this end the cluster is proceeding with its programme of using household food production interventions as part of our strategy of improving food security among the most food insecure and vulnerable communities
7572227 we are accelerating our plans regarding the implementation of the national school nutrition porgamme with over 6 million children receiving meals in more than 18 000 public schools
7572228 the awarding of these bursaries do not only benefit individual students his her family and community but is importantly part of the governments accelerated skill development programme and development of our youth so that they may escape many social ills confronting our society
7572229 we chose to embark on an aggressive training of our own youth in the province so that in the mid to long term we have sustainable skill base in the province
7572230 to date we have 40 students studying medicine in cuba we have over 600 students studying various health professions in our tertiary institutions and more than 300 students studying social and community development in various universities
7572231 how can you get confused between a boob and a bottle of milk from the store theyre two different kind of jugs
7572232 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7572233 we have been fortunate enough to have been able to carry the original dvd of the gamers at our shop alone we have sold over 175 copies it has been our honor to have helped the dead gentlemen and their little local movie that could

7572235 the gamers dorkness rising is already one of the best selling products of all time on www paizo com and its not even released yet

7572237 this is one the biggest construction sites in the country we are pleased to see they are vigilant when it comes to protecting the safety of the employees
7572238 it is unbelievable that not a single serious injury has been reported from this big construction site
7572239 this is a great achievement because we do not want the pace of construction to be halted by avoidable accidents
7572240 this is an area which we are going to address quite vigorously during our inspections
7572241 this is the beginning of our blitz inspection we will clamp down all forms of poor safety standards where workers safety is not a priority we will be vocal and take appropriate steps
7572242 we want employers to understand that when workers go to their respective jobs they are not going there to die or to sustain serious injuries workers are bread winners of our families so we need to protect them
7572243 this organisation has about 4 000 retired ex managers working unpaid for them willing to transfer their knowledge and experience to smaller companies in development countries
7572244 it may also be that they want to export their products and need good advice on european product rules and regulations
7572245 pum promotes long standing relationships and frequent contacts between experts and clients
7572246 many pum senior experts continue to advise their clients after their return to the netherlands
7572247 these are measures such as sending public health nurses or equivalent professionals to visit the homes of high risk families such as low income families and those with teenage or unmarried first time mothers to help them with parenting practices mental health problems and to address the use of tobacco and alcohol
7572248 this means the country should work against violence through community based structures
7572249 we need to send out the message that violence is unacceptable and as a nation we are not acceptant of violence
7572250 its clear that alcohol plays a role in crime and what the media then does is glamorise the use of it which is misleading because it does not give them a clear distinction of what it can do

7572489 al llegar de nuevo a casa ver n que los gastos son tantos que no pueden cubrirlos
7572490 si el problema se repite a o tras a o si despu s el periodo de adaptaci n el trabajo no nos gusta hay que plantearse cambios en la actividad laboral
7572491 sensaci n de tristeza falta de sue o irritabilidad ansiedad e inquietud son algunos de sus s ntomas
7572492 si el trabajo que se realiza es estimulante o las relaciones con los compa eros son positivas su duraci n es menor
7572493 el periodo de adaptaci n suele ser m s corto para el hombre que para la mujer ya que ste suele tener m s facilidad para relacionarse con los compa eros que las mujeres que suelen mostrarse m s reservadas a la vuelta de las vacaciones sobre todo si stas no han sido lo que se esperaban
7572494 si disponemos de un mes y nuestra empresa nos lo permite podemos coger quince d as primero y otros quince m s adelante esto nos servir para evitar saturarnos la sensaci n de estar de vacaciones se alargar y adem s los cambios en los h bitos no ser n tan dr sticos y permanentes por lo que la incorporaci n no ser tan traum tica
7572495 son f ciles de hacer y dif ciles de aplicar y mantener
7572496 cuando esa expectativa es desmesurada y no encuentra respuesta existe frustraci n
7572497 evitar tener la sensaci n de que las vacaciones son un estado absolutamente opuesto al periodo de trabajo y por tanto uno de placer y el otro de malestar y sufrimiento

7572503 we are concerned by statements that attack the 2008 farm bill that leave one to believe that most funding in the farm bill is for government payments to farmers when this is not the case
7572504 over two thirds of the funding authorized in the farm bill is for the food stamp program and other nutrition initiatives another 9 percent is reserved for conservation initiatives 14 percent to provide a safety net for farmers with the remaining 10 percent spent on energy initiatives rural development research trade promotion international food assistance crop insurance and other priorities in fact spending for commodity support programs actually decreased 1 7 billion and the commodity program share of the annual federal budget fell threefold from 0 75 percent to 0 25 percent when compared to the previous farm bill
7572505 we know that farmers want to receive their income from the market as they currently do
7572506 we also know that markets are cyclical and that a responsible safety net is essential in times of low prices or low yields
7572507 we do believe that with the current strain on current production areas to meet food feed and fuel needs it is appropriate for those acres in the conservation reserve program crp that are not environmentally sensitive to be returned to production as their contracts expire
7572508 the united states sells nearly one half of its annual soybean crop abroad in the form of soybeans soybean oil soybean meal and livestock products
7572509 accordingly asa has historically supported trade agreements as the best way to open global markets to exports of u s products u s agricultural exports contributed nearly 90 billion to total u s exports in 2007 and soybeans and soy products accounted for more than 12 billion of those exports
7572510 we are prepared to see trade distorting farm support programs reduced to enhance trade liberalization
7572511 however importing nations with high tariffs on agricultural products particularly developing countries must take comparable steps to opening their markets to u s exports in this regard asa was not satisfied with the status of the doha trade negotiations at the time they were suspended earlier this month and supports the united states refusal to accept an unbalanced outcome
7572512 asa also strongly supports tax policy that promotes the growth of renewable and biobased industries
7572513 extension of the biodiesel tax incentive is essential in order to increase home grown diesel fuel supplies and refining capacity this is asas top legislative priority during the remainder of the 110th congress

7572523 the manual specifically looks at how to conduct performance reviews that are fair to both men and women according to the guide women now constitute nearly half of law school graduates and 30 percent of all lawyers but make up only 17 percent of partners in private firms the guide says this is at least partially due to a biased job evaluation process

7572551 from the caribbean to the caspian weve had one bullish headline after another and the market cannot generate a sustained rally
7572552 it certainly doesnt bode well for anyone who owns commodities
7572553 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7572554 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries

7572563 from a team point of view it was the worst display we have had for probably two years
7572564 we have had some time to sit down and reflect and get into the nets to practice but it is more of a mental change than a skills type of thing
7572565 the guys will come out and you will see a different side tomorrow
7572566 we arrived at the game and played it without really thinking about it you cant do that at this level certainly not to the standard we have played over the last two years
7572567 you cant perform against top sides in the world at 65 70 you have to be close to 100 if you want to beat those sides especially the way england played such a good game all round
7572568 it has been nice that i have contributed with the ball
7572569 i didnt think i would make such a contribution with the ball i thought it would be with the bat hopefully i can turn things around in the one day series and get some big runs
7572570 the whole tour i have never felt badly out of form i have got a few good nuts along the way and a couple of balls i didnt see which is an interesting combination
7572571 i am not out of nick so there is no reason i cant get some big runs again
7572572 but we have to come out and not worry about the opposition but our game
7572573 that has been our strength over the last two years and if we play the kind of cricket we know we can there is no reason we cant turn it around
7572574 its amazing how quickly it can turn around but its happened like that in the past
7572575 in australia it was that kind of scenario in 2006 2007 and it is amazing when you get that low you think it cant get any worse bugger it lets go at the bowler rather than the other way around
7572576 you get into a situation where you think every ball being bowled to you is going to get you out and mentally that is not frame of mind to be in
7572577 it was probably mentally the worst spell of my career because its just happened and its fresh in my mind
7572578 i always remember in australia i was really low because we went over there with high expectations and to get beat 5 0 was a real low they rubbed our noses in it over there so that was a real tough time
7572579 but playing against new zealand out of the two series you would say you would expect to score more runs against them and i found it a real battle
7572580 the funny thing is were always asked to be 100 all of the time and whether it is sub conscious or not weve got a big ashes series coming up and maybe sub consciously you try and peak at the right times
7572581 id rather be crap against new zealand and then build form up towards australia maybe that is the way to look at it but when youre going through that spell youre not feeling like that
7572582 but like any other sport i guess youve got to peak at the right times i did all right against south africa at the end and lets hope i can kick that on now

7572590 i think ive been working hard to get the message out after the primary
7572591 im gratified by the reception that i have been receiving
7572592 even if you work its difficult to get ends meet
7572593 i think the more people that understands our rich history in the primary the better chance we have in protecting it
7572594 i dont think its a good thing to have both your president and vice president between them have 11 homes at a time when were in a housing crisis
7572595 i think the area where we spent the most attention was how to actually write the health care plank because clinton had proposed that it be an actual mandate to purchase health care and obama had not were all in agreement that there needs to be healthcare coverage for every man woman and child in the united states

7572604 when we see a player like that we know he could be a tight end an outside linebacker a defensive end eventually an offensive tackle so when a kid comes in like that really where he could end up going theres no risk for us
7572605 we thought friel would be a tight end and hes proven that and again it is just the type of young man that he is so we talked about the physical part but the rest of it was so clear that this is where he belongs that you know it has been a good fit

7572618 the opportunity for the industry to grow and prosper is tremendous
7572619 technologies that are in use today including the widely used claus process are more energy and capital intensive
7572620 in addition they also lose the hydrogen in the process instead of capturing the hydrogen from the hydrogen sulfide the claus process ends up converting it into water
7572621 if a pilot plant demonstrates that the process is a major improvement over existing technology and we believe it is it will spur the interest of industries that use a process to separate hydrogen sulfide
7572622 companies will be able to retrofit their facilities with the process technology or construct new plants that incorporate it
7572623 in the meantime we are working with argonne to use the technology for other energy applications such as gas cleanup for integrated gassification combined cycle plants
7572624 i must say this is by far one of the best programs we have offered to our community our visitation increased approximately 400 percent museum on main street is a godsend to small museums such as ours
7572625 one of the purposes of our research is to develop better designs for precast concrete buildings
7572626 this is really important to our industry because well be able to develop structures that can resist natures most difficult loads including earthquakes
7572627 we conducted tests from lower seismicity all the way to higher seismicity and shook the building stronger and stronger each time with a higher intensity
7572628 since that time we have been working to come up with designs that will make these structures survive a northridge earthquake or stronger
7572629 we are only able to perform physical experiments on that one structure but if we can show that our models capture important response properly we can run hundreds of earthquake simulations a year for the cost of a graduate student a fast computer and a software license which at around 50 000 is substantially less than the costs of these kinds of tests
7572630 the englekirk center is very important to the research community and to the industry because it has an outdoor environment where we can perform large scale tests that cant be done anywhere else in the world
7572631 triggered star formation continues to be very hard to prove
7572632 but our preliminary analysis shows that the phenomenon can explain the multiple generations of stars seen in the w5 region
7572633 our first look at this region suggests we are looking at one or two generations of stars that were triggered by the massive stars
7572634 we plan to follow up with even more detailed measurements of the stars ages to see if there is a distinct time gap between the stars just inside and outside the rim
7572635 after 12 weeks the whole body vibration group weighed less showed no changes in lean muscle mass and had a lower overall percentage of body fat than the age matched non vibration group
7572636 over the course of the study the vibrated rats were healthy tolerated the vibration well and exhibited no obvious signs of distress following adaptation to vibration
7572637 vibration training has been shown to improve strength and balance in older women
7572638 vibration training may give you the same results as a moderate intensity workout
7572639 we found that there are a variety of behaviors learning disabilities and emotional problems that are unique to patients with xxyy syndrome that may be better addressed with more targeted therapies
7572640 our research is important because it provides an accurate picture of what patients are experiencing that can help physicians who treat patients with the disorder
7572641 until now physicians have had to search the medical literature to patch together a treatment plan mostly based on information on klinefelter syndrome
7572642 as a result people with xxyy werent being screened for the specific medical problems associated with their disorder they werent receiving therapies or medications for the behavioral and neurodevelopmental issues that are more profound for them and they werent receiving the types of community services that can help them live independent lives our research is an important resource for families and practitioners
7572643 life skills are more of a struggle for these males and they may need different medications a broader array of behavioral therapies and more intensive community support than those with klinefelter syndrome
7572644 we were tired of having our families running around the country looking for answers from people who didnt have them
7572645 the more we talked the more we realized our boys had things in common that were not addressed in the literature
7572646 kyle knows that people dont understand xxyy and therefore dont understand him as a person she said
7572647 the study helps the world know why he is like he is it validates what he knows about himself and what we know about him when he cant follow directions its not because hes stupid
7572648 a new look at xxyy syndrome medical and psychological features

7572650 some of the best dramatic works were written by people who were first and foremost poets whether its sophocles or shakespeare or samuel beckett thats often the case

7572655 teaching is properly done by hunch by intuition by experience by ideology what it also needs is a basis in scientific research
7572656 gages empirical work and his theoretical defense of scientific research on teaching have been tenacious and are in no small part the basis of our contemporary faith that there is a role for traditional science in educational research in particular and the social sciences in general
7572657 it is professor gages achievements as an empirical scientist and as a defender of the role of science in education that brings him the respect of the community of educational psychologists but i think that he is honored in our field as well for his decency humor affection unfailing optimism and for his mentoring of and friendship with many other scholars in the field
7572658 at that time people werent accepting jews into graduate schools
7572659 ability to bridge the gap between the complex theory of educational psychology and the insistent practical demands of the classroom
7572660 it structured the field of research on teaching directed attention to important topics influenced the research agenda for a decade and affected government funding for the next 20 years
7572661 its substantive contributions to research on teaching were many but in some way its major products were well trained psychologically oriented personnel
7572662 in his hesitant voice nate said id like to comment on something i heard last year i think it was by one of my students

7572664 my dad loved to have fun and he loved to laugh
7572665 he had a certain number of things he repeated again and again so much so that we started repeating them and one of his greatest joys was that his children were following his example

7572672 biologists have known that in these beetles there is an investment trade off between secondary sexual characters and primary sexual characters
7572673 as horns get bigger copulatory organs get smaller or vice versa what was not known was how frequently and how fast this can occur in nature and whether this can drive the evolution of new species
7572674 in terms of the integrity of a species its important for these things not to change too much
7572675 so there is a lot of evidence suggesting that within species or within the populations of species natural selection maintains genital characters but if these primary sex characters are linked to other characters that can change readily then youve got what we think is a very exciting mechanism that could prime populations for reproductive isolation
7572676 if this is all it takes to change genitalia it may be easier to make new species than we thought

7572693 yes i cant wait to get home and put on my ac and a big comfy sweatshirt
7572694 o meu ideal pol tico a democracia para que todo o homem seja respeitado como indiv duo e nenhum venerado
7572695 he has a very traditional belief that satire is a sort of a moral endeavor that you are waging this righteous battle against powerful figures and institutions and you can actually affect and change society and peoples lives through your satire
7572696 people might find that na ve or self inflating he does have a big ego in that sense but he is also very principled
7572697 are scattershot and indiscriminate in their targets reflexively rebellious in their treatment of anything on the cultural radar
7572698 deep neglected uncharted territory a sort of brain of darkness
7572699 many editors felt he didnt belong on the comics page
7572700 his is political cartooning in a comic strip form and thus unlike most comic strips at the same time it is superior to a lot of the political cartoons because there is character development and ongoing narrative complexity
7572701 you expect a satirist to engage in exaggeration and distortion
7572702 but that runs counter to the roles or objectives of an investigative journalist who has to be very strict about sources and information and make sure its accurate i defend his right to do it but it causes grief for editors and readers who may not know what they are reading
7572703 obama could be difficult but trudeau might target his penchant for elevated rhetoric and deeply resonant voice that can sometimes sound pretentious
7572704 maybe his symbol would be some kind of floating trumpet coming out of the clouds like a pronouncement from the heavens
7572705 hed have an easier time with mccain who is often depicted as a hothead you wonder if hed go with a stick of dynamite with the fuse lit or hammer the age stereotype with a walker of some kind
7572706 as a player you have to accept it and work accordingly he salazar and augie know what they have to do to get ready
7572707 and you have to get them a start when they have a chance to to have some success
7572708 ill try to look at the matchups and make sure that they can succeed like if a guy is 6 for 10 off of a certain pitcher ill do my best to get him in there it wasnt always that way when i was a bench player
7572709 for a guy who didnt start with us he had quite the impact one play the catch can accentuate your importance to a team and make you feel more comfortable but we saw plays like that one all the time from jeff
7572710 these are measures such as sending public health nurses or equivalent professionals to visit the homes of high risk families such as low income families and those with teenage or unmarried first time mothers to help them with parenting practices mental health problems and to address the use of tobacco and alcohol
7572711 this means the country should work against violence through community based structures
7572712 we need to send out the message that violence is unacceptable and as a nation we are not acceptant of violence
7572713 its clear that alcohol plays a role in crime and what the media then does is glamorise the use of it which is misleading because it does not give them a clear distinction of what it can do
7572714 live a responsible life and prepare yourselves to take the mantle of leadership instead of allowing yourselves to be used as thugs
7572715 what impact are you making on your society what legacy are you leaving behind
7572716 the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing
7572717 football is really what i wanted to do and that was my true love and passion i just loved running the ball
7572718 my brother told me not to spend all of my time studying like he did and i heeded that advice a bit too much when it came time to go to any division 1 school that i wanted to go to i just couldnt get in and reality set in real quick i realized that i kind of messed things up and i had to go play baseball hindsight is definitely 20 20 and things definitely worked out but my true passion and love is football and thats what i wanted to do
7572719 those days to me were the most precious day that i ever had when i broke in i was 22 and the next guy closest in age to me was 32 so i had an opportunity to be around guys like buddy bell nolan ryan larry anderson and billy doran and to see how these guys go about their business was incredible they worked hard day in and day out and they were always available for the media whether the result was good or bad to me those were the most valuable days that i have ever had
7572720 buddy made it clear that you are held accountable it doesnt matter who you are whether you are the big fish or the littlest fish on the team you play the game the right way and if you dont then somebody is going to say something to you it taught me how to go about my business if you dont do the right thing and you dont stand up then well make sure that you are there to do that
7572721 theyve been the best its hard its rough on my boys and my daughter you feel like you are never there and you arent there to help them with the little daily things that most dads get to do and thats the hardest thing they pay the biggest price and you cant put a price tag on that you cant go back in years and back in time and start all their activities and memories over again my wife and my kids have been nothing but the best in allowing me to go out here and do what ive got to do
7572722 i got introduced to cancer at a young age when a good friend on my paper route lost their son at the age of 10 years old i was fourteen at the time and i learned what it really does to a family from then on i knew that if i ever had a chance to make an impact or do anything that cancer would be the way to go this was a perfect fit and they are one of the reasons why i stayed in houston just as much as ive had an impact of their lives theyve had more of an impact on mine i understand how lucky we are to do what we do and how fortunate we all are to help them out if only a little bit
7572723 it is something that as an active player you just go out there and play but for people to mention you and the hall of fame in the same breath is very humbling to me i dont look at myself as that type of player so you love the game and you play the game and if people think that in five years from now then that would be the ultimate i just try to play the game the right way be a positive role model and leave my legacy behind i know that i am very appreciative of getting to play the greatest game in the world
7572724 boys will be boys the making of son of rambow
7572725 if they start enforcing the caps were going to have to change service
7572726 this isnt really an issue thats just going to be about frontier
7572727 virtually every broadband provider has been suddenly discovering that theres this so called bandwidth crisis going on in the united states
7572728 if they continue to make the necessary investments theres no reason they cant keep up
7572729 review review not quite what i was planning six word memoirs by writers famous and ob
7572730 small business owners including firms not directly targeted by the mandate have been telling us that this mandate will be a hardship for their businesses and hinder their ability to create and retain jobs
7572731 the main objection was that it was just another add on to the city mandating what businesses have to pay to stay in business
7572732 but since then we really have not heard much about it being a major issue for a lot of businesses
7572733 to all of our family and friends we are pleased to announce that our little princess anja louise ambrosio mazur was born on sunday aug 24 at 7 32 p m she is 6 3 lbs and absolutely perfect
7572734 i will be able to dance i will make it
7572735 if you saw my room it looked like a murder scene i did hurt myself but im fine i wish this didnt happen i have to wear heels all day
7572736 the car has been standing for so long he needed the help of a booster every time he stopped
7572737 the windscreen was so dirty he could hardly see through it and ended up taking it for a good clean to the car wash where his bandaged hand was readily visible
7572738 i only wish i were a rocket scientist instead of a law school professor
7572739 its not about willpower we treat our clients with therapy
7572740 what i learned the past 10 years is very sad its unbelievable the destruction this causes
7572741 we found that unless youve experienced it you dont really know the experience of losing a child from drugs
7572742 even compared with suicide leukemia or a car accident drugs have a terrible stigma
7572743 i know mary and germaine are just a phone call away
7572744 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
7572745 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline not an open time frame
7572746 were optimistic that iraq and the u s can reach a mutual agreement on flexible goals for u s troops to continue to return on success based on conditions on the ground and allow iraqi forces to provide security for a sovereign iraq
7572747 we dont want the phrase time horizons we are not comfortable with that phrase
7572748 stopped talking about the withdrawal of combat troops we just talk about withdrawals
7572749 courtesy of the red white and blue the angry american
7572750 well put a boot in your ass its the american way
7572751 now we are going to have a debate about it
7572752 put a bib on him and put him in a high chair

7572756 like many most urban pedestrians i have little sympathy for critical mass thugs
7572757 i say it again as ignorant as it sounds the cop should get a medal good for him
7572758 as an avid road cyclist i have big problems with things like critical mass what they do is extremely unsafe and gives responsible cyclist a bad name
7572759 years i still admitted to liking bob dylan and listened to him thus the news today that bob dylan endorses barack obama made me smile
7572760 its going to be an awesome party with my favorite rides hanging out with friends fireworks and more
7572761 it speaks well for our institutions consciousness in preventing an otherwise needless waste
7572762 whenever theres a bunch of people here at one time it gets crazy you have people bumping into you so if youre balancing stuff youre going to end up dropping something or breaking something
7572763 it speaks well for our institutions consciousness in preventing an otherwise needless waste
7572764 whenever theres a bunch of people here at one time it gets crazy you have people bumping into you so if youre balancing stuff youre going to end up dropping something or breaking something
7572765 so if a college is looking to go green they need to start looking in the dining facility

7572771 theres just too much uncertainty out there creating all this volatility and whats adding to the volatility is were entering this holiday period the swings are exaggerated by the light volumes
7572772 you really need to see a resolution to those three issues or at least some type of clear picture to those issues
7572773 omdat onze verzoeken aan de georgische en de russische autoriteiten tot dusver onvoldoende informatie hebben opgeleverd zullen we zelf een team afvaardigen dat op korte termijn ter plaatse feitenonderzoek kan uitvoeren
7572774 de crisis tussen georgi en rusland is nog niet ten einde en het geweld heeft diepe wonden geslagen
7572775 maar ik wil niets nalaten wat meer informatie zou kunnen opleveren
7572776 i have a very honorable opponent there are stark differences between us
7572777 when you do shop at the grocery store its very limited they dont have a very wide selection
7572778 i think if we had a farmers market i think we would shop more and eat more produce
7572779 were already outpacing 2007 so i think were going to see significant growth
7572780 its not the kind of noise you would expect to hear in this area
7572781 whenever someone is on the range it impacts the quality of outdoor living in this area
7572782 if someone is having an outdoor dinner or sitting outside and enjoying the birds thats not the kind of thing that you would want to hear
7572783 the conservation league has been in the site it is currently for the past roughly 60 years
7572784 not a lot has changed in the industry making things extremely louder
7572785 the area land has definitely developed from when we moved in
7572786 as people move in all of a sudden they become aware that there is something in the neighborhood
7572787 because we changed that ordinance in the meantime does not mean they cant keep operating as they always have
7572788 we have worked with them in the past to modify their shooting hours
7572789 i have heard from other long term neighbors in the area that this becomes background noise
7572790 it was the very heavy loud noise coming all afternoon and reverberating around the hills
7572791 weve been trying to move them for years but nobody wants a gun club nearby

7572794 the internet is actually a social condition where everyone in the network society is connected directly without intermediation to everyone else
7572795 i am worried about the decision in the russian duma about recognizing independence for south ossetia and abkhazia this would be against international law
7572796 i presume that the russian president will not sign this resolution because that would bring about a very difficult and critical situation in regards to georgias territorial security
7572797 its disturbing and its just not im just really shaken up right now im just really upset
7572798 im really shocked this is a first for me and this kind of scares me because i have two sisters and were like between 20 and 25 this is really scary
7572799 it makes you think to be on the lookout just in case to be more careful when youre walking around

7572801 using proteopedia anyone can easily create descriptions of biomacromolecules linked to their 3d structure
7572802 we are presenting proteopedia to the scientific community to judge its usefulness and merit and we truly hope that it will offer an effective and appealing way to convey the link between 3d structure and function
7572803 everybody woke up after the last election and realized the democratic party had not done well dealing with religious voters
7572804 has a wider deeper agenda that includes poverty protecting the environment or creation care war and peace human trafficking and darfur for instance
7572805 i believe in separation of church and state and so does barack obama
7572806 but that doesnt mean segregation of moral values from public life or the banishing of religious language from the public square dr martin luther king invoked the prophets jeremiah isaiah and jesus he spoke with a bible in one hand and the constitution in the other
7572807 faith in 2009 how an obama administration will engage people of faith
7572808 senator obama is a committed christian and he believes that people of all faiths have an important place in american life
7572809 we are honored that so many religious leaders are reaching across partisan and ideological lines in this convention to address the values that matter to americans
7572810 some of his campaign literature makes george w bush look like a member of the aclu
7572811 there is a lot of alienation among evangelicals in the republican party people are more open to looking at obama
7572812 some people in the obama campaign are taking the views of pro lifers seriously
7572813 whether its because of conscience or electoral necessity they are doing something
7572814 we need to make sure we put faith in action we need to stay focused on the needs of people particularly the least of these our faith as christians calls us to
7572815 ill be focusing on the issues iraq poverty the environment the sanctity of life
7572816 i cant think of anything more important that i could be doing
7572817 so im happy to be part of this campaign i think obama will make a tremendous president and tremendous leader i saw that during the vice presidential process
7572818 there is one candidate who offers that same sense of hope and inspiration
7572819 she made it clear with ted kennedy that she thought that sen obama was the heir to her fathers legacy
7572820 and out of my book tour recently so many people came up to me and told me that they cast their first vote for my father and they described to me what that felt like and it just sounded so much like what im hearing from my own children that i thought this is really something special
7572821 well i grew up on the beach you grow up on the beach and i think the natural inclination is to want to eat everything that you see
7572822 and then you get into the fried food and its like oh my god anything fried is good but a clam fried is heaven
7572823 well i used to work at a clam shack in marblehead called flynnies at the beach which doesnt exist anymore
7572824 but i fried clams and i brought calamari to the menu too because they werent doing calamari
7572825 i dont know what life would have been like without the fried clam so its kind of a mecca
7572826 you imagine the little fat bellies dropping into the oil start to salivate
7572827 actually 92 years ago my grandfather came up with the idea of putting some fried clams in his chip fryalator to deep fry em
7572828 and on july 4th big parade coming through he put a big sign out fried clams and sold 35 worth of product that day and thats the most he took in in any day of operation so he wasnt a stupid man so he kept them on the menu
7572829 i leave my fellow delegates with a heavy heart and i ask that everyone keep my family in their prayers
7572830 the man was armed with a gun and holding a woman against her will
7572831 as the officers were attempting to calm the man shots were fired
7572832 hes been a highly regarded employee of our police department for about four years
7572833 we made several improvements in the technique that could allow us to perform this type of procedure routinely
7572834 we traditionally try to save the kidney for smaller tumors performing a robotic partial nephrectomy
7572835 for larger tumors however patients would get a very large incision on their side now we can remove kidneys with cancer through a single three inch incision near the patients belly button
7572836 i think this is going to be a big advance for having to remove the entire kidney because of large kidney tumors this could be a great improvement over traditional open and laparoscopic surgeries
7572837 the robotic instruments are like having my hands inside the body
7572838 we think well see the same advantages with robotic kidney surgery as we have with robotic prostatectomy
7572839 during everyday life we constantly evaluate social behaviour and this largely affects how we feel about ourselves and other people
7572840 but the way we store and use information about our own and other peoples social behaviour are not well understood
7572841 this latest study used functional brain imaging to identify the circuits in the brain that underpin our ability to differentiate social behaviour that conforms to our values from behaviour that does not
7572842 the most distinctive feature of depressive disorders is an exaggerated negative attitude to oneself which is typically accompanied by feelings of guilt
7572843 now that we understand how the brains of healthy individuals respond to feelings of guilt we hope to be able to better understand why and where there are differences in brain activity in people suffering from or prone to depression
7572844 the brain region we have identified to be associated with proneness to guilt has been shown to be abnormally active in patients with severe depression in several previous studies but until now its involvement in guilt had been unknown
7572845 by translating these basic cognitive neuroscience insights into clinical research we now have the potential to discover new key functional anatomical characteristics of the brain that may lie behind depressive disorders
7572846 the results will hopefully make an important contribution to our understanding of the causes of depression that will ultimately allow new approaches to find better treatments and prevention
7572847 an investment of 41 million in fertilizer research through 1981 returned an incredible 57 billion to u s agriculture
7572848 that doesnt include benefits of the technology to the rest of the world
7572849 tvas fertilizer program is recognized as one of the most effective research and development programs of any u s agency its benefits to the world far outweigh the public investment that the united states made in fertilizer research and development
7572850 its time to launch a radical initiative to develop a new generation of energy efficient fertilizers to help avert hunger and famine
7572851 tva technology fueled the sweeping advances of u s farmers in food and fiber production in the 60s to 80s
7572852 today fertilizers are responsible for more than a third of total u s crop production
7572853 the 57 billion return from a 41 million investment included about 49 billion from use of high analysis fertilizers and 8 billion from process development and improvement thats a benefit cost ratio of more than 20 to 1
7572854 tva followed promising new fertilizers from conception to production to national acceptance by farmers and the fertilizer industry
7572855 its program was based on fundamental research followed by process development and technology transfer
7572856 tva then stopped work on that project and moved to develop newer and more promising technologies
7572857 i am concerned about the state of the fertilizer industry itself
7572858 work should begin now on the next generation of fertilizer products using advanced techniques such as nanotechnology and molecular biology especially in conjunction with plant genetics research smart fertilizer products that will release nutrients only at the time and in the amount needed should be developed
7572859 the world needs a major research effort to improve the effectiveness of fertilizer production and use
7572860 fertilizer is a commodity industry and it is unlikely the industry alone will undertake the research some public investment is probably required
7572861 to decisively step up investment in science and technology for food and agriculture
7572862 the need for increased food is escalating but new agricultural technology is not keeping pace
7572863 an effective research program to develop a new range of fertilizers should be a key element of any long term strategy to alleviate the food crisis
7572864 most fertilizer products used today were developed when energy seemed abundant and cheap but with rising prices we should develop a new generation of fertilizer products that use plant nutrients more efficiently
7572865 such innovations will require investments in research but such costs would be miniscule compared to the benefits for humanity
7572866 ifdc is in a unique position to meet this challenge
7572867 its well known that when you drink you get a buzz but a couple of hours later that initial impact at least is gone
7572868 there is always a very delicate balance between newly formed cells and dying cells
7572869 its a very active period of that balance because usually you develop a surplus of tissue then later melt it back down to acquire a specific shape
7572870 the digits form because the inter digital tissue dies if it did not die we would have paddles instead of hands with fingers
7572871 you have to make people aware of the science behind the risk
7572872 we are not saying that every pregnant woman who drinks three or four glasses of wine in a short period will have a baby with birth defects but it elevates the risk
7572873 in a longstanding mystery smoking high cholesterol and lack of exercise should drive disease to develop evenly throughout all blood vessels but in reality atherosclerotic lesions tend to cluster where vessels branch
7572874 our study provides new insight into why and suggests how the protection afforded by the force of steady flow and simple stretch might be strengthened with drugs
7572875 obviously we should all be exercising to get our hearts pumping fast which increases blood flow force through our vessels
7572876 beyond that genetic engineers may in the future design gene therapy that delivers genes only into cells at blood vessel branch points to increase pecam 1 signaling alternatively drug designers might create super active fyn amplifying the signaling effects of pecam 1 phosphorylation to protect vulnerable areas of blood vessels from inflammation
7572877 turning the house upside down adding weight to it and shaking it
7572878 on the surface it looks good and better than id expected
7572879 the only way theyre going to turn the ship around is to bring to market compelling products that are competitively priced
7572880 the numbers tell me were not doing enough yet and weve got to keep working hard to make them better
7572881 the profitability strategy is get these products out in the marketplace and sell them in millions
7572882 in 12 months demand for our computer forensics services has shifted 180 degrees
7572883 in april there was more demand for our work in australia than in the us and canada combined
7572884 then like clockwork we saw the perpetrators realise these guys have really wised up
7572885 then they started looking for other areas where these compliance standards are not in place or at least where there are no financial penalties
7572886 we expect that by the middle of next year breaches by partial insiders will surpass those of anonymous external intrusions and they already outstrip internal threats
7572887 they go to the call centres the offshore web developers the contractor groups and recruit someone who has access to hundreds or thousands of customers who have systems with vulnerabilities hates their boss and has financial problems
7572888 it is not uncommon for a retailer to have 1000 stores located in four countries but only 200 it people and theyre all in one office
7572889 they have to rely on vendors to support their most critical systems and handle their most sensitive data
7572890 our product needs to have quality of design quality of concepts architecture of the system but it also must have quality of execution in the code we write and how well it performs compared with what is required
7572891 we needed to be able to test such a complex environment and not spend a massive amount of time managing the testing process tracking requirements and issues and referring them back to the developer
7572892 we used to do all of those things on spreadsheets and kind of manually and it was very laborious
7572893 we can now execute a test process in a week rather than a month so if we allow two weeks for testing we will be doing it in half the time and will do twice as much
7572894 it allows the team to share resources because there is a single spot where we have all of the requirements recorded
7572895 we can register the test results and know what issues occurred by function in which particular release of the product and who were the developers so there is complete traceability which is very important
7572896 we can also pinpoint areas where the number of errors is greater and it gives an idea as to which team member has a higher than average number of incidents
7572897 the moment we start capturing the process data in the database it is there to crunch the numbers and analyse it
7572898 if i sent software to thousands of sites and it had a problem that would be intolerable we just cannot do that
7572899 for a company that strives to produce impeccable product it is difficult to live without such a tool
7572900 we already have certain components of process management in our own application so we need to do a bit of integration
7572901 we have a help desk system that tracks all the calls and ultimately we would like to get that integrated with what we do there because some of those calls would translate into software defects
7572902 we print more are less conscientious about doing so and spend more time and money on reprinting documents seemingly lost in the piles of printed pages in print rooms or stowed away somewhere out of sight
7572903 however competitive pressures and the ever increasing complexity of operations are driving the need to streamline information organisation encompassing a range of processes and workflows
7572904 actively managing office printing can reduce spending by 10 per cent to 30 per cent while reaping environmental benefits
7572905 although most enterprises now recognise the problem few have the necessary information leadership funding and strategy to fully succeed
7572906 we need to find ways to integrate with these types of applications both to bring information into them and get it out again when needed
7572907 it is a matter of working closely with companies to understand how they work and then matching devices to those requirements remembering that requirements can vary from department to department and office to office
7572908 in the same way that you dont need to be a telecoms engineer to make a phone call we want to make it that simple to put data into applications and get it out
7572909 we can make it a one step process by using the touchscreen on an mfp
7572910 there is always going to be room for the printed page but we need to look at the whole challenge of managing information
7572911 its a matter of working with customers to ensure we provide them with the equipment they require
7572912 all rfid hardware in the stores is identical to the hardware used for the rollout in germany
7572913 it was important to establish the project in line with epcglobal and dpwn group standards so that we can scale this type of solution for other retailers and other industries
7572914 we can build a different product with different features a different look and feel for different players
7572915 the product we supply to telstra doesnt have voice whereas the product we provide to another operator may have voice and fax features onboard
7572916 when youre working with creative people they tend not to focus on the technical side of things
7572917 when they come up with a requirement they dont ask how they can get that done they say they have a requirement and how quickly can it be done
7572918 our old system was basically ad hoc and every time you needed to provide a new solution be it more storage or an application server you had to do a lot of research and work out what was going to work together
7572919 you had to make sure the white box you were working with had the performance in the correct places for the application you were trying to deploy
7572920 netapp is customisable and scalable in the sense that if we need more storage we buy more disks for it
7572921 if we exceed the performance of the controllers we replace them
7572922 interest rate easing cycles in the past have generated an average return of 13 per cent six months after the commencement of an easing cycle
7572923 the australian equity market has overshot the domestic economic fundamentals
7572924 these gains can be lost just as quickly as they came with wall street so fragile
7572925 the us really is treading on thin ice at the moment
7572926 this is a very credible result despite the adversity in the market over the last 12 months
7572927 that we were able to generate a 21 per cent increase in normalised earnings before interest and tax in such conditions is a reflection of the strength of our diversified financial services business

7572930 it is the engine room for a banking business moving around data is what we do once weve got that baseline and understand whats driving that power usage we can start to talk about the best options
7572931 i can understand the early recommendation to try to force carbon costs down through the system from the front end loading up the fuel suppliers coal and oil suppliers and having that run through the system seems to make sense
7572932 at the same time if theres a compliance overhead that eats up those costs it sort of defeats the purpose we need to get the balance right were not a power company or anything like that our carbon emissions are a function of our usage so we have to be clever and it is one way we can do that
7572933 the question for me is how we get listed as an ethical stock that can be traded in an ethical fund
7572934 from leasing and power costs related to our shopfronts and head offices right through to processes we use for printing and recycling to really look at business processes as well as power components

7572976 from the markets perspective this is such a drawn out process i dont think they are focusing on these individual events just yet
7572977 i think they are still getting to grips with the spectre that the commodities boom could be over
7572978 ill be back in december they said that i might fight with quinton jackson but nothing has been signed yet they ufc called me ad offered a fight with him and i accepted but they didnt say anything else more
7572979 i will play soccer because it will make you happy to watch me play mommy
7572980 keep downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates
7572981 falco 3 by falco yes it includes that 8 minute version of
7572982 theres no doubt the sydney market has remained depressed for a while now and we probably dont see any real impetus for change in that forecast period
7572983 we are investing in additional capacity at a time of unprecedented global demand for alumina and aluminium
7572984 investing in high quality long life assets is increasingly important to meet the continued growth in demand from our customers and enhance our competitive position
7572985 the entitlement offer will also replace funds that would otherwise have been raised by underwriting the dividend reinvestment plan drp for the 2008 interim dividend
7572986 alumina does not intend to underwrite the drp for the 2008 final dividend importantly the structure of the entitlement offer means eligible shareholders have the opportunity to maintain an undiluted interest in alumina
7572987 i think the real benefit is that weve developed a cost culture in the organisation which will stand us in good stead
7572988 i come from the old school where what interests my boss fascinates me
7572989 whenever im on any facility whether its a stadium a cleaning site or laundry the first thing i do is a safety inspection looking for hazards thats how were going to get changed behaviour
7572990 when youve got 25 million savings in your pocket you can probably be a bit more forthcoming
7572991 it doesnt want to give too much away i guess at this point
7572992 take heed unto yourselves lest you forget the covenant of the lord your god which he made with you and make you a graven image or the likeness of any thing which the lord your god has forbidden you
7572993 the only way they could hear so many thousands of prayers and discern the heart attitudes of all of these people is if they were both omniscient and omnipresent in other words each saint would have to be god in order to accomplish this
7572994 there is no difficulty even if the saints cant hear our prayers god can and he would reveal them to the saints
7572995 as the church has received liberally from the lord so let it minister liberally and not ask to do anything through the invocation of angels or through enchantments and other perverse rarities but let prayers be addressed purely clearly and openly to the lord from whom are all things invoking the name of our lord jesus christ
7572996 it is the height of foolishness to pray as though to gods to those who are no gods at all for there is but one good god to him only do we and the angels pray
7572997 every image or statue should be called an idol for it is nothing but vile and profane material and for this reason and to remove idolatry by the roots god has forbidden the use of any image or likeness of anything in heaven or on earth and has also forbidden the making of such images and for this reason we christians have none of these material representations
7572998 the angels are greatly interested in your salvation they have been given as helpers to the son of god but all prayers to god whether they are supplications or thanksgiving should be raised to him through christ the high priest who is above all angels men do not know the angels so it is unreasonable to address prayers to them instead of to christ who is known of men and even were we to know the angels we should not be allowed to address our prayers to anyone except to god the lord of all creation who is sufficient for all and we come to him through our saviour the son of god
7572999 in the reproof of those who trust in the saints i would say cursed be the man who trusts in man jer 17 5 and it is better to trust in the lord than to put confidence in man ps 118 8 if it is necessary for us to have confidence in anyone let us leave all others and trust in the lord
7573000 why bow down before images lift up your eyes and heart to heaven that is the place where you should seek god
7573001 it is written god is my rock in him will i trust he is my shield and the horn of my salvation ii sam 22 3 and the lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed a refuge in times of trouble ps 9 9 and how many similar words do we find in the sacred scriptures should anyone reply that these are prophecies that apply to the son which may be true then let them admit that the saints do not venture to call any created being their help and refuge
7573002 the invocation of idols is a sin and anything that is sinful at the beginning can never be good later
7573003 let not our religion be the worship of the dead for if they lived a holy life it is
7573004 the only image of christ that we should make for ourselves is to keep before us his humility patience and kindness and endeavor to make our lives like his in all things those who go in search of jesus and the apostles in mural paintings far from conforming to scripture fall into error
7573005 in a part of the country that i visited i found a candle placed in the door of a church over which was painted an image of christ and another of a saint i was displeased that in this defiance of holy scripture the image of a man should be hung up in the church of christ and i cut the candle down advising the sacristan that it would be put to better use at the funeral of some poor person
7573006 such practices tend to lead to superstition as though there were more power in some than in others
7573007 no one who bows before an image or looks at it intentionally is free from some kind of superstition and not only so but if he only prays before an image
7573008 that youve gone to our lady of purity why i would never confide in her that would be the last thing i would do
7573009 well look i always confide in the mother of the god of sorrows she has been through great affliction and understands my troubles i wouldnt have the same confidence in our lady of purity she lacks experience
7573010 yes you are right seven months ago i promised the virgin of sorrows to take her a taper and have at last taken it but what a problem i had to pass in front of the virgin of the rosary and i was so afraid that she might notice that i was taking the taper to the other one i hid it under my apron as i passed by but even so i am afraid she may have seen it what a trial and we are too poor to afford one for each
7573011 you shall make you no idols nor graven image neither rear you up a standing image neither shall you set up any image of stone in your land to bow down unto it for i am the lord your god
7573012 and as peter was coming in cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshipped him but peter took him up saying stand up i myself also am a man
7573013 and i john saw these things and heard them and when
7573014 to all the saints in christ jesus which are at philippi
7573015 there shall not be found among you an enchanter one who uses incantations or a witch or a charmer or a consulter with familiar spirits or a wizard or a necromancer one who entreats the spirits of the dead for all who do these things are an abomination unto the lord
7573016 and when they shall say unto you seek unto them who have familiar spirits and unto wizards that peep and that mutter should not a people seek unto their god for the living to the dead if they speak not according to this word it is because there is no light in them
7573017 but what about the miracles that have been performed by the intercession of the saints
7573018 come unto me jesus himself not some angel or dead saint and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me not some angel or dead saint and you shall find rest unto your souls
7573019 in that day you shall ask me nothing verily verily i say unto you whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name he will give it you hitherto have you asked nothing in my name ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full for the father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that i came out from god
7573020 for generations people have lightened their environmental impact by multiplying their consumption less than their income
7573021 we have found encouraging evidence that this trend continues particularly in places like china and india
7573022 though positive evidence prevails our analysis reports troubling directions for brazil and especially indonesia
7573023 the limited success of existing therapy suggested to us that factors besides erbb2 or proteins that collude with erbb2 might nullify the effects of herceptin and lapatinib
7573024 our results might explain why the strategy of using erbb2 inhibitors alone to treat breast cancers has fallen short
7573025 these findings may also suggest a way to treat patients with advanced erbb2 positive tumors and those whove developed resistance to erbb2 inhibitors an idea that were eager to test
7573026 if erbb2 is the accelerator that makes the car move brk helps shift the gear to gain more speed
7573027 we might need to hit erbb2 expressing cancers with drugs against both erbb2 and brk
7573028 brk does not promote the proliferation of normal cells and its expression in normal tissues is restricted to non proliferating cells
7573029 produce fewer unwanted side effects than targeting other cancer promoting proteins
7573030 we also think that brk would be an ideal clinical marker than could be used to provide both a diagnosis and prognosis for breast cancer
7573031 when firefox users click on a web site that uses a self signed certificate they get a security error message that leaves many people bewildered

7573034 its very very very easy for someone to convince you to go through their computer
7573035 a lot of people wouldnt even know theyve been attacked
7573036 unable to verify the identity of xyz com as a trusted site
7573037 most users dont have a clue about what to do in those cases
7573038 a lot of them just shrug and go ahead with the connection potentially opening themselves up to attack
7573039 with perspectives even if a clients isp has fallen victim to the attack the client will be able to detect that the public key received from the fake site is inconsistent with the results returned from the notaries
7573040 in the end we can say its because of gt carnegie mellon researchers develop new software to detect viruses in cell phones and other embedded systems
7573041 increase of tobacco consumption and reduction of the physical activity practice level in spanish adolescents avena study
7573042 if there is a real commitment to protect all children then supporting families and children before they reach the point of being abused and neglected should be a priority
7573043 we already know many of the risk factors for child abuse and neglect and in many cases we could identify many children who are most vulnerable before theyre even born
7573044 the current approach does little to prevent abuse but focuses on intervening once much of the harm has already been done an approach that in my view is both unethical and inhumane
7573045 while urgent action is needed to protect children being abused and neglected we need to broaden adult focussed services such as alcohol and drug treatment mental health corrections homelessness family violence etc so that they can enhance the parenting of their clients
7573046 we also need to use health promotion campaigns with messages such as alcohol and children dont mix given that one in eight australian children now lives in a household with at least one adult who is regularly binge drinking
7573047 child abuse and neglect needs to be attacked in the same comprehensive way we have tackled other serious health issues such as smoking or coronary heart disease that is to identify the risk factors promote a range of interventions and change community attitudes
7573048 if we keep the current approach with its heavy emphasis on the crisis end of the scale then we will never see these rates reduce while we must look after the children who have been abused we must do much more to stop it happening to others
7573049 it was a beautiful model but there were parts of it that didnt add up and those parts directly conflicted with the model published in 2001
7573050 this suggests that the steric occlusion model best explains the available biochemical and structural evidence that has been published
7573051 any evidence positive or negative will help focus our attention toward this goal

7573055 i felt i deserved a chance to compete for the ufc championship on an even playing field and at a minimum if my opponent was caught cheating the loss should be taken off my record after my fight with sylvia my head just wasnt in the game anymore man i worked so damn hard to become a world champion and when my dream died i lost my will to continue fighting but after four long years in exile ive finally regained my passion and hunger i now realize that irrespective of ufc or what the record books say im still a champion at heart and being a champion isnt just about wearing a title but never surrendering to adversity im 100 healthy and 100 focused on reclaiming my lost legacy and nothin is gonna stand in my way this time im stronger wiser and fully dedicated to proving to the world that the real giant is back and the heavyweight division is about to be permanently reconfigured
7573056 right off the bat ivey is the first man ill face in my comeback and iveys been running his mouth for far too long about how im gonna wish i stayed retired well after were done fighting hell really wish i stayed retired got that ivey i cant tell you how good itll feel to bash that guy right in his damn face i want him now
7573057 me and tim have some unfinished business nothing against him personally hes a nice guy and all but he flat out cheated in our fight lets see how he does against me straight up with no pharmaceutical enhancements lets find out who the better man really is im ready whenever you are tim
7573058 for four straight years i went undefeated stopping every single opponent in the first round with just one exception and that exception was josh barnett we fought in the first ever super heavyweight bout in ufc history and i rocked him hard in round one i nearly put him away but he caught me in round two winning by tko due to strikes at 4 34 josh is a great fighter and id love to rumble with him one more time cause it sure would feel good to smash him around the cage again
7573059 i think kimbo is bad for mma period and im the right man to remove him from the sport for good next
7573060 brocks a big strong guy and hed face an interesting challenge for me hes got plenty of size and power and so do i he has a stellar amateur wrestling background and i was trained in college by the legendary dan gable it would be a great test for both of us
7573061 this would be an excellent matchup because of our styles i respect kongo and think hed be the ideal gateway fighter for me to break back into the top tier of the division
7573062 ive looked up to randy for many many years i met him for the first time when i was just a kid at a wrestling camp hes a real good guy and yknow because of our age difference and relationship fighting randy would be kind of like fighting my dad no offense randy but id love to do it
7573063 why do i want to fight fedor so badly because hes currently the best heavyweight in the world and if you dont want to face the best you have no business in mma personally i think this would be a helluva matchup the kind of fight that would have fans on their feet from beginning to end id have a ten inch height advantage over fedor and would fight him as the bigger man making him fight shorter than he actually is id utilize my reach making fedor come to me and when he comes in close id take him out
7573064 bring em all on look i didnt return to mma just to collect a few paychecks this is all about my legacy about finally establishing myself as the number one heavyweight on the planet when im at my best i know how good i am and the only one who can stop me is me ive watched all those other heavyweights and believe me i fear no one any time any place boys
7573065 maybe they can get helen mirren and christian bale on a float wearing their bikinis speedo now that i would definitely watch

7573077 you did not choose me but i chose you and appointed you that you would go and bear fruit and that your fruit would remain so that whatever you ask of the father in my name he may give it to you this i command you that you love one another if the world hates you you know that it has hated me before it has hated you

7573083 do not suppose that i have come to bring peace to the earth i did not come to bring peace but a sword for i have come to turn a man against his father a daughter against her mother a daughter in law against her motherinlaw a mans enemies will be the members of his own household anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and anyone who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me
7573084 i want you to do something that is very important princeton theological seminary is about to go down the tubes on scripture the presbyterian church is getting ready for a new confessional and they will use that confessional as a means of denying foundational truths of presbyterian theology
7573085 i want you to make a study of every major theological seminary in the united states i dont care what it costs and i want you to document for me what happened to them are they orthodox neo orthodox or liberal and then i want you to tell me how they got that way

7573094 tour features a video montage of john mccains image alongside pictures of hitler destruction global warming and robert mugabe
7573095 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7573096 submitted by cindyloo on august 25 2008 8 45am ok so what is the deal with the veins on her arms does she over work the muscles or what
7573097 i support obama 100 and will not be happy if mccain wins but this kind of display is ignorant tasteless and incredibly offensive especially to those families affected by the atrocities of the hitler and mugabe regimes it makes me sick to my stomach it also reeks of desperation and a 50 year old woman trying to do anything possible to stay relevant pathetic
7573098 hmm so john mccains responsible for global warming is he how about the pollution that old skank madonna is causing just being on tour

7573104 my friends we here at the straight talk express believe obama would be the perfect counterpunch to obamas pick of senator biden obama the rockstar picked someone to balance his ticket and id like to do the same thing
7573105 obama is young funny popular and has been against the iraq war from the beginning joe biden is none of those things its the perfect balance for him
7573106 hes young popular exciting black and not quickly morphing into a bush clone we feel a mccain obama ticket would really mobilize independent moderates against obama in the general election

7573109 its about continually looking at your work force and looking at your economic projections and trying to bring those in line
7573110 we thought that we had that two months ago but with the worsening economy we just need to do more
7573111 obviously you can do more if you have more people

7573131 27 of hillary supporters will be voting for john mccain
7573132 biden allies note that despite his long service in washington he is at his core an outsider inside the beltway while that may well be true the optics for obama arent great he cant change the fact that in picking biden he would be going with someone who has spent nearly his entire adult life not only in politics but as a member of the worlds greatest deliberative body
7573133 the democrats in charge of this congress have been heavy on fluff and light on substance

7573137 being a scot has made all the difference in my life
7573138 but as we were preparing the script we realised that it would be unworkable so we decided to make a book instead

7573144 the story of barack obama is firmly rooted in the american tradition
7573145 we understand that some in the news media are more interested in reporting the rumour of controversy than the fact of unity
7573146 senator and president clinton fully support the obama biden ticket and look forward to addressing the convention and the nation on the urgency of victory this fall
7573147 anyone saying anything else doesnt know what theyre talking about period

7573152 how dangerous such so called frozen conflicts can be given that the georgian leadership as they say went crazy
7573153 that decision is not going to help things it only adds to the tension in the region
7573154 we will take any decision including up to a complete break in relations
7573155 there has been a dramatic worsening of our relations but we are not to blame
7573156 your strings should be somewhere around a centimeter above the fretboard
7573157 these discussions continue as we have not yet finalised an agreement
7573158 there is an agreement between the two sides that there will be no foreign soldiers in iraq after 2011
7573159 what i understand is that the iraqi parliament will not pass this agreement
7573160 at this moment the iraqi government and parliament are not ready for such a deal which will face a lot of hurdles
7573161 we cannot sign an agreement unless it will preserve the sovereignty and national interests of iraq
7573162 any foreign soldiers on iraqi soil must have a specific time frame and not be open ended and iraqi blood must be protected and cannot grant full immunity
7573163 we assure you that nothing will be concealed and that we are at the beginning of the restoration of our full rights and sovereignty and the aspirations of the agreement and security arrangement will be presented to the parliament
7573164 we are now giving you this information for the reason that there are rumors on the street there are indiciations people may be speculating on who did this and trying to focus their attentions on people that may have had nothing to do with this case whatsoever

7573249 the large increases in biofuels production in the u s and eu were supported by subsidies mandates and tariffs on imports
7573250 without these policies biofuels production would have been lower and food commodity price increases would have been smaller

7573253 but it still provides surface cover and will eventually become organic matter this residue layer is especially important if you rotate with low residue crops legumes and canola
7573254 we need to constantly replenish organic matter so removing valuable residue especially in areas with low rainfall may not be the best practice
7573255 with cultivation organic matter tends to decline in most places around the world
7573256 in the more than 100 years that we have been cultivating soils in the palouse
7573257 a lot of people think residue is part of organic matter
7573258 but that is not correct organic matter is well decomposed plant material and microbes it is black and rich and gives soil its dark color
7573259 it is like going to an all you can eat restaurant every day and eating too much
7573260 you cannot adequately metabolize all the food you ate cultivated soil is like a pig out for microbes
7573261 it will tend to stay around longer and the microbes will slowly invade it and convert it into organic matter with less lost as carbon dioxide
7573262 but it still provides surface cover and will eventually become organic matter this residue layer is especially important if you rotate with low residue crops legumes and canola
7573263 we need to constantly replenish organic matter so removing valuable residue especially in areas with low rainfall may not be the best practice
7573264 some of the most commonly recommended species for biofuels production are also major invasive alien species
7573265 plantations are started by investors often from the u s or europe so they are eager to generate biofuels within a couple of years and also as you might guess they dont want a negative assessment
7573266 there are very few plants that are weeds full stop
7573267 you have to look at the biology of the plant and the environment where youre introducing it and ask are there worry points here
7573268 giant reed a high yielding non food plant into europe union agriculture
7573269 these are tough survivors which means theyre good producers for biofuel because they grow well on marginal land that you wouldnt use for food
7573270 but weve had 100 years of experience with introductions of these crops that turned out to be disastrous for environment people health
7573271 with biofuels we need to do proper assessments and take appropriate measures so they dont get out of the gate so to speak
7573272 just because a species has caused a problem in one place doesnt make it a weed everywhere

7573285 whats important for us is to continue to reduce our own environmental footprint at roanoke cement as well as to assist in building a greener community cement is the glue that binds concrete and concrete products and concrete is a green building product in its own right this is highlighted in cutting edge uses like pervious concrete paving and thermal mass construction
7573286 if we isolated but a single reason for winning the energy star award it is our investment in the preheater tower

7573289 a tour like this allows our members to be exposed to and educated about how plants can modernize and become more green we serve many industries like engineering architecture and contracting that are true staples of our economy and they are adaptable we are here to learn how and then teach them the green way

7573297 an expectation by financial market participants that financial crises will never occur would create its own form of moral hazard
7573298 and encourage behavior that would make financial crises more rather than less likely
7573299 no other industrial country has the central bank also doing prudential supervision
7573300 this experience has led me to believe that one of the best ways to protect the financial system against future shocks including the possible failure of a major counterparty is by strengthening the financial infrastructure
7573301 these discussions continue as we have not yet finalised an agreement

7573326 corn based ethanol is not perfect but its been blamed for practically every problem under the sun
7573327 blaming biofuels for high food prices is a great trick for these large food corporations they get to raise their prices increase their profits and not worry about how it affects american families struggling to make ends meet

7573341 he talked to us about heart that meant so much having him come in and talk to us he came from a championship team a championship era here it was a treat to listen to him
7573342 he told us how he came into a scrimmage one time and on the first six plays he had six sacks and got kicked out of practice he talked to us about that determination

7573367 that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet
7573368 as this is the first game of the season we held a number of trials and camps over the summer so it was quite difficult to pick just 18 players for this squad
7573369 the 18 players involved will all play a substantial part in this game as it as i think that the performances for all of these players will be far more important than the result
7573370 we have been watching ellis for some time now and i was very impressed with his performances at the umbro cup in galway the midfielder has developed his over all game over the past couple of months and he has grown bigger and stronger and he is more than deserving of his place in the squad
7573371 its now up to these 18 players to justify their selection because there are plenty of quality players ready to come in for the next fixture which is a double header away to turkey on september 16 and 18

7573416 the fact that cashs work has been vilified and re evaluated over many years even by the reviews here is an indication that the concepts and issues he described more than sixty years ago are still debated today a true picture of the mind of the south in the 21st century
7573417 i can feel cash in my very bones a dose of tom watson populism a dose of menckens cynicism and a whole bunch of the self loathing that a defeated and impoverished people wore like tattered old clothes every day some neo south erners call cash a south hater but they miss the point cash wanted desperately to love the south but could find little to love except myth

7573723 effectively these are yesterdays migrants as well as todays migrants contributing to this high level of population growth
7573724 one is an increase in the fertility rates for both uk and non uk born mums but also its because recent migrants have changed the number of people in that age band child bearing age
7573725 with births to foreign mothers becoming such a large driver of population growth it is vital that immigration levels are set taking into account the ability of our schools hospitals and other local services to cope
7573726 with the number of migrants arriving from the new eu countries now approaching one million the governments estimate that a maximum of just 13 000 migrants a year would arrive from these countries is woeful
7573727 labour must realise that immigration can benefit the country but only if it is properly controlled
7573728 carrying out the biggest shake up to the immigration system for a generation
7573729 centre stage is our new australian style points based system which means only those we need can come here to work or study
7573730 migrants contribute to the economy putting more into the exchequer purse than they take out
7573731 so it is vital we take the social impact of migration into account when we make migration decisions
7573732 thats why we set up the migration impacts forum mif to provide independent advice to the government on how migration affects public services and local communities
7573733 we will also ask migrants to pay a little extra towards a fund of tens of millions of pounds to help services deal with the short term pressures of migration
7573734 if the low numbers of asylum seekers to the uk were the result of the world becoming a safer more peaceful place then we would have something to celebrate

7573738 we selected the jbl cabinets based on their excellent audio performance and their acceptance by the tour sound community
7573739 at the rialto we want to provide an extremely high quality experience for our audience and we feel this system will help us meet that goal
7573740 the rialto presents a wide range of musical and spoken work productions so we selected a sound system capable of serving these varied types providing both improved intelligibility and musical impact
7573741 the system will provide both clear intelligible speech to every seat while still being able to provide tonally balanced and high impact i e rockin music
7573742 acoustically we worked on improving the tonal balance of the space
7573743 if more states would publish breach notification lists there would be more information to study and to help us understand this growing concern
7573744 at this time only three states publish such information additionally more companies are starting to audit their security and network systems and use readily available security measures this pro active approach means that breaches are being identified that might otherwise have gone undetected
7573745 the number of attacks in addition to publicly disclosed breaches continues to escalate as criminal networks mushroom around the world while economies weaken
7573746 a more concerted effort is required among companies to secure and protect customer data regardless of regulatory oversight
7573747 these two cases highlight our increasing vulnerability to the theft of personal information unsecured networks are a friendly target for such groups additionally insider theft data on the move and inadvertent posting of personal information to web sites add to the problem breaches are not simply the result of malicious attacks but also of human error and poor information handling procedures
7573748 it is critical that law enforcement governmental agencies businesses consumers and legislators understand the causes of breaches with this in mind the itrc has continued to create new database tools to better analyze breach information when we understand how data is exposed or stolen we can avert many breaches because of improved security procedures and safer information handling

7573774 we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and its unfortunate that warner has chosen to file a case so close to our films release in my opinion i dont think our title has any similarity or links with harry potter

7573784 the young man had spent about five weeks in hastings and was due to return home next weekend his death is incredibly sad

7573848 darwin used his themes to work through many points that led to his theory of evolution by helping him to comprehend what is known and to guide in the search for what is not yet known he used them as a way of classifying the relation of different species to each other as a way to represent the accident of life the irregularity of nature the explosiveness of growth and of the necessity to keep the number of species constant by adjusting and altering the number of themes and connections darwin was able to keep his thought fluid and to bring about adaptive shifts in his thinking he played the critic surveying his own positions the inventor devising new solutions and ideas and the learner accumulating new facts not prominent before
7573849 hello matthew there will be no blogging today work has piled up so in your absence there are far too many items that need to be edited

7573855 this is something i have been advocating for a long time particularly during my time as lord mayor something that we need to remember is that soldiers from across the community are fighting in iraq and afghanistan risking life and limb and it is very important that we show our support and respect for them
7573856 we must also consider that it must be a difficult time for them as they are working tirelessly on a daily basis protecting the public their comrades and themselves
7573857 i think it is truly a shame that other political parties have not supported this parade in belfast it is something we should be proud to host however i have no doubt that when this important event takes place people from all sections of the community will attend to show their support for the men and women who risk their lives for our country on a daily basis

7573861 i am disappointed by some of the comments criticizing the psnis use of taser during the weekend past
7573862 some months ago i availed of the opportunity to see how police officers were trained in the deployment and use of taser

7573866 the fact that such harsh hollow opposition has been provided in the unionist community by the dup for so long and then doing the opposite i have to say is a real cause of division and hurt

7573938 considering the very difficult environment in the home furnishings industry this is a remarkable uptick
7573939 we set out to create excitement and provide an environment of optimism and we were successful by every measure
7573940 we actually had more customers carrying more products than in the comparable 2007 period
7573941 but with the current economic situation these increases were not sufficient to offset the decrease in sales we experienced with many of our customers
7573942 the increased strength of the canadian dollar also had a negative impact of more than c 400 000 on our u s sales compared to last year
7573943 the installation of recently purchased new equipment will be finalized around the end of september this will enable us to respond more efficiently to the industrys demands thus allowing us to seize new opportunities that will help increase our sales whether with new products or new clients

7573964 nosotros creemos que esta semana van a firmar varios legisladores el proyecto y se va a lograr el dictamen
7573965 todav a no conozco el material pero lo que s b sicamente estar a bueno comentar que nosotros estamos trabajando como hormiguitas desde el 2 004 con todas las escuelas y maestros en realidad se han instalado bibliotecas en todas las escuelas y lo importante es volver a construir el h bito de la lectura que no se hace por obligaci n ni por decreto sino con el d a a d a y creo que de a poco nuestras maestras lo est n haciendo
7573966 en realidad nosotros pensamos que la lectura en voz alta parte siempre de la maestra o de un adulto poniendo la voz a circular y comparti ndola con los mismos chicos que se tienen que animar a perder la verg enza la timidez y eso va mas all de quince minutos como plantea el programa esta lectura tiene que ver con todas las disciplinas leer literatura es lo que mas adormecido esta creo que hay que armar escenas y espacios de lectura que es lo que est n haciendo los docentes y ellos est n recuperando ese h bito gracias a las buenas bibliotecas
7573967 los pap s a veces tenemos poco tiempo pero podr amos hacer un esfuerzo para leer un fragmento o un texto en voz alta escucharnos leer tambi n posibilita un ejercicio que hemos olvidado
7573968 para eso leemos todos el adulto es el mediador principal no los podemos dejar solos a los chicos retomar la palabra siempre viene de uno que sabe m s y ese lector adulto es el que posibilita que el otro tenga ganas de leer y podemos jugar con la lectura por ejemplo decirles lee vos mientras tiendo la cama y despu s yo retomo no hay que depositar la confianza en el otro para que no se sienta evaluado porque es ah donde volvemos a contracturarnos y tenemos miedo de volver a leer en voz alta

7573977 we will probably hit 11 gigatonnes of carbon emissions per year by 2020

7573986 wanneer we ons echter baseren op de ondertekende compromissen op dit ogenblik stellen we vast dat de marktprijzen eerder stagneren
7573987 de stijging spreekt zeker de mening van vastgoedanalisten tegen die het eerder hebben over een daling van de vastgoedprijzen hun conclusie wordt bevestigd wanneer we de cijfers van het 1ste semester van 2008 vergelijken met de gegevens van het 2de semester van 2007 hieruit blijkt dat de vastgoedprijzen op dit ogenblik minder snel stijgen dan de inflatie geschat op 4 8 pct tot 5 pct voor 2008 hetgeen dus zelfs neerkomt op een lichte daling van de vastgoedprijzen in re le termen
7573988 beide partijen zijn overeengekomen dat er zich na 2011 geen enkele buitenlandse soldaat meer in irak zal bevinden
7573989 wij geen akkoord kunnen aanvaarden dat de soevereiniteit van irak niet behoudt de nationale belangen van irak dwingen ons een duidelijke kalender voor het einde van de militaire aanwezigheid op te stellen we tekenen geen akkoord zonder zon kalender
7573990 voor de militaire operaties voortaan het akkoord van de regering nodig is
7573991 de voorwaarden van het akkoord zullen aan iedereen bekendgemaakt worden en de tekst zal voor het parlement gebracht worden

7573996 this is a great joy for our mothers and our people but it remains a small step because we left behind thousands of prisoners we cannot rest until they too are freed
7573997 of course i am very glad that he is coming home and i now want him to get a job get married and settle down but the israelis were in ramallah again last night they broke down doors and took away some people so even when people are coming out of jails others are taking their place
7573998 of course i grieve as father to lose such a son it would be more bearable if there was some chance of peace but i do not think that is going to happen
7573999 when mohammed was arrested i was 22 years old my children were babies today i feel i am reborn our familys life is just beginning
7574000 he has been there now for three years and i have only been allowed to see him twice
7574001 men he shares the cell with are being let out but not him i am sad but we are used out men being taken away my husband was imprisoned three times under administrative orders six months each time
7574002 i blame the arabs for what is happening they should either make peace with israel under just terms or fight them they are too disunited to do either
7574003 there is no doubt that we seek peace and we are trying to seek our goals and there wont be peace without the release of all prisoners
7574004 we believe this action can support the negotiation process and create goodwill
7574005 we uncovered 37 bunkers we found their sleeping bags it was first world war trench warfare around here
7574006 i had a problem before because the front line was just there but things are much better
7574007 the cia already conducts operations in partnership with the pakistanis
7574008 nato would like to have the same relationship with pakistan
7574009 they are the first thing we ask for when we plan an operation
7574010 the big thing is that they help us at the lowest tactical level they find information that which allows us to make decisions
7574011 the world is losing the war i think at the moment the taliban definitely has the upper hand
7574012 this organisation is a terrorist organisation and has created mayhem against public life
7574013 the facts are pretty plain the deals across the border have led to a significant rise in insurgent activities here in afghanistan we know where these guys are being trained and armed to be sent to afghanistan to kill civilians and afghan and coalition troops this is obviously a political hot potato but we would be failing in our duty if we did not seek to counter this
7574014 i can only echo what president bush told the visiting pakistanis the other day that in effect information we share with them seems to end up with the bad guys
7574015 the us is now losing the war against the taliban pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has made it a major threat to us strategic interests
7574016 its easy to see that as disrespect and some hillary loyalists are going to resent it
7574017 but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7574018 its not the sort of decision that can be taken in a hurry
7574019 but we can probably expect some kind of statement over the next few days
7574020 its not the sort of decision that can be taken in a hurry

7574022 the cia already conducts operations in partnership with the pakistanis
7574023 nato would like to have the same relationship with pakistan
7574024 they are the first thing we ask for when we plan an operation
7574025 the big thing is that they help us at the lowest tactical level they find information that which allows us to make decisions
7574026 i promise we wont rest until we bring about the release of all the prisoners

7574031 holding the olympics was good in terms of china taking a more democratic path we believe this is an irreversible path
7574032 while the reformist open door policy is said to be making progress in china it is not always leaping forward
7574033 realise how normal or abnormal what they are doing is from an international point of view
7574034 after two days of negative publicity over its extra judicial detention of ten tibet supporters the chinese government is seeking to suppress a story that would have cast a shadow over the closing ceremony of these olympic games
7574035 our pass protection was not very good we missed probably at least four blitzes guys bounced off guys and came free or we just got beat i was very discouraged it just kind of reminded me of who we are
7574036 unfortunately i think that i saw what i already knew
7574037 you get some injuries like this and now depth matters if you dont have it you better go find it
7574038 the dumbest team in america in terms of playing the game
7574039 can you believe this bag of elbows i have to work with
7574040 my friends we live in the greatest nation in the history of the world i hope youll join with me as we try to change it
7574041 very few people look the part and are it too
7574042 the true soldier fights not because he hates what is in front of him but
7574043 my friends we live in the greatest nation in the history of the world i hope youll join with me as we try to change it
7574044 the true soldier fights not because he hates what is in front of him but
7574045 we are really blessed the worst thing can be a blessing by bringing the family closer together
7574046 the true soldier fights not because he hates what is in front of him but
7574047 my friends we live in the greatest nation in the history of the world i hope youll join with me as we try to change it
7574048 this decision is not already made because i want to play if i listened to what i was hearing the decision would be made
7574049 this is not a decision on whether or not to get surgery
7574050 whenever he runs and cuts and plants hes going to have trouble hell figure this out pretty quick
7574051 im just trying to get an opinion on what i need to do how bad the injury is and if i can do anything to play
7574052 im going to do the best i can to get back on the field and get ready for carolina the opener on sept 7 the thing is knowing whether to do it or not
7574053 we would expect him to be there unless he decides with all his medical opinions he wont be there
7574054 with the injury i have nobody would prefer that somebody really play
7574055 but right now i can play its a high risk i could injure it further but its hard i want to be on the field
7574056 im not interested in partisanship that serves no other purpose than to gain a temporary advantage over our opponents this mindless paralyzing rancor must come to an end we belong to different parties not different countries
7574057 obama was fluent cool and cerebral the qualities that made adlai stevenson interesting but did not make him president
7574058 obamas cool cerebral style may be just what we need
7574059 i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7574060 we understand that some in the news media are more interested in reporting the rumor of controversy than the fact of unity
7574061 the fact is that our teams are working closely to ensure a successful convention and will continue to do so senator and president clinton fully support the obama biden ticket and look forward to addressing the convention and the nation on the urgency of victory this fall anyone saying anything else doesnt know what theyre talking about period
7574062 have been wonderful partners in working on the convention with us and we worked closely with them
7574063 hes got the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that may come up more importantly i think he can help shape a long term strategy to make america more secure
7574064 when i initially got the news that biden was the vp choice i had mixed emotions
7574065 i was a little discouraged to hear that clinton had been overlooked
7574066 this convention i hope will bring out hillary and appreciate her for all of the work shes done especially for putting health care at the forefront
7574067 im going to vote for hillary clinton on the floor as provided by barack obamas agreement with senator clinton and then im going to support the democratic ticket with enthusiasm
7574068 we conducted a democratic process the person with the most delegates at the end of the day is the winner and i hope people will recognize that
7574069 when we are talking about a president of the united states we are not talking about the fate of one individual but the fate of a nation and of generations yet unborn
7574070 this is no time to get squeamish or politically correct when talking about whoever is to carry the load of the free world on his shoulders in the white house
7574071 well mrs jones we are going to have to send a technician out there to check and see if the movies are in the inventory that can take a few days but we will contact you as soon as we check

7574073 curators for future volumes will include amy poehler david byrne author jonathan lethem artist marcel dzama
7574074 im shocked by the video when i look at amy i think for christs sake just get a grip of yourself
7574075 as the police know amy is a drug addict and she has now been caught twice on film taking illegal drugs they should arrest her and put her behind bars
7574076 rehab clinics are a waste of money unless you want them to work
7574077 amy doesnt want to give up drugs so shes got to learn the hard way in prison
7574078 police have to act she is making a mockery of the law it has got to stop
7574079 the price amy has got to pay is losing her freedom

7574092 all opinions expressed here are solely my own and not necessarily reflective of the views of the party its leadership its general membership my eda or my local conservative candidate
7574093 we did a lot of positive things a lot of things i really liked
7574094 we just beat ourselves we get ourselves into a rut and we cant get out
7574095 in the first match i dont know if we were focused on what we needed to get done im not sure we were ready for the season to begin
7574096 im not sure what the problem was but we just didnt bring our game we werent ready
7574097 i reminded them why we are here and what we needed to do
7574098 i reminded them that we had a job to get done and we needed to stay focused on what those jobs are
7574099 mistakes happen i dont expect them not to happen so if they happen we have to let them go and do what we are able to do
7574100 our goal today was to come together as a team
7574101 thats the first thing we have to get done and i think that in the second match we were able to do that now were ready to move on and start doing more
7574102 i think we are going to learn from this definitely i heard a lot of them talking after the game and reminding each other they have to let things go weve got to build from this
7574103 tyler gregg is a senior and my no 1 runner jordan vance was a soccer player last year after that my next five kids are young so were looking for great things to happen as the season progresses and hope that nobody gets hurt
7574104 but compared to other races that i have run i felt decent normally toward the end i feel really awful
7574105 it was a 5 08 the next two were about 5 30 it was a rough race because it was everybodys first and we are getting used to running 5ks again after running track all season long
7574106 it would be nice if there was a little less gravel
7574107 overall it was better than my last race in new albany where i was dying with the heat that back straightaway in the shade was just great
7574108 we know how to handle ourselves out there but it is a pretty fast pace out there
7574109 there were open areas that the sun beat down on you a lot
7574110 it just seemed a lot longer than it was the heat made us sluggish the end was a nice turn around because you knew where you where you were going
7574111 it felt like a pretty fast pace but i was not tired until after the second mile
7574112 as long as youve got the people around you that keep running then you are going to keep running i didnt think about a pr i just kept going
7574113 on the girls side the middle of the pack really picked it up
7574114 were a young team and we are consistantly getting better every race on the boys side davis thompson shows great leadership
7574115 it was a lot faster than i wanted it to be
7574116 it started out way too fast it was an easy course and i just ran my race
7574117 wonderful adventure of dreaming about the new school to the reality of it
7574118 an outstanding job within the budget and completed construction mostly on time
7574119 excellent examples of a successful local community and state partnership for the good of our young people
7574120 they are bright and airy we have 21st century technology in all the rooms and it is no longer flooding in the gym we have a gym that is a gym and a cafeteria that is a cafeteria our science rooms were designed for science and the reading rooms designed for reading this is for our kids the future of utica and the future of north fork schools
7574121 were very pleased just because we have so much inexperience out there
7574122 that they needed that confidence booster it was huge for us
7574123 i thought we passed the ball really well on serve reception today
7574124 that was a real strength for us i thought we on offense we missed more of our spikes than wed like to but its early in the season youre going to
7574125 our philosophy is if youve got somebody whos hitting well use them and jackie was on today so we tried to go heavy with her
7574126 camaranne when she was in the front row was on as well so we tried to get it to her
7574127 we need to talk a lot more out on the floor
7574128 and have a little more confidence i think once we get that well be a tough team to beat
7574129 in heat like this it is very hard for anyone to play soccer
7574130 i am really impressed with the girls today the girls i have give 100 percent and played through the heat
7574131 we just practiced some breakaways the other day and it paid off michelle dobson put the ball out there really nice and aubrey came through i dont think i have ever seen her that happy
7574132 without emily mcbride in goal the game would have been gone in the first 10 minutes
7574133 she kept us in it they had some very nice shots on the goals they scored there was nothing emily could do even ones that i thought she could not do anything about she still found a way to stop them
7574134 i am very proud of the way we played after the first 15 minutes of the game
7574135 i dont know why we cant seem to play from the first whistle i cant figure that out today we battled back and didnt quit they stayed in there and kept fighting i told the girls that lancaster plays in the same heat just keep pushing the ball dont give up and dont get frustrated
7574136 penn state hershey medical center ranked among the top 100 hospitals
7574137 a lot of people hear about a broader agenda and they think oh evangelicals are giving up on believing that life begins at conception
7574138 theyre not giving up on that at all not at all
7574139 i saw somewhere that it will be a catastrophically cold winter this year
7574140 we are extremely pleased with the results were received from parallels business automation and anticipate further benefits as we continue to grow our business
7574141 parallels business automation has brought many practical capabilities to our billing infrastructure and is helping us maximize our revenue
7574142 switching our billing system to parallels business automation was an invaluable business decision
7574143 important resources are better utilized and revenue generating programs have become more effective
7574144 parallels business automation enables customers to concentrate on generating revenue and providing new services versus the less efficient in house systems that waste resources
7574145 by leveraging parallels business automation and the parallels open platform we believe our customers can gain competitive advantage with a solution that addresses their business needs now and into the future
7574146 why hundreds of service providers have switched from in house billing systems to parallels business automation
7574147 you are not qualified as a petty officer third class
7574148 it is disappointing that the court did not understand the states claim
7574149 we will closely study the decision and deal with it appropriately
7574150 look what you made me do i voted republican because you couldnt get down off your high horse
7574151 i was going to vote for obama but now after picking biden for the ticket im going for mccain just to keep that guy biden out of there
7574152 the tunnels which are in surprisingly good condition were part of speers grand plans what we now call germania
7574153 we have seen lots of people taking their dogs for a walk since the establishment of the designated area and we have been inundated by phone calls from happy pet owners thanking and congratulating us for this initiative
7574154 it is not a problem because there is plenty of space it will be moved a couple of hundred meters yards further down
7574155 wow look at what happened to the trader trash and office whores

7574157 these are people who are going to get their legs amputated
7574158 i do think cells coming out of menstrual blood are highly regenerative
7574159 i worry that there is a segment of the population that might be harder to reach average citizens who will say come on
7574160 said mr harrison 59 a sociologist at howard university and a consultant for the joint center for political and economic studies here
7574161 historic as this moment is it does not signify a major victory in the ongoing daily battle
7574162 biden is very well aware that his sons deployment to iraq is going to be a big part of what we do in october its part of our narrative and

7574167 i saw somewhere that it will be a catastrophically cold winter this year
7574168 participation in these programs publicly demonstrates conagra foods commitment to taking climate change seriously and doing our part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
7574169 our energy conservation efforts are part of our corporate citizenship responsibilities and critical to our success as a business
7574170 i remember having a conversation with a friend several years ago about how when a tv show starts losing its ratings they will almost always bring in a celebrity to try and revive it
7574171 i think someone at microsoft marketing must be from the tv industry
7574172 somehow i doubt that was the kind of comparison microsoft was hoping to make
7574173 what could be more appropriate than using professional comedians as vista pitchmen
7574174 i wish theyd use judy tenuta now that would be ads that bite
7574175 and they blew it and then they blew the second impression too
7574176 i cant imagine what they think seinfeld can do to help my customers wont go near vista at this point and i doubt anything other than a new os release would fix that
7574177 if thats what they are planning it will backfire big time i can see random insults moving things from the average person hating vista to the average person hating microsoft no one likes being told theyre an idiot
7574178 the perfect spokesman for windows built on technology developed before the internet well known but not very relevant and even though you really cant avoid windows nobody is fanatical about it
7574179 that really has a synergy with seinfeld you can turn on any broadcast channel in any city in america and be sure theyre playing episodes of seinfeld but nobody is actually a regular viewer of those episodes
7574180 as much as seinfeld was great during its heyday watching it today very clearly dates it and exposes that its not as timeless as theyd like you to believe
7574181 i fear that by drawing on this star of the 90s microsoft may be showing its longing to return to a time when buying a computer meant buying windows
7574182 short of every linux distro calling home which i hope will never happen there may never be a way to know how many linux users there are
7574183 perhaps the downloads of some cross platform application would give a rough idea but that application would have to be something that a linux user a mac user and a windows user would want equally if anyone has a better idea i would love to hear it
7574184 although its difficult to tell how many people are using linux microsoft must have a very good idea of how many people are not using vista
7574185 its a bit though not entirely like trying to calculate the market value of food from a home kitchen compared to that of restaurant meals
7574186 measurement of prices paid is not the only difficult task
7574187 you also have to consider the cost of sampling dont like ubuntu try fedora quickly and free opportunity costs for the software itself a low price now even for what is perceived as lower quality goods in some contexts means money available for other things and freedom to experiment and recombine perhaps windows makes sense for some people in a given organization but the data entry might taste just as good if done on linux based thin terminals
7574188 makes less sense as a concept when the market is as fluid as the free software world
7574189 machines dual boot are repurposed are used as vm hosts or serve apps to dozens of other machines which may or may not be running the same os in the first place and not just for free software sure you can count certificate or license sales for various versions of windows but does anyone even pretend that represents the total number of windows installs
7574190 the best metric to measure the success or failure of an open source project is the number of users moved enough to contribute their vision to the project which enables more people to benefit
7574191 that number not the number of users will measure how much momentum any push for change will get
7574192 it has occurred to me that flash on linux is the one major entry barrier controlling acceptance of linux as a viable desktop operating system
7574193 no matter how stably smoothly efficiently and correctly linux runs on a machine the public will continue to view it as second rate if flash keeps crashing i really do have to suspect adobes motivation for keeping flash on linux in such a deplorable state
7574194 once everybody is using it they dont put any effort into making it work better thats not to say that open source software is always better but at least with open source the more popular your software is the more effort is being put into improving it
7574195 it crashes a lot on windows and linux its annoying on windows and linux the only question i have is why do people still care about flash
7574196 silverlights only chance for survival is adobe screwing flash up and boy do they seem to be going out of their way to do that
7574197 the eu should help forge a positive peace from a war which threatens the foundations of the european security order and should actively engage with its eastern neighbourhood to resolve frozen conflicts and avert new crisis
7574198 u ere sch nheit ist ein geschenk gottes und wir d rfen sie nicht verstecken
7574199 weve clearly heard from the community and they would like a larger presence as in a larger hospital so were excited about that
7574200 i think that what has happened is that starting in the fall of last year the u s trade and current accounts were diminishing rapidly it led to a tightening of global liquidity and foreign official dollar reserves were not growing at the same pace as before
7574201 whenever liquidity tightens it leads to poor markets but is very dollar supportive weak demand in the u s lower imports and the demand for oil also declining led to a tightening of global liquidity
7574202 my view is that after four years of under performance the u s dollar would now outperform for three to six months i still maintain that
7574203 i think the dollar can continue to rally somewhat to 1 47 against the euro
7574204 in nominal terms we had a bear market in commodities from1980 until 1999 or 2001
7574205 depending on the commodity we are seven years into a bull market for commodities
7574206 michelle has asked me to clean up because when she first met me i had one suit michelle always finds this funny because i basically buy five of the same suit and then i patch them up and wear them repeatedly i have four pairs of shoes recently ive taken to getting a haircut more frequently than i used to because my mother in law makes fun of me

7574211 i applaud the choice of senator joe biden as the next vice president of the united states his long experience in public service will wonderfully complement senator obamas strengths as a leader
7574212 through the years senator biden has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7574213 theres just too much uncertainty out there creating all this volatility and whats adding to the volatility is were entering this holiday period the swings are exaggerated by the light volumes
7574214 you really need to see a resolution to those three issues or at least some type of clear picture to those issues
7574215 allo ma belle juste un petit rappel de ne pas oublier de transf rer les que tu me dois
7574216 im hoping they will give the money back to the other people as well
7574217 wed also like the debt collectors whove been sending out letters to the people who didnt pay to back off
7574218 its something ive wanted to do since i was intermediate age
7574219 i dont know what sparked it but as i grew the idea was more appealing
7574220 i was lucky enough to be brought up in a good positive maori community
7574221 i made my push to join the police and within a few months i was ready to join the college
7574222 a lot of the time i was going out to incidents and encountering maori in negative situations i wondered how i could help to change that
7574223 i was lucky enough to have things passed down to me
7574224 through that network i was able to extend my personal relationships with maori
7574225 i liaise with the maori community and the police and build strong relationships between them i try and establish a sense of trust between them
7574226 i dont promise to save the world but i do give my full dedication to making sure what i do in this job makes a difference
7574227 there are two different styles but the world taekwondo federation style the olympic style is what were about
7574228 not being a big sport in this country just having three competitors there is big let alone getting a win
7574229 robin was only half a point a way from getting through against the favourite
7574230 new zealands previous performances have been very poor but now thats done thats been put to bed
7574231 in the oceania region new zealand taekwondo is on par with australia who get a lot more funding
7574232 from our point of view to go from nothing to something is great were grateful
7574233 robins performance should now raise public awareness and the overall profile of the sport in general
7574234 whats more shes only 19 shes got plenty more olympic games left in her yet
7574235 nothing you do for children is ever wasted they seem not to notice us hovering averting our eyes and they seldom offer thanks but what we do for them is never wasted
7574236 o que acontecer com os 22 jovens inscritos que deixar o de receber o benef cio do agente jovem voltar o para as ruas e ficar o vulner veis com tempo ocioso

7574239 in many ways it didnt matter what the future held as long as there was a future to look into
7574240 even at 12 years old listening to it i could hear don mclean talking about his own disappointments
7574241 i loved being able to see that i mean don mclean jim croce and paul simon all of them are incredible storytellers i wanted to tell stories
7574242 my own people black people theyve become accustomed to this hip hop sound
7574243 if it doesnt have a driving beat i dont know if theyll hear it right away i think i have to go to a different crowd first
7574244 its very different from jamie foxx and jennifer lopez if i had to compare i believe this is a music critics album
7574245 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life
7574246 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7574247 god works slowly according to our individual needs better than anyone he knows that doing it all at once would reduce us to shivering panic
7574248 our dreams and they are made out of real things like a shoebox of photographs with sepia toned loving
7574249 even if you dont like wilco i know you can keep time like a beast
7574250 kick ed the shit out of blazing hot festivals that charge you six dollars for a test tube of water in the middle of the desert
7574251 this festival sucked ive been to 3 bonnaroos 2 coachellas a sasquatch and about half a dozen sxsw this thing was a piece of shit
7574252 for his set i wiggled my way towards the front where fans were toasting beers and making eyes as they shouted the choruses to
7574253 andrew bird is good jack johnson is charming and wilco still plays too long
7574254 this event is to welcome all college students back to our city in particular new freshmen leaving their support system but its also for upperclassmen to welcome them back
7574255 were very concerned about their being part of the christian community
7574256 he always motivates us to keep going no matter what comes your way
7574257 theyre going to affect you for the rest of your life the relationships that you build now are going to support you through your adult life
7574258 i remember growing up as a small child my mother she kept me busy
7574259 and my father would say you always pick your friends
7574260 we also want to have adequate capital to embark on acquisitions
7574261 when they move into a new country they typically buy a small local distressed bank and build on it
7574262 it will be interesting to see how they deploy the money
7574263 in the past couple of years the so called new generation banks have gained a lot of muscle become very competitive and spread throughout africa

7574282 what does it mean then to allow jesus to be lord of our lives just this whatever controls us is our lord the person who seeks power is controlled by power the person who seeks acceptance is controlled by the people he or she wants to please we do not control ourselves we are controlled by the lord of our life if jesus is our lord then he is the one who controls he has the ultimate power there are no bargains we cannot manipulate him by playing lets make a deal if he is lord the only option open to us is to do his will to let him have control of course jesus remains lord whether we accept him or not his lordship his essence is not affected by what we choose but our lives are drastically changed by our choice

7574330 this second rescue effort has been planned because a survey of the remaining aquatic habitat inside prospect island has revealed a larger than expected number of fish that survived the dewatering of the island in 2007 as the available habitat has shrunk due to evaporation its ability to support these fish has also diminished
7574331 most of the fish likely to be transported on monday are introduced species like carp and sunfish but it is likely a few sacramento blackfish and possibly other native minnows will also be removed
7574332 ill be back in sacramento today and i am committed 100 percent to the rescue as soon as i get home
7574333 if we save any fish its a lot better than doing nothing
7574334 the reason why the state and federal governments are doing the rescue this time is because of the big stink that we made about the fish kill last november

7574336 with a life time commitment to environmental protection and clean energy joe biden is a invaluable addition to barak obamas ticket together they will make the strongest executive team for clean energy in american history
7574337 when we endorsed senator obama earlier this year we said he is the change our nation needs the leader who will put america on the path to a clean energy economy that will create and keep millions of jobs spur innovation and opportunity make us a more secure nation and help us solve global warming over senator bidens career he has proven a strong commitment to that same vision and those same values
7574338 senator biden has a life time rating of 83 from the league of conservation voters he has been calling for the u s to act on global warming for over 20 years and in his role on the foreign relations committee has taken the bush administration to task for failing to engage the rest of the world on climate change
7574339 together senators obama and biden share with us the common goals of putting america back to work by building a clean energy economy taking on big oil and meeting the challenge of global warming under their leadership our economy can become stronger and our world cleaner and safer
7574340 frees the little woman from disagreeable trips to the garbage can
7574341 obama carries in his intellectual dna i e his premises many of the tensions between the left and the middle in american political culture
7574342 he was not involved in the fights of the 1960s and that makes him harder to define
7574343 i see him as having a rhetoric rather than a philosophy
7574344 i have said repeatedly that i think that the death penalty should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes
7574345 i think the rape of a small child 6 or 8 years old is a heinous crime
7574346 hes certainly center left but he has a pretty conservative social message
7574347 we forfeit the imagery and terminology through which millions of americans understand both their personal morality and social justice
7574348 i used to tell people that obama not hillary was the real clinton
7574349 we cant redefine russia as evil thats not in our interests nor will it work
7574350 i will say this what we saw from europe to the middle east was enormous hunger for american leadership
7574351 he buys into the precepts of american exceptionalism which portrays the 20th century as the story of american visionary leadership
7574352 i doubt seriously he has a fully formed worldview yet
7574353 there will be an internal fight for the mind and soul of president obama
7574354 obama doesnt like telling people that their deepest theoretical commitments are wrong he is a visionary minimalist
7574355 he is not rooted in the way of a lot of politicians we dont know what his precise philosophy will be
7574356 arguably as the bigger more cost efficient stores move out the poor increasingly are likely to find themselves choosing between traveling farther to purchase nutritious competitively priced groceries or paying inflated prices for low quality processed foods at corner stores
7574357 stores pricing and location decisions in most instances are guided by competitive factors rather than any bias against the poor or their neighborhoods
7574358 one suggestion would be to explore the possibility of encouraging co operative stores which spreads the ownership among a relatively large group of stake holders within the poor community while at the same time increasing its operational economies of scale another possibility might be to consider joint ownership or management of franchises of selective stores in the poorest neighborhoods by the corporate owners of big grocery chains and poor residents

7574369 i really wish everyone in tennis would get the word usage correct a grand slam is when you sweep in one year all four major tournaments the australian open the french open wimbledon and the u s open
7574370 if you win the u s open you will have one a major tournament not a grand slam you cannot say pete sampras has won 14 grand slams he has won 14 majors roger federer has won 12 major titles not 12 grand slams ana ivanovic did not win her first grand slam title at the french open she won her first major title
7574371 rod laver won two grand slams one in 1962 and another in 1969 and overall he won 11 major singles titles
7574372 jack crawford the stylish australian of the 1930s had no idea when he departed his homeland by steamship in the spring of 1933 that he would unknowingly be the instigator of a concept eventually known as the grand slam
7574373 in paris jack became the first non frenchman to seize the championship of france dethroning henri cochet of france 8 6 6 1 6 3 then crossing the channel to london he lifted the wimbledon title from another californian ellsworth vines in a splendid final 4 6 11 9 6 2 2 6 6 4
7574374 nobody had won those three majors in a row but jack had enough
7574375 the prospect of his winning that one too intrigued a new york times columnist john kieran

7574378 in one of their hyms the sect pictures itself as a pregant woman suffering the pangs of parturition as she gives birth to her firstborn who is described in terms reminiscent of the child of isaish 9 6 the wonderful counsellor most scholars agree that the passage retains its biblical messianic significance in which case it appears that the sect believed that out of its suffering of atonement for the land would come the anointed one or christ
7574379 in spite of that the general lines of the text are clear enough to assure us that in qumran interpretation jacobs blessing of judah was seen as a promise of the restoration of the davidic monarchy and of the perpetuity of his royal office
7574380 it is an aramaic text one of the copies of the testament of levi recently published by e
7574381 and he will atone for all the children of his generation
7574382 they will utter many words against him and an abundance of lies they will fabricate fables against him and utter every kind of disparagement against him
7574383 our qumran text 4q521 is astonishingly quite close to this christian concept of the messiah
7574384 there is no doubt that the qumran community had faith in the ultimate victory of such a messiah over all evil however a closer reading of these texts reveals an additional theme equally dominant that of an initial though temporary triumph of wicked over righteousness that is there was the belief among the qumran community that the messiah would suffer initial defeat but that he would ultimately triumph in the end of days
7574385 if you do not stand on a small bug why would you stand on a big bug
7574386 this lost gospel presents us with more primary evidence that the origins of early christianity were far more diverse than medieval church historians would tell us
7574387 early orthodox histories denigrated and then banished from political memory the existence of these peaceful people and their sacred texts of which this gospel is one
7574388 the talmud is a combination of mishna and gemara the latter is a collection of mishnayoth tosephtas mechilta siphra siphre and boraithas all of these interpreted and discussed by the amoraim saboraim and also gaonim at a later period
7574389 the mishna is the authorized codification of the oral or unwritten law which on the basis of the written law contained in pentateuch developed during the second temple and down to the end of the second century of the common era
7574390 o jesus of nazerath is who we are talking about
7574391 let us imagine what a jew let alone a philosopher might say to jesus is it not true good sir that you fabricated the story of your birth from a virgin to quiet rumourss about the true and insavoury circumstances of your origins is it not the case that far from being born in the royal davids city of bethlehem you were born in a poor country town and of a woman who earned her living by spinning is it not the case that when her deceit was uncovered to wit that she was pregnant by a roman soldier called panthera she was driven away by her husband the carpenter and convicted of adultery
7574392 i could continue along these lines suggesting a good deal about the affairs of jesus life that does not appear in your own records indeed what i know to be the case and what the disciples tell are two very different stories for example the nonsensical idea that jesus foresaw everything that was to happen to him an obvious attempt to conceal the humiliating facts
7574393 is used for jesus in the ammoraic period i e fifth century period

7574420 in fact it serves to distract attention from the unsanitary conditions of industrial agriculture that create the problem in the first place
7574421 irradiation kills some bacteria in our foods but it is no substitute for measures to clean up the huge animal operations that pollute our waterways and irrigation water with the raw manure that often carries pathogenic bacteria
7574422 food companies are also seeking fda permission to label irradiated foods as pasteurized an obvious attempt to conceal from consumers the fact that foods are being irradiated

7574427 the time is right to highlight the bicycle as an ideal transportation solution nearly 40 percent of all trips americans make are two miles or less the perfect length to go by bike with soaring gas prices interest in bicycling as a u s transportation solution has grown this is a perfect opportunity to demonstrate the convenience of bicycling for short trips
7574428 biking is fun and this innovative program from humana and bikes belong provides an excellent way for people to exercise and we all know exercise is critical to protecting ones health i encourage everyone planning to attend the conventions to strap on a helmet and safely pedal their way to good health during their stay in denver or minneapolis st paul

7574436 these crustaceans are sensitive to heavy metals such as copper cadmium and zinc and scientists use them as a test organisms for assessing the toxicity of marine sediments says ms chung
7574437 they accumulate heavy metals inside their tissues and scientists use them to monitor environmental pollutants
7574438 one of the purposes of our research is to develop better designs for precast concrete buildings
7574439 this is really important to our industry because well be able to develop structures that can resist natures most difficult loads including earthquakes
7574440 we conducted tests from lower seismicity all the way to higher seismicity and shook the building stronger and stronger each time with a higher intensity
7574441 since that time we have been working to come up with designs that will make these structures survive a northridge earthquake or stronger
7574442 we are only able to perform physical experiments on that one structure but if we can show that our models capture important response properly we can run hundreds of earthquake simulations a year for the cost of a graduate student a fast computer and a software license which at around 50 000 is substantially less than the costs of these kinds of tests
7574443 the englekirk center is very important to the research community and to the industry because it has an outdoor environment where we can perform large scale tests that cant be done anywhere else in the world
7574444 our basic premise is that consumer purchases are altered by the portfolio of drink sizes made available
7574445 consumers who purchased a 16 ounce drink when a 12 ounce drink was available later chose a 21 ounce drink when the 12 ounce drink option was removed since now the 16 ounce soda is the smallest option
7574446 this effect also occurred at the large end of the spectrum people who purchased a 21 ounce drink when the 32 ounce drink was the largest size available moved up to the 32 ounce drink when a 44 ounce drink was added to the range of drink sizes available
7574447 these loopholes allow top executives to avoid paying their fair share of taxes as a result ordinary taxpayers wind up picking up the bill
7574448 its outrageous that our tax dollars are inflating executive paychecks
7574449 surely in these troubled economic times we can find better ways to spend our nations wealth
7574450 if we had roads cars and clinics in our village my baby would not have died
7574451 it was my fourth pregnancy but i felt more pain than before i had delivered my other three children at home and i was expecting to do the same for the fourth
7574452 but the pain was terrible this time and then i found out that one of my babys hands had come out of my body i was in extreme pain after that
7574453 there is no doctor or clinic in our village in yamgan district about 200km from faizabad so my family decided to take me to a clinic in jurm district
7574454 there is no road or car in our area so they wanted to take me by donkey i couldnt sit on the donkey because my babys hand was hanging out of me
7574455 then i was banded tightly to a wooden ladder and men carried me on their shoulders to the clinic in jurm where doctors said i should be taken to faizabad hospital
7574456 in jurm my husband rented a car to drive us to faizabad i dont remember how long we travelled until we reached faizabad but i remember i was crying out in pain for hours all the way and my face was covered with mud because my tears mixed with road dust as we were driving
7574457 i fainted before i was brought into faizabad hospital and when was i resuscitated i was told the baby had already died it was a boy a handsome boy i was told
7574458 if we had roads cars and clinics in our village i would not have suffered that pain and my baby would not have died
7574459 if we had roads cars and clinics in our village my baby would not have died
7574460 we cant have strong enforcement of our clean air laws unless we know what polluters are putting into the air
7574461 the bush epa went out of its way to overturn a system that required states to adequately monitor air pollution at power plants and factories instead epa actually outlawed states from requiring monitoring good enough to protect the health of their citizens epas consistent polluter biased practices have amounted to industry foxes having a house party in the henhouse
7574462 today the court slapped down epas see no evil approach to the clean air act which would have eliminated emissions monitoring required by law responding to an outstanding argument by earthjustice the court understood that emission standards that arent monitored can never be enforced todays opinion is only the latest in series of decisions that have thoroughly rejected epas seven year campaign to unravel the clean air act
7574463 the federal appeals court held that communities across america have the right to know the amount of air pollution discharged by thousands of industrial sources
7574464 the court reinstated bedrock public health protections undermined by what it properly called an epa about face and sharply admonished the agency to carry out the nations clean air laws
7574465 public health should be a top priority not polluters profits
7574466 todays decision will give states back the tools they need to hold polluters accountable and help ensure that everyone has clean healthy air to breathe

7574468 our efforts are directed at illegally operating carwash businesses as part of the underground economy
7574469 these illegal operations have a negative impact on our states economy do not provide the protection workers are legally afforded and have an unfair advantage over competitors who do follow the law
7574470 we will continue to strengthen our efforts in addressing these types of violations that are typically associated with the underground economy
7574471 to put yourself through what is a pretty rigorous process of running for president youve got to have learned to set up some pretty high expectations for got to be driving you and in my case if you have somebody that is absent maybe you feel like youve got something to prove when youre young and that pattern sets itself up over time
7574472 the stories i heard about my father painted him as larger than life which also meant that i felt i had something to live up to you could argue that if youre too well adjusted you dont end up running for president so if the pattern sets in pretty early on where youre pushing your comfort level it probably has to do with those very early influences and that can come from either the absence or the presence of a father who ends up motivating you in some way
7574473 without a father he was forced to arm himself and to make his own way into the worlds he chose to join and to master
7574474 obama was left with two alternatives either descend into chaos as a lost soul or steel himself against the world in order to rise in it he chose steeliness over surrender
7574475 is thus one of survival and defense for of all the advice he was ever offered the most significant and the one perhaps most relevant to his rise and to his fate was his stepfather lolo soetoros always protect yourself
7574476 the nice thing about it is that at least people tend to underestimate me
7574477 i think my strength actually comes in my case from the absence of a father at some level i had to raise myself my mother obviously was the dominant influence in my life and i had a stepfather and a grandfather who both participated in raising me and were good men who did good things for me but if i think about how i have been able to navigate some pretty tricky situations in my life it has to do with the fact that i had to learn to trust my own judgment i had to learn to fight for what i wanted
7574478 but because many americans think obama is not what he actually is it has become that
7574479 that is a potential problem particularly in a race that shows ever more signs of being extremely close
7574480 at some point these are issues thoughtful people will need to face head on rather than cede the ground to propagandists who traffic in intolerance and who deprived of the ability to make racial slurs with impunity simply shift their focus to religion
7574481 many have discoursed on what an obama victory could mean for america we would finally be able to see our legacy of slavery segregation and racism in the rearview mirror our kids would grow up thinking of prejudice as a nonfactor in their lives
7574482 if obama loses our children will grow up thinking of equal opportunity as a myth his defeat would say that when handed a perfect opportunity to put the worst part of our history behind us we chose not to in this event the worlds judgment will be severe and inescapable the united states had its day but in the end couldnt put its own self interest ahead of its crazy irrationality over race
7574483 the attraction of barack obama as a candidate has less to do with the cut of his suits or the fact that hes championed by hip rock singers than with an almost geeky earnestness a decency and sobriety that he projects when speaking to a crowd
7574484 a large part of his mystique lies in his insistence on his message and on the complexity of that message and in his old fashioned almost stern will to cut the flim flam and in a way so retro its almost novel to actually address the issues
7574485 but will obama amid the pulsating theatrics also attempt the less glamorous and more difficult task of explaining specifically where he wants to move the country and how he proposes to move it above and beyond reciting his policy positions
7574486 history as well as recent public opinion polls suggests that he badly needs to do so
7574487 the beijing olympics have been a spectacular sporting event but they took place against a backdrop of human rights violations with activists prevented from expressing their views peacefully and many in detention when they have committed no crime
7574488 the chinese authorities and the ioc had an opportunity to demonstrate human rights improvements but in most respects they failed to deliver forced evictions detention of activists and restrictions on journalists should not blight another olympics
7574489 it is high time for the ioc to put its core values of human dignity and universal fundamental ethical principles into practice by making human rights a new pillar of the olympic games

7574491 ronald kesslers book the terrorist watch explains how the clinton administration destroyed the ability of the fbi and cia to protect us from 9 11
7574492 electing liberals only adds problems instead of solving existing problems such as energy social security health programs national state and local deficits the trade deficit and illegal immigration
7574493 when bush became president he took a liking to tenet and asked him to stay as director
7574494 in the six years before 9 11 the bureau stopped forty terrorist plots before they happened the fbi foiled an attempt by al qaeda to blow up the holland and lincoln tunnels the united nations and the fbis new york field office the bureau also determined that al qaeda had connections through al kifah refugee center in brooklyn to some of those convicted in the 1993 attack on the world trade center
7574495 we will make no distinction between those who planned these acts and those who harbor them
7574496 america has a message to the nations of the world if you harbor terrorists you are a terrorist if you train or arm a terrorist you are a terrorist if you feed a terrorist or fund a terrorist youre a terrorist and you will be held accountable by the united states and our friends
7574497 its often said that intelligence is the tip of the spear
7574498 they are authorized to carry weapons and can shoot to kill they can deprive a suspect of his freedom and send him to jail for life they can eavesdrop on private phone conversations videotape what goes on in bedrooms subpoena witnesses to testify before a grand jury open mail boxes and read mail and obtain telephone toll records and other confidential documents including income tax returns by consulting their files they can learn the most damaging personal information by showing their credentials they can bypass airport security take their weapons on airplanes get into movie theaters free and park illegally without getting a ticket but unless an agent is on bureau business has proper authorization and in many cases has a court order he has no more power than any other citizen
7574499 established in 2005 the nctc integrated the intelligence community at the nctc dozens of analysts from the cia fbi national security agency nsa and other intelligence agencies sit side by side sharing intelligence and tracking threats twenty four hours a day in addition major portions of the fbis counterterrorism division and the cias counterterrorism center make their offices at the nctc
7574500 war is nothing but the continuation of politics with the admixture of other means
7574501 the us economy in essence is being kept afloat by enormous foreign lending so that consumers can keep buying more imports thus increasing the bloated trade deficits this lopsided arrangement will end when those foreign creditors major trading partners like japan china and europe decide to stop the lending or simply reduce it substantially that reckoning could arrive as a sudden thunderclap of financial crisis spiking interest rates swooning stock market and crashing home prices more likely it will be less dramatic but equally painful as foreign capital moves elsewhere and easy credit disappears for consumers many americans will experience a major decline in their living standards a gradual grinding down process that could continue for years if the us government reacts passively and allows market forces to make these adjustments the consequences will be especially severe for the less affluent families already stretched by stagnating wages and too much borrowing
7574502 the 100 billion worth of tax rebate checks didnt give retailers a bigger lift in july some 28 percent of consumers surveyed in july by market researcher tns retail forward said they used the money to pay off credit cards 27 percent said they used it to pay for everyday expenses like groceries and gasoline and 20 percent said they put the check into a savings account only 11 percent said they used the rebate for discretionary purchases like a new tv or a vacation
7574503 now with those rebate checks spent retailers are warily looking toward sluggish sales through the rest of the year
7574504 in truth the bush tax cuts have done untold damage by preventing needed public investments and hurting our ability to spur private investments we can and should help the private sector it creates the jobs and the quality of life we enjoy but blindly throwing tax breaks at the well off is not the way to do it the wealthy recipients of the bush tax cuts were under no obligation to invest their winnings in the united states they could spend it or invest it elsewhere in the world or bid up asset values without any real return on investment for the nation as a whole lets reverse those ill conceived tax cuts
7574505 remained adamantly opposed to the international status quo and was determined to employ all of libyas resources to overthrow it
7574506 these times call for total change in washingtons world view these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader a leader who can deliver the change we need
7574507 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7574508 this election year the choice is clear one man stands ready for change we desperately need
7574509 no one has supported president bush in iraq more than me
7574510 president carter inherited an economy that was slowly emerging from a recession under ford he had severely criticized former president ford for his failures to control inflation and relieve unemployment but after four years of the carter presidency both inflation and unemployment were considerably worse than at the time of his inauguration the annual inflation rate rose from 4 8 in 1976 to 6 8 in 1977 9 in 1978 11 in 1979 and hovered around 12 at the time of the 1980 election campaign
7574511 both business leaders and the public at large blamed carter for the nations economic woes charging that the president lacked a coherent strategy for taming inflation without causing a painful increase in unemployment
7574512 the faltering economy was due in part to the energy crisis that had originated in the early 1970s as a result of overdependence on foreign oil
7574513 oil addiction is not an addiction in the medical sense like a drug addiction or a tobacco addiction but it is an addiction in the sense that powerful behaviors are involved theyre difficult to change and it can be agonizing for people to change
7574514 our nation has been rewired our national infrastructure has been wired by cheap plentiful oil
7574515 foreign oil the president said we were addicted to it and what does he want to do he wants to reinforce the addiction
7574516 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to fulfill it
7574517 faced a drastic erosion of the value of the u s dollar in the international money markets and many analysts blamed the decline on a large and persistent trade deficit much of it a result of u s dependence on foreign oil the president warned that americans were wasting too much energy that domestic supplies of oil and natural gas were running out and that foreign supplies of petroleum were subject to embargoes by the producing nations principally by members of opec in mid 1979 in the wake of widespread shortages of gasoline carter advanced a long term program designed to solve the energy problem he proposed a limit on imported oil gradual price decontrol on domestically produced oil a stringent program of conservation and development of alternative sources of energy such as solar nuclear and geothermal power oil and gas from shale and coal and synthetic fuels in what was probably his most noted domestic legislative accomplishment he pushed a significant portion of his energy program through congress
7574518 most noteworthy accomplishments came in the field of foreign affairs
7574519 the militant students from time to time held press conferences and showed off some of their hostages in front of the television cameras they also constantly paraded mobs chanting anti american slogans before the cameras at the embassy the three american television networks in competition with one another provided the iranians the ayatollah students and foreign minister with access to every american living room and allowed them to vent their hatreds demands and resentments against the shah this terrorist theater carefully staged for the cameras was an effective weapon for several months the students held the united states at bay as the latter remained fearful of acting lest the hostages be killed
7574520 a long stalemate resulted while mobs daily reviled the united states in the streets of teheran and burned american flags in retaliation the united states halted all oil imports from iran accounting for a mere 4 percent of total american daily consumption and then when the iranians sought to retaliate by withdrawing several billion dollars in oil earnings held by american banks president carter froze all iranian assets in the united states that is no iranian money could be taken out of the united states oil and money were used as means of bringing pressure for the release of the hostages
7574521 american reaction was initially limited to cutting off iranian oil imports to the united states and freezing iranian assets in the united states the latter were estimated at 6 billion
7574522 to fight the iranians needed to purchase american spare parts for their largely american made forces especially the air force bought by the shah

7574525 claims that reagans economic agenda restored prosperity are overblown the so called reagan boom was in fact a rather middling episode of economic growth shorter than either the 1960s and 1990s expansions the 1980s economic expansion was still the third longest on record but it was hardly robust the economy grew much more slowly in the 1980s than during the 1960s more slowly than the postwar average of 3 6 annual growth and no faster than in the 1970s or the 1990s nor did reagan administration regulatory rollbacks unleash a productivity boom productivity gains in the 1980s failed to match those in the decades before and after and couldnt hold a candle to the productivity gains of the 1960s boom
7574526 strong us support for the afghani resistance to the ussr is widely credited with sapping the soviet military machine of its strength and blamed for giving birth to the taliban and al qaeda
7574527 what one can say now is that reagan saw soviet weaknesses sooner than most of his contemporaries did that he understood the extent to which d tente was perpetuating the cold war rather than hastening its end that his hard line strained the soviet system at the moment of its maximum weakness
7574528 well under clinton the republicans were vetoed by a democrat president

7574530 homeland security is best accomplished through a strategy of bringing to justice real terrorists containing potential terrorists and exercising restraint with respect to the muslim community only then will the leaderless jihad expire poisoned by its own toxic message
7574531 sageman rejects the views that place responsibility for terrorism on society or a flawed predisposed individual instead he argues the individual outside influence and group dynamics come together in a four step process through which muslim youth become radicalized first traumatic events either experienced personally or learned about indirectly spark moral outrage individuals interpret this outrage through a specific ideology more felt and understood than based on doctrine usually in a chat room or other internet based venues adherents share this moral outrage which resonates with the personal experiences of others the outrage is acted on by a group either online or offline

7574535 under mr campbell we had some serious opposition to japanese outlaw whaling in the southern ocean
7574536 the email rumor thats been floating around is that somehow im unwilling to see doctors offer life saving care to children who were born as a result of an induced abortion
7574537 i have repeatedly said that i think its entirely appropriate for states to restrict or even prohibit late term abortions as long as there is a strict well defined exception for the health of the mother
7574538 sen obama is an abortion extremist who will do nothing to counter the number of abortions in this country
7574539 the significant structural and economic changes in the marketplace are prompting all automakers to further refine actions to respond to these pressures

7574556 i think as the nominee of the democratic party barack obama is obligated to do everything that he can possibly do that is honest and ethical to win that seat
7574557 now what he talked about in terms of a different kind of politics i hope that after he wins he will attempt to have that kind of administration but this is an election and the obligation he has i think to the country is to fight as hard as he can fight
7574558 with biden obama also took mccains age off the table
7574559 the choice of biden was a hard headed cold blooded calculation that he may need a biden to win and will certainly benefit from a biden in governing if he become president it was the action of a politician not a crusader
7574560 his gifts as a campaigner his personality and his natural talents have set him apart from other politicians

7574574 each six weeks there are very specific things that need to be going on in every grade and in every subject
7574575 its outrageous that our tax dollars are inflating executive paychecks
7574576 surely in these troubled economic times we can find better ways to spend our nations wealth
7574577 these loopholes allow top executives to avoid paying their fair share of taxes as a result ordinary taxpayers wind up picking up the bill

7574586 my agent called me and he said you are on a short list to be the

7574696 i guess if you think that being rich means that youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
7574697 but if youre like me and youve got one house or if you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
7574698 by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes
7574699 he couldnt count high enough apparently to know how many houses he owns
7574700 when i bought the first one my husband who is not a beach person said oh this is such a waste of money the kids will never go

7574714 during the time when we cut taxes to today our economy has grown by more than 1 9 trillion
7574715 this marks the first time this has happened since world war ii in a business cycle lasting anywhere near as long as the most recent cycle
7574716 the economy is not doing as well as wed like to do like it to do today but theres no question that the tax cuts provided economic vitality
7574717 raising taxes in a bad economy is about the worst thing you could do because it will kill even more jobs when what we need are policies that create jobs
7574718 it makes no sense to tell the enemy when you plan to start withdrawing
7574719 all the terrorists would have to do is mark their calendars and gather their strength and begin plotting how to overthrow the government and take control of the country of iraq i believe setting a deadline for withdrawal would demoralize the iraqi people would encourage killers across the broader middle east and send a signal that america will not keep its commitments setting a deadline for withdrawal is setting a date for failure and that would be irresponsible
7574720 the united states has agreed to remove combat troops from iraqi cities by next june and from the rest of the country by the end of 2011 if conditions in iraq remain relatively stable according to iraqi and american officials involved in negotiating a security accord governing american forces there
7574721 the withdrawal timetables which bush administration officials called aspirational goals rather than fixed dates are contained in the draft of an agreement that still must be approved by prime minister nuri kamal al maliki and other iraqi leaders before it goes before iraqs fractious parliament
7574722 t he accord indicates that the bush administration is prepared to commit the united states to ending most combat operations in iraq in less than a year a much shorter time frame than seemed possible politically or militarily even a few months ago
7574723 but iraqs shiite dominated government demanded a withdrawal timetable as the price of legalizing the american military presence in the country after the expiration of the united nations mandate at the end of this year
7574724 mr mccain has vowed to stay in iraq until the war is won but has suggested that he would have the troops out by 2013 two years later than the bush administration has agreed to withdraw them if conditions in the accord are met
7574725 senator barack obama the presumptive democratic nominee for president has argued that the united states should withdraw its troops from iraq 16 months after taking office or by mid 2010 a faster pace for full withdrawal than envisioned in the draft accord but the drafts interim goal of ending combat operations in iraqi cities by next summer is faster than any commitment made by mr obama
7574726 negotiators agreed several weeks ago to reduce the presence of all u
7574727 they have both agreed to 2011 mohammed al haj hamoud iraqs chief negotiator said in a telephone interview
7574728 if the iraqi government at that time decides it is necessary to keep the american forces longer they can do so
7574729 iraq initially wanted all combat troops out by the end of 2009 but agreed to push the date to 2011 after the u s agreed to protect iraqi funds in u s banks from being seized by creditors
7574730 t he agreement as its working its way through the consultative process right now with the iraqis is not one that would require congressional specific congressional approval because this is the type of agreement in many cases that we have with many countries around the world so its not a treaty so it would not require senate ratification or anything like that
7574731 campaigning thursday in virginia obama said they are working on a plan that looks lo and behold like the plan that ive been advocating i will encourage the administration to move forward with it
7574732 mccain campaign spokeswoman jill hazelbaker said were monitoring closely and will have something to say when an agreement is finalized
7574733 but above all the iraqi army has needed to reverse a track record of high profile failures in earlier years iraqi forces often fled and left heavy fighting to the u s now the iraqis are mounting large scale operations in restive areas like diyala province a longtime stronghold of sunni insurgents and holding large swaths of territory 10 of iraqs 18 provinces largely on their own
7574734 the shiite dominated government in iraq is driving out many leaders of sunni citizen patrols the groups of former insurgents who joined the american payroll and have been a major pillar in the decline in violence around the nation
7574735 in restive diyala province unites states and iraqi military officials say there were orders to arrest hundreds of members of what is known as the awakening movement as part of large security operations by the iraqi military
7574736 the governments rising hostility toward the awakening councils amounts to a bet that its military feeling increasingly strong can provide security in former guerrilla strongholds without the support of these former sunni fighters who once waged devastating attacks on united states and iraqi targets
7574737 but it is causing a rift with the american military which contends that any significant diminution of the awakening could result in renewed violence jeopardizing the substantial security gains in the past year united states commanders say that the practice however unconventional of paying the guerrillas has saved the lives of hundreds of american soldiers
7574738 without true political reconciliation the success of the surge is by definition temporary and ephemeral so now there are three possible scenarios
7574739 the maliki government comes to its senses and makes a major effort to reconcile with the sunnis
7574740 the sunnis return to the insurgency if not to the arms of the jihadis
7574741 options two and three are not mutually exclusive of course and the smart betting in iraq has always been on the side of pessimism
7574742 and if the congress wants to test my will as to whether or not ill accept the timetable for withdrawal i wont accept one i just dont think its in the interest of our troops i think it im just envisioning what it would be like to be a young soldier in the middle of iraq and realizing that politicians have all of a sudden made military determinations and in my judgment that would put a kid in harms way more so than he or she already is

7574769 i have said on a number of occasions that power in a democracy flows from the ballot rather than from the bullet and that all grievances of the people of assam can be addressed effectively in our democratic polity i therefore call upon the ulfa to join the national mainstream and work with all of us for rapid social and economic development of assam
7574770 the north east has immense development potential and we will make every effort to ensure that it is realized however the continued activities of insurgent groups create a climate of fear and insecurity not conducive to rapid economic development and new investment in assam and other north eastern states
7574771 in exploiting the hydro power potential in the region the interests of all states of the north east will have to be harmonized i am happy to know that there is now a consensus emerging on my suggestion of setting up a north eastern water resources authority to plan and implement the use of the mighty waters of this region

7574847 if we look at how much more water we will need for food and how much more for biomass for energy going forward it is quite worrying
7574848 almost every increase in water used in agriculture will affect water availability for other uses including that needed to keep ecosystems healthy and resilient in the face of change and perturbation
7574849 it might be environmentally reasonable to withdraw maybe 6 000 cubic kilometres but if we withdraw more water it would be at a very high environmental cost because we need water to flush the system and for different ecosystem services
7574850 by 2030 the same amount of energy that we produce today with fossil fuels will have to come from biomass
7574851 meet food demands by 2050 if we have a much more efficient use of water that does not include the water we need for all that biomass
7574852 we are at the end of the road when it comes to irrigation because all the water available in rivers and so on has already been now more or less used up
7574853 in a large part of africa if you look at the total rainfall throughout the year the amount is usually enough to grow many crops
7574854 if you can capture that rainfall and store it as soil moisture or in local dams it would be possible to significantly increase food production in these areas

7574904 the idea that the white house had anything to do with a forged letter purportedly from habbush to saddam is absurd

7574951 if the games could have a permanent location this is where they truly belong
7574952 because of the cost of making the playstation 3 and because they sold it at a loss sony basically has pretty much no chance of making money on the ps3 because its lost more money than they made during the entire peak of the playstation 2 its not going to happen again for sony
7574953 if they release the playstation 4 and have an even more expensive console and raise the cost of games by ten dollars that would not be good
7574954 this is going to force them to make the ps3 last longer and theyre kind of positioning to do that

7574964 arguably as the bigger more cost efficient stores move out the poor increasingly are likely to find themselves choosing between traveling farther to purchase nutritious competitively priced groceries or paying inflated prices for low quality processed foods at corner stores
7574965 stores pricing and location decisions in most instances are guided by competitive factors rather than any bias against the poor or their neighborhoods
7574966 one suggestion would be to explore the possibility of encouraging co operative stores which spreads the ownership among a relatively large group of stake holders within the poor community while at the same time increasing its operational economies of scale another possibility might be to consider joint ownership or management of franchises of selective stores in the poorest neighborhoods by the corporate owners of big grocery chains and poor residents

7574968 one of the chief reasons for the great variation in case fatality in different groups is undoubtedly the nature and relative abundance of secondary invaders the excessively high mortality in certain army camps on certain transports and in particular hospitals or barracks seems most readily explicable in this way
7574969 1 the influenza virus weakens the resistant power of the pulmonary tissues so that various bacteria are able to play the role of secondary invaders 2 the precise nature of the secondary and tertiary invaders is largely a matter of accident dependent on the occurrence of particular bacteria in the respiratory tract of persons at the time of infection and in the case of group outbreaks on their occurrence in contacts 3 the character of the resulting pneumonia clinical and pathologic is largely determined by the nature of the secondary invaders whether pfeiffer bacillus streptococcus pneumococcus or other organisms 4 there seems little doubt that the influenza virus besides depressing the general pulmonary resistance also acts directly on the pulmonary tissues causing capillary necrosis edema and hemorrhage 5 it seems to be true therefore that the fatal outcome of influenza pneumonia is determined partly by the degree to which the influenza virus depresses local and general pulmonary resistance and partly by the virulence and nature of the bacteria which invade the tissues in the wake of the specific virus

7574975 versiones de justicia y paz pretenden enlodar a funcionarios del gobierno
7574976 aseveraciones de quienes se someten a la ley de justicia y paz pretenden enlodar a personas de nuestra comunidad chantajear a sectores de ella y generar una percepci n que no corresponde a nuestra realidad
7574977 a esta realidad no se escapa a quienes vieron en estos grupos ilegales la oportunidad de mantener su poder o expandir sus fortunas pero creemos que no todas las circunstancias son iguales y que algunas acusaciones han sido hechas con maleficencia con nimo de retaliaci n a quienes los hemos combatido
7574978 no pretendamos que las acusaciones hechas contra los adversarios pol ticos sean ciertas y las hechas a los amigos sean falsas aceptemos los fallos de la justicia sin importar a quienes beneficien o condenen

7575005 one important way state troopers and our law enforcement colleagues around ohio are working to make ohio roads safe to travel is by aggressively searching for and removing impaired drivers from the roadways before they can cause a tragedy to someone in your family or someone you know
7575006 state troopers universally take the crime of drunk driving seriously and that is what drunk driving is a crime

7575013 the united states produces the highest quality meat in the world customers at the grocery store should be able to know whether the meat theyre buying was produced here i expect country of origin labeling to give a boost to american producers and give consumers more information about what they are feeding to their families we label our t shirts shorts and shoes the least we can do is let people know where the meat on their dinner plate comes from

7575020 the price is up good today thursday august 21 its about as good as it gets
7575021 the quality is good but proteins are light which is the only dark spot of this grain harvest
7575022 it will be late september before we see the soybeans

7575029 almost half of the journalists reported they were not familiar with the concept of health literacy but said that their readers ability to understand health information was very important to consider when writing health stories
7575030 increasing knowledge of health literacy could help journalists clarify medical information to readers
7575031 health journalists play an important role in helping people effectively manage their health
7575032 however we found that many journalists find it difficult to explain health information to their readers while maintaining the informations scientific credibility they have to resist bogging down the story with too much technical science data and dumbing down the story with overly simplistic recommendations
7575033 a large percentage of americans are not health literate which is related to significant health problems including medication errors failing to seek treatment and an inability to understand directions about proper health behavior
7575034 the role of a health journalist includes translating medical information and acting as a liaison responsible for providing quality information we need to actively find ways to improve health coverage and recognize the importance of the medias role in improving the publics quality of life

7575051 when that picture first came out i was invited to go and see it in london but i couldnt bear to go in the room where it was if id have seen that picture up close i would have put their windows in
7575052 to use this image to promote the olympic games to send this image all over the world is disgusting i watched the olympics from beginning to end and thought it was wonderful and that if i got the money i would go to 2012 i wont now because of this
7575053 it seems silly anyway because myra hindley is a manchester woman and nothing to do with london maybe thats why its happened because those in london dont know how strongly manchester people feel about this

7575116 i think through the past weeks and months and years with the media talking about my putting and writing about my putting and people talking about my putting and people want to help me i must have had hundreds of letters and phone calls and all saying that they can fix my putting said singh who is now 8 4 in playoffs
7575117 you know at the end of the day it kind of gets to your head that youre not a good putter
7575118 so i made a point after last week that you know im going to change that attitude and i believed in myself that im the best putter and i came out here with a different attitude and i putted great this week if i keep doing this im going to win a lot more golf tournaments
7575119 be hitting golf balls at the beginning of the year
7575120 especially not really getting an opportunity to help the team whos to say if we had the opportunity to play it could be a different outcome in 04 thats one thing we did great in this tournament we used our bench thats the reason were better than everybody we dont got one or two guys weve got 12 guys who can play
7575121 then they come back and hit a three then we hit another three and they come back and hit two more threes and now its up four and and
7575122 im kind of crazy because im watching the whole game in my head again the intensity was unbelievable
7575123 we should be very proud of the effort we showed
7575124 tonight we shot 70 percent and were up by six
7575125 at one point i said youve got to be kidding me we wanted to play good defense and it was hard to do it spain executed they shot the ball they made big plays
7575126 and to be sitting in front of you guys tonight on top of the world i think we did a helluva job of putting americas basketball where its supposed to be which is at the top of the world
7575127 i would say already we can feel it that the young players want to be part of this
7575128 the first or second year stars players just drafted out of college agents are calling players are calling point is now that we have gotten it to this point we have a chance to take it to another level and that would be something that would be really important to u s basketball
7575129 we are just waiting to see what kind of healer he is going to be but the doctor talked about him having a little bit of a contusion there
7575130 it will be based on how he improves but he definitely wont play this thursday well be cautious if we had the choice of him playing between one game and 15 well take the 15
7575131 first win the war against franco and only afterwards win the revolution
7575132 we have evaluated matt through offseason workouts minicamps training camp and over the course of three preseason games
7575133 after reviewing matts progress we feel that hes won the starting job we feel that matt gives us the best opportunity not only against detroit in the opener but the in long run
7575134 were going to play against some really good players and theres really good coaches on other teams as well
7575135 so theres going to be good schemes and sometimes were not going to be at our best but youve got to learn from those mistakes and youve got to understand that theyre going to happen and youve got to bounce back from them as quickly as you can

7575184 i really think he is the most qualified democrat in the race for president
7575185 his track record is exceptional hes done a fine job as governor and was re elected with around 70 percent of the vote
7575186 if a democrat carries new mexico colorado and nevada we dont need ohio or florida to win richardson is very popular throughout the southwest and stands the best chance of being able to do that
7575187 i was disappointed to hear about the presidents threat to veto the washington dc appropriations bill because of the domestic partner registry
7575188 it is particularly sad that the president would choose to issue this threat during pride month which should be a celebration of glbt americans contributions to our nation as well as a celebration of the strides our nation has made towards full equality

7575192 instability in the hamas run gaza strip would be in fatahs interests
7575193 the situation has become so grave that partisans of fatah actually fled to israel for protection
7575194 more proof that cooperation with israel can only lead to degradation and loss
7575195 when news of the beach blast was initially broadcast on pa television in ramallah it was accompanied by triumphant music and patriotic anthems as if it were a victory
7575196 whose close association with israel was proven by the fact that they ultimately fled there for refuge
7575197 israels inability to remove hamas from gaza either by force of arms or by cutting it off from the rest of the world has prompted it to adopt indirect means of weakening hamas
7575198 now its using its agents inside gaza to incite violence domestically
7575199 might have been the beginning of an attempt to overthrow hamas rule
7575200 there are elements that would like to portray hamas as incapable of maintaining security

7575204 i think the most challenging thing weve shot was the tower bridge we had to do a shot we had one minute to get a shot and no other chance to to get the shot we needed the tower bridge opening in the background and we knew it opened at a specific time i think it was 10 00 p m and i think we got it

7575244 its not the finish i had imagined but i am slowly coming to terms with whats happened over the last 24 hours
7575245 the realisation that i had just played my last game for the knights was very overwhelming and the thought of not putting on my red and blue no 9 jersey ever again was really hard to comprehend
7575246 only a place like newcastle could give you the welcome home we got that night
7575247 winning the premiership and then the trip back up the f3 was the highest of highs and walking into the packed stadium was incredible something i will never forget
7575248 the feeling i got that night stayed with me and motivated me for all these years to train week in week out to reach that pinnacle again
7575249 with the world cup at the end of the year i felt my goal of playing for australia one last time was within reach as well but it just wasnt meant to be

7575333 chris hoy is entitled to his own opinion and he has clearly done a fantastic job at the olympic games but i think a scottish team is still important and i would support the idea
7575334 people have to look at what level they want to represent their country at
7575335 before there are any discussions of scotland going it alone at the olympics he would have to look at the facilities and the resources that have been put into scotland in the first place
7575336 at the moment we dont have an international facility for cycling and we dont have the coaching structures in place in fact we dont have anything in place so the whole idea is ridiculous
7575337 i wouldnt have three gold medals hanging round my neck if i wasnt part of the british athletic team im a scottish athlete in a british team and im proud to be a british athlete
7575338 given the choice of saving meadowbank or getting a knighthood hed choose meadowbank in a flash it means so much to him
7575339 the facility has a great international reputation if you lose meadowbank you lose the reputation as well and that will be extremely sad
7575340 the velodrome needs a little tlc but it is loved and my pupils can see the facility is good enough to take them to the top
7575341 i would love to be able to take more groups of pupils there and introduce them to the sport
7575342 we think chris would be great as the next face of scotts porage oats
7575343 he is strong and healthy good looking and a scottish hero hes the perfect icon its not at boardroom level yet but were certainly keen to get him signed up if hes interested
7575344 chris is a dream hes an outstanding athlete it will be very easy for him to earn 1million every year for the next four years

7575351 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges

7575366 you have interests out there who will use the race issue in trying to deter voters from him
7575367 then you have people that care about race less than in the past you have a new generation of americans people that were raised before the civil rights movement have retired or died out
7575368 and thats not how its always worked in the past
7575369 its a bit of a shell game in american politics
7575370 alternative university teaching the tactics and strategies necessary to force an end to this war
7575371 we are bringing in additional officers to make everything go smoothly
7575372 there are many types of equipment to use including three types of bikes treadmills and steppers cross trainers rowers and arm ergometers for cardiovascular training
7575373 for strength training there are free weights dumbbells three kinds of selectorized machines and functional training machines called humansport we also have bands medicine balls balance devices and a stretching and core area
7575374 everyone gets a free chance to try out the wall but if they decide to continue using the wall they must take a class or pass a test to be certified to use the wall without an instructor
7575375 to register to use the src students and staff must fill out a two page form provide their campus wide identification number and get their hand scanned
7575376 to enter the src you must scan your hand and enter your campus wide id number
7575377 there are fitness classes including martial arts and dance there are strength training equipment orientations on selected tuesdays and wednesdays weight room orientations on selected fridays
7575378 the incentive for students is the location of the parking
7575379 you get your titancard encoded at the titancard office its good any day of the week on any of the octa buses
7575380 i would definitely recommend that anyone who doesnt live too far take the bus
7575381 if students are really pressed for funds the first suggestion i have is apply for an asi scholarship
7575382 my dad pays for them so i cant really say that textbook costs has anything to do with all my costs
7575383 the next best option for a student would be rental
7575384 computer science seems a little bit high math maybe not quite as much
7575385 basically its a whole lot of work and i dont get a much better price
7575386 if some whacked out adult wants to spend his time playing grand theft auto vice city one has to wonder why he doesnt get a life but when it comes to kids it has a demonstrable impact on their behavior and the development of the frontal lobes of their brain
7575387 its such a brilliant game in terms of social comparison and political satire that people get caught up with the violence of the game
7575388 people need to understand the social satire and political scrutiny
7575389 the parents have the money there are other more pressing issues than the game like what their kids are eating and what theyre learning in school
7575390 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
7575391 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
7575392 obviously were not in favor of lowering the drinking age its ultimately going to create more problems than it would solve on this campus we take a hard line on those issues and well continue to do so i dont see lowering the drinking age as a benefit to anyone
7575393 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
7575394 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
7575395 it binge drinking is not necessarily caused by the acceptance or the availability of alcohol it has more to do with a group mentality it has nothing to do with whether or not its illegal
7575396 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
7575397 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
7575398 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
7575399 i have seen a number of young people who have gotten into a variety of difficulties with alcohol abuse i just feel that the longer you delay the drinking age the greater the probability of responsible drinking
7575400 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
7575401 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
7575402 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
7575403 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
7575404 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
7575405 the old e mails required us to have hardware to store the disk space from the old system
7575406 now that we are powered by google there is no need for the old hardware everything is stored through google google is constantly upgrading the amount of disk space each student can use back when we started in june each e mail had about 6 5 gigabytes of memory since that time google has updated the disk space to 7 gigabytes every time google increases the disk space csuf e mail space will increase too
7575407 we are in a four year educational contract with google the four year agreement is at no cost it works out for both parties because we get a better e mail system and google is increasing their user base it works for both of us the only time we need to do any maintenance is if there is a software upgrade
7575408 we just implemented the system and we havent seen any problems yet it is still very new but as of yet no problems
7575409 just getting to the e mail is easier then before i had a hard time navigating it before i like the chat function it seems cool i havent used it much but it just looks better than the old one
7575410 the university was really looking ahead hooking up with google
7575411 when you log into where your new e mail is you will see a screen for the old e mails students will have about a month after school starts to transfer everything over we wanted to give enough time for people to get it all over

7575417 omdat onze verzoeken aan de georgische en de russische autoriteiten tot dusver onvoldoende informatie hebben opgeleverd zullen we zelf een team afvaardigen dat op korte termijn ter plaatse feitenonderzoek kan uitvoeren
7575418 de crisis tussen georgi en rusland is nog niet ten einde en het geweld heeft diepe wonden geslagen
7575419 maar ik wil niets nalaten wat meer informatie zou kunnen opleveren
7575420 generally we have re established the sideways pattern in existing home sales since october which given the general down draft in a lot of housing data it is certainly good news that we seem to have some kind of floor
7575421 right now the sign is encouraging not that its over but youre starting to see a bottom
7575422 prices have come down more than we have expected but sales and starts have actually held up better that may be a sign of realism out there that people have accepted the fact they cant get as much for the house as they thought they could
7575423 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia
7575424 its fair to say that they are still not living up to the terms of the ceasefire agreement
7575425 the president felt it was important to have the vice president consult with allies in the region on our common security interests
7575426 the department of state urges u s citizens in georgia to exercise caution while traveling
7575427 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7575428 an open time limit is not acceptable in any security deal that governs the presence of the international forces
7575429 go through a number of levers in the iraqi political system before we actually have an agreement from the iraqi side
7575430 until we have a deal we dont have a deal
7575431 we will not accept to put the lives of our sons on the line by guaranteeing absolute immunity for anybody whether iraqis or foreigners
7575432 without the approval of the iraqi government and american forces
7575433 we see some demand seeping back into the market the majority of that was due to the price decline as prices continue to decline we should see more demand
7575434 we dont see the total supply diminishing because we are seeing more foreclosures and distress sales we need to see prices fall further to clear the overhanging inventory the more months of positive sales should be a sign of home buyer confidence
7575435 its not enough to sign a change in trend but its a positive report hopefully we could move in this direction it could take up to two years for prices to start climbing back up again
7575436 the market was expecting a bounce anyway but this is still mildly dollar positive i do think the impact on the dollar would be short lived the flows this week are still being driven by macroeconomic factors such as oil and equities whether we have seen a bottom in the housing sector would depend largely on oil prices if oil continues its decline then that should boost consumer spending and hopefully support the housing market
7575437 the data is not too significant and the market hasnt reacted dramatically to it it is interesting that home sales have pretty much leveled off in 2008 we were going down at a very rapid rate in 2006 and 2007 but thats really about it
7575438 financial stocks are pretty much in the red across the board theyre the main determinant of the direction of the overall market and its hard to make progress when they are down fannie and freddie are on everyones mind but nothing has happened its lots of speculation but no developments
7575439 it is a shame that the u s administration could not push this agreement through congress in the time there was
7575440 if you take into account the recent political events congress is unlikely to pass it so to avoid it being blocked it would be right and proper to recall it and let it be looked at by the new administration
7575441 the question of peaceful use of nuclear energy should not depend on the current political situation
7575442 independientemente de los resultados obtenidos en los juegos ol mpicos todos los venezolanos debemos sentirnos orgullosos de nuestros atletas ellos son nuestros h roes y hero nas
7575443 aqu hay mucha gente que ha dicho no se que m s que no estuvieron a la altura que atacan al gobierno pero como dijno el quijote si ladran los perros es porque cabalgamos
7575444 con este episodio de las olimpiadas y la pasi n que se desbord en venezuela y aqu en mi coraz n yo personalmente voy a estar mucho m s pendiente del deporte apoyando lo que haga falta
7575445 algunos diarios se dedicaron a escribir editoriales diciendo que por ejemplo las muchachas de softbol no estaban preparadas que las echamos a los leones que se las devoraron en china ellos son los que no tienen patria pero ustedes atletas son la patria buena la patria grande
7575446 aquellos que no conocen del deporte no tienen por qu criticarnos primero tienen que sentarse a conocer el deporte por dentro y despu s pueden opinar
7575447 no importa que critiquen los que quieran pero este pueblo los ama a ustedes nuestros gloriosos deportivas
7575448 una primera decisi n que hemos tomado para profundizar la revoluci n deportiva es la creaci n de una oficina para el deporte de alto rendimiento donde los deportistas puedan ir y hacer sus planteamientos y para hacer asambleas para o r sus opiniones
7575449 analizar la situaci n del deporte porque son los atletas los que la conocen realmente
7575450 estamos agradecidos por todo el apoyo que nos han dado y queremos solicitarle que se haga una gesti n constante con la selecci n nacional para que el pueblo venezolano conozca a sus atletas de alto rendimiento que somos los que metemos el pecho y entregamos todo por nuestro pa s
7575451 para que el deporte nacional pueda surgir como lo queremos se debe contar con una dirigencia que de verdad conozca el deporte por lo que la resposabilidad de dirigir el deporte debe estar en manos de deportistas y exdeportistas
7575452 queremos aclarar al pueblo venezolano que algunos hicieron falsas expectativas sobre nuestra participaci n en beijing y nosotros fuimos a pelear por estar en lo m s alto de podio estar entre las medallas sin embargo no se lograron los objetivos pero eso es parte del deporte
7575453 aquellos que no han hecho deporte no deben criticarnos en 4 d as que llevo en el pa s he tenido dos enfrentamientos con personas equis que han criticado a compa eros nuestros sin raz n
7575454 toda vez que la competencia disciplinaria de la comisi n de funcionamiento y reestructuraci n del sistema judicial se origina en una norma que emana de la asamblea constituyente y por tanto de rango superior al legal establecida en 1999
7575455 the bold combines everything business people love about the traditional blackberry email experience with great graphics streaming video a sharp display and the ability to download view and edit documents in a matter of seconds
7575456 we asked telstra for some blackberry bold units to trial but apparently there are some bugs
7575457 they asked us to wait for the next release of the firmware telstra didnt go into detail but weve been asked to wait until september
7575458 rim is developing a software upgrade to optimise media streaming on the device
7575459 this free firmware upgrade is around the corner and a handful of customers have chosen to wait for this before rolling out the new blackberry bold to their teams
7575460 at this stage a few thousand devices have been distributed to selected customers who are aware of the forthcoming software upgrade
7575461 on monday last week telstra became the first australian carrier to start distributing the blackberry bold to selected business customers as part of an early seeding program
7575462 all the services our customers are used to on their blackberry such as email phone and web browsing are performing well
7575463 the blackberry bold has not experienced any issues with bugs at all all four local carriers will be launching the product telstra and optus both currently have the product available in the marketplace
7575464 its very common for different carriers and networks to have specific requirements for software handset manufacturers then tailor software specifically for a network or a carrier
7575465 il y a un accord entre les deux parties pour quil ny ait plus aucun soldat tranger en irak apr s 2011

7575468 nous avons enregistr des grands progr s dans la n gociation de laccord toutefois il existe encore des d saccords fondamentaux sur certains points entre les deux parties
7575469 gouvernement ne fera rien en cachette les termes de laccord seront connus de tous et le texte sera soumis au parlement
7575470 notre d marche se fera dans la transparence tout doit tre clair pour le peuple et nous nabuserons pas de sa confiance

7575473 actuellement le gouvernement irakien et le parlement ne sont pas pr ts pour un tel accord qui va se heurter de nombreux obstacles
7575474 le vere favole sono sempre storte zoppicanti e rugose e chi ce le racconta non sa quasi mai dove ci vuole portare forse sono le storie a possedere noi e non il contrario
7575475 cerebral blood flow response to flavanol rich cocoa in healthy elderly humans
7575476 our study found that the fires in wtc 7 which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings caused an extraordinary event
7575477 video and photographic evidence combined with detailed computer simulations show that neither explosives nor fuel oil fires played a role in the collapse of wtc 7
7575478 we conducted the study without bias without interference from anyone we have only one single minded goal in this effort the public should really recognize the science is really behind what we have said
7575479 glad thats over now i can go back to sleep after i drink my kool aid they must think we are a bunch of freaking idiots
7575480 so the government is now able to change the laws of physics to cover its own ass
7575481 nist a once reputable scientific center has created a scenario unsupported by the physical evidence and history of building collapses the bush administration tarnishes another once great government agency over my career in the aerospace industry i had the opportunity of working with nist scientists such times were rich and professional experiences unfortunate occurrence
7575482 the government goes to some non white scientist when it wants to make sure the scientist says what it wants fbi has hired muslims as its top scientists
7575483 there were probably thermite charges planted in the wtc buildings as well but according to mr
7575484 lying assholes the only steel framed building in the world to fall in its own foot print no fucking way assholes 911 was an inside job
7575485 the israeli mossad demo experts took care of it thats why the mossad agents in the white van were there to record it
7575486 uh oh this is bad news for anyone working in high rise buildings beware if you building catches fire it will fall down in less than 10 seconds groundbreaking new info from the george bush science team
7575487 dr sunder and his group of patsies should have their professional credentials cancelled for gross negligence or misfeasance
7575488 i mean what secret rumsfeld admits the pennsylvania plane was shot down he even admitted that the pentagon was hit with a missile silverstein admits they pulled the building there is no secret just a complicit press and government
7575489 the govt should be embarassed at the ridiculous cover up they are trying to pull
7575490 the same people who took down wtc 7 totally control the internet nothing gets blogged or posted without their consent the messages you never know about are the ones you must consider youll probably never see this one unless they get lazy wake up and see the obvious just ask anyone dont be cheneys tool
7575491 the building was loaded with explosives watch the frikkin video closely and trust your own eyes
7575492 jfk and governor connelly were both shot by the same 6 5mm bullet which passed right through both their bodies and the car seat if i recall before being found almost undamaged on connellys ambulance gurney an incredible coincidence flight 800 was brought down by a spark that occurred in the center fuel tank of the 747 something that had never happened before and has never happened since despite literally millions of 747 flight hours over about 40 years dozens of witnesses who saw a missile fly from the sea upward that ended in a white flash high explosives not the yellow flash of a fuel explosion must have been mistaken an incredible coincidence wtc building 7 is brought down by limited structural damage and in a new theory that structural beams which were buried in feet of concrete and swathed in asbestos expanded and failed due to office fires although this has never happened before in thousands of fires in steel framed high rises an incredible coincidence
7575493 hopefully this thorough report puts to rest the various 9 11 conspiracy theories which dishonor the men and women who lost their lives on that terrible day
7575494 i dont expect you to believe the scientific explanation of evolution i do expect you to understand it
7575495 theres a difference beween thinking something is interesting and believing it
7575496 is at best a conversation stopper and at worst the origins of much of the suffering that humans wreak on one another
7575497 wider with more volume and slightly softer plan shape curves this creates great paddling qualities plus the ability to run across flat sections it also enhances the boards drive out of your turns and down the line speed and tube riding momentum the idea is to retain the maneuverability of the modern design yet maintain the boards superior paddling qualities
7575498 if he went back onto field he was only going to let someone down
7575499 we didnt expect to see him back after halftime he was going to fill a hole but to send him out there half busted when really the game wasnt on the line would have been an unintelligent thing to do as a coach
7575500 to suggest the guy wasnt going to go back on the field because he was feigning injury is taking it just a tad too far
7575501 my reaction is thats all crap theres a lot of good teams in this competition
7575502 we just need to get about our business and if we start believing in that well we aint going to be doing what we need to do
7575503 we factored in criteria like low sat scores incompetent professors rock bottom admissions standards unbridled alcohol and drug consumption rampant criminal activity and dubious alumni
7575504 its important for students to know or be mindful of the cost majors available how soon are their students getting jobs and also if its a right fit for the student
7575505 if they come from a small private school and they come to a large institution or vice versa then it might not be the best thing for the student
7575506 it wouldnt effect my decision to where i was going
7575507 future freshmen will ignore our findings at peril unless they actually want to spend four years being accosted by moonies enduring humiliating hazings or drinking to the point of brain damage
7575508 the gallery was the best way to set up that foundation
7575509 much in the same way that every person has their own beliefs and meanings in their life each and every person should see these things in a different light
7575510 maybe its not where an athletes from that makes us root for them maybe its not the flag on their back or the anthem that we hear when they win that makes us cheer maybe its simply that they are human and we are human and when they succeed we succeed
7575511 you know they have been giving me female hormones for that right
7575512 you know what female hormones do to a guy dont you
7575513 if there was a large active shooter event on campus we would rely on all of those agencies to assist us just like they would rely on us to assist them in an event
7575514 fullerton fire would come into play in the case of mass triage fire would need multiple paramedic units multiple ambulances a possible medevac situation and its just a good drill for them to go through also
7575515 our department is very fortunate because we know your campus very well
7575516 furthermore the learning curve will mostly be with the csuf population who will be assessing how well we can work together on the matter
7575517 to put it the drill on campus especially in the library that has a lot of history kinda brings it all home
7575518 i believe this drill is still in its infancy a
7575519 the organization here helped reach out to the community last semester through attending county meetings helping out with the county board for young democrats some of our students are even working on the obama campaign
7575520 committed to keeping our nation safe and expanding opportunity for every american that commitment is reflected in an agenda that emphasizes the security of our nation strong economic growth affordable health care for all americans retirement security honest government and civil rights
7575521 im very aggressively wanting to do this i have high hopes and ive been chatting with the college republicans trying to organize joint events
7575522 college democrats will be hosting all sorts of watch parties youth panels and other events throughout the democratic national convention in denver
7575523 we are outsourcing elements of customer care to reduce costs and improve customer service levels
7575524 most of the customer care call function will be outsourced well still have people internally to handle calls that the outsourcer cant deal with
7575525 we have been progressively moving calls to the outsourcer over time so the number of staff has come down compared with what it was six months ago
7575526 we count every penny in our space and in this industry you obviously have to
7575527 we can build a different product with different features a different look and feel for different players
7575528 the product we supply to telstra doesnt have voice whereas the product we provide to another operator may have voice and fax features onboard
7575529 if we put the choice in front of delegates here and voters all across this country whos going to help rebuild this economy and put your family back to work whos going keep your family safe at night whos going to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
7575530 the best person to do those things isnt john mccain its barack obama
7575531 hillary clintons worked with both of these guys and shes come to the same conclusion barack obama is her guy
7575532 we feel confident that if we can demonstrate a record of change a record of vision a team of barack obama and joe biden can convince democrats republicans and independents to support a ticket of change in november

7575545 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7575546 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself were we all there shed ask softly
7575547 watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof from the fateful day of our lunch tell tale signs that something wasnt quite right began to emerge

7575554 its terrible that this has happened and i think its due to neglect you shouldnt have guns around young children
7575555 the police have been to question all the neighbours i saw the ambulance arrive and that was the first i heard about it i saw the family quite often and they are quite quiet the rumour is that it was the little girl one of his sisters who pulled the trigger by accident
7575556 there are four people who live there and theyve got two or three of kids
7575557 yesterday afternoon i saw the man next door doing target practice against some kind of shooting board in his back garden with an air rifle
7575558 i asked him if he was with a club and he said he was i have to admit i wasnt very happy at this going on next door to me because it made a loud clacking noise and i dont like having guns so nearby
7575559 they are a nice family and are no trouble to anyone at all the little boy who was shot was a lovely boy
7575560 the family are very upset but it was a complete accident they dont want to talk to anyone
7575561 we were called to an address in washwood heath in birmingham at around 6 40pm last night following reports of a child having been shot he had suffered a serious head injury
7575562 we sent an ambulance two rapid response vehicles an incident support officer and west midlands care team emergency doctors to take the child to birmingham childrens hospital
7575563 we were arrested and taken to a university for questioning we were held for nearly 24 hours without any sleep and having interrogation of up to about eight hours then we were moved to a detention centre and before we were allowed any sleep we had another 12 hours of interrogation
7575564 the guys i was with were given the reason that it was illegal to undertake even a peaceful protest and to talk about the situation in tibet
7575565 they seemed to have decided to really clamp down on protesters
7575566 she has an absolute commitment to the cause and even though i wouldnt like to say that china has listened only time will tell if they have
7575567 its terrible that this has happened and i think its due to neglect you shouldnt have guns around young children

7575580 i f we cant even get other women to stop describing serious women and serious events with a vocabulary that can only diminish and mock us how will we ever get the likes of chris matthews tucker carlson or the whole team at fox news to stop referring to us as bitchy and castrating
7575581 a media blog featuring news links and progressive media criticism from around the web along with commentary from eric boehlert and jamison foser
7575582 i may have to do that just based on what we did out there its not about disappointment its about doing whats right and its not about throwing them back out there and putting pads on and scrimmaging for two hours because we did what we did but its a matter of developing just a drive maybe just to go back out there and get back some tempo before we have to get into the season
7575583 he definitely wont play this thursday well be cautious if we have the choice of one game or 15 games well take the 15
7575584 we had to have good protection so our quarterbacks could hone in and really focus in on tight man coverage and we didnt do that the first four passes that jason threw he had somebody walked back into him or he had somebody in his face its very difficult to play quarterback from that position

7575587 the constitution forbids government officials to meddle in religious matters
7575588 decisions about religion are up to parents not school board members
7575589 if parents want their children to have a bible they are perfectly free to go out and buy one
7575590 in the cafeteria students who choose to take bibles and those who choose not to will be visible to much if not all of the student community a prospect made more likely given the schools small size 427 students
7575591 any child visibly ignoring the availability of the bibles or returning to class empty handed will stand out to his peers and thus feel pressured to take a bible
7575592 to encourage the children to accept christ as their personal savior

7575596 if you talk to warren buffet hell tell you his preference is not to meddle in the economy at all let the market work however way its going to work and then just tax the heck out of people at the end and just redistribute it
7575597 that way youre not impeding efficiency and youre achieving equity on the back end

7575641 stadiums and playing fields were destroyed and good coaches left the system all the young women and men who would have come into sport we lost that generation were feeling that now
7575642 a total of 25 individual gold medals were won by athletes who are making their olympic debuts and they were also the main force for four gold medals in team events
7575643 la seguridad en todos los mbitos tiene que ser una prioridad para el gobierno
7575644 sospechamos que los presupuestos generales del estado se har n en el comit federal del psoe y no en el parlamento

7575649 sospechamos que los presupuestos se har n en el comit federal del psoe y no en las cortes generales
7575650 no apuntan a unos presupuestos pensados en el bien general de espa a

7575658 i am happy that aids related deaths have decreased by over 75 percent over the last four years in comparison with the aids related deaths we had in 2003 2004 because of increased free treatment
7575659 this represents a 67 percent survival rate but we still need to do more because those who did not make it may have died because they started the treatment late or did not have access to proper nutrition
7575660 we consider this one of our most successful olympic games ever
7575661 the team will surpass the total medal count in athens but that doesnt tell the whole story we earned medals and high finishes in sports and disciplines we did not think we could do a few short years ago

7575666 nato should abandon its anachronistic posture the defense of allied territory against direct attack to make a great leap forward and adopt peace keeping outside nato territory as a formal alliance mission
7575667 on more than one occasion been brought back in my mind to classes i took with dr bennett
7575668 on the threshold of the new world order a rebirth for the united nations
7575669 collective security today must encompass not only the security of nations
7575670 but also mankinds security in a global environment that has proven vulnerable to debilitating changes wrought by mans own endeavors
7575671 thus in setting an american agenda for a new world order we must begin with a profound alteration in traditional thought
7575672 administration if not absent has been little more than an onlooker
7575673 foster the conditions and institutions necessary for a free economy and a free body politic to thrive
7575674 we should seek a steady mutual draw down to a ceiling of no more than 500 warheads per side
7575675 we should cut the gordian knot of difficult dismantlement by acting immediately to sequester all warheads to be eliminated
7575676 must be able to use force to stop rogue nations like north korea
7575677 nato should abandon its anachronistic posture the defense of allied territory against direct attack to make a great leap forward and adopt peace keeping outside nato territory as a formal alliance mission
7575678 the president has opposed every congressional effort to impose serious sanctions or even link trade to more reasonable chinese policies on human rights and the sale of dangerously destabilizing arms
7575679 no one can expect that trade sanctions against beijing would yield a sudden transformation of that regime but american foreign policy should leave no doubt and the bush administration has left much doubt that the united states stands squarely on the side of chinas brave and aspiring democrats to whom power will ultimately flow
7575680 for the united states it should become a paramount priority to promote american environmental technologies and services around the world
7575681 we do not despite what the president or anyone else may say have to choose between jobs and the environment
7575682 the more immediate goal of the rally is to continue the momentum of the campaign over the last year and a half
7575683 i see it as my responsibility to not let that die
7575684 theres a lot of frustration out there and i think were tapping that
7575685 my whole goal is to get liberty oriented people together
7575686 pretty much create a change in washington it makes me feel like im doing something
7575687 if im not at work im working on these issues
7575688 politically i believe the united states is at a turning point
7575689 the american people are showing significant interest in this people are recognizing this movement is not a lunatic or fringe movement
7575690 it was very tough on me personally and for the family
7575691 if it continues to move along the way it is it may be a historic event
7575692 es war zu erwarten dass die leipziger messe mit ihrer terminank ndigung den versuch unternimmt das thema auch 2009 im programm zu halten sie werden dies dann aber weitgehend ohne die branche tun m ssen die leitmesse findet 2009 und dar ber hinaus in k ln statt

7575695 i think college kids today would appreciate a place like this
7575696 i wanted to assure them that we accomplished our goal
7575697 i really think this area needed a change of pace
7575698 there were a lot of fights at the off campus pub
7575699 you dont have guys hitting you on the ass which used to happen at the off campus pub
7575700 before at the off campus pub i was afraid to talk to some people now i just socialize with everyone
7575701 titan bowl and billiards is a place for students to relieve stress relax and have fun with their friends when they want to take a break from their studies
7575702 its a good place for people who want to have fun or for enthusiasts who want to work on their game but be careful you can spend a lot more time down here than you would think
7575703 we allow one free group event for registered clubs or groups on campus
7575704 please respect the intent of this space by refraining from eating sleeping using personal computers or other such activities
7575705 any student can come in here and use the equipment for projects
7575706 we are the place on campus if you want to get involved in social justice community or service learning
7575707 we provide volunteer opportunities from environmental conservation and restoration to working with children teaching literacy and promoting blood drives
7575708 this is also a good place for students who volunteered in high school and want to continue to volunteer in college
7575709 as an intern i thought id get all the dirt jobs
7575710 but i wasnt treated that way at all people asked for my input and i was treated with respect at all times
7575711 the program provides students with contacts that can help with future career goals impressive work experience for a resume and a valuable cultural experience of living in an entirely different part of the country and in a fully professional setting
7575712 students often say the experience of living there is as valuable as what they learn in their internship offices
7575713 with taking some of the political sciences courses in college its hard not to get jaded
7575714 you see that people are affected so much but sometimes people dont make the smartest decisions
7575715 i realized how important democracy is as well as how important it is for everyone to have a voice
7575716 we all have different experiences and these experiences can be applied usefully to government
7575717 students who participate get an exposure to the inside world of washington d c
7575718 they get a chance to see what it feels like to walk the streets of the nations capital to be immersed in that inside the beltway culture
7575719 an alarm bell went off in my head when i realized i am about to graduate college and ive lived in california for most of my life
7575720 i need to go outside of my comfort zone and actually see how politics work at the most basic level
7575721 after my experience in d c i found out how important a constituents concern is to a politician
7575722 we answered every single letter and phone call a lot of people may think politicians dont care for them and they really do from what i saw constituents mean the world to the senators
7575723 i had a crisis of confidence when i was in d c
7575724 everyone else came from either an ivy league school or uc berkeley or ucla and it really doesnt do much for your confidence if you think about it
7575725 there was a chance we got to sit down and have lunch with sen feinstein and i said something not too intelligent
7575726 we got to ask questions and i asked her what she would have done if she would not have become a senator
7575727 there was a rhodes scholar in front of me who asked a really awesome question and feinstein said peter her chief of staff you should write that down we should look that up
7575728 i got to sing the star spangled banner and she was very complimentary
7575729 she always took time to say hello to us in the office in and in the hallways
7575730 she really seemed to care about the interns welfare she would help out anyone who needed her
7575731 i felt like i had an out of body experience
7575732 the senate and house of representatives are in similar rhythm in terms of how things work
7575733 so i think i will be a lot more prepared this time before the internship
7575734 i am not sure if i will be a teacher or professor but i want to somehow inform people
7575735 nabila is really good at taking what shes been taught in class as a beginning rather than an endpoint in her intellectual process using her newfound knowledge to reinterpret her world in new ways
7575736 silver star is our long term solution to the gang problems on the central coast we must have firm enforcement to keep our communities safe now but unless we pair that with serious prevention efforts we will never be tackling the root of the problem
7575737 like any education or health initiative we have to set children on the right path at an early age silver star aims to do just that through all of its programs and dedicated staff they do a great job and are worthy of praise
7575738 due to the difficult fiscal times we are facing this funding is vital to continue the services for our youth and families
7575739 we owe a debt of gratitude to congressman farr for his continuing support of these critical programs
7575740 silver star is exactly the kind of local project that federal dollars should support

7575753 i have been fortunate to have been involved in many olympics
7575754 beyond the competitive drama every olympics provides a snapshot of a city and a country at a point and time this one was more compelling than most since chinas rise and its ongoing transformation is the global story not only of the moment but likely of the foreseeable future
7575755 no advanced degree in international relations is required to appreciate the genuine warmth of the chinese people the honest pride in their country and how seriously chinese citizens from famous olympians to everyday men and women took this chance to show themselves to the world
7575756 it was clear what was at issue here from the outset the very first drumbeats at the opening ceremony on aug 8 serving notice of chinas arrival among the front ranks of the nations of the world a station chinese athletes emphatically underscored over the next two weeks their performance topping the gold medal chart with 51
7575757 successive editions of the olympics are sure to be measured
7575758 the venues were first rate several architectural marvels the buses ran on time pollution related concerns ultimately played no part in the sports schedule
7575759 the striking success of the olympics on burnishing chinas prestige as the world admired its sporting prowess organizational skills and dramatically modern urban landscapes could encourage profound changes in the country
7575760 the thousands of blue shirted volunteers could not have been more friendly polite and welcoming even when as was frequently the case the language barrier proved formidable
7575761 have a computer problem three volunteers descended in five minutes to solve it arrive at a venue without an umbrella on a rainy day volunteers requested you wait on the bus until they found one
7575762 i smiled then turned to look around the gym there was no one in the place but us there had probably been no one else in the place since 2 a m

7575772 when an lgu has lots of resources it is easier to accomplish a lot for example the hall of fame awardee antipolo city has an annual budget of over 1 billion pesos of course bad leadership can waste such resources due to wrong priorities or corruption
7575773 i think as the nominee of the democratic party barack obama is obligated to do everything that he can possibly do that is honest and ethical to win that seat
7575774 now what he talked about in terms of a different kind of politics i hope that after he wins he will attempt to have that kind of administration but this is an election and the obligation he has i think to the country is to fight as hard as he can fight
7575775 with biden obama also took mccains age off the table
7575776 the choice of biden was a hard headed cold blooded calculation that he may need a biden to win and will certainly benefit from a biden in governing if he become president it was the action of a politician not a crusader
7575777 his gifts as a campaigner his personality and his natural talents have set him apart from other politicians

7575832 it is not about waiting for the new hospital it is past critical point now
7575833 we need at least 10 more icu beds immediately with trained nurses
7575834 following discussions with the royal childrens hospital and monash medical centre we have been asked to convey to ceos the significant pressure that picu services are experiencing
7575835 as such your health service may be asked to care for a patient under 16 years of age in your adult intensive care unit
7575836 with an international shortage of pediatric icu nurses there are sometimes limits on the number of icu beds that can be safely opened
7575837 however the brumby government has significantly increased the states neonatal and pediatric icu capacity from 52 beds in 2000 to 72 beds in 2008
7575838 we are building a brand new 1 billion state of the art childrens hospital with the capacity to treat an extra 35 000 patients every year

7575849 he was a great man with tragic flaws who was persecuted by his own country
7575850 his long anticipated chess match with russias boris spassky was watched worldwide as if it were the super bowl except it was publicized as a cold war battle and drew a much bigger audience time out of mind the soviet chess dynasty had reigned
7575851 i have since subjected this problem to the most powerful chess computers and i am now convinced that duchamp has given us in effect a problem with no solution
7575852 he died helping to bring freedom and democracy to the iraqis
7575853 my son died to preserve unrestrained economic markets and rule by a corporate elite

7575860 many times documents are printed when they could really be dealt with in digital form
7575861 we can work with customers to show them how to build systems that actually reduce the volume of paper in their organisation
7575862 the savings that can be made in organisations is significant
7575863 youll never get rid of paper totally but through efficient planning you can reduce the volume
7575864 the same approach can work for things like letterhead documents and forms
7575865 printing these things as needed means that lots of pre printed sheets wont go out of date and have to be thrown away
7575866 it might sound counter intuitive coming from a printing company but the more you reduce physical output the more benefits you get in cost and reducing the environmental impact
7575867 its true that you can always refill or recycle cartridges but not having anything to recycle is even better
7575868 there is little doubt that placing the responsibility on manufacturers for the collection and cost of recycling e waste will give them a strong incentive to design products that are easier to de manufacture consume fewer materials and reduce harmful content

7575879 the united states should aspire to do as the communists do and invest in our infrastructure the way the chinese government has done in beijing
7575880 everybodys watching whats going on in beijing right now and the olympics think about the amount of money that china has spent on infrastructure their ports their train systems their airports are all vastly superior to us now which means if youre a corporation deciding where to do business youre starting to think beijing looks like a pretty good option

7575903 were way way behind in our infrastructure investment both in the private sector and publicly
7575904 and we need to move a lot on that or we will see other countries supplant us as they get greater investment in their infrastructure
7575905 throughout the 12 months of the crisis it is difficult to avoid the impression that the fed is too close to the financial markets and leading financial institutions and too responsive to their special pleadings to make the right decisions for the economy as a whole
7575906 if no countervailing actions are taken what would be perceived as an implicit expansion of the safety net could exacerbate the problem of too big to fail possibly resulting in excessive risk taking and yet greater systemic risk in the future
7575907 it creates a troubling perception when washington policymakers appear to be hitting the fast forward button when major institutions are on the line but are between the pause and the slow motion button when massive home foreclosures are on the line
7575908 market participants failed to soundly manage measure and disclose risks with ignorance greed or hubris playing their customary roles
7575909 the alarms of the financial sector have been overstated the real economy has slowed down but is not yet in severe difficulty
7575910 it headed off disaster the history of financial crises tells you the economy doesnt get sick the next week it takes a while

7575920 one of the surgeons said to me you would have to demonstrate that you would be prepared to be sterilized if you are serious about doing surgery
7575921 when i was at school i wanted to be a marine biologist
7575922 im the sort of person who if they want to make it
7575923 while i was there i decided i didnt want to go back to research i wanted to become a practicing doctor at first people were supportive and thought heres this really intelligent woman whos got an oxford degree and we could really use her as a general practitioner
7575924 and they started to treat me as if i had a psychiatric condition i was unable to get a job in the uk training as a basic intern so i had to travel to hong kong that was easier than doing battle with the men who were trying to discourage me from doing surgery
7575925 one of the surgeons in london said to me you would have to demonstrate that you would be prepared to be sterilized if you are serious about doing surgery its an all encompassing life you dont have time to go and do ridiculous things like taking care of babies
7575926 i got up and walked out of the room and said i didnt want to have to work for anyone who hadnt had to prove himself by having a vasectomy of course i got to the door and thought to myself what do i do if he says he has
7575927 he hadnt and i ended up working in hong kong
7575928 during the time i was there i met my husband he was developing his career as a urologist and he needed to be back in the uk for further training so he left and eventually i followed him back and very soon after that we got married and i had my first child
7575929 after returning from practicing in hong kong i still knew wanted to do surgery
7575930 im sure and i dont see any reason why i cant do it
7575931 people were saying are you sure you know youve got the baby as if its the sort of thing youd forget
7575932 my answer was yes im sure and i dont see any reason why i cant do it
7575933 up until that point everything had been very successful for me i had been a consultant for seven years and that was probably the most satisfying career point in my life things were going well
7575934 although i had experienced sexist behavior before the men i worked with there had never exhibited any sexist behavior to me whatsoever they were incredibly supportive and the whole of our department was more like a even look after our colleagues kids
7575935 right at that time the bbc were chasing after me for a documentary on women who had been successful in the nhs of four women i was chosen to represent hospital surgery and in hospital medicine
7575936 it was a pretty huge thing for the bbc but i was actually very naive i thought this documentary would be a one day wonder and that everybody would have forgotten about it by the time i got back to work i took a short break over the summer
7575937 that wasnt the case it was an amazingly successful documentary the people who did it won awards for it it was just incredible
7575938 i still get patients who will say to me i wrote your name down when i saw the documentary and ive kept it since then youre the only person i would have operating on me
7575939 during the time that i was away over the summer a new surgeon came in he was a good technical surgeon but he had a big problem with women
7575940 he made the whole of the rest of the department feel threatened by me which had never happened before we dont want to be in a unit that is only famous because it has women in it he would say
7575941 the whole unit which had been so friendly just disintegrated into an us and them there were people being pushed into one team or another
7575942 i just didnt see this huge change coming and i didnt take defensive action
7575943 suddenly one day i was called in and they started telling me that i was incompetent
7575944 they were so clever about it one of the junior doctors said i think it would be a good idea if all the consultants gave us a lecture on the things that they had learned from their own mistakes a very clever way to get me to be completely open about every one of my mistakes as a surgeon
7575945 over fourteen years every surgeon whos busy operating on a thousand cases per year has mistakes and i opened up about mine so that people could learn from them
7575946 instead they actually took detailed notes of these patients and put them together into a horrendous dossier which they then presented to the management
7575947 right at that time a nigerian trainee came to me since i was her women in surgery rep to tell me that one of the consultants had been blatantly racist against her she asked me what she should do
7575948 i told her that if she made an official racist complaint it would be very hard for her but i told her that if thats what she wanted to do i would stand fully behind her
7575949 the next day she came back with a written complaint and said lets go for it so i backed her
7575950 within ten days of that event i was suspended and accused of incompetence
7575951 it was very obvious to everybody who had been open minded and reasonable for the previous years that this was a way for the new regime to get rid of me because at that time i was very popular and quite famous from the bbc documentary and i was threatening their ability to have a private practice they hadnt yet actually established a loyal patient following
7575952 i spent nearly two years not working for the nhs they even messed up the way they suspended me the private hospital said unless youre suspended were quite happy for you to continue working for us
7575953 so i was actually in quite a bizarre situation all these inquiries were going on and people were trying to figure out if i was actually incompetent or not while all the private patients were still coming to see me
7575954 which of course made these men even more determined to get rid of me
7575955 eventually i got a lawyer and i took the case to a tribunal
7575956 there were people who had not been to see him in nine years suddenly turning up on the doorstep and saying oh its so lovely to have tea with you gerald
7575957 he told them that they obviously didnt know his wife
7575958 finally we went to the tribunal and after a long process we settled
7575959 what ive lost by having to leave at 50 was the opportunity to become a professor ive always had this idea that the pinnacle of my career would have been to be the first woman professor of plastic surgery in the uk but that wont happen now
7575960 at least ive had a much less stressful life by being in private practice rather than in the nhs for the last few years
7575961 i see them every day but i was just absolutely determined that no matter what was going on in my soul they would see me going down the corridor smiling at them and being polite and all those sorts of things it hurt them a lot that they havent managed to get rid of me
7575962 i still get junior doctors coming to me and saying weve been around for three or four years and youre the first person whos ever spoken to us in a positive way about continuing a career in surgery
7575963 ive done projects with my colleagues where weve gone into schools for example and we meet up with the girls who are applying to medical school
7575964 they seem to be put off at different stages they start off really determined to be surgeons but it seems the more and more men they talk to the less and less they want to be surgeons
7575965 youre the first person whos ever spoken to us in a positive way about continuing a career in surgery
7575966 it left me in some ways lacking confidence in some ways looking over my shoulder waiting for the next stab wound but i made an absolute decision at the beginning that i would not tolerate myself becoming bitter
7575967 so every time i caught myself being bitter i just made a decision to stop
7575968 i have tried to look at the positives that have come out of my rather unplanned career path and i tried to make it feel like a small part of life and the big issues like my husband and children were still the most important things in life
7575969 when i turned up for my surgeons exam seven months pregnant the first question i was asked was what makes you think you have the right to present yourself looking like that
7575970 i actually let the examiner upset me he was very aggressive and i became flustered i failed an exam which i shouldnt have failed
7575971 now i tell women that when they go for the exam the exam will be fair there wont be any bias against them theyve just got to be as good as everybody else theres no longer any prejudice against women in the exams partly because im an examiner and i simply wont tolerate it
7575972 what makes you think you have the right to present yourself looking like that
7575973 what we need is for those women to then go on to committees to help in planning the future of medicine to be able to prevent even more discrimination of women
7575974 we have to make surgical training something that is desirable and friendly towards women and theres a lot of work that needs to be done before it can just be regarded as the norm for women to be surgeons
7575975 in terms of something you can start doing today one of the reasons that i was able to take on the claims against me with confidence is that somewhere along the line somebody told me that the path would be hard for a woman especially a successful woman
7575976 so when people were accusing me of something like not being at work i could show that the reason i wasnt at work on monday was because i was representing the hospital interviewing junior doctors in the regional headquarters
7575977 so i would also give that advice to trainees just have a big diary and keep it forever write down that on tuesday morning you came into work at 8 oclock you did this this and this and you left at 9 oclock in the evening
7575978 it sounds a terrible thing to have to do but if youre in the habit of writing a little diary every day and just filing it away at the end of each year it can be very useful in non confrontational settings as well as settings in which it can be career saving
7575979 wenn wir damit gerechnet h tten dass wir solchen schaden damit hervorrufen w rden unsere lebensgemeinschaft legalisieren zu lassen h tten wir es so nicht gemacht vor allem wegen herrn kollas nicht
7575980 schwule sind keine katakomben christen die sich wie im r mischen reich verstecken m ssen und denen schilder umgeh ngt werden auf denen steht
7575981 wir bekommen viel zustimmung f r die entscheidung des bischofs
7575982 what makes u so unhappy i never see u say anything positive makes me sad for u
7575983 we werken hard maar door de vele verplichtingen van silvio wordt het misschien wel wat krap
7575984 after meeting with leon i now have much more of a plan
7575985 i think its quite right that the judge made the type of decision that he would make in any other case and that mr hutton shouldnt be prejudiced by his celebrity
7575986 team gb have provided us with just the most extraordinary platform
7575987 team gb have provided us with just the most extraordinary platform one we could not possibly imagine before we came here
7575988 its the opportunity to drive the project for us but take nothing from any of those guys whove performed i think way beyond what i think any of us were expecting
7575989 weve got our fingers crossed that things will improve but there is the recognition that there is still a long way to go yet
7575990 it looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7575991 this is just a transitory period of subdued growth and we will get through the other side and the growth will resume to more normal levels
7575992 i am waiting for a decision i fit all the criteria
7575993 i believe the government should compensate me for taking away my liberty for six years which also meant i lost the childhood of my daughters
7575994 want a leader whos judgment and experience they can trust
7575995 we want to make sure people know exactly who senator obama is and where he wants to take the country
7575996 hillary clinton was clearly in the democratic primaries the woman who the person who gathered the most votes 18 million of them was a great debater and a great campaigner
7575997 we want to make sure people know exactly who senator obama is and where he wants to take the country and two that voters know their choice in this election between barack obama who wants to fundamentally change the way business is done in washington and john mccain who is just more of the same of what we have had over the course of the last eight years
7575998 there are no words to describe it really the whole road loves them
7575999 das system ist 24 stunden am tag verf gbar und ist praktisch direkt nach eintreffen der akutpatienten einsetzbar
7576000 das ist besonders wichtig weil die wahrscheinlichkeit dass flimmerepisoden sich nach einem schlaganfall wiederholen erfahrungsgem auf der zeitachse abnimmt ich hoffe sehr dass sraclinic sich m glichst schnell als feste gr e auch im alltag anderer stroke units etablieren wird
7576001 wir freuen uns sehr schon so kurz nach der verf gbarkeit unseres sraclinic verfahrens bereits die ersten beiden kliniken als anwender gewonnen zu haben
7576002 beide einrichtungen geh ren jeweils zu einem verbund medizinischer betriebsst tten insofern haben die jetzt gemachten erfahrungen gerade im unmittelbaren umfeld der gruppen exemplarischen charakter mit dem potenzial des weiteren ausbaus zudem erproben schon viele weitere stroke units den einsatz unseres verfahrens und wir stehen mit etlichen anderen bereits im engen kontakt
7576003 wir haben nach der einf hrung von portolan fcm zun chst die abschl sse der jahre 2006 und 2007 testweise nachvollzogen und damit sehr schnell genau die gleichen ergebnisse erzielt wie zuvor auf dem sehr m hsamen umweg via exel
7576004 wir sind heute wesentlich effektiver weil wir insbesondere nicht mehr ber excel nur einseitig buchen sondern gleich direkt eine doppelte buchf hrung abbilden k nnen dar ber hinaus haben wir f r 2008 geplant berichte ber portolan fcm zu erstellen die wir f r unsere muttergesellschaft entwickeln auch hier versprechen wir uns eine h here effizienz im gesamten reporting prozess
7576005 mit dem konsolidierungsmodul ist es nun erstmalig m glich auch unterj hrig auf knopf druck bilanzen zu erstellen
7576006 aufgrund unseres laufend expandierenden unternehmens war es auch f r uns wichtig ohne gro en aufwand weitere gesellschaften und standorte hinzuf gen zu k nnen die gro e zeitersparnis und das erstellen von eigenen excel berichten mit dynamischer datenaufbereitung runden die vorz ge von portolan fcm ab
7576007 il y a un accord entre les deux parties pour quil ny ait plus aucun soldat tranger en irak apr s 2011
7576008 nous ne pouvons pas accepter un accord ne pr servant pas la souverainet de lirak et ses int r ts nationaux
7576009 les int r ts nationaux de letat nous commandent avoir un calendrier pr cis sur la fin de la pr sence militaire et nous naccepterons pas de signer un accord sans un tel calendrier
7576010 les op rations militaires se fassent avec laccord du gouvernement
7576011 nous avons enregistr des grands progr s dans la n gociation de laccord toutefois il existe encore des d saccords fondamentaux sur certains points entre les deux parties
7576012 gouvernement ne fera rien en cachette les termes de laccord seront connus de tous et le texte sera soumis au parlement
7576013 le travail des n gociateurs tait termin maintenant il se trouve entre les mains des dirigeants

7576016 the supercomputer center in wyoming is a long term project its going to be a year or more before theyre breaking ground
7576017 this immediate thing which is affecting the entire scientific community and government is hopefully a short term thing but it isnt impacting this project
7576018 it will illuminate what fountainbridges most famous former milkman thinks of many aspects of scottish culture and life including sport architecture and of course the gothic tendency in scots literature
7576019 we are bruces yankee army we are going to germany and were never gonna stop til the us lifts the cup cause the us is the greatest soccer team
7576020 your primary doctor is like your mother you dont change your mother
7576021 why work sucks and how to fix it no schedules no meetings no joke the simple change that can make your job terrific
7576022 but having said that the economic conditions probably masked any improvement we would have hoped to see at the gaming machine level
7576023 china was eager to present something that shows it is a new power that has its own might
7576024 it has problems but it is able to manage them it has weaknesses in its institutions but also strengths in those same institutions
7576025 the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world
7576026 i believe this is something that will have positive effects for the long term
7576027 they have earned a tremendous amount of face because of the olympics
7576028 they are going to ride on that for a while we dont have a culture that is pro change china by nature has got to be provoked to make changes the economic reforms came about because we were desperately poor
7576029 we are ready to take any decision up to halting relations altogether
7576030 nato russian relations will need to take fully into account the implications of russian military actions in georgia
7576031 however we believe it would be a mistake to suspend all nato russia contacts when they are so much needed
7576032 we have invited local agencies and employers to interact with veterans
7576033 the intent is that veterans can become aware of what is available to them locally and get assistance with career placement
7576034 i was told that when i failed out of that school in may that i would be at another unit by june so i figured i wouldnt have to go they would tell me if i had to go to their at
7576035 i got a church tore up and several vehicles over by the police department theres cars on top of other cars i need ambulance
7576036 were gonna try to have the concrete poured by the first two weeks of september if we can so were gonna go as fast as we possibly can
7576037 and how weve been able to stay together and maintain our unity and be able to encourage one another and have joy in the midst of tragedy
7576038 this community really pulled together since the storm and it shows the strength of this community everybody working together
7576039 were hoping well be ready to occupy by the first of december something like that
7576040 biden camp pressed hard for a slot on the ticket
7576041 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7576042 ive known john for 35 years he served our country with extraordinary courage
7576043 have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7576044 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well
7576045 like president bush sen mccain is presenting the american people with a false choice national security or civil liberties we need a president who understands that we can have both
7576046 help carry out obamas agenda of change in a broken washington
7576047 he wanted to see how the decision sat with him
7576048 after having a president for eight years who cant go beyond talking points its a good thing that biden can dig into the issues even if he occasionally goes overboard

7576050 i havent had one published yet but being rejected makes me feel young again
7576051 sonic tantra records presents dark noizez va a dark psytrance compilation for free
7576052 we print more are less conscientious about doing so and spend more time and money on reprinting documents seemingly lost in the piles of printed pages in print rooms or stowed away somewhere out of sight
7576053 however competitive pressures and the ever increasing complexity of operations are driving the need to streamline information organisation encompassing a range of processes and workflows
7576054 actively managing office printing can reduce spending by 10 per cent to 30 per cent while reaping environmental benefits
7576055 although most enterprises now recognise the problem few have the necessary information leadership funding and strategy to fully succeed
7576056 we need to find ways to integrate with these types of applications both to bring information into them and get it out again when needed
7576057 it is a matter of working closely with companies to understand how they work and then matching devices to those requirements remembering that requirements can vary from department to department and office to office
7576058 in the same way that you dont need to be a telecoms engineer to make a phone call we want to make it that simple to put data into applications and get it out
7576059 we can make it a one step process by using the touchscreen on an mfp
7576060 there is always going to be room for the printed page but we need to look at the whole challenge of managing information
7576061 its a matter of working with customers to ensure we provide them with the equipment they require
7576062 there are no words to describe it really the whole road loves them
7576063 weve got our fingers crossed that things will improve but there is the recognition that there is still a long way to go yet it looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7576064 this is just a transitory period of subdued growth and we will get through the other side and the growth will resume to more normal levels
7576065 our position remains open in terms of new roads being tolled but we wont be tolling existing roads for general motorists use
7576066 we have no intention of putting in place a london style congestion tax
7576067 the government sees no reason why that parking tax levy cant continue to operate
7576068 what he is talking about here is putting a toll on tradies putting a toll on commercial vehicles and people who commute to and from work on a daily basis
7576069 there is no doubt that this government has an agenda and they have an agenda to put tolls on existing roads and introduce a congestion tax across the metropolitan area
7576070 as we have repeatedly said we are not going to be ruling things in or out of the victorian transport plan
7576071 we believe waynes murder was an execution style murder in the form of what we would term a drug rip off
7576072 back in 2001 there was some pseudoephedrine stolen and it appears this particular ring had been able to gain some access to that pseudoephedrine and that was the precursor chemical wayne was trying to purchase it was a fairly sophisticated operation he was dealing with
7576073 we have laid charges which have been before the court in regards to the drug side of things but the murder investigation is still ongoing
7576074 i dont know why he wanted to get involved he was a typical family man a funny caring good father
7576075 this is like what happens in movies i dont know whether he was forced into it i dont know whether he did it of his own free will
7576076 they extinguished the fire and found him in his seat they got him out and tried to revive him
7576077 to a certain extent they are asking us to censor our work before we even present it
7576078 artists are getting scared of having their work policed to the extent it could have ramifications for their career
7576079 the discussion around artwork is just as important as the work itself
7576080 good art is trying to communicate an idea its not trying to sell it to you
7576081 what it does is give a clear direction to artists and management about what is acceptable and where it is acceptable
7576082 indonesia the worlds largest muslim country has traditionally tolerated minority religions
7576083 it was the only thing we could do we knew we were going to go for two
7576084 we had it we scored were going to go for it
7576085 definitely planning on working as much as i can all the way up through until the last minute
7576086 extremely optimistic about how long ill be able to stay
7576087 i love being there with the contestants i love seeing their progress
7576088 before she started to lose her hair she had everyone over for a hair cutting party and we sat in her kitchen and watched her get her head shaved it was a wake up call for all of us to take care of ourselves and get mammograms
7576089 money we raise will stay here and hopefully anyone diagnosed will be able to come to use for financial support if they need to buy a wig or medication or need help with travel expenses
7576090 many of us are alive today because of your heroism on the 4th
7576091 jacko we miss you love you and honor your service
7576092 james i hope your soul found your way out of this shithole you were always good to go so im sure it did
7576093 god wanted a special marine in heaven so he called you home that day
7576094 he has done so much for the fallen and for military families
7576095 it was one of the most difficult classes in high school and i enjoyed the challenge
7576096 i really doubt id be the one to do it but if i can be a part of it that would be cool
7576097 im not sure what she was doing but i saw the stuff there and it kind of registered
7576098 a lot of the other kids didnt enjoy it as much as the other classes because it was so much harder
7576099 i enjoy knowing things about chemistry its just one of the passions that i have
7576100 matthew is very special to me i cared for him for 5 1 2 years and i got attached to him
7576101 i knew his parents wouldnt be able to send him to disney world because of the expenses related to his disease
7576102 the kids wish network would send me advertisements with referral papers in them
7576103 we were thrilled and very excited for him to go
7576104 there were no worries for us when we got there
7576105 these kids have been through so much and this program lifts their spirits up
7576106 go back in the house whitey bitch or ill kill you
7576107 crows nest at bradley bourbonnais community high school kcc used to rotate its games between various local high schools at that time and while the scene changed frequently the smile on locks face stayed the same
7576108 whats he so happy about i recall thinking to myself at the time its now apparent andy lock adored his job and wasnt bashful about showing his affection for it he chose his profession instead of his profession choosing him and it remained a labor of love until the very end
7576109 the trend of agribusiness is a trend to provide more quality recreational events for the residents of the district
7576110 we utilized an outside company called the maize company to construct the maze
7576111 they came in june and they put corn around the design it took them less than a day to build
7576112 we drew the design on a grid system on a computer we then went out into the field and sprayed out the design with herbicide
7576113 a corn maze is a growing part of agriculture which brings people to a farm
7576114 this can be educational if farmers talk about how corn is grown the types of corn and what its used for
7576115 because of the economy people may want to stay close to home to have fun
7576116 we anticipate an increase in the amount of people going to farms and corn mazes
7576117 we plan for this to be a annual event if its supported and successful
7576118 digger dog the week in iphone apps sniff wi fi and gas up your gulfstream but not at the xbox 360 special edition sidekick lx shown off by soulja boy xbox 360 sidekick
7576119 the big boost to infrastructure announced today reflects last years strong economic performance
7576120 the economic challenges were facing this year mean i can safely predict i wont make this kind of announcement 12 months from now
7576121 wont be able to move as quickly as we thought we could
7576122 he should have been more keenly aware of the danger of the exploitive material he saw fit to enjoy
7576123 it is no small price to pay it will follow him after his jail term is over
7576124 the only thing they dont get is the fenian thing we speak their language are the same skin colour live in their council houses take their dole and still hate them
7576125 ive been coming to the fair since i was a wee girl and im 61 now
7576126 my father made it and his mother did before him
7576127 the children grow up making it and help out and thats how they learn it they each have a certain job to do theyll never tell whats in it
7576128 ive made plenty of friends coming here and the craic is good
7576129 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
7576130 it is unacceptable to think that any kind of comparison exists between the behavior of the us and the islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve their objective
7576131 is a reflection of increased sales of foreclosed homes at very low prices rather than a pick up in the regular private sales market but they all count
7576132 the rebound in existing home sales does not indicate the beginning of a recovery in the housing market as the level of excess supply continues to rise and sales prices keep falling suggesting that the downward adjustment in prices is not over
7576133 sales have picked up significantly in several florida and california markets home prices generally follow sales trends after a few months of lag time
7576134 inventory remains high in many parts of the country and will require time to fully absorb we expect more balanced conditions in 2009 and will eventually return to normal long term appreciation patterns
7576135 russia intends to inform various wto partners of its withdrawal from accords that contradict its interests
7576136 it turns out that we dont see or feel any pluses from membership and if there are some we still carry a burden
7576137 we need to get things clear with our partners we need to think most seriously about protecting our manufacturers
7576138 this doesnt mean we should renounce our strategic course towards the wto but there should be some clarifications on this question elementary fairness should prevail
7576139 ive sent a letter to mamata banerjee asking her to end the protests and i hope we will be able to resolve the issue through talks
7576140 our door is open for discussion but the government must return the land
7576141 this is the first match of the final round and it is very important i chose these 20 players who are able to fight in hot weather and understand the concept of the team very well
7576142 im going to pick up a few more players after the j league matches this week hopefully we can win this important match
7576143 were not thinking about the previous results first off its important to win the first match in order to go to the world cup we must do our very best and we must win
7576144 i well understand the devout muslims reaction wounded by what they hold most dear and would themselves die for
7576145 there is only one person around here who is in any danger of dying
7576146 whether your faith is that there is a god or that there is not a god if you dont have any doubts you are either kidding yourself or asleep doubts are the ants in the pants of faith they keep it awake and moving
7576147 there i was on this mans arm and everyone was talking around me as i if i wasnt there
7576148 im a devout vegetarian but i enjoy a good steak
7576149 im not a bigot but i really cant stand those black or brown or yellow etc folks
7576150 dont worry boss they cant do nothin til theyre through sparklin
7576151 dont worry boss they cant do nothin til theyre through sparklin
7576152 we are first and foremost an educational institution that values integritity honesty and treating others with fairness and respect
7576153 tom we like to buy we dont like to sell
7576154 it is harder to sell than it is to buy
7576155 we sell when the stock reaches our price target or is fully valued
7576156 we sell if there is deterioration in the companys financial position or earnings growth slows or competitive conditions change
7576157 we sell if our thesis for owning the stock has changed
7576158 it was the only thing we could do we knew we were going to go for two
7576159 we had it we scored were going to go for it
7576160 it will be helpful for all concerned if burke is too busy at the vatican to enter the fray
7576161 leader of a faction in the u s conference of catholic bishops that believes catholic voters should judge political candidates primarily by their views on abortion
7576162 has been savaged by conservative catholics for refusing to bar pro choice catholics such as u s sen john kerry and house speaker nancy pelosi from the communion rail
7576163 if we have a public figure who is openly and deliberately upholding abortion rights and receiving the eucharist what will the average person think
7576164 he or she could come to believe that up to a certain point it is okay to do away with an innocent life in the mothers womb
7576165 is not with the intention of interfering in public life but rather in the spiritual state of the politician or public official who if catholic should follow the divine law in the public sphere as well therefore it is simply ridiculous and wrong to try to silence a pastor accusing him of interfering in politics so that he cannot do good to the soul of a member of his flock
7576166 it was the only thing we could do we knew we were going to go for two
7576167 we had it we scored were going to go for it
7576168 human culture as we have known it for the past 200 years is drawing to a close a revolution of civilization is upon us prepare
7576169 the most significant characteristic of modern civilization is the sacrifice of the future for the present and all the power of science has been prostituted to this purpose
7576170 nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could only do a little
7576171 i was a pow i was a pow i was a pow i was a pow
7576172 we have the dubious distinction of having had our headlines dominated by allegations and convictions related to pay to play politics for years now
7576173 we can put an end to that practice or even perceptions of that practice with the signature of one man
7576174 as we stated all along we do want to pass real ethics reform in the state of illinois
7576175 theres no way to improve this bill this governor needs to sign it as is
7576176 ive got a lot of other senators on my side to help me put pressure on the senate president to call it
7576177 pay to play politics is alive and well in illinois
7576178 theres a distrust or a cynicism in the public about state government and how its operated
7576179 theres the idea that its all based on clout and patronage and who you know and that the system exists to enrich the folks who are connected at the expense of everybody else
7576180 low and behold close analysis shows that a lot of those donors also wind up getting something from the state and so its not surprising that the public has its suspicions about this
7576181 the current funding for sport is partly driven by lottery and gaming revenue which is also used to fund essential services like hospitals schools police and transport
7576182 however were always happy to consider any sensible ideas from sport administrators to better direct money to both junior and elite sports development without starving our hospitals schools and police of critical funds
7576183 i dont accept the view put forward by critics of our olympians who produced outstanding results and were cheered day and night
7576184 as for the brief burst of english pride they should remember that when you compare our populations we once again proved australia fights well above its weight in sport and beat them hands down
7576185 weve told police its you how do you feel about that
7576186 id been involved in a sexual encounter with a patient and that was crossing an ethical boundary
7576187 top 10 who are changing the world of internet and politics
7576188 at first i liked going home by myself but after a while i started to feel scared about going in the house alone
7576189 my mum did not know why i was taking so long to walk home i did not want to worry her because she has to work
7576190 to rahma i really miss you and so does my family rahma the first day you got lost all my family were crying and never stopped
7576191 we really want you back nice and safe at our home but we dont know where you are
7576192 the last time i saw you we were having so much fun i remember we had to go to sleep because we had school in the morning you werent there
7576193 always from the time she was missing they wake up in the night time and cry the old one she screams and cries
7576194 i need them to give me back my daughter i love all my children but i love rahma more than my other children not because she is rahma but because she is missing
7576195 i never knew there were foot fetishists until someone at a convention asked to take a picture of my feet

7576202 believes there would be a lot of power in a clinton bush mccain economic contrast and might mention that a bit anyway

7576212 jenkins plays incredulous well in this clip asking over and over again why the protesters dont believe in freedom of speech the irony of ironies considering these protesters are exercising their first amendment rights with every step they take
7576213 because there is so much uncertainty around the markets financial markets capital markets equity markets people dont really know what to think and when one is confused people dont want to make major decisions
7576214 potentially industrial and retail sectors may correct more than the commercial office sectors which tends to be more resilient the downside tends to be less in those areas
7576215 at the moment it is holding up quite well and that is due to the fact that there is a much bigger domestic market in asia pacific than in previous slowdowns and also because there is much more wealth in asia pacific than historically
7576216 although vietnam has its own set of problems if you look beyond the immediate future it has a huge population it has one of the longest coastlines in asia so again there are opportunities there

7576235 this is something that matters a lot to the palestinians it matters a lot to the palestinian people and it is obviously a sign of good will
7576236 on both sides the israelis and the palestinians have work to do

7576246 ive been a victim my son was killed and he should be alive i also believe that george bush and dick chaney should be tried for murder and crimes against humanity but i think that unless we have a policy that is more into reconciliation and rehabilitation and less into punishment then our system is not going to change

7576260 democrats will make immigration reform a prominent discussion at their convention in denver hoping to capitalize on anger that many hispanic voters feel toward gop support of strict curbs on immigration democrats believe that hispanic voters will play a pivotal role in battleground states such as colorado florida nevada and new mexico which president bush won in 2004 in part because of a stronger than expected performance among hispanic voters
7576261 many hispanic and immigrant advocacy groups supported immigration reform legislation that democrats led by sen ted kennedy mass pushed in the 109th congress conservative republicans used the power of the filibuster to defeat the bipartisan proposal which would have created a path to citizenship for an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants
7576262 libertarian presidential candidate bob barr is the only candidate still in the race for the white house in 2008 that truly understands the issue of immigration while the other two candidates insist on blowing smoke up the collective skirts of the american people barrs unique grasp of this essential national security issue should put his candidacy at the forefront of american politics barr understands that the borders need to be protected but he also accurately pinpoints the availability of social services as one of the main driving forces behind the illegal immigration problem
7576263 we need our borders secured and our immigration laws enforced we dont need more regulation but we do need the regulations that we currently have in place applied
7576264 new jersey towns that have drafted the rentals ordinances include riverside freehold bound brook and middletown the laws which have been rescinded or struck down in most cases typically call for fining landlords about 1 000 in june a national group that favors strict immigration laws sued a plainfield property management company claiming it encourages illegal immigration by renting to a large number of undocumented immigrants the suit by the immigration reform law institute a legal arm of the washington d c based federation for american immigration reform has attracted nationwide note by citing the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico rico is normally used to prosecute organized crime or large scale immigration violations such as human smuggling
7576265 a clampdown of major state thoroughfares u s highways 77 and 59 for example increasingly push smugglers to ranch land and county roads in response last year texas created operation border star an intense multi agency effort that attacks crime in targeted regions affected by the dangerous spillovers

7576270 the frequency of these images and references dont make any sense unless youre trying to send the message that obama could be the antichrist
7576271 if they wanted to be funny if they really wanted to play up the idea that obama thinks hes the second coming there were better ways to do it
7576272 why use these awkward lines like and the world will receive his blessings
7576273 obama is correct in saying that the world is ready for someone like him a messiah like figure charismatic and glib the bible calls that leader the antichrist and it seems apparent that the world is now ready to make his acquaintance

7576282 the field of cardiovascular genetics is exploding with exponential increases in scientific investigations and manuscripts
7576283 these rapid advances bring with them the urgent need for continuous education of cardiologists scientists and practitioners the pages of circulation cardiovascular genetics will constitute a premier forum for scientific debate where experts can weigh in on issues that challenge the field
7576284 as such it represents the one stop journal to both publish findings and read the literature that is specifically of interest to cardiologists and scientists with a focus on cardiovascular medicine
7576285 circulation cardiovascular genetics represents the sixth member of the circulation portfolio of cardiovascular subspecialty journals
7576286 this new journal will serve as a venue for publishing highly relevant studies in the rapidly expanding fields of cardiovascular genetics genomics proteomics and metabolomics under the able leadership of dr ramachandran vasan as editor the journal will emphasize the growing importance of these new scientific disciplines in defining cardiovascular risk prognosis and therapeutic response and in laying the groundwork for the evolution of the field of personalized cardiovascular medicine
7576287 as high priority manuscripts seek a home in the leading journals in the field we expect that our journal will become one of the pre eminent publications for cardiovascular scientists

7576292 from societys perspective covering the uninsured is still a good investment failure to act in the near term will only make it more expensive to cover the uninsured in the future while adding to the amount of lost productivity from not insuring all americans
7576293 the uninsured receive a lot less care than the insured and they pay a greater percentage of it out of pocket contrary to popular myth they are not all free riders
7576294 adding the cost of the additional care to current spending by or for the uninsured total medical care costs for newly insured people will be about 208 6 billion roughly 3 800 per full year equivalent newly insured person consisting of 122 6 billion in new spending on top of the 86 billion already in the system

7576309 on the pc side weve done as many as four updates in a day and thats great we can respond very quickly
7576310 or we can do the pyro updates and the medic updates and so on on the consoles they want us to charge money for them because thats in their model and our model is very much more to grow the community by giving out free updates thats harder for us and then on the consoles they have pretty lengthy certification periods and were pretty happy that our customers think that we do a good job on the quality side of updates and we dont need someone looking over our shoulder checking to make sure that were not going to screw our customers with a bad update
7576311 we expect mnb the central bank to reduce rates this year a view which the market is already beginning to discount
7576312 while we still foresee some risks that mnb could be forced to hike rates one last time we only think this might occur if the forint weakens significantly

7576343 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7576344 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7576345 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7576346 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7576347 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

7576353 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7576354 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7576355 we are here today to say that any cuts to health care are unacceptable
7576356 the state cannot balance the budget on the backs of the millions of californians who rely on public programs for their health care as doctors we see the human cost that these decisions can have on the lives of our patients they come to us sicker or with advanced conditions which could have been prevented with regular care this is tragic and avoidable
7576357 it s time for our elected state leaders to recognize what the federal court did earlier in the week that california s healthcare system can t afford any additional cuts additional cuts will only cause irreparable harm that will be felt by millions of californians
7576358 our health care system serves all californians but that system is on financial life support
7576359 it has already been cut to the bone and simply cannot withstand additional budget cuts
7576360 we call on the governor and legislators to hold the line on additional cuts to our already overburdened health care system to identify permanent revenue solutions that will keep our health care system adequately funded and to reject any mechanism that would force future automatic cuts to health care

7576375 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june
7576376 okay so if housing is going to drag for another 18 months then berkshires results will also so one would then expect lower comp earnings and hence a lower share price financials institutions like american express axp wells fargo wfc bank of america bac usb usb m amp t bank mtb make up about 30 40 of berkshire equity portfolio it varies based on valuations the argument can be made that these are the class of the financials and that may be true but all have seen share prices cut almost in half in the last year and a half no mater their quality the other parts are tied to housing shares have suffered and the consumer like home depot hd lowes low usg usg coke ko and others a prolonged housing downturn could see further deterioration
7576377 most of us if were lucky have one not the seven that john mccain has
7576378 its complicated by unfamiliarity inexperience and rumors our job is to make sure people know who barack obama is and what he stands for
7576379 because they dont want to vote for mccain and theyre disillusioned by bushs economic policies
7576380 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7576381 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7576382 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7576383 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7576384 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7576385 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

7576389 some analysts argue that buffett has lost his magic touch we dismiss this out of hand his most recent decisions to add into railroads to buy shares in leading steelmaker posco ltd pkx and 19 other south korean companies buying the leading israeli industrial company and taking profits in his china holdings just before that market lost half its value were all brilliant moves and will more than compensate for any mistakes he made in timing the u s dollars weakness the year before or more recently in taking some mark to market losses in credit default swaps where he eventually should end up making very good money
7576390 the bottom line under buffett berkshire hathaway is a like an astute and disciplined kid in a candy store
7576391 one of my favorite sayings paraphrased is those who make no mistakes usually make nothing at all it is important to be actively doing things if you expect to accomplish anything assume you will make mistakes and take them in your stride if you bought berkshire hathaway stock at the beginning of the year you may feel you made a mistake since it is down about 18 that is worse than the djia s amp p 500 or nasdaq indices which are only down about 14 collectively although i cannot turn back the clock i can say that in these troubled economic times you at least could be relatively confident that you were not going to lose your money as i and many others did with certain financial stocks
7576392 okay so if housing is going to drag for another 18 months then berkshires results will also so one would then expect lower comp earnings and hence a lower share price financials institutions like american express axp wells fargo wfc bank of america bac usb usb m amp t bank mtb make up about 30 40 of berkshire equity portfolio it varies based on valuations the argument can be made that these are the class of the financials and that may be true but all have seen share prices cut almost in half in the last year and a half no mater their quality the other parts are tied to housing shares have suffered and the consumer like home depot hd lowes low usg usg coke ko and others a prolonged housing downturn could see further deterioration
7576393 for all its holdings berkshire is essentially an insurance company

7576401 the serious stage of the presidential campaign begins this fall
7576402 somehow its appropriate that the democratic presidential campaign begins in earnest this week in a place called popejoy hall
7576403 and now the 200 presidential campaign begins as hopefuls must commit and start raising cash
7576404 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7576405 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7576406 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

7576423 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

7576431 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7576432 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7576433 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

7576450 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7576451 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world

7576457 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7576458 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7576459 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7576460 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7576461 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7576462 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7576463 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7576464 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7576465 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7576466 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7576467 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7576468 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7576469 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7576470 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7576471 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7576472 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7576473 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7576474 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7576475 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7576476 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7576477 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7576478 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7576479 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7576480 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7576481 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7576482 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7576483 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7576484 who are open to doing something on the production side
7576485 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7576486 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7576487 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7576488 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7576489 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7576490 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7576491 clearly a problem there how worried are you about those voters
7576492 people are going to be looking very hard at hillary and what she does
7576493 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7576494 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7576495 he knows how to use a wrench he knows how to talk to workers
7576496 he is the blue collar working class guy who can go out and fight
7576497 theyre going to say this guy really gets my life
7576498 do any of you think it shouldve been hillary rodham clinton
7576499 i think he has made his decision she has been very supportive of it
7576500 obama faces nothign like the 20 point or 30 point wipe out in macomb that contributed to mondale and dukakis losing michigan handily
7576501 he picked joe biden because he felt joe biden was the best partner for him joe biden is a guy who obviously is accomplished and knowledgeable hes an independent guy who will tell the president what he needs to know even if he doesnt want to hear it thats what you want in a vice president but mostly i think what attracted senator obama was bidens wisdom and not the kind of wisdom you get in washington d c but the kind of wisdom you get when you overcome adversity tragedy in your life as he has the kind of wisdom you get in the working class communities of scranton pennsylvania and wilmington delaware where hes lived all his life hes never lived a day in washington d c
7576502 of course well he would be at the top of any list right
7576503 i think this choice says a lot about the judgment of senator obama he went through a very methodical pragmatic process he listened to a lot of people he talked to each of these candidates several times and came to what i think was a very good choice he picked somebody who has unparalleled expertise on foreign policy somebody who will help him rebuild the economy put people back to work make our country independent of energy but i think you know senator joe bidens personal story has been tested many many times by personal crises hes somebody that works in washington but doesnt live there and i think that says a lot about him doesnt forget where hes from were comfortable with our pick we had a lot of great choices and we talked to a lot of different people but i think we settled on a great pick and a great partnership to bring about change in this country
7576504 i think senator biden again has unparalleled foreign policy experience and i think if you look at not just what was said yesterday by democrats about this pick but look what was said by republicans senator dick lugar of indiana the chairman of the foreign relations committee senator chuck hagel an unparalleled expert on defense policy senator arlen specter another republican this time from pennsylvania all spoke very highly of the choice of joe biden
7576505 but what about change joe biden has actually been in the halls of congress 10 years longer than john mccain has so this whole message about change doesnt that go out the window
7576506 no because again as i said to you earlier joe biden works in washington but he doesnt live there every night he goes home on an amtrak train where he knows the names of the conductors to his wife and family in delaware
7576507 obviously you can pull up a lot of quotes from august when these two guys were running against each other but if you look at the statements just recently joe biden says barack obama has the judgment the intellect and the spine of steel to lead this country in a different direction
7576508 joe biden talks too much he was known during the john roberts supreme court hearing for asking what many believe to be the single longest question in the history of the senate has obama or has someone on your staff talked to joe about keeping it quiet
7576509 on occasion hes asked long questions i think hed probably plead guilty to that i think that may be something that a lot of them are guilty of but look we didnt hire him for his stunning good looks we hired him for his judgment to lead this country if something happens to barack obama and the judgment and the advice that hell give the next president of the united states and we think weve got a fabulous pick
7576510 i dont think so first of all let me say its an excellent choice its a real sign of the leadership of senator obama that he would choose senator biden recognizing the issues of the day are the economic and personal security of the american people it isnt a question of what senator obama needs hes the full package he has great judgment and knowledge and can draw upon expertise this is what brings balance and brings reinforcement anyone who knows senator biden knows that he is a disrupter this is not your standard washington fare this is a person a senator who goes home every night lucky for him to delaware this is a person who has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7576511 joe is a friend of mine and i have great respect for him i just think that this is a problem for senator obama more than anything else not for joe biden senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength its quite clear from all of the commentaries all of the things ive heard from democrats in particular the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious choice would have been hillary clinton she had 50 percent of the democratic vote obama has 50 percent of the democratic vote you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party and it seems to me that for whatever reason that hasnt been explained a choice was made out of weakness than strength you know dont go with your strongest candidate and then go with a candidate that actually emphasizes all your weaknesses and has been quite vocal about them
7576512 the republicans keep saying that the fact that senator obama had to bring joe biden in underscores his vulnerability that he doesnt have the national security the foreign policy experience to be commander in chief and the fact that biden is there on the ticket right now reaffirms that i wonder if you want to respond
7576513 oh i think it shows to me just the opposite it shows that barack obama is someone who is prepared to bring into his administration talented people from all walks of life that will be able to help him move forward but it will be clear that he will be the president i had the privilege of being with him to visit with president karzai in afghanistan with prime minister maliki in iraq and i saw in both cases a very firm very determined very articulate spokesperson or representative who could deliver a message a tough message in both cases he was urging our allies to do much more and they should do much more and i think hes type of person through his intellect and his temperament that can bring in strong forceful and experienced people but be clearly the leader clearly the president clearly the one who will mark the course for this country going forward
7576514 joe comes from a state delaware that borders virginia the eastern shore part of virginia and delaware are not only bordering but very very similar and i think theres a lot in common and joe understands that virginias a very military state joes long track record on foreign relations matters strong support for the military but strong support for america being great at the diplomacy area will go over very well in virginia and i think hes a heart guy i mean as he campaigns hes a great retail campaigner who really connects with people on a visceral level and virginians like that and so i think the pick of joe biden will do very well in virginia
7576515 if you look at what joes done as a senator hes done some things that i think will resonate well with virginians and others hes got a solid record of accomplishment and i think theyre a good team personality wise they complement each other well i think youre going to see them really enjoying being out on the trail together
7576516 yes im just using a joe biden line as you remember you know im going to answer a question with a yes look joes got a great track record and baracks got a record of being right on the critical issues i mean weve got judgment weve got experience we fuse them together in one ticket
7576517 i think it was a smart choice because joe biden does have the experience to number one be president
7576518 i think this is a very strong ticket not only for pennsylvania but for the country and historically pennsylvania has always been close so we expect a close race but i think senator obama and senator biden together form a very strong team a strong team that understands the struggles that people are facing in this economy and i think that will be a strong message for the people of pennsylvania
7576519 you know im not going to talk about my conversations with the campaign about this i will say it was really flattering to be mentioned it always seemed like kind of a longshot to me but it was really really nice to be mentioned i think joe biden with the state of the race and the state of the world was a great choice for senator obama
7576520 well you know i told you my wife said after i found out remember youve been elected to the highest office in the land youre my husband and so you know that was good that put it in perspective so i know who hail to the chief is too
7576521 lets talk a little bit about what it felt like when you got that call on friday from senator barack obama and he informed you that you would not be his vice presidential running mate walk us through a little bit because its one of those experiences that very few people ever have and youve had it
7576522 well obviously its a life changing moment he had a lot of nice things to say about me which i was very flattered by i told him i was honored to be considered i hope it reflected well upon both me and my state and i believed in him and i wanted to do whatever i could to help us change the direction of this country to address the problems that middle class families in states like mine are facing and i thought joe biden was an excellent man and he could count on me to be helpful in any way that i could
7576523 no he just said that they were going to be going in a different direction but he said that that was a reflection on other things than me he said a number of things that would sound immodest if i recounted to you so im not going to do that but look i really got to know barack well during this process and ive got a lot of confidence in his judgment and his ability to lead this country in a better direction and i wholeheartedly support his decision and as i said it was an honor to be in that final two or three you know i dont think youd be there unless they concluded you had a lot of positive things to offer and probably not too many negatives i called joe biden yesterday morning by the way early in the morning to congratulate him i think hes going to be great and lets go out and lead this country in a better direction
7576524 well if my memory serves not long after the primary process was over barack obama sat down with hillary clinton they had a very long and i think productive meeting remember they meet even before she went out on the trail who knows what they talked about in that meeting even dianne feinstein left the room and left the two of them alone so i think its a little but presumptuous on the part of anybody to say they never discussed this because i do believe that they discussed it very well
7576525 well i think thats going to be the role of the convention is to really be a unifying time for the ticket if you think about the allowance of putting hillary clintons name into play have her name placed on the floor thats really a concession in many respects but its an acknowledgment of her historic campaign and i think it will have a unifying effect
7576526 i think theyre going to be won over not by that but theyre going to be won over by the clintons appearance this week and what they say i just have a feeling this weeks going to be very good and both senator clinton and president clinton are going to say lets do all we can to make change in this nation my anecdotal evidence is just hanging around with the virginians who are strong hillary clinton supporters theyre getting on board
7576527 i dont no i couldnt say that look this is such a personal choice however the obama campaign kind of determines that they need to run the process who they need to look at its got to be something that is just that fit that only the candidate can know so yeah nobody whos not picked is disrespected you know its fine
7576528 im not going to get into the process of how these guys were picked were fortunate to have the support of hillary clinton i think clinton supporters are united in the thing that unites all of the people in this convention we need change we cant have more of the same
7576529 very few people know actually what transpired during this process but i can tell you the first person that he sat down and talked to at all about this vice presidential issue was senator clinton they had a discussion back in early june about it and he spent more time with senator clinton alone talking about issues than he has with joe biden or anyone else in the last couple of months so thats simply not true
7576530 look he has a high regard for senator clinton shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration but he felt that senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time for the reasons that i mentioned earlier and i was pleased that senator clinton gave such a robust endorsement to senator biden as the nominee yesterday
7576531 well i think theyd both be good tickets for different reasons both joe biden and hillary clinton are ready to be president of the united states tomorrow theyre both extremely well qualified and experienced hillary clinton obviously has a longer relationship with a broader spectrum of voters women voters who have been following her for a long time but joe bidens going to grow on the american people very fast because hes a tremendously engaging guy a tremendously bright guy and a guy whos sort of harry truman like he tells it like it is
7576532 i think that senator obama chose the vice presidential candidate that brought balance to his ticket its his choice were going into the future
7576533 john mccain has a womans problem and heres his womans problem that he is to the right of george bush when it comes to a womans right to choose he opposes a womans right to choose even in cases of rape and incest he opposed the pay equity act hes so out of touch that he actually doesnt understand that there are cases that women are paid less than men and need judicial remedy john mccain has a womans problem and at the end of the week what youre going to see is a united democratic party senator clinton has made it very clear who her pick is and who her choice is here
7576534 they know that that ad is demonstrably false they know that hillary clinton is supporting barack obama
7576535 on that clip let me tell you this last week the mccain campaign leaked the name of governor romney as a potential running mate and you better clear your whole show next week because you could fill your whole show with the nasty things that john mccain and mitt romney said about each other just a few months ago
7576536 women across this country are going to be introduced to the second real champion for women on the democratic ticket barack has an incredibly strong record and incredibly compelling life story raised by a single mom his grandmother married to this bright and beautiful and talented woman and the father of two young daughters theres no way he is going to forget about womens issues theres no question hillary clinton has served with both these men she chose barack obama this ad is a bit disingenuous i would say suggesting somehow that john mccain would get the support of her or her supporters
7576537 this ad will have a three day life span when hillary clinton speaks on wednesday night she will blow this ad out of the water
7576538 this is a clever effort by mccain to divide democrats at our convention but i assure you were going to leave here stronger and more unified
7576539 i dont blame them for trying but the simple message to the women who voted for hillary clinton is if you like the last eight years under george w bush youre going to love the next four under john mccain lets be honest its the most disastrous presidency that weve had in modern american history john mccain has said theres no significant issue that he disagrees with george w bush on in the end these folks are not going to vote for a continuation of the policies of this administration period and thats what the obama camp needs to spend less time worrying about keeping the clintons out of their campaign and more time worried about how you put bush in the middle of it
7576540 no what i want john to select is the best possible candidate and i think john has a strong record on being pro life 100 percent you couldnt have a candidate thats more committed to appointing judges like roberts like scalia these are judges that biden voted against those are the things that are going to bring conservatives around and of course hes going to select a conservative john is a conservative he always has been
7576541 i have not been as far as i can tell in the case of hillary clinton they thought that she didnt need to be vetted because it had been you know exposed so much various things about her life have been exposed so much in my case i think the same thing is true although im not a candidate for vice president but you can pretty much vet me in about 60 minutes by googling me its down to three or four candidates it is not me i think the three or four are terrific i have my own views on them which i will deliver personally but i think john has some really excellent choices
7576542 thats a touchy subject because the solid republican base is necessary for senator mccain to win and theres a lot of concern about having somebody who is pro choice but bear this in mind that john mccain has never been a trumpeter on the issue never been outspoken and senator mccain is for embryonic stem cell research so that senator mccain himself presents a good balance but i dont know what john mccains going to do on a running mate but he has to balance a lot of factors and i think that there are other matters of concern to the suburban philadelphia voters besides the pro choice issue and i think that mccains independence will stand him in very good stead there
7576543 there were a lot of complaints among democrats four years ago that john kerry and his team didnt do enough to lay out the contrast didnt go after president bush enough in their convention how would you lay out what youre going to do this week and should we expect to see a lot of contrast or more emphasis on biography of barack obama
7576544 you were involved in the convention in 1992 that was somewhat similar in the sense that people didnt know bill clinton the republicans were doing what the republicans do and tried to portray him as a sort of silver spoon ivy leaguer when in fact he had a great american story as barack obama does the son of a single mother working his way up and then going back to work in communities that were failed by steel plant closings were going to tell that story but were also going to tell the story about whats happened to the country under the policies that weve seen under the broken politics of washington and were going to talk about how were going to change that and so you know were not going to shy away from making the contrast people are making a choice we need to make clear what that choice is were going to do it in a constructive way but were going to lay it out very very clearly
7576545 absolutely not in fact i think that you should pay attention to where we go down the line
7576546 i dont know what itll be i expect this is going to be a close election from now to the end you know if i set my clock to the polls i would have jumped off a high building a year ago when you were asking me about polls that showed us 30 points behind for the nomination so im not going to concern myself
7576547 i dont see any storm clouds on the horizon i see nothing but clear sky for our convention and for the country because i think people are going to make the right choice so im not worried about the weather on thursday i think its going to be fine
7576548 john mccain has had a pretty rugged life he has not exactly had a life with a silver spoon in his mouth john mccain has experienced more personal adversity than anybody i know certainly anybody in the united states senate and i think he understands tough problems and the way to deal with them i dont think anybody could ever fault john mccain about being able to deal with adversity and going through really a living hell which is a lot more important than how many apartments your wife owns
7576549 i think we have an opportunity with the candidate on the republican side who is totally out of touch with whats happening across american towns and cities people are in foreclosure theyre terrified theyre going to lose their homes or they have already lost them they are afraid they will never buy a home we still dont have any idea how many homes john mccain owns and i dont begrudge him seven 10 whatever the number is but i think its an indication that he has no idea he doesnt support the kind of foreclosure protection that senator obama has put forth he doesnt support stabilizing this market the middle class tax cut hes put forward is three times as big as john mccains over and over and over again he wants to help people restore the american dream john mccain has lived the american dream but he somehow doesnt feel that that should be opened up to all americans
7576550 this convention is about ensuring that john mccain does not get an eighth home he has seven homes thats enough could be 10 well we dont want an 11th home we dont want him in the white house he says he has seven kitchen tables we dont want him to have an eighth kitchen table when john mccain gets up in the morning and leaves his house to lock his door he has to shuffle through a number of keys to figure out which key works in which door in which home hes at at any given time that suggests a significant disconnect between the average american who is experiencing quite a different economy than the one john mccain has been advocating
7576551 wed be counting a lot of homes if you had a mccain romney ticket theres no question about that
7576552 we had a really enlightening moment this week when senator mccain said the economy was fundamentally sound and then later when he was asked how many homes he owned he couldnt come up with a number couldnt keep track of the number of homes he owned and so maybe thats why he thinks that weve made great progress and that we should continue these policies but the american people dont
7576553 they both live in million dollar homes so what is that about people in glass houses shouldnt throw stones youre sort of not in a position to be pointing at other people when you are in that one percent of america in terms of i mean how many people live in one million dollar homes they both do this is not going to be i think a fruitful way of going about it and its not the new politics that senator obama was talking about trying to convince the american people that john mccain is not a regular guy just isnt going to work
7576554 i think another thing that biden brings and we saw it on his speech on behalf of barack obama he will be along with michelle obama a great testifier on behalf of the story of barack obama what hes done in his life and what hell done as president i think hell be extraordinarily effective
7576555 not just a testifier i mean this was the announcement yesterday he went off as if it were convention speech the number of attacks against president bush and senator mccain
7576556 also he kept saying bush mccain bush mccain as if that were the ticket
7576557 but also the positive message you cant go overboard and joe biden part of barack obamas problem is the same problem that bill clinton had he comes in here famous but not well known
7576558 we now have three sitting senators in this race weve never in american history had two sitting senators run against each other this would i would think give some reason for john mccain to pick someone from not on the floor of the senate
7576559 i do unless he changes his mind i think that michigan is the key of the whole election i think john mccain can win this presidency with two combinations the exact electoral votes that george bush won or michigan
7576560 i dont think joe bidens selection does much to assuage the outrage that a lot of hillary backers feel whether that will translate into some disaffection that lasts till election day among hillary voters i think is very much an open question does biden bring anything in terms of reaching out to voters beyond those that obama might otherwise attract on foreign policy perhaps so but on all the other range of issues he is virtually every bit as liberal as obama is this ticket therefore offers not very much to centrists and conservatives and this is after all i think still a center right country
7576561 when news organizations do their big profiles of joe biden will they be digging for dirt will they for example recycle the 1987 plagiarism incident
7576562 its old news itll be down in the story towards the bottom of the story about the neil kinnock stuff and how joe biden went on and on and on at all the hearings for supreme court justices and joe biden running for president twice and what obama emphasized of course was his biography which all of us who covered him already know so you know that can be discounted to a certain degree
7576563 im not sure that joe biden needed to run across the stage yesterday im not sure that was the best look for a 65 year old man but he was enthusiastic
7576564 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7576565 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7576566 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7576567 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7576568 but this line from the scriptures kept coming into my head for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul

7576666 currently there are a lot of infrared imaging systems out there for night vision and other surveillance and reconnaissance work but the image is just like black and white it only measures the intensity of infrared that falls on the detector
7576667 we have come up with technology whereby on that infrared imaging chip you can place essentially another filtering element which allows you to select the wavelengths you want to hit the detector
7576668 that wavelength information can tell you a lot about what it is you are looking at
7576669 for example every tank has an infrared imaging system for night vision you can look a few kilometres away and see another tank but it is a black and white image so you cant tell if it is a friendly tank or not
7576670 the idea with our technology is you can go into a mode where you actually detect the spectrum from the tank allowing you to identify what kind of tank it is because the spectrum has information about the paint that is used and the material it is made from and all sorts of stuff

7576711 he can beat you with his legs he can beat you with his arm and now what he is learning to do is to beat you with his mind
7576712 everybody makes it a two horse race i think its a three horse race
7576713 well do our best to get there when the season ends
7576714 it should be motivation i dont think the players will like it but it doesnt mean a darn thing right now
7576715 you see the shake and bake and you see the effort he is really trying to be that leader you want him to be in a group of great talent
7576716 i was just hoping it was a bruise or a pulled muscle or something
7576717 but its kind of hard when its in your knee to know exactly what is hurting
7576718 well just have to see how rehab goes and what they find inside the knee
7576719 you dont want to win a spot like this due to an injury
7576720 but at the same time it says carpe diem on our shirts youve got to seize the day
7576721 i think this time of the year i think all of em probably get a little sore
7576722 he probably had a little bit more throwing so much as much as we throw i think its kind of common
7576723 i dont know anything about that hopefully ill be here you never know
7576724 and when it comes to supply and demand on the energy issue obama and biden are focusing too little on supply and too little on demand
7576725 i think its fair to say the mayor had hoped it would correct itself and ultimately be successful
7576726 the fact of the matter is youve got a lot of loans that appear to be uncollectible
7576727 youre doing the heavy lifting that nobody else will do
7576728 we could never sell the property for that in the current market
7576729 i dont believe that has ever been operated as a financial success
7576730 we took on hard projects projects that other people wouldnt take on
7576731 if you have a sample from a brother or a father it is easy but if we get away from this and have to turn to more distant relatives things are much much more complicated
7576732 will some bodies go unidentified i cannot tell you right now but it is a possibility
7576733 in general the company was fine and no problems whatsoever were detected
7576734 is rapidly turning into a bottomless pit for its financial backers
7576735 equal or better than something we can get in another project
7576736 there is a history of feasibility studies for toll roads being overly optimistic
7576737 of the 10 major private toll roads constructed since the mid 1990s nearly half carry far less traffic than projected some 4 billion in toll road bonds risk default over the next five years unless theyre refinanced
7576738 fitch says that the ever present possibility of state governments siphoning off surplus toll revenues or leveraging them for other borrowings prevents state owned turnpikes from achieving the aaa rating
7576739 what they power stations were looking for was a solution where they could repair the blades in situ
7576740 the rotor is taken out of the turbine and put in a cradle we dont remove the blades but use laser technology to put a new coating on them
7576741 we are also looking at robotic technology for the profiling of the blades
7576742 getting all 11 pairs of hands to the ball wherever you see the ball thats where all the defenders are we give 110 percent all the time just being dominant out there creating turnovers
7576743 the bold combines everything business people love about the traditional blackberry email experience with great graphics streaming video a sharp display and the ability to download view and edit documents in a matter of seconds
7576744 we asked telstra for some blackberry bold units to trial but apparently there are some bugs
7576745 they asked us to wait for the next release of the firmware telstra didnt go into detail but weve been asked to wait until september
7576746 rim is developing a software upgrade to optimise media streaming on the device
7576747 this free firmware upgrade is around the corner and a handful of customers have chosen to wait for this before rolling out the new blackberry bold to their teams
7576748 at this stage a few thousand devices have been distributed to selected customers who are aware of the forthcoming software upgrade
7576749 on monday last week telstra became the first australian carrier to start distributing the blackberry bold to selected business customers as part of an early seeding program
7576750 all the services our customers are used to on their blackberry such as email phone and web browsing are performing well
7576751 the blackberry bold has not experienced any issues with bugs at all all four local carriers will be launching the product telstra and optus both currently have the product available in the marketplace
7576752 its very common for different carriers and networks to have specific requirements for software handset manufacturers then tailor software specifically for a network or a carrier
7576753 senator mary landrieu once viewed as the most vulnerable democratic incumbent this election year has opened a significant lead over republican challenger john kennedy in her bid for re election the latest rasmussen reports telephone survey in the state shows the louisiana democrat attracts 53 of the vote while the republican hopeful earns just 37 support a month ago landrieu was leading kennedy by only five percentage points 49 to 44
7576754 on the eve of mary landrieus speaking role at the democratic convention this tuesday a prominent pro landrieu web site today reported her highly touted push poll from rasmussen was
7576755 the government has a live commercial selection process under way for the national broadband network and it is therefore inappropriate to speculate on the potential outcome of the request for proposals
7576756 it has always been the governments position that the provision of appropriate network information to proponents is important for the success of the national broadband network process and that this should be done as soon as possible
7576757 if telstra win the bid it will switch it on straight away in april
7576758 that is of course if the government goes for a quick fix instead of an innovative and open access solution
7576759 in 2009 with or without the network telstra will still deliver 12mbps to all metro areas if the government decides to go with telstra there will be no competition and under serviced areas will suffer
7576760 telstra is not interested in pursuing the spirit of the network which is about open access and broadband for under serviced areas
7576761 it would be much better if the government stuck to its election promises and picked a network based on open access even though this may mean australia wont see services for some months it will be worth it
7576762 it all depends on who the successful bidder is how quickly they can mobilise whether they have contractors lined up and if they have already pre purchased fibre equipment
7576763 if the proponent hasnt selected a vendor we can expect more delays
7576764 weve been sitting on selecting a vendor until we get the network information and the clock starts ticking we are making a short list because we may need multiple types of technology from different vendors

7576770 i never knew it could go that fast one of the officers told me its not often were in a car chase and get out stripped
7576771 the atm wasnt working so i walked another 50 yards to another machine withdrew money then returned to find my car gone
7576772 it would only have been three or four minutes i didnt lock the car and i left the keys in it so im totally in the wrong
7576773 it took off the pursuing police pulled out of the chase due to the speed it was doing it was doing at least 140kmh and it had just started to rain
7576774 the thing im most grateful for is that no ones hurt
7576775 magnificent everything it should be at 32 years of age a powerful wine that should go on for decades yet

7576777 20 50 a call to action for the future of the tampa bay region
7576778 it is imperative that the people of our community weigh in we must take an active role in writing the future or else others will do it for us
7576779 we can allow that growth to happen randomly or we can actively participate in developing a vision so that residents in 2050 and beyond benefit from the best design technology and transit options that ensures the protection of our natural resources sense of community and economic vitality
7576780 an important example of opportunities for collaboration within the region
7576781 if we dont voice our opinions now we will have no right to complain about our disappointment down the road
7576782 we were told all along by police that there was a criteria and they would judge based on that what they would charge her with and that is the way it has gone
7576783 her emotional side is affected as well we just have to let it sink in
7576784 the crown is alleging dangerous driving and other factors which will come out at the trial were major departures from the standard of care expected of a reasonable person driving a motor vehicle that day
7576785 acm sigkdd is pleased to present dr raghu ramakrishnan with its 2008 innovation award for his important contributions to the advancement of the data mining and knowledge discovery
7576786 dr ramakrishnans visionary research on techniques for scaling data mining algorithms to large datasets and on mining ordered and streaming data has significantly influenced ongoing developments in the industry
7576787 we believe a phenomenal opportunity exists for us to become a leader in the local job space utilizing cutting edge technology to connect employers with job seekers our ceo and founder derek chisholm has created a scalable technology platform similar to our local directories that should allow us to enter new markets with relative ease we believe www tampabayjoblistings com will be very well received by floridas largest job market the tampa bay area
7576788 after tampa were targeting launching local job sites in all of floridas major markets by the end of the year and nationally in 2009
7576789 as an example of the team atmosphere he said to me im very sorry im very sorry and it was not his fault it just shows how ferrari people are the passion that they have the way they behave and the professionalism that they put in every day we need to be very proud of the guys who work in this team
7576790 the system works in the following way when the fuel nozzle is connected to the car you see that there is a red light on at a certain moment you see that there is a flashing light that is close to the red light telling the driver that he has to be ready then as soon as the nozzle comes off the light becomes green unless the guy that is controlling the pit stop position overrides it manually because there is a car in the fast lane coming through so he has to delay the car that is how the system works weve used it since last year
7576791 i dont think so to be honest when there is a red flight its a red light its like the lollypop is down i dont think that we need to go towards that depth of course we need to make sure that the system is always working that is something that we have to make sure but this is another story
7576792 we are doing pit stop practice at home trying to do more simulation or some rehearsals at home but the fact that we cant do it at a race i dont think is a problem
7576793 weve received a fine for the team and not for the driver to be honest we didnt consider that as an unsafe move as you could see there was no obstruction there was no braking felipe was on the right hand side he stopped and the force india let him through but that was the view of the fia and we have to respect it
7576794 unfortunately like the last time in hungary for felipe there was no indication at all we saw the smoke on the main straight once again and we are now disassembling the engine to understand what is the real problem so i cannot give you an answer straight away as to what the problem was because the guys are still working on the engine but there was no warning at all
7576795 as general manager shes in charge of membership and finances vacuuming laundry as well as other general housekeeping and maintenance of exercise equipment
7576796 it works out great staff wise we can be flexible
7576797 theyve long time members watched my kids grow up and ive watched theirs
7576798 the older two sometimes came here after school theyve all worked here at different times
7576799 if i have to get off work its really easy to do that
7576800 shes very patient with them shes a big people person everybody loves her
7576801 it was fun they were slow and i was really really slow
7576802 on the third day i thought i almost couldnt get out of bed i was so sore
7576803 that running kind of progressed and i started doing local 5k races
7576804 i had never been to a track meet you need a lot of people to run a track meet
7576805 the biggest difference is athletes know where they have to be and when they have to be there
7576806 i have had people disagree with a call you just defer to the meet referee
7576807 first thing i say is were not going to use all of those machines
7576808 its baby steps really one step at a time feeling comfortable
7576809 theres not a lot of people who can come to work everyday and say that
7576810 britney spears will not be performing at the vmas this year im telling you officially and unequivocally that bs will not be there
7576811 britney spears will not perform at the 2008 mtv vmas
7576812 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7576813 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7576814 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7576815 every power cut even if it lasts for just a few minutes delays water production by three hours
7576816 there wasnt a lot of focus from the former regime on the long term consequences of dumping raw sewage onto river banks
7576817 we have people illegally siphoning water from the pipelines using potable water to irrigate their gardens and fill their fish pools
7576818 even water used by car washes this wasted water could be used in areas already suffering from shortages
7576819 the water is dirty but what can we do we dont have any other choice
7576820 people like us who earn three or four dollars a day we spend it all on generators
7576821 as soon as you build new plants and you lay down new networks you will be able to service more people
7576822 now they apparently have enough resources and theyre slowly moving toward using those resources
7576823 but the task is immense even with all the money in the world it would still take time
7576824 have to admit as democrats we have been wrong on education
7576825 those folks who are giving money for campaigns and you know who im talking about

7576835 the crown is alleging dangerous driving and other factors which will come out at the trial were major departures from the standard of care expected of a reasonable person driving a motor vehicle that day
7576836 its a great story shes carried the memory of her fiance throughout her whole life
7576837 magnificent everything it should be at 32 years of age a powerful wine that should go on for decades yet
7576838 its a bit thin it didnt have the depth and richness that i believe it should
7576839 it preserves key landscape features like larger dunes going around the toe of them rather than bulldozing right through them
7576840 rather just accommodating traffic issues the new design is more driven by urban issues and the environment
7576841 there are a few more bends in it it goes up over and around dunes rather than flattening everything out
7576842 prioritising walkway and cycleway facilities will encourage people to get out of their cars
7576843 most guys just leave their catch on the wharf and dont gut it until they take it home later ive never got sick but im really careful about it youve got to fillet it immediately and keep it cool
7576844 wild food is a traditional part of new zealanders way of life and there has been an anecdotal increase with higher food prices
7576845 but there is likely to be massive under reporting of people getting sick
7576846 this is not about regulation its about providing information so people can harvest wild food safely
7576847 the lord smote him because he gave not god the glory and he was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost
7576848 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7576849 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7576850 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7576851 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7576852 ive had a wonderful time at the lg skins game the past two years and winning has just been an added bonus
7576853 im a big fan of the skins game format its fun for both the players and the fans and im thrilled about the chance to return this fall looking for a three peat
7576854 water was rising up toward the bottom of their house it doesnt look like it was close to entering the house but they didnt have a way to get out their cars had been moved to higher ground we sent one of our rescue boats in to remove the children
7576855 the water is ranging anywhere from a foot deep to as much as it looks like 5 feet deep thats pretty bad
7576856 weve been here since the early morning hours when we had to actually go in and physically rescue some people out of their residences with our small marine unit
7576857 the carpet is gone the flooring is floating theres waste everywhere in the house it stinks there are fish in the house if you walk through the water there are ants everywhere its nasty its ridiculous in there
7576858 nem tudo o que mensuravel importante e nem tudo que importante mensuravel
7576859 a participa o das empresas na rea das pol ticas sociais v m crescendo muito temos observado tamb m nos debates e nas agendas o aumento da import ncia dessa parceria para isso preciso saber quem o parceiro
7576860 lembro que quando secret rio visitei escolas onde havia quatro formas diferentes de trabalhos de alfabetiza o em fun o de projetos superpostos
7576861 ainda forte a cultura assistencialista os doadores financiam os bandaids das quest es sociais ao focarem nos efeitos e n o nas causas
7576862 acho que esse n mero ainda est superestimado na medida em que as empresas consideram que um controle cont bil pode ser avalia o
7576863 h uma velha m xima que diz nem tudo o que mensur vel importante e nem tudo que importante mensur vel
7576864 s o culturas muito diferentes e sentimos absoluta necessidade de definir quais s o os pressupostos e quais os resultados finais desejados
7576865 sem essa negocia o das partes para criar um entendimento fica dif cil avaliar
7576866 h por exemplo em todo o mundo a vis o de que as empresas s visam o marketing no brasil soma se a isso um grande preconceito contra o lucro
7576867 i think its a bit of a longshot to be honest but obviously no other countries are committed because they were all going to be playing in the champions trophy
7576868 well monitor the environment and see if any of the other countries are willing to participate were keen but i guess well just wait and see
7576869 we couldnt host anything you cant play cricket here in late september but i think wed be pretty happy to travel
7576870 it would be good for the guys to get a bit of cricket prior to the bangladesh tour and theyre all fit and ready to go
7576871 i think the cultural aspect of where he comes from and his background will have huge pressure on him
7576872 but dannys been living in rotorua since he was nine and nzg high performance manager david graham is so close to him so the indication weve got is that he wants to remain with new zealand
7576873 there is a really neat picture on one of the websites today of danny waving the new zealand flag after his win
7576874 hes going to carry a new zealand passport i guess one of the biggest indications is that he could have turned professional now but he is so determined to represent new zealand at the eisenhower its unbelievable
7576875 we are determined and have stated so many times that we want to help young amateurs transition to professionalism
7576876 understanding the tours they should go on the management groups they should associate with is very important and the united states is obviously a very big market
7576877 there are so many options these days in both the new and used car realm for safe fun and affordable back to school rides
7576878 vehicles are better built and better equipped than ever before and there are a variety of body style options available to suit the needs of any parent and inevitably satisfy the wants of any teen
7576879 it speaks well for our institutions consciousness in preventing an otherwise needless waste
7576880 whenever theres a bunch of people here at one time it gets crazy you have people bumping into you so if youre balancing stuff youre going to end up dropping something or breaking something
7576881 so if a college is looking to go green they need to start looking in the dining facility
7576882 it speaks well for our institutions consciousness in preventing an otherwise needless waste
7576883 whenever theres a bunch of people here at one time it gets crazy you have people bumping into you so if youre balancing stuff youre going to end up dropping something or breaking something
7576884 so if a college is looking to go green they need to start looking in the dining facility
7576885 its going faster in some places than others because you have different cultures and different ways that universities do things
7576886 its going faster in some places than others because you have different cultures and different ways that universities do things
7576887 we talked about the game today and we realized that over the last week or 10 days john mccain has had a 12 0 run in this basketball game
7576888 and its going to shift soon we think this a good time for barack to show his strength
7576889 what barack has on the ground in all 50 states is an unbelievable grassroots campaign said obama senior advisor and family friend valerie jarrett
7576890 we feel we have the infrastructure in place to make sure folks actually do come out and vote
7576891 they are clearly not inside the conversations between the clinton and obama camps
7576892 the people who are actually at the table have a very good working relationship jarrett said
7576893 senator clinton has done absolutely everything sen obama has asked of her there is no stronger surrogate with sen clinton supporters than sen clinton
7576894 it might take a little longer for some people to come around
7576895 he will outline his vision for america the kind of president he will be his approach to leading our country and the key issues that we will face as a country going forward
7576896 this is a tough presidential campaign were in i have a very honorable opponent there are stark differences between us
7576897 it was like the working with the cast of looney tunes
7576898 no excess value to benefit the estate and no equity exists for creditors
7576899 theyre not glued to the television sets watching the convention anymore so they get it across the internet podcasts there are loads of ways to do it
7576900 weve seen kind of an eclipse of the backstage place in which candidates can operate freely
7576901 its been true to some degree that candidates have always been in the public eye when they are campaigning but theres a greater sense of it
7576902 little stories or stories not recognizable as big stories when they first break is something the new media has brought to the fore
7576903 if gov corzine needs to tie his shoelace ill probably write something about it
7576904 every little thing is going to be picked apart by us
7576905 they political parties started to train delegates on how to behave for tv because conventions had typically been rowdy boisterous affairs and now suddenly there were cameras on you
7576906 im not yet convinced the internet will be equally consequential
7576907 the u s intelligence community buckled sooner in 2002 than previously reported to bush administration pressure for data justifying an invasion of iraq
7576908 the documents suggest that the public relations push for war came before the intelligence analysis which then conformed to public positions taken by pentagon and white house officials
7576909 surge is a success in the context of a devastated population in an obliterated nation lacking in the most essential supplies and services a nation where death continues on a shopping spree
7576910 a recently declassified draft of the cias october 2002 white paper on iraqi wmd programs demonstrates that that the white paper long pre dated the compilation of the national intelligence estimate on iraqi capabilities
7576911 bush administration and the tony blair government began acting in concert to build support for an invasion of iraq two to three months earlier than previously understood
7576912 a comparison of the cia draft white paper with its publicly released edition shows that all the changes made were in the nature of strengthening its charges against iraq by inserting additional alarming claims in the manner of an advocacy or public relations document
7576913 the draft and final papers show no evidence of intelligence analysis applied to the information contained
7576914 baghdad for now appears to be drawing a line short of conducting terrorist attacks with conventional or cbw against the united states fearing that exposure of iraqi involvement would provide washington a stronger cause for making war
7576915 iraq probably would attempt clandestine attacks against the u s homeland if baghdad feared an attack that threatened the survival of the regime were imminent or unavoidable or possibly for revenge
7576916 close your eyes and ask yourself how old youd picture this co worker if they didnt have an adult body once youve established an age consider how you would actually treat a child this old for example if your co worker really were 5 you would probably be patient clear and set limits without resentment
7576917 the recent acquisition of nestles yoghurts and dairy desserts business represented a significant step towards achieving our growth strategy in australia
7576918 but having said that the economic conditions probably masked any improvement we would have hoped to see at the gaming machine level
7576919 ive been a big supporter major supporter of unions virtually all my life

7577024 its almost like the politicians are second guessing the jokes that the comedians are going to do
7577025 i think were going to see a lot of that satire on the fringe next year

7577027 you cant ban cars from the road so thats not gonna continue but the efforts to get people more aware of the dangers of smoking thats gonna be a long term public health issue

7577039 barack obamas father was muslim and therefore according to islamic law so is the candidate in spite of the quranic verses explaining that there is no compulsion in religion a muslim child takes the religion of his or her father for muslims around the world non american muslims at any rate they can only ever see barack hussein obama as a muslim
7577040 the symbolism of a major american presidential candidate with the middle name of hussein who went to elementary school in indonesia
7577041 dont really understand obamas family tree but what they do know is that if america despite being attacked by muslim militants on 9 11 were to elect as its president some guy with the middle name hussein it would mark a sea change in america muslim world relations

7577048 everybodys got a facebook page and a myspace page and its important to let guys know theyre representing the university of kentucky
7577049 hopefully theyll do a better job than i did my freshman year
7577050 its fun to go out every weekend and they have their fun but its important to just let them know whats important
7577051 sometimes ill go out with my friends and theyll want to take pictures and im like i dont know
7577052 maybe there are a lot of people around that are drinking so it can be a bit frustrating for them but its a safeguard to make sure i dont find myself on the news the media loves to play up the bad jock scenario another athlete whos just out doing things wrong that might not be the case but thats the story

7577065 what will keep the lights on for the people who elected us
7577066 were able to capture the evidence we need to actually pursue individuals
7577067 its really not fair to the community to have that thing hanging over his head

7577069 many of our victims are lower income and they dont even have cars
7577070 i certainly understand the fiscal constraints of hemet the county is faced with the same escalating expenses
7577071 these laws while not perfect were a step in the right direction
7577072 the laws limit the receipt of contributions from anyone the city council has been responsible for awarding a public benefit
7577073 my concern is to move the city ahead and do whats right for the city
7577074 the reason i have my event annually is specifically to avoid the appearance of conflict

7577099 i think its outrageous that this tape has been released without the approval of the court
7577100 this is the first time in history that a child has been prosecuted for war crimes
7577101 this is just horrific i think it reflects badly on the way the world should go in its protection of children we should be seeking out and trying to as the un has done in many initiatives to stamp out child soldiers
7577102 im just not sure why the canadian government which was tremendously important in my work in west africa they were incredibly supportive is not making a bigger deal of this
7577103 theres a general idea that hey a 14 or 15 year old probably knows that its wrong to steal its wrong to kill its wrong to do various things that are anti social in war those norms dont apply in war it is okay to kill it is okay to destroy property it is okay to do things it is not otherwise okay in normal life to do
7577104 is it any way reasonable to expect a child to understand these highly nuanced sophisticated concepts of the war of armed conflicts that say you can kill people but you can only kill people if youre wearing certain clothes
7577105 oh ill just throw this grenade in that direction and whatever it hits it hits

7577108 in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation within the meaning of section 232 is to reduce the sentence from life imprisonment with a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years 10 years
7577109 every woman who values her freedom and the freedoms of her children and grandchildren is against the bill in fact the only people making lauding and making excuses for and obfuscations about the bill are those who spend their time actively trying to stick their noses in others reproductive organs
7577110 the ccrf guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society

7577115 the use of this image is in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote london

7577140 what you saw today was a team everybody wants to talk about nba players being selfish being arrogant being individuals well what you saw today was a team bonding together facing adversity and coming out of here with a big win
7577141 from day one weve been together its been a bond for the last three years
7577142 this team has come a long way and we had a lot of blowouts those first few games so it was fitting that this one would be a close one it really tested us to see what we were all about and in the end we showed were the best in the world
7577143 the good news is unsolicited five or six of these guys said they want to be part of this going forward
7577144 i think this right here will be contagious and it will rub off on a lot of people
7577145 i think guys will see how much fun we had and be like man i want to be a part of that

7577151 phone and cable companies have launched multi billion dollar bandwidth competitive network upgrades but unless they also address the fundamental limitations of tcp the new wideband networks will have the same bandwidth constriction issues as current broadband technology
7577152 hyperpipe gives these providers an unmatched tool to deliver wideband class service on a broadband network with a huge time to market advantage there is simply no financial competitive or technical reason for service providers to spend the time and money on wideband network upgrades when they can receive the same benefits today using hyperpipe on an existing broadband backbone
7577153 the system may be robust in some places but it must also be fragile in some other places
7577154 if youre developing a drug you might want to target these fragile places
7577155 you could consider this a law of networks a law of systems biology
7577156 to apply it to drug development is definitely a new idea
7577157 weve proved that robustness is not conserved but that fragility is

7577170 the statement effectively conceded that berbatov was lost as a player to tottenham and appeared to give manchester united the upper hand in the wrangle
7577171 it was not the unsettled striker who told them he did not want to play
7577172 manchester united are expected to offer an increased bid of 25 million to land disaffected striker dimitar berbatov although it is understood that tottenham have yet to receive a formal offer
7577173 complete an acrimonious move from tottenham hotspur to manchester united within days after the barclays premier league champions finally reopened formal negotiations over the weekend united made a second formal bid in the region of 25 million on saturday august 23 and a deal appears imminent after juande ramos the tottenham head coach declared that the saga must be resolved

7577177 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
7577178 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
7577179 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
7577180 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
7577181 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
7577182 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
7577183 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
7577184 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
7577185 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
7577186 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
7577187 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
7577188 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
7577189 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
7577190 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
7577191 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
7577192 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
7577193 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
7577194 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
7577195 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
7577196 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
7577197 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
7577198 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
7577199 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
7577200 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
7577201 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
7577202 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
7577203 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
7577204 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
7577205 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
7577206 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
7577207 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets

7577215 i am happy that aids related deaths have decreased by over 75 percent over the last four years in comparison with the aids related deaths we had in 2003 2004 because of increased free treatment

7577227 from societys perspective covering the uninsured is still a good investment failure to act in the near term will only make it more expensive to cover the uninsured in the future while adding to the amount of lost productivity from not insuring all americans
7577228 the uninsured receive a lot less care than the insured and they pay a greater percentage of it out of pocket contrary to popular myth they are not all free riders
7577229 adding the cost of the additional care to current spending by or for the uninsured total medical care costs for newly insured people will be about 208 6 billion roughly 3 800 per full year equivalent newly insured person consisting of 122 6 billion in new spending on top of the 86 billion already in the system

7577257 the only reason l c gets paid more than anyone else

7577264 in most if not all of the northern counties there are few or no common brewers the inn keepers and publick ale houses brewing what they retail in their own houses and private families for themselves and in all these counties tis as rare to find any ill malt liquors as it is to find good in london or the adjacent counties
7577265 as for your malt the north country malts from nottinghamshire derbyshire leicestershire cheshire lancashire amp c are the best especially for ale but are generally too slack dryed for march or october beer which is to be kept at least half a year before it be drank the goodness of these northern malts proceeds partly from the corn which grows on grounds more rested than in the southern countrys where the rents are more racked and the grounds more worn by continual sowing and partly from the making in which they take more time then in other parts and dry it leisurely with pit coal charkt called in some places coak an in others culm which is sweet and gives a gentle and certain heat whereas in the south east parts they dry their malt with straw which is hard to keep to a moderate and equal heat
7577266 in short the reason why publick and common brewers seldom or never brew good drink is that they wet more malt at once than tis possible they can have vessels and servants enough to work and set it cool emough to ferment kindly and withall brew so often that they cannot sufficiently betwen one brewing and another cleanse and scald their brewing vessels and barrels giving them due time to dry but that they will retain such a rest as will always char and sour their liquors and the mischiefs accrewing by such neglects are incredible to persons unexperienced

7577268 he played for us last year in the playoffs and he was very good it was like he played there all year hes got great hands good instincts composure with the puck great skater he can kind of do it all hes a solid player all around
7577269 you want to use him and see someone from austria that did it he was the reason i came over here from austria he hooked me up with a tryout in the ushl and he kept in touch the first year to see how things were going
7577270 andreas is just scratching the surface of what hes capable of
7577271 he has really developed into a much better all around player and i think hes going to be a dangerous offensive weapon in the pros
7577272 andreas has the ability to do a lot of things at high speed
7577273 hes an excellent skater hes got very good hands he can go out and make plays shoot the puck in stride hes physically already filled out
7577274 we talked to him about turning pro last year at this time but he wanted to go back and improve on a lot of things in his game and we watched him a lot over the course of the season and i think he did that when we approached him at the end of the year about where he was at he wanted to turn pro we were happy to have him
7577275 they really emphasize being in good condition i worked out a lot i ran a lot which i hadnt done in the past a lot of running a lot of biking all that stuff to get in the best shape possible

7577285 this ailing patient the u s cotton sector shows every sign of a great recovery it just may need at least another year to recuperate
7577286 while the long term outlook for the cotton sector in the united states is favorable the sector may still endure some pain before things improve
7577287 acres in the delta region are likely to see a larger decrease approximately 30 percent a change which would see that region losing over half its cotton area in just two years
7577288 despite the relatively low acreage in the long term the u s cotton sector is likely to strengthen largely due to changes in the global sector the u s cotton sector is likely to improve as major global cotton producers such as china and india increasingly divert more acreage into food production to keep pace with rising incomes and populations
7577289 while cotton production in africa continues to have great potential growth is slow and volatility is ever present
7577290 additionally with low yields compared to world averages the region may benefit from increased international focus in terms of multilateral agronomic development and an increased focus from the private sector outside the region that is seeking to develop new resources
7577291 the main reason for the success of indias cotton program has been the implementation of a government program that targeted improvements in seeds extension services marketing infrastructure and processing facilities
7577292 assuming that current trends in terms of strong demand and upward price pressure for grains and oilseeds continues into 2009 it would be reasonable to predict that 2009 2010 u s cotton acreage is unlikely to see a major increase if any increase at all
7577293 however as the economic slowdown eases textile demand is likely to strengthen again and with it demand for cotton
7577294 so as global cotton prices react to any future cut in supply u s cotton growers will be ideally placed to benefit
7577295 is not epidemic this year but it is more common than during the years 2004 through 2007
7577296 so the infection concern is not just the leafhoppers that come down from the foothills
7577297 its not a good idea to cut back on water during fruit set
7577298 a tomato crop is most sensitive to water stress during fruit set
7577299 and attempting to save water by reducing irrigation during fruit set is strongly discouraged
7577300 a substantial level of moisture stress can be imposed with minimal loss of productivity
7577301 most fields can tolerate irrigation of only 40 percent to 60 percent of eto during this period with minimal problem fields with high water holding capacity and good rooting depth may be able to deal with as little as 25 percent of eto over the final six weeks
7577302 if the water table is non saline late season deficit irrigation poses little risk of serious yield decline
7577303 however if the water table is saline a much larger yield loss is possible with an aggressive irrigation cutback also deficit irrigation at the end of the 2008 season will leave the root zone with a high ec thereby increasing next years water requirement

7577313 were starting to see the impacts of climate change in the late winter and early spring particularly in the southwest its a season specific kind of drought

7577371 bethesda clearly has a solid understanding of the appeal behind the franchise and has taken great steps towards recreating and even improving upon the most important aspects of the classic pc role playing games
7577372 and this is a time when we should be in unity behind our secular government
7577373 t heres no need for us to bring a presence to an event if theres no african americans involved
7577374 do you see do you see what we are capable of do you see just how much in step the youth of china is with our way of life
7577375 but if youre pro life conservative and or republican you certainly dont want barack obama joe biden nancy pelosi and harry reid running the country if a mccain lieberman ticket is the best way to thwart that prospect you could probably learn to live with it even perhaps to like it
7577376 red hot smokin wife carley who is a stone cold fox
7577377 at some point both candidates would probably push to put physicians into a statistical fishbowl
7577378 the average american doctor still practices behind a veil of complete secrecy
7577379 within the next five years more and more doctors will find that veil of secrecy pulled back their outcomes will be known
7577380 the candidates opposing visions of healthcare reform reflect fundamentally different assumptions about the virtues and vices of markets and government
7577381 it would essentially be a private market solution with the exception that he adds a government program for americans who are comfortable with that
7577382 by itself the adoption of more health information technology is generally not sufficient to produce significant cost savings
7577383 prevention better care for chronic conditions are enhanced aspirations rather than concrete policies for controlling costs
7577384 the prospects of reform getting enacted with mccain is less likely because you will have a divided congress
7577385 junkie pothead thats where id been headed the final fatal role of the young would be black man
7577386 biden is very well aware that his sons deployment is going to be a big part of what we do in october its part of our narrative and were going to milk it for all its worth
7577387 its common knowledge out here obamas ranked as the most liberal member of the senate by the national journal
7577388 they make carter mondale look like a couple of right wingers
7577389 these attacks are devastating as they go straight to the heart of voters concerns that obama is not ready to be president
7577390 codeine itself doesnt have any pain relieving effects but our body changes it into morphine and thats what combats the pain
7577391 the problem is that your genetic makeup makes more or less of it
7577392 so this is where the risk lies because you cant know in advance what that predisposition would be unless you would do a genetic test which is not standard routine at this point so while it would not be a problem in all cases i would say that codeine cannot be considered a safe drug for some mothers who are breast feeding their infants
7577393 a major factor has been the change in cheerleading activity which now involves gymnastic type stunts if these cheerleading activities are not taught by a competent coach and keep increasing in difficulty catastrophic injuries will continue to be a part of cheerleading
7577394 often patients think psoriasis is just a rash but it is a systemic inflammatory disease with far reaching affects
7577395 patients should be aware of that and understand that controlling that systemic inflammation can help with other diseases
7577396 redhook seasonal craft beers are carefully blended to tie a robust full flavor with a particular time of year late harvest pairs perfectly with the crispness of autumn thanks to its rich complexity of specialty malts
7577397 with our expanded distribution on the west coast craft beer fans across the country can look forward to this seasonal beer every year
7577398 given that our results are backed by numerous experimental studies showing that incense is a powerful producer of particulate matter and that incense smoke contains carcinogenic substances i believe incense should be used with caution
7577399 that is frequent use in rooms where people live should be minimized or at least sufficient ventilation should be secured in our study we find the increased risk of cancer to be present in individuals reporting frequent use of incense for many years thus repeated exposure for years should probably be avoided
7577400 the american lung association is going to add it as a risk factor
7577401 its not nearly the danger of smoking a pack a day for 20 years but its a danger
7577402 there is now a wealth of evidence that climate change has had and will have further impact on a variety of allergenic plants
7577403 longer pollen seasons greater exposure and increased disease burden for late summer weeds such as ragweed
7577404 in my perspective its a great and special week for us
7577405 its like all the hard work it paid off unexpected hard work
7577406 there were photographers there and i told them exactly where i was going to go i said right there make sure you wait for me there its just a positive attitude
7577407 they kept telling me push push push and i was pushing to the limit
7577408 that was fun a lot of fun oh my god this is awesome weve been close so often we never lost faith this is great for detroit
7577409 we would not have won this race if helio hadnt driven the wheels off it when he needed to we will keep going and see where we end up at the end of the year
7577410 i think our approach next weekend is the same we go for broke thats the only thing that is going to get us where we need to be
7577411 it was definitely a bad day we lost a ton of points
7577412 this is a race thats very tough unfortunately we got the bad end of the stick i guess we just need to shrug it off and come back strong next week
7577413 i think if helio wins the next two races we just have to place fourth so we should be able to do that
7577414 we just have to stay behind him were ok we have a long way to go yet
7577415 fraser had two match points on me on one he lobbed me i chased it down and let a backhand rip
7577416 emmo who was watching the match thought my shot was going out but fraser volleyed it out and i was still in the match
7577417 i think he was surprised to make his and i was surprised to see it go in and he was even more surprised to see mine go in
7577418 i think we were both surprised i think we were both happy as well
7577419 i think the most important thing about it is that i keep putting myself in a good position and unfortunately somebody just seems to be able to come up with some spectacular playing when im out there on top
7577420 i hit it right where i wanted to and the speed i wanted to
7577421 it looked real good with about 4 or 5 feet to go and just curled left on me so it wasnt meant to be
7577422 at the end of the day i had a shot
7577423 thats what you ask yourself for and vijay just came out with the goods and youve just got to give hats off to him
7577424 its one of those deals where i couldnt get by him i couldnt get by him and i just had to ask myself would he do that to me
7577425 and he has before so thats the way it goes
7577426 whatever carls going to say hes sorry that he didnt want to race that way but he always does well take it well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
7577427 i think definitely you have to give a lot of credit to catcher geovany soto weve been working pretty well together im comfortable with him behind the plate i think a lot of it is mixing up pitches keeping them guessing
7577428 when he doesnt get behind in the count and throw a lot of balls its tough
7577429 he can throw anywhere from 88 to 91 and kind of sink it he can come with 95 to 97 its just tough to pick up he throws everything from the same arm angle
7577430 we wanted to shorten his stride its a simple little thing getting his hands set a little quicker so his swing is shorter more compact and into the ball
7577431 lou gave me his point of view on what he thought i should change
7577432 i was able to work on it a little bit in the cage but during the game i cant think of stuff like that while im at bat so i wasnt able to fully introduce what he told me
7577433 im getting pitches to drive and im not missing them
7577434 i said to myself get in the fairway get on the green and give yourself a chance because putting is what i do best
7577435 i knew if i hit it good enough with the way i putt i knew id have a chance
7577436 that putt was a lot more difficult than the one i had in regulation
7577437 it broke a couple feet its a pretty amazing putt to make in a playoff
7577438 its fun to show i can play that i can still make putts under pressure
7577439 that locks down the important swing state of delaware and puts the combined fatuous egotism of the ticket into overload territory
7577440 yesterday i tried on some jean pants on jack size 18 months thinking thats what hell wear this fall well they dont fit around his big fat tummy even though the legs are longer than his feet i checked the other pairs and all his pants dont fit i pulled out a 24 month pair and its the same width as the 18 month just has longer legs which is not what i need i need a clothes line for a fat short baby what am i going to do poor jack has to be resigned to stretch pants already oh and i had such cute jeans for him too that i bought before we had him now i just have to put them away and hope when he starts crawling that hell loose enough inches around the waist to fit into them

7577486 trust the government heck im in the government and i dont even trust it you dont have to believe in the government to be a good american you just have to believe in your country
7577487 its been a long campaign and the whole team are really pleased to be back home and very proud with what has been achieved
7577488 its really difficult to gauge the mood of the public but no one expected the level of this reception here
7577489 its quite overwhelming its an incredible reception youre living in a bubble in the olympic village and its only when you land and see quite how many people have turned up you realise its incredible
7577490 its been a long pressure build up and its going to be nice to switch off and see friends and family and do normal things again
7577491 i think thats ridiculous to be honest it seems crazy
7577492 i think ill have one or two days off and then its back to hard training for london
7577493 my london training cycle started the day i left the track as soon as i won my medal in athens i was preparing for beijing and london is only four years away
7577494 we had a great olympics but im sure well move on and be more successful in 2012
7577495 weve all been following team gb whilst theyve been in beijing
7577496 theyve done the uk proud and were so pleased to be delivering them back to home soil to the heroes welcome theyve earned
7577497 it has been frustrating we almost hit the target but you dont get medals for close
7577498 as we move up to it we want more and more young people in britain interested in sport
7577499 relations between mutambara and mugabe have been good lately its not inconceivable that the two agreed to work together in an attempt to retain control of parliament
7577500 the fact that the mdc won despite these tactics is certainly an important psychological victory for them and a big blow for mugabe
7577501 we have been informed they want to arrest 15 mps its all about the vote for the speaker nothing to do with the law
7577502 this arrogance has the potential of sinking the ship of our negotiations
7577503 mr shuah mudiwa has been released but the honourable elia jembere is still detained but we dont know where
7577504 you sit on that side you are now in the opposition
7577505 according to information at hand a one year and two month old son drew a bowl containing maize meal from the table and it accidentally fell on him
7577506 its nice to win knowing that i had to play well and then actually doing it
7577507 i had two weeks to try to impress nick the first is out of the way and i seem to have done that
7577508 i dont know if i have done enough but im going to gleneagles in better shape and hopefully he will take notice
7577509 there are only two picks so its a tight situation but im going to have to win in scotland to give myself a chance
7577510 as everybody knows its about winning ive no complaints ive not played well enough but theres one more event and ill certainly be giving it 101
7577511 my missus will be upset with me i told her id play well and see her tomorrow
7577512 its plan b it was not on my schedule to play these two weeks in europe but i came to do a job i didnt do it this week so ill do it next week
7577513 his physio has told him not to risk further damage by playing
7577514 theres just too much uncertainty out there creating all this volatility and whats adding to the volatility is were entering this holiday period the swings are exaggerated by the light volumes
7577515 you really need to see a resolution to those three issues or at least some type of clear picture to those issues

7577520 thank you sooooooooo much you mean the world to me schmoopy
7577521 it would be a mistake look if were going to do something about nuclear proliferation just to take one issue that i think is as important as any on the list weve got to have russia involved
7577522 in his first event since choosing joe biden as his vice presidential nominee barack obama attacked many of joe bidens own positions on national security issues we look forward to the debate between joe biden and barack obama over whether or not senator obama is qualified to be commander in chief unfortunately for americans the one area that is not up for debate on the democratic ticket is their shared opposition to new drilling safe nuclear power and their votes for higher taxes on the middle class
7577523 this is a guy whos used weapons of mass destruction this is a guy whos destabilized the whole neighborhood this is a guy who in a war with the iranians over 800 000 people on both sides were killed this is a guy who is an extreme danger to the world and this is a guy who is in every way possible seeking weapons of mass destruction that case in and of itself ought to be sufficient
7577524 if the president of the united states was saying four years ago clear evidence of mass destruction do we have any choice but to eliminate saddam hussein and the threat
7577525 i still believe that saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction
7577526 i still believe that saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction and that the war in iraq was justified
7577527 statement of senator joe biden on the white houses acknowledgment that iraq uranium assertion was wrong
7577528 i mean look the president had a choice and it was a tough choice when he came when 9 11 occurred he could either listen to the advice colin powell and shinseki and most of the uniformed military and john mccain as well and dick lugar and others or choose the advice of the vice president secretary of state the secretary of defense and others and he chose the wrong advice and this i think we need a fresh start to be able to gain any momentum on this war on terror and i dont think were going to see any change id feel a lot better if i knew that president bush was going to be elected and im not being solicitous if i knew he was going to start to listen to john mccain instead of the secretary of defense because they have totally different no i shouldnt say totally many have very different views of how to proceed and so i think youd see a difference in the way how you prosecute the war in iraq i think youd see a difference in how you dealt with homeland security and i think youd see a difference in terms of the cooperation with other nations in terms of getting the consensus on how to deal with controlling chemical biological nuclear weapons
7577529 i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic

7577603 jimmy wilkerson had a great preseason and that makes me believe he can have a real good regular season hes a hard working guy that can play inside and out hes really in the mix and hes really firing a lot of people up in our organization
7577604 we did go to mike clayton a lot we tried to toss him a reverse on third and 1 he made a big play in the end zone i thought one ball got away from him hes a heck of a receiver and hes going to be a big part of our football team
7577605 everybody talks about elbert i told cornerback aqib talib whats the deal man aqib made some big plays against a fine receiver in reggie williams tonight elberts in the mix hes in the mix and as we said earlier it will be a tough call for us hes got some good film out there and im sure that there are people in the league that like him
7577606 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7577607 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7577608 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7577609 hes truly humbled by the outpouring of support and wouldnt miss it for anything in the world
7577610 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7577611 a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7577612 there are a lot of delegates here who had passionate choices in an extended primary season
7577613 we feel confident that if we can demonstrate a record of change a record of vision a team of barack obama and joe biden can convince democrats republicans and independents to support a ticket of change in november
7577614 i am here because of the opportunities that my father had that my mother had you know we are who americans were supposed to be
7577615 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us

7577624 we want the european union and all states to recognise our independence this is a very positive moment for the eu it could follow russias example and also recognise abkhazia it is the only way to preserve stability and peace in the region
7577625 we recognise that full recognition is a very big demand of abkhazia for the eu at the moment
7577626 the eu could instead give a voice to abkhazia in various european forums and institutions
7577627 only georgia is invited to such forums while discussing the caucasus which is why the information the eu is receiving is biased and why the conflict became possible
7577628 the game is completely open but it would be much more reasonable for medvedev not to do so if he doesnt he holds onto a very powerful bargaining chip with regards to the eu and us and georgia itself
7577629 if he wants to turn a military victory into a diplomatic victory he will not recognise the rebel enclaves because it will then become extremely difficult for the eu to keep an open dialogue with moscow
7577630 what russia wanted was a division within nato if they go too far they will only achieve the opposite a unification within the alliance
7577631 even for the shanghai co operation organisation the china russia kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan and uzbekistan security alliance recognition would create problems for the same reasons that china was not happy with the wests recognition of kosovo beijing would also not be happy with russian recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia
7577632 the debate is ongoing in russia and we will not react as long as the debate is ongoing
7577633 a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in
7577634 russia should have recognized the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia long ago and should have followed it up with defense cooperation and assistance treaties long ago too
7577635 currently it is important for us that south ossetia should gain independence legally from the point of view of the world community
7577636 after this we shall be able to seek accession into the russian federation but this issue will be postponed for the future
7577637 only the international recognition of independence and sovereignty will give reliable international guarantees of security and free development rights improve the situation and ensure stability in the caucasian region
7577638 the situation in the caucasus will get much worse against the background of a most serious crisis in relations between russia and the united states and western europe

7577668 with the explosion of news sources blogs citizen journalism sites and news aggregators news readers are finding it increasingly difficult to find high quality accurate news online

7577696 its our belief that boxing will continue to be either the main or one of the two platforms that we use for a brand like tecate
7577697 it is a viewing occasion that brings value to the retailer and tecates distributor sales the consumer will go into the store to shop for this viewing occasion where a number of people are going to get together buy the pay per view and watch the fight all in all its been an amazingly successful program

7577714 the whole idea for the game was for the casual market but as we went on we realized that there werent any first person shooters on the market with good graphics on the wii
7577715 i think a lot of developers that make fpss on the wii say lets do this so the player can use the wii shooter and it doesnt work you lose half your control
7577716 i dont know if were going to use it or not its one of those things where its so new and were at the point in the project where we need to know what we have to play with
7577717 i think we have already established that we probably wont be doing the 1 1 ratio it was at e3 when they announced that and it was at that point where we were already too far into the project to retrofit it

7577727 no matter how good the package might have been if we couldnt get an agreement from the democrats that any future increases needed a two thirds vote of the legislature we couldnt agree to support it thats what happened
7577728 a reduction in spending is the other half of the equation
7577729 we need tax reform but we also must reduce the increase in spending it has to go hand in hand or it wont work
7577730 i think were getting close one of my biggest disappointments was the passage of the tax to support dirigo i truly believe thats money raised on the backs of maine people and spent on a program thats a failure we need to cover these people but we need to do it by opening up the free market to insurers by eliminating the guaranteed coverage for all mandate we came very close to passing that in the last term

7577821 este un an dificil in care trei patru segmente de piata sunt incetinite si nu merg la fel de bine ca anul trecut in primul semestru am continuat sa crestem dar in partea a doua a anului vom resimti mai acut problemele de pe piata din prima parte a anului situatia este valabila pentru toata piata dar strict la colliers ne propunem conservator sa atingem aceeasi cifra de afaceri si profit ca in 2007

7577824 commodity prices will remain high and volatile and market turbulence will go on through 2009
7577825 we are lowering our price target from 30 to 22 to reflect what we view to be a heightened risk profile owed to uncertainty regarding ratings the size of a potential capital raise and the ultimate cost of a de risking strategy especially for its credit default swap cds business

7577831 a message to the boys about how to deal with conflict
7577832 i spoke of the importance of finding better ways to deal with the inevitable conflict everyone faces and used the example of tony veitch to illustrate how a violent response to resolving disagreements is not the way to go

7577836 thats a bit of a leap from a group of boys having a fight to tony veitch i think theyre two totally different situations

7577858 creen en la escuela como un lugar de contenci n pero no por los conociemientos que les confieren no creen en el estado ni en las instituciones rescatan y respetan a los l deres naturales como el muchacho de la esquina el director t cnico del club de barrio la manzanera la maestra y es por este motivo que estamos armando con ellos un programa de 1500 tutores que son los m s cre bles para armar proyectos de 10 mil pesos

7577865 i spun around a few times then hit the ground pretty hard then he started running
7577866 there was the boner log and then the jump right after that was taking out a lot of people because the lip was super steep and it was hard to go that fast into steep lip like that i got lucky and had the right speed you had to brake a couple times into it because if you braked too much you cased and if you went too fast you would get bucked pretty bad so that was the hard part
7577867 personally i like crankworx a little more well this year at least last years bearclaw invitational was way better than crankworx 2007 i really like this course it is pretty tech but it needs a little love right now it hasnt broken in at all with crankworx they had three months which is plenty of time to dial it in this courses cherry has just been popped

7577875 theyre in the race now so weve got to re evaluate that for what it is
7577876 theres zero chance of it happening this year its something thats being talked about right now as the game is gaining popularity and looking like its going to be a hit

7578110 and if youre brave see if you can stick with your foray into social media abstention until you start to see your world opening back up again maybe in different ways
7578111 while many americans are living paycheck to paycheck to effectively protect ourselves for the future we need to start saving paycheck to paycheck
7578112 our study shows that americans are better at saving money when they are thinking about it month to month on an ongoing basis rather than a long term goal
7578113 we plan on pay raises work bonuses and other monies to come forward but we cannot be thinking this way we need to start saving money every day
7578114 planning too far in advance not only makes consumers over optimistic regarding how much they will save but it also makes them behave in more aggressive and risk seeking ways in other financial arenas
7578115 the easiest thing to do is to be a smarter consumer and make spending and saving decisions thoughtfully on a daily basis that extra cup of coffee every morning carpooling with a co worker and cutting out the extras
7578116 the harder and more prudent thing to do is to mindfully take a portion of your earnings each pay period and save it in the bank
7578117 americans cant solely depend on their retirement plan it will be painful but like that mortgage or car loan payment we need to start thinking about a savings transfer every pay period
7578118 because bats can detect objects with echolocation they seldom collide with man made structures
7578119 an atmospheric pressure drop at wind turbine blades is an undetectable and potentially unforeseeable hazard for bats thus partially explaining the large number of bat fatalities at these specific structures
7578120 given that bats are more susceptible to barotrauma than birds and that bat fatalities at wind turbines far outnumber bird fatalities at most sites wildlife fatalities at wind turbines are now a bat issue not a bird issue
7578121 slow reproductive rates can limit a populations ability to recover from crashes and thereby increase the risk of endangerment or extinction
7578122 in the best case scenario this would open up the window of time that people could recover and go back to normal functional status
7578123 but if youve seen this kind of thing as often as ive seen it over time you know what it is the instant you see it and you know what to do
7578124 pooling data on vocal imitation vocal convergence and compensation for noise suggests a wider cross species distribution of vocal production learning among mammals than has been generally appreciated
7578125 prescription sleeping pills can be important in certain situations but they can cause a lot of adverse effects and are not a long term solution for older people sleep medication can increase the risk of falling as well as interfering with other medicines
7578126 sleeping pills are not the best way to solve underlying problems like depression or painful conditions that are interfering with a good nights sleep
7578127 most people know that coffee cola or black tea can interfere with their sleep
7578128 but many do not realise that alcohol is one of the major causes of a bad nights sleep
7578129 acetylsalicylic acid aspirin is based on a plant stress hormone
7578130 i asked myself could there be other plant stress hormones that have clinical efficacy while various studies have suggested that aspirin can prevent cancer especially colon cancer i realized that there could be a chance to find a potent plant hormone that could fight cancer even better i pinpointed jasmonate
7578131 the jasmonate compound is used widely in agriculture and in cosmetics
7578132 proven to be non toxic it has the same regulatory status as table salt that and the fact we are working on a natural chemical gives us a good starting point for launching a new drug
7578133 has already been shown to have selective anticancer activity in preclinical studies and this finding may stimulate the development of a novel class of small anticancer compounds
7578134 if there is a real commitment to protect all children then supporting families and children before they reach the point of being abused and neglected should be a priority
7578135 we already know many of the risk factors for child abuse and neglect and in many cases we could identify many children who are most vulnerable before theyre even born
7578136 the current approach does little to prevent abuse but focuses on intervening once much of the harm has already been done an approach that in my view is both unethical and inhumane
7578137 while urgent action is needed to protect children being abused and neglected we need to broaden adult focussed services such as alcohol and drug treatment mental health corrections homelessness family violence etc so that they can enhance the parenting of their clients
7578138 we also need to use health promotion campaigns with messages such as alcohol and children dont mix given that one in eight australian children now lives in a household with at least one adult who is regularly binge drinking
7578139 child abuse and neglect needs to be attacked in the same comprehensive way we have tackled other serious health issues such as smoking or coronary heart disease that is to identify the risk factors promote a range of interventions and change community attitudes
7578140 the lower fertility and growth rates among the creatures exposed to contaminants is probably a stress response
7578141 these crustaceans are sensitive to heavy metals such as copper cadmium and zinc and scientists use them as a test organisms for assessing the toxicity of marine sediments says ms chung

7578164 its not in our hands top four finish but weve given ourselves an opportunity if we win our last game it makes it very interesting and were looking forward to it
7578165 theres an awful lot of ability and resolve in that side and that showed in the second half
7578166 we were dreadful for large parts of the game and we were very lethargic but the response was fantastic
7578167 we were fairly good in the first half but we didnt take some good enough decisions on our last plays we had the opportunity to put the boot in but we came up with some really poor kicks
7578168 we didnt get as excited without the ball as we did with the ball and thats been an issue for the last six or seven weeks
7578169 i think weve made progress this year were disappointed with some performances but sometimes weve exceeded expectations

7578179 across a range of sports we found that wearing red is consistently associated with a higher probability of winning
7578180 my father worked on various sports commissions for probably 35 years to get a pro team for this town it was one of his dreams now sometimes in life you have to do what you have to do but i would consider it a personal defeat if we ended up in that situation
7578181 anybody who votes for mike babcock is a joke arace reed and portzline could coach that club to 48 regular season wins easy wed get beat in the second round of the playoffs but
7578182 we need to make sure that the maclean years didnt irreparably damage the hockey fanbase in this town before we can offer guarantees but i think it should be ok

7578185 whether the kid is disabled or unruly or just being a hormonal teenager the state is saying hey we have a really easy option for you
7578186 if we save one child from being abused its well well worth it
7578187 the main interest i have is that it gives the mother or a parent another option of what to do with a child before they do something drastic
7578188 circumvents every rational practice in child welfare that im aware of
7578189 drafters will sometimes try to say as little as possible so they dont create ambiguity but drafters here succeeded in writing the law in such a limited fashion that the entire provision is ambiguous

7578191 im not sure the safe haven law is really going to help in a majority of cases
7578192 you didnt clean your room thats it im droppin you off at the orphanage eventhough your 19
7578193 it is fantastic anybody who was worried doesnt need to be worried about this film i cannot talk about it was in very capable hands the director did a phenomenal job the director and his crew top notch cast and the guy that plays the lead is an instant star that dude is going to be so famous he is so wonderful he picked up a role that i would say is pretty challenging for someone to step into the shoes of because it is a role that has been played before many times by the same guy

7578230 the battle over who becomes president does not take place only among the citizens of this nation it takes place among groups such as the council on foreign relations the trilateral commission and the bilderberg group let me tell you something the cheney pnac cabal stole the elections from george h w bush james baker george schultz and associates not from the democrats they are the ones who assembled the bush administration and rigged the 2000 election to place them in power as a proxy presidential administration the problem was that the neocons once in office took control and did what they wanted to do not what their sponsors wanted them to do here is how it used to work the media which is controlled by the real power brokers in this nation have controlled elections in the past by presenting and withholding selected information from the public in order to influence their voting by doing so they pretty much guarantee the outcome of an election do you think that if the media did their job and actually informed the public accurately about who george w bush was and what his qualifications were he would have stood a chance of becoming a us president this guy was less qualified to be president than britney spears is qualified to be a parent
7578231 america needs to spend a little time on the couch reassembling its shattered psyche and reconnecting with its inner self that means sorting through the rubble of the bush years and getting back to basics a strong commitment to justice human rights and personal liberty
7578232 there really is only one answer deep inside we love war
7578233 an investment of 41 million in fertilizer research through 1981 returned an incredible 57 billion to u s agriculture
7578234 that doesnt include benefits of the technology to the rest of the world
7578235 tvas fertilizer program is recognized as one of the most effective research and development programs of any u s agency its benefits to the world far outweigh the public investment that the united states made in fertilizer research and development
7578236 its time to launch a radical initiative to develop a new generation of energy efficient fertilizers to help avert hunger and famine
7578237 tva technology fueled the sweeping advances of u s farmers in food and fiber production in the 60s to 80s
7578238 today fertilizers are responsible for more than a third of total u s crop production
7578239 the 57 billion return from a 41 million investment included about 49 billion from use of high analysis fertilizers and 8 billion from process development and improvement thats a benefit cost ratio of more than 20 to 1
7578240 tva followed promising new fertilizers from conception to production to national acceptance by farmers and the fertilizer industry
7578241 its program was based on fundamental research followed by process development and technology transfer
7578242 tva then stopped work on that project and moved to develop newer and more promising technologies
7578243 i am concerned about the state of the fertilizer industry itself
7578244 work should begin now on the next generation of fertilizer products using advanced techniques such as nanotechnology and molecular biology especially in conjunction with plant genetics research smart fertilizer products that will release nutrients only at the time and in the amount needed should be developed
7578245 the world needs a major research effort to improve the effectiveness of fertilizer production and use
7578246 fertilizer is a commodity industry and it is unlikely the industry alone will undertake the research some public investment is probably required
7578247 to decisively step up investment in science and technology for food and agriculture
7578248 the need for increased food is escalating but new agricultural technology is not keeping pace
7578249 an effective research program to develop a new range of fertilizers should be a key element of any long term strategy to alleviate the food crisis
7578250 most fertilizer products used today were developed when energy seemed abundant and cheap but with rising prices we should develop a new generation of fertilizer products that use plant nutrients more efficiently
7578251 such innovations will require investments in research but such costs would be miniscule compared to the benefits for humanity

7578272 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7578273 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7578274 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7578275 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7578276 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7578277 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7578278 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7578279 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7578280 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7578281 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7578282 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7578283 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7578284 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
7578285 no one works for someone we all just work together
7578286 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
7578287 all night any mention of a war past or prospective touches off enthusiasm among the delegates so ecstatic that it often seems delirious
7578288 we the people must keep hope alive the pain of a hungry baby whether white black or brown hunger hurts we want a democracy of the many and not the aristocracy of the few all blood is royal blood its so basic we want to share hold on dont surrender your dreams
7578289 secret gift of good wishes to every woman lucky enough to enjoy wearing and loving one of his exclusive designs
7578290 my practice is concerned with exploring the fascination that the british public has with american popular culture and the sub cultural world of fandom
7578291 in the images i have shown people in their own homes and environments wearing costumes that they would be dressed in to attend events with other like minded individuals it seeks to offer a glimpse into seemingly ordinary lives of my subjects and allows the private to become public the work hints at the depth of peoples fantasies and the methods they employ to adopt this culture as part of their own lifestyle as a means of escapism
7578292 i take it and once ive got about 20 to 30 ill bring it to the bank and put it in my bank account for college
7578293 i find that for every person who calls you or writes a letter there are 100 that feel the same
7578294 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7578295 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7578296 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7578297 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7578298 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7578299 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7578300 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7578301 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7578302 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7578303 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7578304 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7578305 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7578306 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7578307 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
7578308 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
7578309 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
7578310 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7578311 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7578312 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7578313 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7578314 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7578315 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7578316 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7578317 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7578318 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7578319 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7578320 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7578321 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7578322 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7578323 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7578324 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7578325 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7578326 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7578327 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7578328 how dangerous such so called frozen conflicts can be given that the georgian leadership as they say went crazy
7578329 that decision is not going to help things it only adds to the tension in the region
7578330 we will take any decision including up to a complete break in relations
7578331 there has been a dramatic worsening of our relations but we are not to blame
7578332 the whole reason i invented ribbon ring was because i couldnt manage my own collection of ribbon i needed the ribbon at my fingertips and neatly organized i came up with a solution and it works great

7578334 th fuck riley were you stuck in a doctors office this morning with only one magazine to read
7578335 we went in with too few troops dismantled iraqs army bureaucracy and state owned factories arrested tens of thousands of iraqis mistreated and tortured some of them and used overwhelming military force against all perceived threats
7578336 the finest secretary of defense this nation has ever had
7578337 lo vamos a plantear estoy convencido de que estamos en la obligaci n de eliminar la inmunidad de proceso a los congresistas el parlamento no puede seguir funcionando bajo ese manto
7578338 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7578339 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7578340 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7578341 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7578342 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7578343 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7578344 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7578345 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7578346 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7578347 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7578348 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7578349 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7578350 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7578351 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7578352 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7578353 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7578354 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7578355 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7578356 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7578357 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7578358 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7578359 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7578360 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7578361 our schedule is currently on track abdulla al gurg said in an interview with the associated press
7578362 we want this golf course to play fast quick he said while remaining appealing to a broad range of players
7578363 the tiger woods dubai is catering toward a niche market gurg said adding that the developers were in no hurry but were
7578364 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7578365 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7578366 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7578367 relations between mutambara and mugabe have been good lately its not inconceivable that the two agreed to work together in an attempt to retain control of parliament
7578368 the fact that the mdc won despite these tactics is certainly an important psychological victory for them and a big blow for mugabe
7578369 we have been informed they want to arrest 15 mps its all about the vote for the speaker nothing to do with the law
7578370 this arrogance has the potential of sinking the ship of our negotiations
7578371 mr shuah mudiwa has been released but the honourable elia jembere is still detained but we dont know where
7578372 you sit on that side you are now in the opposition
7578373 one of the prevalent themes at gc was the emergence of the internet as a distribution platform for video games
7578374 while an increasing number of titles will be offered simultaneously through online and traditional retail channels e g spore the sims 3 socom we believe digital downloads are likely to remain a small part of the overall software market for the next several years
7578375 romney a former massachusetts governor and member of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints overwhelmingly won nevadas jan 19 republican caucuses running away with 51 percent of the vote
7578376 it is embarrassing to the state and embarrassing to himself he has no solutions i am not surprised by the results
7578377 if we create or become a mirror image of the religious right we have failed
7578378 but if we have increased the number of chairs around the table then weve succeeded
7578379 people of faith are being engaged in the convention in a new and robust way and its because of senator obamas acknowledgment that people of faith and values have an important place in american public life
7578380 now theres a genuine interest in speaking with groups and religious groups who were previously considered enemies
7578381 there still is a possibility that obama will chip into the republican advantage with this religious outreach
7578382 even if he gains just a few points that could be decisive in a close election
7578383 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7578384 this is a planning took where all things are going
7578385 you cant find a more regular guy than joe biden
7578386 he would be the kind of guy you would expect to find in the parish hall in the neighborhood that kind of personality when combined with the kind of reflective christianity barack obama has demonstrated is a winning combination
7578387 is as close to were going to be able to get as a society
7578388 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that
7578389 but his record of support for so called abortion rights while mixed at times is seriously wrong i certainly presume his good will and integrity and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion

7578395 the concept is flexible and the network of the global games industry permits us to be active at different locations after the southeast asian games convention we are now focusing on the north american market
7578396 the gc games convention will be back in leipzig again in 2009
7578397 the industry and visitors are giving us their clear support to continue with the fair in leipzig
7578398 do you think there should be a gc in leipzig in 2009
7578399 anyone who has experienced the enthusiastic mood in the exhibition halls over the last seven years knows this fair belongs in leipzig
7578400 the fairs and conferences in leipzig are becoming increasingly international and attract more and more visitors were pleased with this development i completely agree with the governor of the free state of saxony stanislaw tillich that we will do everything to help this new cultural sector and the gc games convention to achieve further success
7578401 the concept is flexible and the network of the global games industry permits us to be active at different locations after the southeast asian games convention we are now focusing on the north american market

7578405 joining both components on the same die doesnt buy you that much its not like theres a real bottleneck there and every square millimeter you add to the die is a very expensive millimeter its an incremental expense not a linear function its cheaper to separate them
7578406 the class of buyer who buys that type of graphics isnt really buying graphics they dont care about it youre working out what you can really afford to put on a cpu and youre selling it to a customer who doesnt care the economics dont make sense
7578407 theres an incredible amount about larrabee thats undefined you cant just say its x86 so its going to solve the massively parallel computing problem
7578408 intel is not a stupid company theyve put a lot of people behind this so clearly they believe its viable but the products on our roadmap are competitive to this thing as theyve painted it the reality is going to fall short of the optimistic way theyve painted it
7578409 as peter glaskowsky said the large larrabee in 2010 will have roughly the same performance as a 2006 gpu from nvidia or ati
7578410 what i actually described as equating to the performance of a 2006 vintage graphics chip was a performance standard defined by intel itself running the game f e a r at 60 fps in 1600 x 1200 pixel resolution with four sample antialiasing
7578411 roughly the same performance as a 2006 gpu from nvidia or ati
7578412 we underestimated ati with respect to their product weve looked very closely at this and we know there are certain things we can do better there will be improvements to things from all angles there are some easy fixes in the software domain that will soon be forthcoming believe me its a very prime focus of ours
7578413 ati did not spend on things like physx and cuda but we believe that people value things beyond graphics if you compare only on graphics thats a relative disadvantage to us but the notion of what you measure a gpu on will change and evolve we are forward looking and sometimes when someone is forward looking they get a little bit ahead of the game and thats kind of where we are
7578414 t he practice of arbitrary imprisonments have been in all ages the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny
7578415 when we look ten years into the future maybe yes i may well end up spending more time on the metal gear series
7578416 i always intend to stay true to these statements i do always say what i actually feel at that time after each metal gear when i say i am going to move on to the next project
7578417 but its like when hayao miyazaki says he is not going to do more and then always ends up doing it
7578418 i can also say that if theres any way we can reward the community well go there
7578419 if the people are clamouring for big chunks of content it would make total sense for us to do it
7578420 were just exploring all options at this point sequels yeah why not dlc why not paid for content why not
7578421 t he practice of arbitrary imprisonments have been in all ages the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny
7578422 unfortunately i never meshed with the rest of the station so rather than continue working there i asked them to buy me out of the remaining 14 months of my contract we were able to reach a deal this week and my time at wftl is now over leaving wftl will free me up to do even more with cbs4 news i wish the folks at wftl all the best
7578423 t he practice of arbitrary imprisonments have been in all ages the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny
7578424 people say well why do we always get things last why cant we say things well ive said this many times before sometimes its an advantage to be last in europe you know
7578425 this time we do have things to say in the european market we have the music service and were doing great things on singstar and theres more to come these are global announcements
7578426 they recognize that the shows in europe whether its in leipzig cologne or london we can do the announcements wherever
7578427 i never want to say that but its as bad as it can get as far as issues with the knee according to rod martin trainer unfortunately it will be a long process
7578428 hes had so many things like this happen to him hes had a lot of tough breaks injury wise he was on a one year contract so this was very tough for him
7578429 so it would be tough to only go with two guys who have played before

7578432 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
7578433 with kara by her side paula has some backup and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7578434 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7578435 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7578436 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7578437 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7578438 i surprised myself because of giving up a slider for a home run

7578458 ya los venezolanos le cerramos el paso a ese proyecto en el refer ndum de diciembre pasado pero el presidente insiste en su intenci n y por eso decimos que vamos a dar la pelea en el escenario que sea necesario para derrotarlo de nuevo
7578459 los venezolanos fuimos informados y concienciados en cuanto a la reforma constitucional y as como sucedi el a o pasado nosotros estamos comprometidos a divulgar los alcances y contenido de estas 26 leyes lo vamos a hacer los partidos pol ticos la sociedad organizada y todos los venezolanos

7578461 i think you are a sexist misogynist dinosaur a relic from the cold war
7578462 the woman who had dominated discussions for so long could no longer lead debates or keep up with the thread of a drinks party conversation
7578463 on bad days she could hardly remember the beginning of a sentence by the time she got to the end
7578464 watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof
7578465 losing dad was truly awful for mum not least because her dementia meant she kept forgetting he was dead

7578470 the entire area has become more lively there are new markets new art shows and lots of small boutiques and galleries have suddenly emerged
7578471 the first step is always for artists to arrive then firms follow and finally people fill up the remaining flats
7578472 the kids in this neighbourhood dont have much offered to them
7578473 thats where i come in i can teach them how to make candles

7578482 you dont want to be known as the developer that screwed up star wars as a developer youre only as good as your last project
7578483 i think were entering into an interesting time when it is possible for a meaningful interaction between filmmakers and game makers
7578484 nowadays filmmakers and game developers are using maya and motion capture so theres a real potential for this kind of stuff to be shared i think they can add to each other
7578485 on a lot of other games we could spend that time prototyping new features
7578486 but we had to narrow the scope of the game and i actually think that was a good thing we had to focus exactly on the things that were fun and make them the center of the title
7578487 if you produce bad games you will not keep the licensor of course there are restrictions time budget and scope sometimes you have a very tight timeline and you cant move a films release date to suit the game nor are you likely to get more budget out of them so in the end the only thing you can modify is the scope
7578488 a video game is part of an overall licensing strategy but its also a revenue stream
7578489 typically a license will require everything to be subject to the film studios approval
7578490 from our perspective because we sell our own games as well as develop we try and work out the conversation rate of the consumers how many of the licenses fans are going to be gamers and what type of game is going to suit them best
7578491 one of the biggest disappointments is that the film didnt do very well were actually sitting 40 points higher than the film on metacritic
7578492 you dont need to get iron man to reach the hardcore gamer you get iron man to reach another audience its a shame that audience isnt really represented in the reviews you read
7578493 wal mart or target are looking for licenses because thats something thats going to stand out on shelves
7578494 historically weve always only dealt with the publishers but starting with speed racer weve been talking with the filmmakers we got a lot of time with the wachowski brothers and that was fantastic
7578495 we needed to produce extra racers to round out the world and the filmmakers used those in the film
7578496 lucasarts and ilm industrial light amp magic were originally based closely and i think that was the goal
7578497 its like being given a sandbox with action figures to create play but there are always restrictions in place

7578507 cest vrai l ducation sexuelle nest pas la hauteur en chine a l cole secondaire on enseigne la biologie et les sciences naturelles mais il ny a pas d ducation sexuelle proprement dite le r sultat est que beaucoup de jeunes ne connaissent pas le fonctionnement de leur corps

7578586 its a case of goodbye beijing hello sydney for 35 plus australians
7578587 you dont have to be a young elite athlete to have an olympic style experience
7578588 the sydney 2009 world masters games are open to mature age people of all abilities so were calling on australians flush with olympic spirit to get out there and have a go
7578589 theres no doubt he can start a test hes perfectly capable of that
7578590 it was great for timana to get the time that he got
7578591 we delayed his entry obviously and deferred to the blokes who had the background of test rugby first with the initial replacement option
7578592 but when timana got in the game my first instinct was that he did really well having watched it live
7578593 well have a look at the footage and pour over it and contemplate our combinations and what we believe will work for us
7578594 i think ive taken my opportunities this year so hopefully if i get a spot we can make it another good win
7578595 i see myself as a 13 but obviously stirlings captain and also had a great game yesterday but i could slot in at 12 or any other place in the backline
7578596 we can swap any time i can go 12 he can go 13 were both big centres and get over the advantage line and i think thats a bonus for us
7578597 i know that you can change at the very last minute but he wasnt listed as one of the subs
7578598 its something i probably need to talk to the ffa about just to have a clarification about that ruling but certainly we know that you can make a change right up to just before the game starts
7578599 once again franky farina has done a shifty on us
7578600 no i would prefer a little bit more clarification even if you have a fifth subsititute named so at least we know that hes actually testing and theres a possibility that he might start the game
7578601 in that situation i would prefer to know whos lining up where because even craig moore with one leg is probably just as good as a centre back or a pairing at the back
7578602 he adds a lot of experience and i would have preferred craig moore not be there
7578603 i think there were incidents in athens which cost medals and it relates really to the cruelty aspect i think rather than performance enhancing as i understand it
7578604 its pleasing that the international equestrian federation has prohibited drugs and that thats being enforced
7578605 this is certainly a serious blow to the sport and we are well aware of the possible implications for the sport and its position in the olympics
7578606 the four cases tested positive for the same substance i dont know if we can say its a trend but it contributes to the seriousness of the case
7578607 i think hes got as good a title shot as anybody
7578608 its tough to play perfect for five years in a row hes only done it four years in a row atop the atp rankings
7578609 its a tough situation when youve made 17 straight semi finals in slams or whatever it is now and if youre not thinking about it being asked about it every day is bound to go into your head a little bit
7578610 but i think one big result and its turned right around for him
7578611 i probably played average in those two events but it definitely helped me get back into match shape
7578612 just playing points in the rhythm of a match i think that helped
7578613 obviously theres a couple of teams that are top that have dominated the competition for the last 18 months
7578614 we give ourselves every chance and as long as we prepare right well take it as it comes
7578615 we probably havent put a full game together which weve been really happy with but theres definitely three quarters or half a game which is how wed like to play our football
7578616 and i think weve been putting some good scores on the board and also stopping the opposition so if we can do that for four quarters well give ourselves every chance to be successful
7578617 we were obviously a little up and down towards the start of the year and i think with two breaks this year weve come back pretty well and won seven of our last nine games
7578618 so its definitely positive and hopefully weve got a little bit more improvement in us
7578619 i dont know a lot about our position and what we need to happen but i think we need a few teams to lose and for us to have a pretty comfortable win
7578620 i feel were probably one of the teams and i think theyre all about the same really between fourth and twelfth we could have finished anywhere up to fourth
7578621 were going to finish tenth or eleventh so therefore thats a failure
7578622 weve failed to end up where i think were capable of doing
7578623 we had seven games that have been decided by less than two goals and we lost three and won four
7578624 theyre the ones you tend to think if youre in front with a few minutes to go thats where you feel like you should be able to now protect the lead for a few minutes
7578625 one of the things that you always do at the end of the season and players should as well is ask how many players had career best years or how many players played as well as they have before
7578626 over the whole season there would be more that would look back and say no i didnt have a great year
7578627 some might say i had a poor year some might say i had an okay year but there would only be a handful that probably have felt yeah this is my best year that ive had in my footy career
7578628 i feel like weve got more upside in our players than weve got logical downsides so i still think were on the up
7578629 what i expected i saw out on the field in england you never say first versus last is easy
7578630 the top teams only lose two or three games a season and we have missed an outstanding chance
7578631 chelsea have had a bad day in my opinion but one piece of brilliance by deco has won it for them
7578632 micah was a little bit groggy obviously but the paramedics did their job there are always concerns when you see incidents like this
7578633 i do not think any one of my players can hold their hands up and say they performed
7578634 ive spoken to kerry about his situation and hes publicly stated he wants to stay at the west coast eagles and hes contracted to the football club for another year so im not so sure what all the fuss is about
7578635 its something i cant control hes a very important player to this football club and im confident hell be at west coast next year
7578636 he judd was a victorian guy and he went home for family reasons kerr is a west australian bloke and he loves this football club and im confident hell be here next year
7578637 kerrys his own person and im sure hell make the right decision for himself
7578638 something drastic has to happen for him not to be here next year
7578639 hes a loyal person he could have gone back to victoria i think at 20 21 for the big bucks but he stayed loyal to the football club
7578640 it was disappointing we couldnt win for him hes been a terrific player for this football club for a long time and i thought his final effort that mark he sort of ran back with the flight of the football to take just summed up what the guys all about
7578641 yeah ive not been as good as last year that would be true the time spent in football and worrying about football has probably increased 10 20 per cent but the output and the results have certainly decreased probably 50 per cent or whatever it is
7578642 so its not necessarily the harder you work the better results you get in coaching it depends on a lot of factors but there have been some positives
7578643 weve worked really well as a coaching group theres been a real united feel about the group which is fantastic for us
7578644 theres opportunities for people to be divisive and have their own agendas and maybe listen to outside influences but thats been good and the ability to be able to help develop our new coaching group and also our younger players thats been good
7578645 coachings a little bit of you put some time in and it all blossoms some time in the future
7578646 we played geelong first up and we lost by 120 points the first time the grand final and lost by only about 10 the second so you think gee theyre probably into it for the year
7578647 my analysis would be those early games and maybe it was that game certainly then we lost the second game easily we came back the crows game we were a chance to win and maybe even the next game
7578648 there were some close calls where we didnt quite get over the line and when you add that up to the disappointment at the end maybe then it started to kick in
7578649 since 1992 the boks have done themselves no favours when it comes to being branded the thugs of test rugby the facts are damning in the decade since readmission the boks have been involved in at least one match a year marred by fighting or ill discipline during this time bok players have been sent off cited and suspended for indiscretions ranging from punching to biting to kicking to swearing at the referee
7578650 the boks are not necessarily dirtier than any other side but they must be a lot dumber as they always seem to get caught statistics from 2000 to 2003 attest to bok brutality in forty one tests leading into the 2003 world cup the boks had twenty players yellow carded and two red carded for ill discipline the opposition in these forty one tests lost only ten players to yellow cards
7578651 well if you want to grab my balls then of course im going to blow up thats not your go schalk youre a better player than that
7578652 the next shock is going to be bigger and bigger still
7578653 the shocks keep getting bigger because we keep propping things up and bailing everyone out
7578654 guys were making too many mistakes here in the u k
7578655 oh my god were going to go down and if we go down the whole system goes down
7578656 okay got to print some more money got to save the day

7578670 sports is one of the most popular interests in the school this can be seen by the fact that the athletes needs are met through designing special programs consideration of their needs consideration of their teachers competitions and placing the school athletics program high on our list of priorities
7578671 sports is as popular a subject as communications and electronics but sports raise school pride while other areas of study do not

7578685 any time you have 600 athletes competing in 31 sports youre going to have disappointments and youll have surprises along the way
7578686 we may have been disappointed based on the outcomes but were not disappointed in any team or individual
7578687 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future
7578688 the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic
7578689 you have a question of unlimited need and limited resources
7578690 they have a lot more to spend now and they like spending it on sports
7578691 and more and more countries are winning them there are only so many to win if the chinese are winning more someones winning less and here in beijing we didnt step it up like they did
7578692 team sports are extremely popular in america and because of our culture its where we place our emphasis
7578693 but its far easier and less expensive to train one individual than it is 30 or 18 in a team sport

7578697 mit dem granatapfel war ich nicht so happy war geschmacklich nicht schlecht allerdings habe ich nicht so wirklich eine nische daf r gefunden da er ja grob gesagt nur roter saft ist ich habe ihn in verschiedenen alkoholfreien drinks vermixt die allen gut geschmeckt haben aber brauche ich nicht zum leben
7578698 die aromen waren oder besser sind toll und sind auf jeden fall geeignet zum mixen
7578699 is a reflection of increased sales of foreclosed homes at very low prices rather than a pick up in the regular private sales market but they all count
7578700 the rebound in existing home sales does not indicate the beginning of a recovery in the housing market as the level of excess supply continues to rise and sales prices keep falling suggesting that the downward adjustment in prices is not over
7578701 sales have picked up significantly in several florida and california markets home prices generally follow sales trends after a few months of lag time
7578702 inventory remains high in many parts of the country and will require time to fully absorb we expect more balanced conditions in 2009 and will eventually return to normal long term appreciation patterns
7578703 we hope the new tools in the hands of home buyers from the recently enacted housing stimulus package will spark a sustained sales uptrend in the months ahead
7578704 this report has confirmed my belief that a fossil fuel based economy is not compatible with our personal well being
7578705 canadians will benefit immensely by an immediate shift towards a green economy which relies on sustainable energy inputs
7578706 we are definitely disappointed by australia because they have not toured us for 10 years
7578707 australia have a commitment of playing five one day internationals in april next year so we hope by then their fears are removed and they play in our country
7578708 what were all hoping now is the situation in pakistan allows us to go there next year
7578709 the former president is now resigned were all hoping the civil
7578710 we havent had a senior australian team in pakistan for a long time
7578711 whether to stand him down or sack him were always considerations for the club and the board and the coaching staff
7578712 at this point in time we dont have all the facts and obviously its important that we do have all the facts before any further action is determined
7578713 he certainly wont be training or playing with the nrl team and i would say its highly unlikely hed play again this year
7578714 certainly if these allegations are proven then we are certainly into the territory of looking at not only his future at that club but his future in the game
7578715 obviously these are very serious allegations its now a matter for the courts but i certainly support the action of the sharks in standing the player down
7578716 it is a bit of a kick in the teeth luckily ive still got my teeth
7578717 from what i understand it was pretty cut and dried circumstances and the matters were not contested by the player
7578718 from what i understand happened this morning at court greg and his counsel said that he would be strongly denying the allegations
7578719 without greg birds qualities as a footballer it makes it a lot tougher for us its another obstacle we have to face
7578720 i nicoli l poate nlocui pe ne u nu mai lu m pe nimeni

7578722 sono infatti apparse su un maxischermo immagini di distruzione e di violenze intervallate dai volti di

7578724 odio dirti che ti amo perch significa che io sar con te per sempre oppure che dovr darti un triste addio
7578725 sono in cerca di qualcosa di unico e magico sono in cerca di un sogno di un desiderio nascosto xd sarebbe troppo facile non credi prima bisogna farsi viaggi assurdi e poi magari si opta per lopzione pi facile chiederglielo
7578726 its well known that when you drink you get a buzz but a couple of hours later that initial impact at least is gone
7578727 there is always a very delicate balance between newly formed cells and dying cells
7578728 its a very active period of that balance because usually you develop a surplus of tissue then later melt it back down to acquire a specific shape
7578729 the digits form because the inter digital tissue dies if it did not die we would have paddles instead of hands with fingers
7578730 you have to make people aware of the science behind the risk
7578731 we are not saying that every pregnant woman who drinks three or four glasses of wine in a short period will have a baby with birth defects but it elevates the risk
7578732 the limited success of existing therapy suggested to us that factors besides erbb2 or proteins that collude with erbb2 might nullify the effects of herceptin and lapatinib
7578733 our results might explain why the strategy of using erbb2 inhibitors alone to treat breast cancers has fallen short
7578734 these findings may also suggest a way to treat patients with advanced erbb2 positive tumors and those whove developed resistance to erbb2 inhibitors an idea that were eager to test
7578735 if erbb2 is the accelerator that makes the car move brk helps shift the gear to gain more speed
7578736 we might need to hit erbb2 expressing cancers with drugs against both erbb2 and brk
7578737 brk does not promote the proliferation of normal cells and its expression in normal tissues is restricted to non proliferating cells
7578738 produce fewer unwanted side effects than targeting other cancer promoting proteins
7578739 de dood van de jongeren is telkens weer een grote schok voor de omgeving het moet nu afgelopen zijn
7578740 de burgemeester alemanno van rome vindt het niet gek dat twee nederlandse toeristen beroofd zijn
7578741 biologists have known that in these beetles there is an investment trade off between secondary sexual characters and primary sexual characters
7578742 as horns get bigger copulatory organs get smaller or vice versa what was not known was how frequently and how fast this can occur in nature and whether this can drive the evolution of new species
7578743 in terms of the integrity of a species its important for these things not to change too much
7578744 so there is a lot of evidence suggesting that within species or within the populations of species natural selection maintains genital characters but if these primary sex characters are linked to other characters that can change readily then youve got what we think is a very exciting mechanism that could prime populations for reproductive isolation
7578745 if this is all it takes to change genitalia it may be easier to make new species than we thought
7578746 we made several improvements in the technique that could allow us to perform this type of procedure routinely
7578747 we traditionally try to save the kidney for smaller tumors performing a robotic partial nephrectomy
7578748 for larger tumors however patients would get a very large incision on their side now we can remove kidneys with cancer through a single three inch incision near the patients belly button
7578749 i think this is going to be a big advance for having to remove the entire kidney because of large kidney tumors this could be a great improvement over traditional open and laparoscopic surgeries
7578750 the robotic instruments are like having my hands inside the body
7578751 well good luck like i say thats in the past
7578752 right now were looking forward to playing the deshis bangladesh up in darwin
7578753 well get our chance in the next 15 months to play against the poms back in england
7578754 its a great result for all the players just to find out whether were going or not going
7578755 i think all the guys are happy now we know now the that icc cricket australia and aca would make a decision and theyve finally done that
7578756 its a tournament title australian currently holds and next year whenever they put it on well look forward to retaining that trophy
7578757 right now all the guys are rapt the icc has made a decision
7578758 all the guys have been in contact with brett whether its via text or phone and he knows everyone is supporting him

7578760 some people complain about the care theyve got it in their head that its not a good deal
7578761 people have to understand how many people they take care of it might be a little slower but the volume is just tremendous i think its amazing what they do
7578762 dont get me wrong everything is dollar driven to some extent
7578763 but there is never a push to discharge a patient here because of payment issues
7578764 to go to a va hospital when i started out i wouldnt have done it
7578765 today there is no difference the only difference is that the va has become a respectable medical community
7578766 those two things truly changed the whole focus of the va system
7578767 kizer was the one who said were not going to sit in our hospitals and treat patients
7578768 they have very good doctors and people are super friendly and accommodating
7578769 one of the big reasons is they dont have to worry about money but i think they realize that when they come in that were not making big money and were not driving bmws and they see that were trying to do the best we can for them
7578770 providing this is not something you would find out in the private sector insurance wouldnt cover that its a preventative intervention that i dont know that youll find anywhere else
7578771 people say to me you should get something for your service you deserve it
7578772 its frustrating to think this has been coming and we couldnt do anything we need to make health care a top priority for the community the state the entire legislature
7578773 our projection is we will run out of money by december that means we cant pay our vendors pay for blood pay for services
7578774 we need to be more efficient this crisis is about money make no mistake the challenge for us for the entire state is reimbursements we are the worst state
7578775 there is less money coming in the state is not in really strong financial situation
7578776 its painful the challenges are not new theres not going to be a silver bullet to get us out of this
7578777 i understand its not popular these are not short term solutions its going to take some time to develop strategic plans
7578778 were at the start we havent turned the corner yet but i think we can actually see where the corner is now
7578779 we keep treating it as if there is a big bucket of money up there and if you jump high enough youll tip some money your way but theres just isnt
7578780 if the giants make a sincere overture its a good chance that strahan would consider coming back
7578781 there are other things he has to take into consideration the money and his contract with fox but if the giants really want him they have a shot its not out of the question
7578782 i havent heard from anybody else so to say if i would or wouldnt is premature
7578783 i did talk to him on the phone a short while ago and told him that he is in everyones thoughts and prayers
7578784 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7578785 but after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure and the right way to go
7578786 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7578787 obviously he loves the giants and obviously he is working for fox
7578788 right now he is relaxing and getting ready for his fox gig
7578789 we are exceptionally pleased to be teaming up with more for our 2009 series
7578790 the magazine which celebrates women in their 40s and 50s really connects with the confident and contemporary women in our audience
7578791 this mutually rewarding alliance will allow us to benefit from many of merediths valuable assets while allowing more to reach its readership in an exciting new way
7578792 we view this as the beginning of a wonderful relationship providing a unique opportunity to truly bring the written word to life
7578793 more is delighted to partner with smart talk media as we celebrate the magazines 10th anniversary
7578794 the two properties are perfectly aligned both from the top notch roster of speakers to the upscale audience of women this lecture series attracts at more we feel anything that brings smart talk to the forefront of public dialogue is all to the good
7578795 its time to stop waiting nervously for others to start loving us they never will we have to become the people they depict us as being our next moves should be the following first we mustnt lose the tempo

7578804 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
7578805 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
7578806 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
7578807 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
7578808 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do

7578880 it was a big challenge for me to come to korea as i was doing plays and tv dramas in china but i thought i shouldnt miss this opportunity to play for my career so i decided to come to korea
7578881 there is basically no big difference between musicals and plays but the working style is a bit different between china and korea in a korean musical the production process is more interactive between an actor and a director
7578882 many chinese women including myself think korean dramas and films are so romantic so i longed to come to korea
7578883 but my korean co workers are so friendly and kind to me and they are so enthusiastic when we are doing rehearsals
7578884 during everyday life we constantly evaluate social behaviour and this largely affects how we feel about ourselves and other people
7578885 but the way we store and use information about our own and other peoples social behaviour are not well understood
7578886 this latest study used functional brain imaging to identify the circuits in the brain that underpin our ability to differentiate social behaviour that conforms to our values from behaviour that does not
7578887 the most distinctive feature of depressive disorders is an exaggerated negative attitude to oneself which is typically accompanied by feelings of guilt
7578888 now that we understand how the brains of healthy individuals respond to feelings of guilt we hope to be able to better understand why and where there are differences in brain activity in people suffering from or prone to depression
7578889 the brain region we have identified to be associated with proneness to guilt has been shown to be abnormally active in patients with severe depression in several previous studies but until now its involvement in guilt had been unknown
7578890 by translating these basic cognitive neuroscience insights into clinical research we now have the potential to discover new key functional anatomical characteristics of the brain that may lie behind depressive disorders
7578891 the results will hopefully make an important contribution to our understanding of the causes of depression that will ultimately allow new approaches to find better treatments and prevention
7578892 what will there be more interesting scenes to be seen here
7578893 since early in the season we identified the tour of spain as a major team goal weve had an excellent season to date and our riders are extremely motivated to end in winning fashion i think weve assembled a well balanced team that can accomplish our final major goal of 2008 we have riders for the mountains and flat stages as well as the experience of super champions like alberto contador andreas kl den and levi leipheimer
7578894 it was not an easy choice which really shows the strength of our team we have a lot of talented riders on team astana but johan and i decided that certain intangibles such as experience were very important this group knows what it takes to win the big races and im hopeful we can prove this in the next three weeks
7578895 this will be my 20th and last grand tour i am very grateful to all the riders staff sports directors and fans who have supported me throughout my entire career it is a true honor to have had the opportunity to race for johan lance and now alberto it has been a dream and i would love to complete my career with another grand tour victory
7578896 i have been focused on this race for a number of months ive spent time with the rest of the team and i feel that we are prepared and motivated for the next three weeks i am better prepared than i was for the tour of italy mentally but technically as well right now were not looking too far ahead but our goal is to win another grand tour for kazakhstan our sponsors have supported us throughout the entire season and i cant think of a better way to thank them

7578921 tenemos que analizar cada una de las declaraciones porque son tres m dicos distintos que actuaron sobre tres s ntomas totalmente diferentes cada d a la salud de jes s iba empeorando y tambi n el diagn stico y el tratamiento es distinto en cada caso las preguntas han sido diferentes y las respuestas tambi n tenemos que valorar en su conjunto y en los pr ximos d as iremos viendo las actuaciones que tomamos
7578922 siempre hemos manifestado nuestra confianza en la justicia y hemos tenido una fe plena de que en este asunto se va a investigar hasta la ltima coma y se va a esclarecer qu es lo que ha sucedido y todas las responsabilidades que hay en este asunto queda mucho por investigar y aclarar porque los m dicos que ya han comparecido no son los nicos que le atendieron hab a otros que estaban esos d as en los servicios de urgencias y tambi n tuvieron un contacto con jes s y tendr n tambi n que dar sus explicaciones su actuaci n diagn stico y el tratamiento que realizaron en su momento por lo que habr que pedir nuevos peritajes m dicos
7578923 as va a continuar en los pr ximos d as
7578924 como as se ala el juez en el auto de prisi n y en el informe m dico forense
7578925 es el responsable directo por lo que hay que dirigir hacia l todas las actuaciones
7578926 nosotros tambi n vamos a centrarnos en l y despu s investigar lo que sucedi en los d as y horas posteriores

7578935 fast pace lofty goals keep john neyer coming back for more
7578936 you may not have realised it but you were one and a half times over the limit for driving being part of a crew on an aircraft this is more stringently controlled
7578937 to have been yourself in that condition and not realised it is a very serious matter because there is an obligation on you to be particularly careful when you know people are dependent on you
7578938 this is quite normal apparently if they are not flying the next day
7578939 she woke up the next day and felt fine but she was suffering from a migraine so took some herbal medication
7578940 she went with the rest of the crew to the airport by bus nothing was said by the captain about being under the influence of alcohol
7578941 they went through security together and security officers were suspicious something was wrong with her
7578942 the accused captain and first officer went to the plane
7578943 the accused has lost her job as a result of this she has been very upset this has cost her dearly
7578944 she has had to fly up to aberdeen for court not with bmi i hasten to add it has already cost her 300

7578948 dieser entscheid wird sich f r die buchh ndler zu einem sehr schmerzhaften eigengoal entwickeln

7578953 devon is guilty by association no one in wwe has any ill will or bad feelings toward devon but bubba is a detriment to his career
7578954 there are a lot of fun stories told here beyond just the usual tidbits of telling his story as a wrestler some of the stuff added in focuses on his family life the mr perfect vignettes and much more by the end of the documentary you really are going to have a whole new level of appreciation for mr perfect i found myself trying to walk around and whack the gum as it came flying out of my mouth later in the day needless to say it isnt easing being perfect
7578955 her mother passed away unexpectedly and shes been out of the country dealing with everything
7578956 i wanted you all to be aware of what is going on and send out as much positive energy and prayer to help her get through this difficult time in her life the wwe has really helpful and understanding with her taking a little time off right now but she will definitely be back in full force before september
7578957 maybe you should put down the joint and work on your spelling punctuation and grammar
7578958 pay attention to your dreams gods angels often speak directly to our hearts when we are asleep
7578959 danny wants the opportunity to play in the masters and opens next year so it could be about this time next year when he turns professional
7578960 some people think it would still be too young to turn professional and maybe it is but then we havent seen anyone like him before so we have nothing to base a judgment on
7578961 his performance in the pga tournament was beyond expectations but certainly the goal was always to win this event it was the way in which he won that was surprising for the most part he smashed it
7578962 danny doesnt particularly like his golf swing there is still work to do which is the scary thing but a good thing as well hes not at his full potential yet
7578963 hes an incredible ball striker but one thing he will have to start looking at is physically can he continue to swing the club like he does
7578964 there might need to be some improvements to reduce the risk of injury
7578965 i had him out there a few times and it has developed from there
7578966 this is pioneering stuff for canterbury to have an integrated urban development and transport infrastructure
7578967 over the next 10 years what you are not going to see are greenfield developments with no connection to transportation and other community serviced infrastructures that then have to be supplied after at considerable expense to the community
7578968 these variations are the last part of our council process in terms of debate now it goes off for analysis submissions and then it will be heard by the hearing panel and no doubt reviewed by the environment court after that
7578969 the hearing will be in march april next year and after that it will be up to a party or parties if they think that the panel has it wrong to have that decision reviewed in the environment court
7578970 they are not determining the whole process advice from christchurch city council is growth projection for the next 35 years can be accommodated in parts of christchurch without going into that 50 55dba line area
7578971 christchurch airport is one of those airports that can operate 24 hours seven days sydney cannot because of concerns and actions by neighbours this is still a matter that people can submit on
7578972 our group simply wants a fair deal and a balanced approach to land use it is clearly in everyones interest to have the airport operating to capacity 24 7
7578973 there will be no impact on the airport if the 55dba new zealand standard is adopted
7578974 if this is achieved and delivers higher in market returns it will truly be an outstanding result
7578975 an excellent production season combined with the use of pruning and harvesting techniques to meet zespris requirements is a major contributor to the projected improvement in returns this season
7578976 probably the worst thing for farmers who have been through a long drought both climatically and economically and now they are hit by another flood
7578977 i havent had any updates its one of those ones where they are in transition at the moment
7578978 im still suffering from blurred speech ive got very disrupted sleep having bad dreams and waking up in sweats
7578979 it hurts to talk but if i take enough medication it subsides the pain a bit you dont know how much you use your jaw until something like this happens the drugs are also having side effects
7578980 its pretty bad because its going to stop me from learning and advancing in my riding
7578981 i turned around and there was this guy swinging at everyone we saw him back my friend against the wall
7578982 i stood to the side of him and told him to calm down as soon as i said that he turned around and stepped up and punched me
7578983 i spun around a few times then hit the ground pretty hard then he started running
7578984 und das mitgef hl f r alle die so pl tzlich einen geliebten menschen verloren haben
7578985 er war ein mensch dem man gern begegnet ist der unterhaltsam war stets gut gelaunt auch wenn es unangenehme dinge zu besprechen gab
7578986 unsere gedanken und unser mitgef hl sind jetzt bei den angeh rigen
7578987 ze hoort bij mijn vriendin maar ze wil het verkopen
7578988 wir fahnden von anfang an sehr intensiv nach den t tern haben leider aber bis jetzt noch keine hei e spur
7578989 wir gehen derzeit bei der unfallursache von einer vorfahrtsverletzung aus
7578990 monday i made the complaint tuesday the posters were taken down and wednesday the english posters were up
7578991 i figured one of the kids got up and went to the washroom
7578992 they the thieves were pretty brazen i was still up and the lights and tv were on in the house
7578993 once upon a time you didnt have to lock anything up but now you have to lock everything up
7578994 im home in my own house at one oclock in the morning you should feel safe
7578995 i went up and removed it there was nothing else there to save
7578996 not only was my truck and coat stolen but my childrens cds were in the truck along with some of my personal belongings and my cell phone
7578997 basically we have no suspect no physical evidence to go on the file can be re opened at any time but theres no other avenues of investigation unless we hear something from a crime stoppers tip
7578998 it was scary this person entered a house with kids in bed asleep what if he got caught you dont know if he had a knife or a hammer you wouldnt know and theyre going to try and get away and you dont know what theyll do to get away
7578999 ron paul says hes still in the presidential race but is moving to scale back his staff and shift focus to his own re election campaign for his texas congressional seat
7579000 por otro lado pues dada a la gran cantidad de gente por carrera que admite grid yo habia pensado en comenzar no como cualquier torneo no como los de cod por ejemplo en donde se comienza enfrentamientos directos sino comenzar al estilo f1 en donde se cuente con un compa ero de equipo osea 2 del mismo equipo en la misma carrera manejando una tabla de puntuacion similar a la de f1 tambien y al finalizar la primera face del torneo pasan los x mejores equipos los cuales acomulan la mayor puntuaci n sin descartar la posibilidad de un repechaje luego de pasar aquellas faces eliminatorias se puede pensar en la individualidad de cada piloto ademas se establecer an horarios y dias fijos de carrera como las 5am por ejemplo no mentiras en eso si no como las de f1 y pues evidentemente quien no asistiera a ella no recibir a punto alguno asi como los que no terminaran la prueba dentro de los x primeros perjudicando a su equipo pues bien esto es una vaga idea de lo que me gustar a armar como ven tiene trabajo y logistico por hacer por ello lo que se necesita es gente hasta de 1 solo ojo para que el asunto salga lo mejor posible y sea totalmente serio y transparente no como esos torneos de cod que suelen salir por ahi que nunca se terminan esa es mi idea a ver si sale gente para masificarla
7579001 s el depender de otra persona para sus propias metas personales es una mier siempre lo eh dicho pero es tentador lo que se podr a llegar a hacer en un buen trabajo de equipo suponiendo que cada carrera admita 12 players digamos que en la primera vuelta del torneo se pasen por clasificaci n directa 8 players osea los 4 primeros equipos por puntuacion el resto de players correr an una carrera individual el llamado repechaje y los 4 primeros en dicha carrera lograr a su clasificaci n a la segunda face de ahi para adelante adi s equipos y cada cual por su lado ahora tambien me gusta la idea de correr individual tampoco tengo problema
7579002 its quite overwhelming its an incredible reception youre living in a bubble in the olympic village and its only when you land and see quite how many people have turned up you realise its incredible
7579003 im going to take a couple of months off but it hasnt really sunk in yet
7579004 its nice to get back home and get some home cooking just the relaxation and quietness
7579005 welcome back home from what should have been an enjoyable holiday in beijing
7579006 when the modern liberal mind whines about imaginary victims rages against imaginary villains and seeks above all else to run the lives of persons competent to run their own lives the neurosis of the liberal mind becomes painfully obvious
7579007 who got some sort of perverse pleasure in watching or encouraging the fight to continue
7579008 the perpetrator of this incident was treated the same way as the two who threw the punches they were stood down if i had my way id do the same with the mob having a bit of cheap fun at their expense
7579009 inflames things more than a face to face confrontation and gets things a wee bit out of kilter
7579010 a message to the boys about how to deal with conflict
7579011 i spoke of the importance of finding better ways to deal with the inevitable conflict everyone faces and used the example of tony veitch to illustrate how a violent response to resolving disagreements is not the way to go
7579012 the reason why i used him was he was a person who was a male and was sports mad like a lot of boys here
7579013 i was trying to draw some sort of similarity there between those elements and those characteristics that many of our boys have and said this is topical and this is what could happen if you cant control your anger
7579014 thats a bit of a leap from a group of boys having a fight to tony veitch i think theyre two totally different situations
7579015 our top five exposures only represent 8 7 of our total gross receivables at june 30 they were two plant equipment transactions two business loans and one property portfolio loan
7579016 meanwhile we are enjoying the strongest inflows of new investment funds we have experienced in the past two years we are averaging 4 7m of new funds per week during the 2008 calendar year
7579017 we have tested it every day and it has cleared any bugs that were in the system
7579018 health informatics will do for healthcare what enterprise solutions did for manufacturing and banking some 20 odd years ago
7579019 to the delight of many shareholders we expect to reinstate the payment of dividends
7579020 its not surprising after these incidents that some people may be concerned we have taken our eye off the ball
7579021 qantas is the worldwide launch airline for the system and as with any new it system especially one of this scale there were some minor teething problems but these were limited in their nature and impact
7579022 were very pleased with the programs implementation and believe given the projects scale we have handled the transition extremely well
7579023 what they power stations were looking for was a solution where they could repair the blades in situ
7579024 the rotor is taken out of the turbine and put in a cradle we dont remove the blades but use laser technology to put a new coating on them
7579025 we are also looking at robotic technology for the profiling of the blades
7579026 currently there are a lot of infrared imaging systems out there for night vision and other surveillance and reconnaissance work but the image is just like black and white it only measures the intensity of infrared that falls on the detector
7579027 we have come up with technology whereby on that infrared imaging chip you can place essentially another filtering element which allows you to select the wavelengths you want to hit the detector
7579028 that wavelength information can tell you a lot about what it is you are looking at
7579029 for example every tank has an infrared imaging system for night vision you can look a few kilometres away and see another tank but it is a black and white image so you cant tell if it is a friendly tank or not
7579030 the idea with our technology is you can go into a mode where you actually detect the spectrum from the tank allowing you to identify what kind of tank it is because the spectrum has information about the paint that is used and the material it is made from and all sorts of stuff
7579031 its the kind of structure you would see in large private companies its the kind of structure you would see if perhaps there was more than one shareholder bearing in mind that at the moment simon hackett is the only shareholder we could expand the shareholdings and you cant do this when youre configured as a single director private company
7579032 the government has a live commercial selection process under way for the national broadband network and it is therefore inappropriate to speculate on the potential outcome of the request for proposals
7579033 it has always been the governments position that the provision of appropriate network information to proponents is important for the success of the national broadband network process and that this should be done as soon as possible
7579034 if telstra win the bid it will switch it on straight away in april
7579035 that is of course if the government goes for a quick fix instead of an innovative and open access solution
7579036 in 2009 with or without the network telstra will still deliver 12mbps to all metro areas if the government decides to go with telstra there will be no competition and under serviced areas will suffer
7579037 telstra is not interested in pursuing the spirit of the network which is about open access and broadband for under serviced areas
7579038 it would be much better if the government stuck to its election promises and picked a network based on open access even though this may mean australia wont see services for some months it will be worth it
7579039 it all depends on who the successful bidder is how quickly they can mobilise whether they have contractors lined up and if they have already pre purchased fibre equipment
7579040 if the proponent hasnt selected a vendor we can expect more delays
7579041 weve been sitting on selecting a vendor until we get the network information and the clock starts ticking we are making a short list because we may need multiple types of technology from different vendors
7579042 these vendors will increasingly be considered for strategic service deals and will augment or in some cases replace todays acknowledged megavendors in this space
7579043 such a shift in the it service landscape is a key trend that application development and sourcing managers need to understand and prepare for
7579044 our analysis indicates that the top five india based it companies have raised combined market share from 33 per cent in the 2004 financial year to 40 per cent in the 2008 financial year
7579045 these companies took a 51 per cent share of incremental revenue in 2008
7579046 we believe this trend will continue in 2009 as vendor consolidation gathers momentum we expect the indian it industry to grow at 20 per cent in us terms in 2009 despite the us slowdown
7579047 way too much hype for the selection obama hyped this thing up and had everyone on pins and needles for joe biden had it been al gore or hillary clinton or someone like that then it would have made sense this is like a nonstop 2 week pr blitz for the movie gigli
7579048 we were in the hotel and i cut my foot on a glass mirrored table that was broken and jagged and i didnt see the edge and it was like blood everywhere we went to the hospital and im ok
7579049 i had to call my partner mark ballas she told seacrest
7579050 i feel so bad i had to wake him up
7579051 you know what this is a challenge and well get through it and were going to do whatever we can to make this heal as fast as possible
7579052 i am interested in learning about ham radio what courses do you suggest what radio should i buy to get started
7579053 its me against the world even though michelle and i are close its still me against the rest of the house
7579054 there was no way i could keep the rope from cutting into my groin
7579055 my body said get off so it was time to get off
7579056 you are currently looking at week seven season 10 hoh right now im calling the shots
7579057 depends on renny who walks around here with wigs and boas
7579058 we cannot be more pleased with the chinese peoples presentation of the games and their hosting of the games
7579059 they did an absolutely amazing job running the meet if we needed water they had water if we needed ice they had ice if we needed a towel somebody got us a towel i cant explain to you how well run the meet was
7579060 we pledged a clean team it appears weve done that
7579061 these games are significantly more competitive than those in athens
7579062 we dont gauge our performance strictly on the number of medals
7579063 weve been clean and drug free we could not be more proud of how this team has behaved and exhibited olympic ideals
7579064 as the most intangible legacy but also a very important one is that through the games china has been scrutinized by the world
7579065 the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world i believe that this is something that will have positive effects in the long term
7579066 we have received a report from unamid representatives there that the police of the government said that they had a search warrant from the court authorizing them to enter kalma camp to search for arms and possible wanted persons
7579067 they entered on their own and it seems that there are clashes going on and now we are sending an investigation team to make the assessment of the situation
7579068 we are outsourcing elements of customer care to reduce costs and improve customer service levels
7579069 most of the customer care call function will be outsourced well still have people internally to handle calls that the outsourcer cant deal with
7579070 we have been progressively moving calls to the outsourcer over time so the number of staff has come down compared with what it was six months ago
7579071 we count every penny in our space and in this industry you obviously have to
7579072 paypal has been working through the process of identifying its customers that have recently been affected by the collapse of ebs international in liquidation operating on ebay com au as ebusiness supplies and running the website at www bestbargains com au
7579073 customers who have been directly impacted by ebusiness collapse have now all been credited by paypal to either their paypal account or credit card
7579074 early on we provide a very rough estimate in figures
7579075 the matter has now been finalised and as a business we will not be disclosing the numbers publicly
7579076 were dealing with a large number of people both on and off ebay and we had to have some confidence that payments were being made to the right people
7579077 i think the area where we spent the most attention was how to actually write the health care plank because clinton had proposed that it be an actual mandate to purchase health care and obama had not were all in agreement that there needs to be healthcare coverage for every man woman and child in the united states
7579078 im hillary clinton and i do not approuve this message

7579081 we were arrested and taken to a university for questioning we were held for nearly 24 hours without any sleep and having interrogation of up to about eight hours then we were moved to a detention centre and before we were allowed any sleep we had another 12 hours of interrogation
7579082 the guys i was with were given the reason that it was illegal to undertake even a peaceful protest and to talk about the situation in tibet
7579083 they seemed to have decided to really clamp down on protesters
7579084 she has an absolute commitment to the cause and even though i wouldnt like to say that china has listened only time will tell if they have

7579104 is ambiguous are they on board with specific goals and a candidate specification or are they on board with the general idea that it might be time to talk about some kind of standard in the general area of utility computing

7579145 the petition refers to a research paper political and administrative manipulation of the police published in 1979 by bureau of police research and development warning that excessive control of the political executive and its principal advisers over the police has the inherent danger of making the police a tool for subverting the process of law promoting the growth of authoritarianism and shaking the very foundations of democracy the commitment devotion and accountability of the police have to be only to the rule of law the supervision and control has to be such that it ensures that the police serve the people without any regard whatsoever to the status and position of any person while investigating a crime or taking preventive measures similarly we can only express our hope that all state governments would rise to the occasion and enact a new police act wholly insulating the police from any pressure whatsoever thereby placing in position an important measure for securing the rights of the citizens under the constitution for the rule of law treating everyone equal and being partisan to none which will also help in securing an efficient and better criminal justice delivery system

7579174 mr biden certainly helps to address one of mr obamas greatest weaknesses but senator obama has three challenges he must face to win the white house and while mr biden aids one it leaves the other two as even more problematic it also cuts against the central theme of mr obamas campaign mr biden has a long resume serving in the senate since 1973 he has been a presence in washington for thirty five years during that time he has been involved in a number of issues certainly mr bidens greatest strength is foreign policy as chairman of the senate foreign relations committee he has been involved in the intricacies of many foreign policy issues facing the nation for years it is widely believed mr obamas greatest weakness is foreign policy his lack of experience with foreign policy issues and his lack of familiarity with world leaders has been touted by some as the greatest risk to his white house bid mr obamas choice of mr biden certainly addresses foreign policy mr biden can confidently advise mr obama on foreign matters and has longstanding relationships with foreign leaders while mr bidens approach to foreign affairs represents the democratic emphasis on multilateralism interventionism and working through the u n there is no doubt that he is an authority on foreign affairs but it is debatable whether mr obamas need is foreign policy voters rightly see the presidents primary duty as protecting american lives and the american homeland while diplomacy and knowledge of world events is part of that it is only one part national security is central to protecting american lives that involves intelligence work fighting terrorism and securing vulnerable entry points the instrument of our national defense is our military despite mr bidens general familiarity with these things he has never served in uniform or in the defense department or been responsible for national security
7579175 regardless of that there are two other issues with which mr obama must grapple and far from helping with any of these mr biden actually makes mr obamas path more difficult the first is that mr obamas other big challenge is convincing moderate americans he shares their values he is already seen by many as a liberal big city politician who says people cling to guns and religion out of bitterness associates with radicals and attended a church with a radical theology mr biden is a fierce foe of gun rights ardently opposes restrictions on abortion that have widespread support and promotes gay rights he supports higher taxes bigger government and socialized healthcare that doesnt exactly help mr obama with blue collar voters in ohio pennsylvania and michigan the second is mr bidens lack of executive experience not only has he never been a governor or a cabinet secretary he has never been a mayor an agency head or served in any other executive role not even prosecutor or military officer given that mr obama also lacks that experience having two career legislators heading the executive branch of our government might create doubts
7579176 and the third issue is hillary clinton many of senator clintons supporters are still unhappy with mr obama and right now he is losing some of them to john mccain this pick does nothing to help heal that rift which could make the difference in a close election more broadly it cuts against mr obamas central campaign theme of change his message is washington is broken and the old establishment needs to be swept away in favor of new blood and a new vision how does picking someone who has been in washington a decade longer than mr mccain jive with mr obamas contention that mr mccain has been in washington too long to change it
7579177 the u s is clearly slacking two controversies have arisen of late one is a growing argument because more than 100 college presidents are advocating the lowering of the legal drinking age because they say it will prevent binge drinking among underage students the logic is that when deprived of their rights to legally get drunk or get a drink college kids resort to overdoing it taboos are so irresistible students are drawn to them like moths to a flame i assume this leads to dorms filled with students who have gotten sloshed and express their liberty by vomiting all over everything the other idea is that colleges have developed new ways to fail their purpose of preparing students for professional work developing their skills and making sure that they are prepared for the demanding expectations of the real world much more laxity is currently allowed and the work is made far easier because professors are afraid of being given bad ratings by students who might feel unfairly overworked and parents even get in the game by demanding less pressure on their children the result claim the outraged is that higher education prepares the student to remain an adolescent rather than grow up and that one does not expect high quality performance or the ability to withstand the rigors that life tends to unsparingly impose on all of us
7579178 life liberty and the pursuit of happiness have been perverted until ones rights should no longer include the freedom to pursue happiness happiness should be a right immediate experience takes precedence over understanding the current mind set is that if a child doesnt like something it should be changed to fit his lack of understanding his impatience his laziness that is not permissive it is irresponsible to the point of an ominous stupidity no we do not need to make life into a marine corps boot camp we just have to understand that the faces of george washington and abraham lincoln adorn many symbols in our nation because these men faced life as adults and made decisions as though they were long past adolescence they helped form and hold this nation together because each of them knew that war was the most dangerous and demanding game of them all after that i would say that we must prepare to the very best of our ability our greatest natural resource which is our population those in the emerging asian world know this and rightly assume that we have forgotten how a society protects its future
7579179 we are now in a ring and a fight which is partially what it is because of the intellectual emotional and psychological sloth to which we have submitted over the past 40 years we now need responsible adults parents teachers and students not people willing to kill those close to or below them with destructive versions of kindness it is very hard for people to live in a world devoid of love but societies have learned from their very beginnings that tough love is always the best and most dependable kind
7579180 mr obamas comments about justice clarence thomas qualifications made in response to a question put to him last week by political forum moderator rev rick warren are resoundingly similar to those of president thomas jeffersons rejection of black poet phyllis wheatley when asked by rev warren which of the justices he would not have confirmed mr obama blurted out seemingly without consideration i dont think mr thomas was a strong enough legal jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution to paraphrase his jargon for the non jurists among us before we even reach the issue of what justice thomas thinks we must first dismiss him as a non thinker setting aside for the moment that ad hominem attacks of this nature are beneath the dignity of the office of the president mr obamas response reveals his intrinsic prejudice against black conservatives
7579181 in 2005 when opposing the nomination of janice rogers brown to the first circuit court of appeals mr obama claimed that the test for a qualified judicial nominee is not simply whether they are intelligent curiously though his stated reason for opposing justice thomas was that he did not believe justice thomas to be a strong thinker yet he praised justices scalia and roberts whose philosophies he also opposes as intellectually brilliant and smart in drawing this contrast mr obama is trying to call attention to what he believes to be the implicit incoherency of black conservatism to mr obama the distinguishing factor is that he believes that black conservatives opinions are published under their names but authored by someone else nothing could be further from the truth black conservatives perhaps more than any other political faction in america have earned their stripes the hard way their ideas precisely because they do not enjoy popularity become by necessity self reflective constantly examined and rigorously applied whats more justice thomas has been vetted by the same top institutions and legal minds that give mr obama his air of authenticity why then dont justice thomas credentials earn them the assumption that their views are honestly held

7579203 despite the former presidential candidates public statements of remorse there remains far too much that doesnt add up for instance were being asked to swallow a bizarre story that a member of his campaign staff is the father of edwards mistresss child either john edwards is not done lying to us or we dont fully appreciate the scope of the behind the scenes moral depravity of his self righteous campaign lets assume for the moment that no legal infractions occurred and that edwards lapses were exclusively moral what is the relevance of this behavior to his qualifications as a political leader and possible president scandals in the private lives of politicians are sadly hardly rare there is a line of reasoning that suggests its prudish to see them as relevant to the mans fitness for his job i would argue that for liberals typified by john edwards such partitioning of private from the public is highly unlikely if not impossible why because to be this kind of liberal youve got to stand traditional morality on its head traditional morality is a bottom up process it starts at the individual level the ten commandments are addressed to thou not we the people it begins with individuals taking personal responsibility for the moral tone of their own lives and the social reality that results is the collective product of that individual behavior traditional guidelines are to love our neighbor our brother not mankind the focus is specific and individual not vague and abstract but liberal politics are top down despite the pretense about being driven by caring about people unique individuals are at the end of the liberal food chain
7579204 candidate john edwards called poverty the great moral issue of our time and his antidote for solving this moral crisis was massive government programs with the modest objective of eradicating poverty in 30 years how particular individuals who happen to be poor actually behave which is where the real moral issues lie is of marginal interest to this liberal mindset their interest is the grand solution from above that will supposedly change the condition of the poor individuals below who are viewed as innocent bystanders in their own lives it never seemed to interest edwards that lyndon johnson declared war on poverty in 1965 and more than 40 years and 10 trillion or so later it accomplished nothing when i was on welfare id deal with indifferent bureaucrats who had little interest in me personally they were just doing a job no different from any civil servant in the post office or the department of motor vehicles but behind the faceless bureaucracy was a grand liberal vision for me it was all irrelevant it was just a system to work to get a check ironically edwards marketing of his moral crusade was his two americas pitch get people on board by inspiring envy chucking the 10th commandment out the window and use political power to finance the massive programs with other peoples money which can be reasonably viewed as theft
7579205 in an interview last year edwards was asked what he thought would most outrage jesus about american life today his response our selfishness our focus on our own short term needs not only was this guy in the midst of an adulterous affair oblivious to his own hypocrisy he saw himself as master of the universe who had to lecture the rest of us about how we behave so it shouldnt surprise anyone that during a campaign defined by pronouncements of morality and compassion edwards was being immoral and cruel to the real individuals around him and closest to him for liberals individuals are footnotes to their own grand schemes and ambitions

7579249 during barack obamas underwhelming performance last week at the saddleback forum hosted by pastor rick warren the presidential hopeful managed to fill the shoes of another son of illinois not abraham lincoln but stephen a douglas to the question at what point does a baby receive human rights obama responded that the answer was above his pay grade for a man that proposes to lead the free world it was a sorry answer indeed obama supports the right of a woman to choose to have an abortion and voted against the ban on partial birth abortion more importantly obama has the unique distinction of being the only elected official to vote against giving life saving medical care to babies born alive after a failed abortion apparently he felt sufficiently pay graded to legislate policy that hinges on the very question he dodged as president he would also presumably nominate judges that would decide law based on the answer to the question clearly his failure to answer was not because he doesnt have an opinion instead his response is an attempt to remake a moral question into a legal one just as douglas attempted to do 150 years ago about slaverys expansion into new u s territories
7579250 obamas response to the question of rights for babies is also an attempt to pass the moral buck to the supreme court a court he hopes to pack with taneys
7579251 obamas dodge of the question does not change the settled scientific fact that life begins at conception or the moral truth that that same life is not only heir to god given rights to life liberty and private property but is equally due the legal protection of the government nor does a supreme court ruling shed the repugnance of abortion any more than taneys decision washed clean the hands of slave owners and their supporters obamas performance at saddleback simply demonstrated that he is willing to place politics above morality and content to share the company of douglas rather than soar in the more rarified air of abraham lincoln

7579265 weve had six burglaries in the last 12 months and now weve had a fire how do you like that luck
7579266 weve had to hire someone to keep up with the demand
7579267 when the transmitter went when there was no tv one at all people started playing with their tvs people were ringing up saying they were trying to fix it and didnt know what was happening its definitely something thats affected heaps of people
7579268 obviously we cant fix the problem thats not fixable until the transmitters fixed but we can resolve the issue of people who have been trying to fix their tv and are now left in a place where they cant get any channels or all of them are mixed up
7579269 the contractors need to fly parts for the transmitter out from overseas and we need to work with doc to heli copter them in so that is the estimate at this stage we will review it if it looks like its going to be longer than that
7579270 the recent acquisition of nestles yoghurts and dairy desserts business represented a significant step towards achieving our growth strategy in australia

7579278 do you remember that i told you how i had this tremendous urge to put my penis into the pickle slicer
7579279 no bill i mean what happened with the pickle slicer
7579280 when i started university law definitely wasnt something i had considered doing
7579281 i starting off doing marketing but a year in i wasnt really enjoying it and law felt like it was something i would like
7579282 yes the firm has gone through some changes and we have all been there
7579283 back in those days quite a lot of people did what their parents did it just happened that way for us too
7579284 my father went on to become a district court judge in wellington and he has retired down there i am in commercial and property law
7579285 my role has been as a law clerk but now having passed the bar it finalises my position as a lawyer and i will be able to practice law
7579286 but having said that the economic conditions probably masked any improvement we would have hoped to see at the gaming machine level
7579287 he told us he was looking for a metal art foundry in maine
7579288 this is not like producing a sink this is a well known artist theres a social political aspect to it too
7579289 it was really amazing here we are a small company from maine and our work was going to be at the democratic convention
7579290 its thin enough to work with and thick enough so it so it doesnt bend like a pretzel
7579291 we wanted to find someone nearby and the fact that they were from maine was a bonus
7579292 sure were artists first but its great its going to be supporting barack obama
7579293 this feels sort of surreal for me were a little cog in a wheel and were thrust in this larger machinery but all the pieces of the machinery are needed you know
7579294 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
7579295 with kara by her side paula has some backup and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7579296 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7579297 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7579298 ese otro pa s donde alguna vez viviste y ahora prefer s olvidar
7579299 there was a guy in a crazy long scarf and a girl dressed like andy pandy running around a nuclear power plant as a disembodied rock hand growled eldrad must live and it scared me silly i was hooked

7579307 our processes really require high productivity so what makes it competitive here in the midwest is that we have a great labor force that is eager to work and well trained already
7579308 we do a test of the available labor pool and hire the cream of the crop
7579309 as utilities begin to embrace distributed power generation these type of things play into our natural advantage
7579310 to serve the political ideological rhetorical and or emotional needs of the present
7579311 experienced several decades of economic oppression by the foreign powers
7579312 during the past 100 years the citizens of the entire country suffering under the yoke of the unequal treaties which gave foreigners special concessions and extra territorial status in china were unanimous in their demand that the national humiliation be avenged
7579313 ours will no longer be a nation subject to insult and humiliation
7579314 the question of western humiliation is always unconsciously inside us
7579315 there is something almost in our dna that triggers autonomic and sometimes extreme responses to foreign criticism or put downs
7579316 throughout the ages chinese have had only one way of looking at foreigners we either look up to them as gods or down on them as wild animals
7579317 a monster with a human face but the heart of a beast
7579318 ive been at this for 22 years its about as bad as i have seen it in the fixed income market during that period what we have been seeing over the last eight weeks has been pretty extreme
7579319 we have armageddon in the fixed income markets we have armageddon
7579320 this has been a very deep and unusual crisis that involves the unwinding of a decade of excess
7579321 it is pretty clear that retail deposit taking institutions are in a stronger position i think the business model will change significantly and there will be fewer independent investment banks
7579322 stand alone investment banks will struggle to operate in anything like the way they were before the crisis
7579323 they are not going to be able to operate with the same degree of flexibility and leverage
7579324 investment banks have shown an amazing ability to reinvent themselves
7579325 investment banks should have a deep interest in making the fed comfortable they will not want it to escalate late launch emergency action in response to a funding crisis
7579326 a government back stop would reduce the risks of the business but it could also take away some of the profit potential
7579327 we are not going back to the days when banks made loans and kept them all on their books we have seen that movie and we know what happens in the end
7579328 i see striking similarities in what i see today with the early stages of our own financial crisis in japan more than a decade ago
7579329 probably we will have to be prepared for more events to come the crisis management skills of central banks and financial authorities will be truly tested
7579330 if you had said a year ago that america could suffer a banking crisis on the scale of japan people would have laughed
7579331 the duration of the turmoil its scope and the growing evidence of effects on the real economy have come as a great surprise to most commentators private as well as public
7579332 how could problems with subprime mortgages being such a small sector of global financial markets provoke such dislocation
7579333 abundant market liquidity led some firms to overestimate the markets capacity to absorb risk
7579334 the same buoyant environment resulted in market pressure for high returns and high levels of competition among financial firms
7579335 people had looked at what had happened to the japanese banks and said this simply cannot happen here because the banks were no longer holding all the credit risk
7579336 there was this huge trust in the intellectual capital of wall street and that appeared to be supported by the fact that banks were making so much money
7579337 it seems clear that risk dispersion did not work as expected major financial institutions did not succeed in shedding risks so much as transferring them among their own business lines
7579338 firms became reluctant to participate in money markets as a result subprime credit problems turned into a systemic liquidity crunch
7579339 what we learnt in japan is that banks have a tendency to underestimate how their assets could deteriorate due to the feedback problems
7579340 compounded by rapid increases in the prices of energy and other commodities
7579341 worrying level of inflation rates results largely from sharp increases in energy and food prices at the global level
7579342 developments in the global balance of demand and supply for food and energy
7579343 we know the international price of energy and other commodities they add additional pressure to inflation in china
7579344 the biggest challenge for the world economy as a whole is not the oil price as such i think there are mechanisms that will lead eventually to an equilibrating between demand and supply but it is trying to ensure a monetary policy framework for the world as a whole that does not build into it an excess inflationary impetus
7579345 repeating the mistakes industrialised nations made prior to the great inflation of the 1970s
7579346 while the dollar depreciation is helping to reduce the us current account deficit it has not been sufficient to alleviate imbalances and risks rather new misalignments may be emerging and risks may be shifting
7579347 with inflation a clear and present threat and with real policy rates in most countries very low by historical standards a global bias towards monetary tightening would seem appropriate

7579366 a huge blow to the enemys ability to plant major ieds
7579367 its thrown them off balance and well continue to maintain the momentum to keep them off balance in that specific area
7579368 i personally believe weve taken out some of the key leaders that have conducted some of these ied operations that have affected local nationals afghan security forces as well as isaf soldiers and canadians
7579369 it struck the front right side of the vehicle flipped us over and fortunately all of us made it out alive
7579370 ive talked to many soldiers whove cheated death countless times between ieds and firefights with insurgents and they keep going back out there and doing their job
7579371 i think thats what me and my fellow reporter are going to keep doing while were here
7579372 our purpose is to exert sovereignty demonstrate sovereignty and security but also learn how to live off the land and learn more about the operating environment here in the north
7579373 the canadian forces along with our other government departments need to be ready to respond to threats such as environmental accidents oil spills and potentially communicable disease outbreaks on a cruise ship
7579374 weve seen much increased activity in terms of russian overflights of canadian airspace the americans are seeing the same thing around alaska

7579394 what im hearing from sen obama is a lot like what we heard from robert kennedy
7579395 no matter what campaign ad we see or how its spun hope is important its what this country was based on
7579396 that tag that sen obamas been given is a campaign ploy obviously by the republican party
7579397 i dont see him hanging out i have yet to see him at any celebrity events
7579398 this is the first time that a political convention of any sort has been surrounded with the awareness of environmental issues

7579409 i get the feeling its gonna to be like this all week
7579410 i used to get a lot more on the right
7579411 if youre a little bit critical of barack obama you get really a pie of vilification right in the face
7579412 were born too late because they would have been great communists
7579413 do we really want four more years of the same tune
7579414 i get the feeling its gonna to be like this all week
7579415 as the police and the crpf were warning the protesters to disperse somebody from the mob fired at them injuring two paramilitary troopers and two policemen

7579421 las comparaciones son indignantes inaceptables y groseramente discriminatorias todo al mismo tiempo
7579422 demuestra claramente que cuando se trata de respaldar a barack obama las celebridades mundiales que lo apoyan descartan considerar zona prohibida algunas calumnias o ataques
7579423 tiene algunas complicaciones mayores y algunas menores en otros rganos en la parte cerebral el ri n estuvo hasta ayer bastante fr gil ahora se ha estabilizado tiene un tema con las hemorragias y los sangramientos que forma parte del cuadro grave de la hepatitis fulminante
7579424 esta historia pudo haberse acabado varios d as atr s pero ah estamos en la pelea todav a
7579425 esto parece un paso atr s para obama quien el mes pasado ten a una ventaja de 51 por ciento a 44 por ciento
7579426 a n la semana pasada justo antes de que eligiera a biden como su candidato vicepresidencial la mayor a de las encuestas mostraba a obama con una ventaja de un d gito sobre mccain
7579427 con esos antecedentes y su firma respecto de la presunta libertad de venturelli
7579428 este es un cargo de confianza y la pregunta sobre mi continuidad tiene que ser hecha al presidente ricardo teixeira
7579429 habl diariamente con teixeira y voy a seguir el trabajo que l pidi estoy tranquilo no hay cambio de planes
7579430 they seem amused and slightly disgusted by the excitement here but i suspect theyre just jealous
7579431 do we really want four more years of the same tune
7579432 much much better to run with jeb in 2012 after the democrats get into all kinds of difficulties dealing the messes and land mines these people have left behind
7579433 im saying it now president barack h obama jr 2009 2017
7579434 i had a chance to watch an otherworldly documentary from nickelodeon about kids pre teens for mccain
7579435 im going to hire a private accounting firm to keep track of any new initiative i offer and make sure that its being done as efficiently as possible
7579436 what guarantees do we get that they dont waste it
7579437 realistically mom roe vs wade is never going to be overturned by a democrat or republican but the republicans know that they can get you to screw yourself over and vote against your own economic self interest based on that one issue maybe you shouldnt let them get away with that
7579438 what guarantees do we get that they dont waste it
7579439 id be interested in how the participants got selected but if the group was run right you cant ignore it even if it was run by frank luntz
7579440 president skippy when did you realize mccain and bush were both right on iraq and what springsteen strumming did you use to hide it
7579441 sorry boob what was that i was on the other line with mrs arafat trying to get her last check from move on to clear
7579442 mr presidente why were you so diligent in surrendering iraq to al queda and iran
7579443 boob as you may well know ive been up to my gigantoid ear lobes in schlepping for the plo mob for quite some timers goes way back at least to my teens as illinois state senator from who gives a crap
7579444 but mr president isnt there any room for freedom in muslim nations not under the gun from russias surrogates in tehran and damascus
7579445 i know you like maps and nude national geographic stuff but what does that have to do with the price of ballet lessons off division street i have an extremely timid paranoid and borderline lesbian collegiate client le ive got to appease and if that means chucking the troops into the hell fires of liberal damnation so be it have you seen my wine spritzer and bowling shoes
7579446 fisa reform was once part of your grand alleged plan for change along with public campaign finances then you brought up to his armpits in amtrain old joe biden aboard
7579447 so you consider veep biden a part of your considered schedule for legislation
7579448 oh right the white dude last i saw of him he was down in mississippi getting subpoenaed or something well miss him at sunday brunch after the george stepinit show am i allowed to mention an actual news network
7579449 mr president your first 100 days in office have been a colossal failure where russia has now entered ukraine in force red china has tanks on the ground in tibet and soon nepal pakistans nuke stores are wide open since you accidentally bombed the indian embassy there and the good people of illinois want your present votes back do you have any plans for the weekend
7579450 because im biracial i know my attitudes towards the prospect of the first african american president may be different than that of most clinton supporters
7579451 mccains campaign will invent something that the tradmed will pick up and repeat endlessly
7579452 osamash seems to have a difficult time extending anyone who is not
7579453 i honestly think this is just a proxy for racism thats what has to be overcome
7579454 actually centfan i was referring to osamishs post which would have been directly above mine
7579455 blaming this on racism is both unnecessarily pessimistic and unfair
7579456 ive been disillusioned since gingrich rolled off of mount doom
7579457 why do republicans have to lie about everything in order to win elections
7579458 do we really want four more years of the same tune
7579459 i think we as a country are most of the way to the finish line despite the efforts of republicans under the

7579461 canadian universities offer high quality education with globally recognized degrees it has not been as well advertised as higher education in the us or uk yet in my university the ryerson university in toronto indians make up the highest number of the 900 foreign students
7579462 in delhi we are visiting nine schools which includes the delhi public school r k puram the british school and the vasant valley school the tour concludes aug 28 and we hope that by the end of it we would have convinced most of the students that canada is the ideal destination for higher studies
7579463 the programmes most in demand correspond to the popularity of the subject here therefore although courses like engineering and business management maybe more expensive than other courses they are still more popular
7579464 we also give scholarships to meritorious students so if one wants they can avail them most of them are however partial scholarships
7579465 it is not important whether inflation touches the 13 percent mark but the fact that it will start moderating within three to four months
7579466 the actual rate of inflation is seven to eight percent i have been saying that inflation we are currently witnessing is not going to stay for long i reiterate that it is a short term problem
7579467 some churches have been attacked and there are reports of sporadic violence

7579475 it was a difficult case and a lot of money was required but there was a financial constraint in the family a public appeal was made and siddhu himself donated rs 1 million and gave him a new lease of life
7579476 after treating the kid for around seven months for jaundice we realized that there is something more to it and then the liver problem was diagnosed following which the appeal was made through media
7579477 we are grateful to the media and all those who donated to save the life of nihal
7579478 the next generational change from our stable will be done on the indigo

7579484 this is a terrible predicament for a family that loves their adopted child and for the indian family that has lost a child and as a mother my heart goes out to them
7579485 our investigations found a simple modus operandi street children were kidnapped and given for adoption abroad for sums ranging from as low as rs 10 000 to as high as 10 000 a child
7579486 obviously kidnapped children have been passed off by impostors claiming to be their mothers donating them for adoption their real parents may not even be aware where their children are and may not have received a single rupee as compensation
7579487 while bringing the guilty to book may be a problem due to the absence of complainants disturbing children living abroad with emotional moorings may prove counterproductive none of them would like to return to a poverty stricken life back home
7579488 under australian law these children are australian citizens and the children of the adoptive parents

7579504 the militants started firing at the security forces triggering an encounter in which four guerrillas were killed
7579505 the violations of the bilateral ceasefire by pakistan troops are aimed at providing cover to the intruding guerrillas into the indian side of the loc
7579506 clearly they have chosen the path of arrogance unilateralism thats a serious blow to confidence building in the talks

7579515 the cbi has evoked the provision of the criminal procedure code crpc and sent jasbir singh notice under section 160 indian jurisdiction of summoning instead of section 166 for summoning a person living outside india
7579516 the cbi cannot summon him directly by sending a notice under section 160 of crpc at a short period as he cannot arrange the finances quickly
7579517 needs to be examined in depth and is also required to point out the place in outram line area in delhi where he had overheard the accused instigating a mob
7579518 i did not know what hit me for few moments i was in a trance
7579519 the court was very slow and i was making too many errors she was picking my shots from any angle and corner i got impatient i wanted to rush through the match my mind was in a state of flux i was thinking of the semi final the game slipped so quickly from my hands i could not even hear what gopi sir was telling me i was blank i should have heard him out i could not believe when i lost the match i was so disappointed if only i could replay the match
7579520 no point worrying too much about the loss but the only way i could set the record straight is by beating her the next time i play yulianti
7579521 i am just waiting to play her next time i will beat her
7579522 now i know that even if i am down 3 11 in any match i can comeback thats the lesson the beijing defeat has taught me
7579523 it was my career best performance winning the philipinnes open my first international tournament was the biggest but the beijing quarter final has surpassed it
7579524 i know the people will expect me to win a medal in london 2012 and i will be better prepared for that but before that i would concentrate on commonwealth games 2010
7579525 yes everything has happened so fast in my career i have worked hard for it but i do not want to be satisfied with what i have achieved though it has come at a young age i just want to keep winning
7579526 my parents are not able to believe all this my playing in olympics entering the quarterfinals and returning with such accolades it is a dream for them they are happy and they are prepared to back me in whatever i do
7579527 i had played her twice before and lost both the times but this time i was confident of putting it across her perhaps i was inspired by the occasion i could retrieve all her shots and thats when i realised that it was my day i was also pumped up after abhinav bindra won the first individual gold medal for india it is the kind of achievement that inspires you
7579528 the ambience at the olympics was also a motivating factor meeting athletes from different countries was a great experience they are so friendly and so focussed on the game everybody wanted to win and that instill confidence in you i did not feel the pressure and that also helped me to perform well
7579529 everyone was watching me with high hopes and that makes you feel good i am having a hectic time now i am meeting so many people i am meeting the prime minister tuesday it feels so good when your effort is appreciated i met the sports minister and the andhra pradesh chief minister they all had encouraging words for me
7579530 i had a different role when i made my debut i was batting at a different slot we had a person who would carry on an innings and be there till the end i was among those batsmen who will go out and look to accelerate even if i get out it was okay
7579531 theres been a transformation in my career i am playing for the last four years and during the latter half of my career i was under a bit of pressure to take up the responsibility and play through the innings
7579532 the crowd is very colourful here so it becomes difficult to spot the ball
7579533 till the ball is new you can see it but once it gets mingled up with dirt and all that it becomes very difficult to spot it and at times we see the fielders not really reacting or we see a late reaction it is tough but you cannot really do anything about it

7579548 there is no doubt that the conditions in pakistan were not ideal to host an event of the magnitude of the champions trophy it was sensible to postpone it

7579639 i think its tough to play perfect for five years in a row
7579640 i think one big result and its turned around for him i know pretty much every player except for one that would take his bad year so i think you have to use a little bit of perspective hes created a monster for himself

7579683 orissa is home to more than 50 per cent of the worlds turtle population the state needs to protect the nesting beaches which are now threatened by beach erosion that may force the turtles to abandon the state for ever
7579684 there has been unprecedented erosion at puri we feel it could be correlated to the opening of a new mouth at chilika lake in 2000 which connects to the seawater
7579685 this could be an ecological disaster for villages and the wildlife found in the lake as the brackish water lake is turning into a saline ecosystem due to a huge influx of seawater
7579686 however we are sure that as per studies undertaken recently erosion is going on and it is increasing year after year

7579716 agriprocessors has been in contact with the iowa department of labor ever since it raised the issue early this year it repeatedly asked the department to advise it of underage workers who may have fraudulently presented documents to work at the plant
7579717 the department did its own audit in april and did not find any underage workers the company policy is clear no one under 18 may be employed at the plant when it did learn of several underage workers in the plant they were immediately dismissed

7579803 he makes big shots and he plays both ends of the floor
7579804 wink can really score he can really defend and he competes like crazy
7579805 i feel like i had a decent season and the adversity our team went through made me a better player
7579806 its good news for the aztecs we are excited about that
7579807 it will help us take a big step forward with the team success
7579808 i did not sit down one minute of one game i felt my team needed that energy and that passion

7579817 i think there is a new kind of satire thats coming out it isnt necessarily targeted at individuals but rather at the system which people seem rather tired of

7579863 we have been made aware of a security breach at the offices of an external contractor involving the loss of personal information about offenders in england and wales
7579864 a full investigation is being conducted police and the information commissioner have been informed
7579865 the data was held in a secure format on the contractors site it was downloaded onto a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost the transfer of data on this assignment to the external contractor has been suspended
7579866 we are collaborating closely with the home office on this matter we have no further comment to make at this time
7579867 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
7579868 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels it is vital that sensitive information such as prisoner records is held securely at all times
