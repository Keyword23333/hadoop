840000 the conditions are not good it would be a good idea to have it kept for some time because now that people are angry such anger can be transferred into the debates and nothing good will come out
840001 it brings together people who would not otherwise know each other
840002 you can see how for people who were exhausted it would have been nearly impossible for them to descend without the ropes
840003 once their hands and feet are frozen they really are unable to move on their own power and it takes other people to carry them down

840006 wow i havent thought about this song since it was actually on the radio
840007 you had given banu al muttalib from the khumus of khaibars booty and left us in spite of the fact that we and banu al muttalib are similarly related to you
840008 banu hashim and banu al muttalib only are one and the same
840009 if you look at the rising price of petroleum the rising price of food around the world we are all going to have to re examine how we produce food where we produce it how we consume it
840010 its not just a question of energy prices its not just a question of global warming its a question of how we are going to keep our kids alive
840011 the same people who sell them today at 60 did not all the sudden have a conversion where they said im being greedy and now ill be generous they charged that because they had a small volume with a lot of fixed costs
840012 now because of the unitaid funding there is a big volume with absolutely certain payments
840013 so they can charge a small profit margin on each individual lifesaving medication
840014 while weve all prepared for this event today the discoveries from kibo will definitely offer hope for tomorrow
840015 i think its a unique privilege to not only fly in space but then have your brother that you can talk about it with and he understands exactly what youre talking about cause hes shared those experiences and memories

840032 why do you think ill have to fondle her is she my wife my lover or my concubine
840033 by expressing regret rajinikanth has showed his greatness we no longer oppose the release
840034 it was a mistake i have learnt a big lesson from the people of karnataka what is important is that the mistake is not repeated i will be careful while speaking in future and see that i dont hurt anybody after all im not a politician that is why it happened
840035 i had witnessed for some worst violence caused for public disturbance and loss of public assets those people should be punished
840036 we had the largest turnout at our open house last night
840037 social studies and some of the english classes are at 40 students which means some our teachers will have 200
840038 im looking forward to meeting the students every year theyre so different
840039 the best day is the first day theyre glad to be back theyre glad to see their friends again theyre looking forward to making new friends
840040 my priority is to refine what weve already been working on
840041 a personal goal is to raise funds to get a smartboard in every classroom
840042 i think the smartboards are the best way to reach students
840043 shes going to be one more resource well be able to go to with our behavior problems
840044 were trying to make it fun for the students were trying to give the teachers a chance to get to know the students and give the students someone they can go to when they cant see their guidance counselor
840045 the night before we come back i dont think any of us sleep
840046 im not ready to go back the type of component requested is unsupported
840047 i make art until someone dies see i am the worlds first fully functioning homicidal artist
840048 and somebody will be spending a night at the hospital it wont be the cat
840049 its an exciting time for every program around the country
840050 it signifies a new season and hope is at an all time high for success for every team its an exciting time for our players weve had one of the best summers that ive ever been a part of as far as conditioning and workouts now we need to take that preparation and focus on improving our skills
840051 last year we basically started from scratch implementing a three week plan to account for every hour of every day
840052 this year it will be much easier and we will just work out the kinks weve modified a few things but for the most part kept most of the fall schedule in place our players also know what to expect this year and thus there will be a lot less anxiety because of that
840053 it gives us a good opportunity to evaluate the freshman class the upper classmen are much farther along then the newcomers this allows us to move at a slower pace with the freshmen and evaluate their physical skills when newcomers get confused in the first few days of practice they dont usually perform as well so we are trying to minimize that by giving them more hands on coaching
840054 those who delivered us into this mess can not be trusted to get us out of it
840055 if you have a green party i want to join
840056 those who delivered us into this mess can not be trusted to get us out of it
840057 if you have a green party i want to join
840058 there is a lot of discussion around the country that this is ripe for a lawsuit because it really sounds like what arizona is doing is defying lao v nickels
840059 in conversation around the country there is discussion that this may be another lawsuit coming down the pipe for arizona because that is exactly what lao was about the kids have to get access to the regular curriculum and if theyre getting four hours a day separated just learning english in various ways its not clear they will be able to access the regular curriculum
840060 our state is enacting educational policy not based on consideration for what is the best most effective way of teaching kids
840061 our state is enacting educational policy based on ideological commitments to notions that are entirely unrelated to education theyre related to immigration and anxiety about the predominance of other languages in our society
840062 i think within two years youll see a dramatically higher rate of students being classified as knowing english this will be a tremendous benefit for them
840063 the reclassification rate is at 13 percent now and i consider that to be scandalously low so were hoping for a dramatic increase
840064 theres a court case that says it is not segregation for a school to temporarily for educational purposes put them in a different classroom thats the only way to make them successful you dont make them successful by putting them in a class where they have no idea whats going on because they cant speak english
840065 we were told we should make sure students werent isolated in schools so we spread them out
840066 now they are saying its ok to group by language
840067 well try to bring in some social studies and science in the vocabulary
840068 what were most worried about with our high school students theyre going to be out of the content classrooms so theyre not going to be able to graduate in four years
840069 do we know all the ways yet no this is brand new

840091 actually the first time i was on stargate atlantis was not as dr keller
840092 a wraith with a heart of gold she was raised by humans and all she wanted was to be loved and accepted
840093 lots of people are used to seeing me as kaylee from firefly who is very innocent and naive and sweet shes loving and kind of wears her heart on her sleeve and dr keller is not that she has secrets she is reserved she has a lot of anxiety about her she doesnt really warm to people right away but she also has that same quality that kaylee had where shes pretty much friends with everybody
840094 thats fun to play because i get to interact with all different types of characters on my show
840095 keller and teyla rachel luttrell are kidnapped and they go through this really perilous situation and she has to step up to the plate and let go of her fraidy cat instincts
840096 she develops a little bit of a bond ill call it with ronon jason mamoa
840097 i think keller knows in her heart that she should not pursue her relationship with ronon but its just this physical attraction but she has a very intellectual attraction with mckay and i think she understands him in a way that a lot of other people dont when hes complaining and going on and on about how terrible things are and how sick he is or whatever she just kind of has a way of dissipating that in him and going okay you know what rodney just chill out so yeah with those two shes eventually going to have to make a choice
840098 if no one is harvesting its just going into the sea its serving no beneficial purpose
840099 there just isnt the water in the river that there used to be and it seems to be getting less and less each year any larger falls of rain seem to have far less impact on water levels than in the past and the rain records bear this out
840100 we believe fcig taking water out of the waima catchment would have a significant impact on the river system and their application should be declined
840101 i have heard that many farming families will leave after cashing up as soon as a consent is granted what does that do for the school a lot of the community spirit that the area now boasts will change
840102 considering the weather im rapt its a good turn out
840103 i have fed them together you can make enough milk to feed two babies its the easiest way to feed them
840104 its about the kids isnt it it should be the kids we should be counting
840105 we are over the moon with the turn out and really thrilled to see that mothers are feeling supported enough to be out in public breastfeeding
840106 the day breastfeeding is ho hum will be a great day because it will mean its normal and thats the way we feed our babies
840107 it just brings a momentum and a movement right here to my backyard
840108 barack obamas message is that change happens from the bottom up
840109 for a community like sarasota to have the opening of an office is a big resource for our community

840113 im not sticking around if im going to get yelled at for nothing
840114 in the very first week we were in black park near pinewood and we were all so excited about starting work
840115 and then on the last night the wind died it stopped raining and it wasnt cold anymore we had these four massive cherry pickers with these huge lights on them and the rays made the rain drops glimmer on all the trees it was just stunning there was our cameraman sitting on a quad bike which was doubling as the gorgonopsid chasing us through the woods at 30 miles an hour and that was the day when i thought here i am in the woods pretending to run away from a 30 foot dinosaur this is absolutely what i signed up for
840116 we passionately believe that the best special effects in the world mean little unless they are coupled to an exciting and compelling human story our series is as much or more about the people who come into contact with our creatures as it is about the beasts themselves this is a story about all kinds of human emotions grief love laughter fear and courage and each of our principal characters has a long journey to go on for us the drama always comes first and special effects are only a way to tell the story more effectively not the reason for telling it in the first place this series in essence asks the questions what would any of us do in the most extraordinary of circumstances how would we behave if we met a dinosaur in the supermarket or the school playground what would happen if humanity was suddenly confronted with its dark and terrifying past in the face of unimaginable crisis would we stand together or fall apart
840117 why me what do you want from me im not capable
840118 bwa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha geeze i hope that was supposed to be funny hmm maybe not
840119 holy crap no freaking way wrong on so many levels

840121 is this really supposed to be part of the same series
840122 maybe stephenie meyer was hospitalized for months and months and months so they just hired a ghost writer
840123 i think i may burn all four books once im done with this one im so over this series
840124 bwa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha i know that was supposed to be funny ahh emmett
840125 oh no is she going to kill them off which ones how many maybe not i hope not i hopenotihopenotihopenot
840126 now that im done i understand the whole purpose of this series this is fabulous
840127 we take matters like this very seriously and i am sorry that this was not picked up in the publishing process

840133 lay not your treasures on earth where moths eat and thieves steal but instead lay your treasures in heaven where moths cannot eat and theives cannot steal for wherever your treasure is so will your heart be
840134 and even now as a hall of famer the one thing i want to make very clear is that my identity and my security is found in the lord
840135 lord who am i that you are mindful of me and the apostle paul says think of what you were when you were called not many were wise by human standards not many were influential not many were born of noble birth
840136 they were the melendez family and a good friend named doug taft and they told me about a man named jesus jesus saved my soul gave me a different perspective on life he showed me i could be a man and walk right the things my son talked about i can have integrity i can be honest i can be faithful i can be true and so i brought what my parents had taught me and what jesus had said and i put that to work in my nfl career and god told me not to leave washington d c so i was there for 20 years that was during free agency time yes i was a part of that i was a part of that free agency but god had a plan for me i stayed the course not only did i stay the course on the field i stayed the course faithfully to this woman for almost 24 years faithfully to my community faithfully to my pastor pastor brett fuller and the grace covenant church in chantilly va faithful to my community and the centers and the other works and faithful to the people i believe that this day is a part of the continuation of gods sovereign purpose and righteous destiny for my life and that being knowing jesus loving him and making him known i did that even as a professional football player everywhere i went and that was done through the visibility the influence the access all that god gives us the lord gives us while we play a childhood game can i tell you today at the expense of sounding real self righteous i belong here i belong here i belong here i belong here because i know what to do with it i know what to do with gods fame with gods dollars with gods visibility gods influence and relationships i know what to do with it to jesus be the glory thank you bless you
840137 if it makes you happy then it cant be that bad if it makes you happy then why the hell are you so sad
840138 maybe this is a triple a rochester team in minnesota
840139 rochester has taken one on the chin to the benefit of the major league club
840140 they all understand what were trying to do down there manager stan cliburn and pitching coach stu cliburn in triple a understand that we want these guys to be versatile be able to move around a little bit play both sides
840141 they move them all around down there if you look at the triple a lineup you see guys playing everywhere
840142 friends are angels who lift our feet when our own wings have trouble remembering how to fly
840143 of course she knows how much we learn from her
840144 i know the truth of who you are i know the truth even if you dont and i will hold the space for you until you know it too i will be your witness
840145 we knew that we did something different not started a tradition
840146 i wasnt picked to dot the i i was just in the right place at the right time
840147 hey you switch places with the trumpet player in the dot
840148 the turn was an impulse reaction when drum major myron mckelvey arrived three or four measures too soon at the top of the

840150 we are therefore christs ambassadors as though god were making his appeal through us we implore you on christs behalf be reconciled to god
840151 therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed the prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective
840152 do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit but in humility consider others better than yourselves each of you should look not only to your own interests but also to the interests of others
840153 and he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others two men went up unto the temple to pray the one a pharisee and the other a publican the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god i thank thee that i am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican i fast twice in the week i give tithes of all that i possess and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted
840154 we are here to defeat destroy you and uplift truth
840155 as it is written there is none righteous no not one
840156 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god
840157 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord
840158 but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord
840159 but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him
840160 whoever will call on the name of the lord will be saved

840165 i had a meeting at sophies school today they do not think she is retarded
840166 i thought we werent going to use that word because of sophie
840167 okay no duh the school confirms what zach and abie have been saying for years i am also convinced that when sophie looks into my eyes she is looking into my soul and she doesnt always like what she sees
840168 i keep thinking about how that response i sent you wasnt the response you needed to hear this whole retarded thing is probably full of problems it probably means shell lose her services right

840283 hedge funds there is no product only wealth it is flabbergasting to my patients too they can make so much money at once and then lose it
840284 it used to be that my patients were the children of the rich inheritors people who suffered from the neglect of jet setting parents or from the fear that no matter what they did they would never measure up to their fathers accomplishments
840285 now i see so many young people people in their 30s and 40s whove made the money themselves
840286 they are almost all of them smarter than i am and certainly more competent
840287 one of the things that drew a very wealthy woman to see me was that she was an inadequate tennis player

840312 prima vennero per i comunisti e io non dissi nulla perch non ero comunista poi vennero per i socialdemocratici io non dissi nulla perch non ero socialdemocratico poi vennero per i sindacalisti e io non dissi nulla perch non ero sindacalista poi vennero per gli ebrei e io non dissi nulla perch non ero ebreo poi vennero a prendere me e non era rimasto pi nessuno che potesse dire qualcosa

840315 e una biografia di tamara de lempicka una donna che ammiro sia per lo stile di vita che per le sue opere conosci
840316 si stiamo proprio una di fronte allaltra pare e da poco che abito a venezia e non conosco ancora nessuno ma tu non sei veneziana quel libro che stai leggendo in che lingua e
840317 era una donna eccezionale si racconta che persino dannunzio si fosse innamorato di lei ma lei lo respinse pensa uno degli uomini piu potenti famosi e ricchi dellitalia quel tempo e non riusci mai a possederla
840318 credo che lattrazione sia in fondo solo una reazione chimica dissi cercando di apparire intelligente a me e capitato di essere attratta da persone delle quali pensandoci adesso a mente fredda non riesco ad intravedere alcuna qualita degna di nota
840319 anche io la penso cosi anche a me e accaduto ed accade tuttora
840320 accademia ma ho unidea perche non ci facciamo una passeggiata io non ho fretta potrei accompagnarti fino a san marco e poi da li proseguirei prendendo dalla fenice poi da santangelo e da campo santo stefano e un giro un po lungo ma lo faccio volentieri
840321 di solito prendo sempre il vaporetto non sono ancora pratica di questa citta per me e come un labirinto ma se mi fai da guida non rischio di perdermi accetto
840322 insipido ecco il termine giusto e insipido mancava di sapore
840323 semplicemente glielo ho detto gli ho detto che preferivo dormire da sola tutto qui quindi prima dellalba gli ho fatto prendere le sue cose e lho pregato di andarsene promettendogli che lo avrei chiamato io cosa che ovviamente non ho piu fatto credo che trovero qualche suo messaggio in segreteria ma non posso farci nulla sono fatta cosi e prima che con gli altri devo convivere con me stessa
840324 per trionfare nella vita occorre desiderarlo con tutte le nostre forze era il motto di tamara de lempicka e sai come erano chiamate le lesbiche nella parigi degli anni trenta
840325 amazzoni tamara era unamazzone il suo piu grande amore e stata la duchessa de la salle ma piu che lesbica era bisessuale quasi sempre dipingeva durante la notte anche fino allalba quando ritornava dalle orge e dai baccanali parigini guarda ecco una sua foto
840326 guarda i suoi occhi non credi che siano pieni di vitalita
840327 era una donna sfuggente libera libertina innegabilmente un mito ma troppo ambiziosa per i miei gusti se dovessi scegliere unamica preferirei un altro tipo di donna una come ad esempio la sua modella preferita pare fosse una prostituta di strada e raffigurata in diversi dipinti ecco guarda il mio preferito e questo
840328 lo penso anchio confermasti e tu le assomigli molto e stato dipinto nel 1927 e si chiama rafa la sur fond vert e leffigie dellerotismo a proposito stiamo chiacchierando da unora e non ci siamo ancora presentate io sono kl ra
840329 chi propone il nucleare lui per primo deve dimostrare a tutti che non lo teme

840331 purtroppo la loggia degli tzigano coglion invidiosisti vorrebbe che io costrussi la centrale qui accanto a casa mia
840332 sono certa anche che qualcuno proporra un nuovo referendum e un diritto e questo anche se tu sei per il nucleare devi consentirlo a chi non lo e

840336 caro direttore per tutti quelli scioccati dalla stampa di questi giorni voglio rassicurare non siete impazziti e non sono nemmeno impazziti i giornali la questione molto semplice questo sistema fradicio e corrotto vede nelleliminazione del dissenso lunica possibilit di salvezza scrive filippo ceccarelli su repubblica in relazione al mio intervento a piazza navona nulla del genere si era mai visto e ascoltato a memoria di osservatore questa cosa ceccarelli si chiama libert non hai mai visto una persona che chiama le cose col suo nome anche quelle di cui tutti convengono sia assolutamente vietato parlare come lingerenza inaccettabile del vaticano nella vita politica del paese e nelle vite private dei cittadini italiani caro ceccarelli hai fatto unesperienza straordinaria col tempo apprezzerai la fortuna di esserti trovato l l8 luglio quello che hanno visto i presenti e gli utenti di internet una piazza ricolma di gente che stata in piedi per tre ore ad ascoltare e ad applaudire entusiasta gli interventi pi criticati dai media sono quelli che hanno avuto indiscutibilmente pi successo nel mio intervento al contrario di quello che tanti bugiardoni hanno scritto gli applausi pi forti sono stati sulle critiche alla politica del vaticano e le frasi pi forti fra quelle sono state applaudite ancora di pi questa manifestazione stata il giorno dopo descritta come un fallimento un errore un autogol stampa e tv hanno tirato fuori il manganello e con i mezzi della diffamazione della menzogna e dellinsulto stanno cercando di scoraggiare chi ha partecipato a continuare alcune ovvie piccole verit a sinistra si lamentano del fallimento della manifestazione quando lunico elemento di insuccesso costituito dai loro stessi interventi se non avessero parlato in tanti di insuccesso a dispetto dei fatti la manifestazione sarebbe stata percepita per quello che stata un successone berlusconi e i suoi sono furiosi per quanto accaduto e il sondaggio che direbbe che berlusconi ci ha guadagnato lo ha visto solo berlusconi quello che dice potrebbe non essere vero lintenzione di espellere di pietro era gi evidente da parte del pd e non per me e grillo che i due si sono separati pare che veltroni gli preferisca casini non una battuta le parlamentari che hanno difeso la carfagna sostenendo che io in quanto donna non posso attaccare unaltra donna insultando me sono cadute in contraddizione pari opportunit e carfagna sono due concetti incompatibili come previti e giustizia falso che non si possa criticare il presidente della repubblica si pu e ci sono buone ragioni per farlo ad esempio impugnando il parere dei cento costituzionalisti sul lodo alfano falso che non si possa criticare e attaccare il papa si pu e ci sono buone ragioni per farlo ho letto un po dappertutto che il papa sarebbe una figura super partes super partes non uno che si schiera con tutte le sue forze su ogni tema dalla scuola ai candidati alle elezioni alla moda e alla cucina con interventi spesso molto al di sotto delle parti cosa su cui anche la littizzetto esimia collega ha efficacemente ironizzato la reazione furibonda di tutto il mondo politico alle parole di alcuni liberi pensatori dimostra che gli interventi fatti sono stati importanti ed efficaci la repressione dei media rivela la debolezza politica di una classe dirigente che in entrambi i poli nata a tavolino gli unici elementi che hanno una oggettiva radice popolare e sono rappresentati in parlamento allo stato attuale sono lega e di pietro e crescono berlusconi e pd calano vertiginosamente c un partito finto il pd nato senza idee tranne quella di fondere due partiti per ingrandirsi con lo stesso criterio con cui si accorpano le banche per essere pi forti questo partito votato controvoglia dalla maggioranza dei suoi elettori si rivelato fin dai primi passi un soggetto politico artificiale che somiglia pi a un corpo diplomatico che altro molti dei vip che lo hanno sostenuto ora sono colti da attacchi isterici constatando che non sta in piedi dallaltra parte ci sono delle idee che vogliono essere rappresentate e discusse idee davvero alternative a quelle del centrodestra la qual cosa nel momento in cui si cerca di costruire unalternativa ha la sua porca importanza e fa s che queste idee vengano considerate oggettivamente interessanti dallopinione pubblica per quanto riguarda lannosa questione pu un comico fare politica si tratta anche qui di una domanda che non esiste in natura ovvio e tutti sanno che chiunque parli a un pubblico fa politica ovvio che la politica in una democrazia la fanno tutti ma la vera domanda che si pone pu un comico ottenere molto pi consenso politico di un politico pu il discorso di un comico essere molto pi politico di quello di un politico i fatti dicono di s e tocca abbozzare potete anche continuare a menare le mani ma sarebbe meglio fare uno sforzo di comprensione daltra parte parlo per me ma credo anche a nome degli altri le nostre idee sono l e si possono usare gratuitamente approfittatene
840337 quanto a leggi che limitano la libert despressione io non ne ho viste ammeterai che fino a questo momento il tuo un processo alle intenzioni
840338 non ho detto che sei schieraro ma che hai degli amici pure io ho degli amici nel pd
840339 la coerenza ha comunque un fondamento di verita di correttezza e di onesta non e poco

840346 i blog sono un importante strumento per diffondere le idee e la democrazia ma la vera democrazia non si esercita n sui blog n nelle piazze sar un po conservatore ma solo il voto nelle urne ci dice cosa vuole la maggioranza dei cittadini
840347 ognuno la stessa notizia rappresenta a suo modo io leggo tutte e poi mi faccio la mia idea
840348 vede la cita che sta sparendo al orizzonte fu fondata nel 1010 ma le prime testimonianze scritte risalgono al 1071 nel 1612 fu la capitale de facto della russia poich mosca era stata occupata dai polacchi certo ha bellissimi edifici religiosi e civili perfettamente conservati meta di un turismo nazionale lunica cosa deludente era il cibo non ce niente di meglio di un buon piatto di pasta ho una fame tremenda i russi certamente della cucina non capiscono molto
840349 per fortuna hanno appena aperto il ristorante mi sa che oggi lo tengono aperto solo per un ora ce la serata danzante dopo
840350 urcha ho un buco nero nello stomaco signorina se non le dispiace posiamo cenare insieme e meglio che ci sbrighiamo prima che chiudano
840351 grazie molto gentile la sua oferta ma credo che saltero oggi la cena sa non mangio tanto di sera e poi e ancora presto per me
840352 come preferisce signorina anche se devo ammettere che non ha nessuna ragione per preoccupasi per la sua linea
840353 era un mossa furba pensai al primo momento aspettandomi un altra prova di aggancio ma lei non lo fecce
840354 e il ristorante comunque non chiude fino alle 23 00 lei lo sapeva sento il bisogno di dirle un grazie ormai
840355 ha menzionato il corso di ballo che dovrebbe volgersi stasera
840356 ho letto da qualche parte che stasera fanno la dimostrazione e un piccolo corso dei balli popolari russi kalinka barynya khorovod trepak troika
840357 mi piace ballare sin da piccola quando ballavo davanti a un specchio di quelli usati nei camerini dei teatri circondato di lampadine con la luce giusta ma implacabile con gli anni in quel specchio mentre gli danzavo davanti si rifletteva un cigno grazioso con i movimenti che facevano invidia alle primedonne del grande balletto russo il professore ahahha il professore parla tanto quando ballo non ascolto e non parlo uno dei rari momenti ahaha come quando faccio lamore per esempio sorrisi con un aria volutamente seducente o quando mi immergo nelle emozioni coinvolta dal libro che sto leggendo credo che i movimenti del corpo il linguaggio che parla supera ogni capacita comunque limitata orale e linguistica e un linguaggio piu che internazionale molto piu di un esperanto o un inglese universale anche se parla una lingua sola quella del anima davanti al linguaggio del corpo le parole mutiscono
840358 sono daccordo con lei ballare subconsciamente solo perche non posso fare altrimenti mi fa chiudere i occhi una mia amica mi disse una volta non fidarti mai delle donne che baciano e ballano con i occhi aperti il dialogo con il cuore e lanima si manifesta al interno delle palpebre
840359 quale il suo ballo preferito chiesi ormai intrigata dal svolgimento della conversazione
840360 il flamenco e il tango direi il flamenco per la influenza forte dal popolo nomade dei gitani un popolo di quale condivido tanti aspetti un ballo che si balla perfettamente da soli ma non nasce dal ballo per se ma dal canto che lo circonda il tango daltronde per la complicita che crea rapido e tumultuoso per la sua essenza basata sullimprovvisazione dove sta alla fantasia dei ballerini costruire come in un dialogo il proprio ballo poche regole semplici e la passione che lo caratterizza si la passione forse lunica parola che li rende giustizia credo che ogni attivita che ci coinvolge come la danza per esempio e le forme che prende parlano molto della nostra ineriorita
840361 interessante lei saprebbe intuire da quel poco che conversiamo quali sarebbero i miei balli preferiti
840362 il flamenco senzaltro per le ragioni gia descritte e poi fatemi pensare forse per vostro accento forse per la immagine che mi sono creato il cs rd s per la bellezza e semplicita umile nel stesso momento il ballo che nasce lentamente per evolvere in una parte veloce caratterizzata da numerosi giri e salti il alternarsi tra motivi allegri e tristi incalzanti e malinconici la ciarda si il dolce camino seducente della donna che annuisce sorridendo ai uomini che a volte piegano i loro ginocchi e risorgono improvvisamente
840363 ha tralasciato il ballo orientale ma comunque complimenti loriente mi ha affascinato da sempre e posso dire che mi rispecchio in molti suoi aspetti la danza orientale per esempio una delle mie preferite tradotta erroneamente dai francesi in danza del ventre non assolutamente una danza erotica il lato seduttivo una conseguenza non certo lelemento centrale di solito un ballo delle donne fatto per le donne crea una complicit incredibile
840364 interessante se posso dirlo senza offendere la percezione dei colori di daltonici deve essere un dono piu che un difetto direi scarnarsi e essere liberi dalle percezioni e convinzioni impostateci dalle regole scritte da chi sa chi la cosiddetta cultura e civilta i dogmi e pragmatismi vuole dire esaltare la individualita se il dio esiste esiste sicuramente in ognuno di noi e ognuno di noi ha il stesso diritto di affermare che le fragole sono rose verdi blu o qualsiasi colore del spettro la percezione dei colori come daltronde delle idee ideali sogni puramente individuale rende questo mondo splendidamente colorato se non fossi cosi il arcobaleno non avrebbe il suo fascino
840365 il silenzio limpido lungo le coline sfiorano il cielo i uccelli taciono iil fiume e sempre piu lento e ululante traspira di rasigurazioni gocce di pioggia impalpabili sembrano non bagnare il sole e in fuoco una stella del vespro la torrente d ambrosia muore solo per oggi in sua gloria per rinascere come la fenice dietro di se lascia traccia di un rosso immortale
840366 le cose che veramente contano nella vita quelle che ci lasciano una impronta indelebile nel anima quelle piu preziose non si possono comprare con i soldi e sono gratuite a tutti lamore lamicizia gli ideali ma anche questo tramonto a prima vista cosi banale ma assai speciale non crede
840367 mi scusi lei lavora qui mi potrebbe dare una mano
840368 perche non puoi eri gia bagnata mi piaci molto tundi non vuoi che ti faccia godere
840369 le mestruazioni rezs sono tutta bagnata lo hai detto anche tu devo andare a lavarmi
840370 tundi tu non la racconti giusta non hai le mestruazioni perche tinventi questa cosa
840371 tundi non sono mestruazioni ma non dirmi che non lo sai
840372 no dico che non lo hai mai fatto neanche da sola
840373 e perche non mi hai detto nulla tu mi piaci tundi lo sai che non ti avrei mai mancato di rispetto bastava che me lo dicessi
840374 certo lho capito da come ha reagito il tuo corpo accade questo alle ragazze tundi ai ragazzi invece accade qualcosa di simile ma solo alla fine
840375 senza dubbio molte altre sono venute da allora in poi si ma fra tutte quelle che abbiamo conosciuto lei lultima che dimenticheremo la prima ragazza che abbiamo preso tra le braccia
840376 la donna che odia gli uomini che odiano le donne
840377 scusi sa come ha certamente captato la sto osservando da un po e mi par di capire che lei non stia leggendo o meglio che legga senza leggere la situazione non puo che esserle ampiamente nota
840378 in questi casi una via duscita sbrigativa ed efficace potrebbe essere ad esempio per cortesia non mi rompa lasci perdere o in alternativa se desidera conversare non attenda limbrunire io tiferei per la seconda
840379 ecco appunto per cortesia non mi rompa lasci perdere se le e possibile

840461 mereka menyembunyikan kejahatan mereka daripada manusia dalam pada itu mereka tidak menyembunyikan kejahatan mereka daripada allah padahal allah ada bersama sama mereka ketika mereka merancangkan pada malam hari kata kata yang tidak diredhai oleh allah dan ingatlah allah sentiasa meliputi pengetahuannya akan apa yang mereka lakukan
840462 pengertian muhasabah ialah melihat keadaan modal keadaan keuntungan dan kerugian agar dapat mengenalpasti sebarang penambahan dan pengurangan modalnya dalam konteks agama ialah perkara yang difardhukan keuntungan ialah perkara sunat dan kerugiannya pula ialah maksiat
840463 muhasabah ialah membezakan antara apa yang diperolehinya dan apa yang perlu ditanggungnya setelah mengetahui yang demikian maka dia hendaklah membawa apa yang diperolehinya dan melunaskan apa yang ditanggungnya dia seolah olah seorang musafir yang tidak akan kembali

840467 orang yang bijak ialah orang yang menundukkan hawa nafsunya dan beramal untuk hari selepas mati orang yang lemah ialah orang yang mengikuti hawa nafsunya dan berangan angan sesuatu di sisi allah
840468 hitunglah diri kamu sebelum kamu dihitung timbanglah amalanmu sendiri sebelum ia ditimbangkan untukmu dan bersedialah untuk hari pembentangan amal yang besar sesungguhnya hisab pada hari kiamat menjadi ringan bagi sesiapa yang melakukan muhasabah diri di dunia ini
840469 seseorang itu tidak bertakwa sehinggalah dia memuhasabah dirinya seperti mana dia memuhasabah rakan kongsinya dari manakah makanan dan minumannya

840471 sesungguhnya seseorang hamba itu dalam keadaan baik selama mana dia mempunyai penasihat dalam dirinya dan muhasabah menjadi perkara yang penting baginya

840612 tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself
840613 and that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams because every second of the search is a seconds encounter with god and with eternity
840614 the worlds greatest lie is that at a certain point in our lives we lose control of whats happening to us and our lives become controlled by fate

840821 jim i wonder if you might do me a huge favor the head of our programming committee has moved and we need someone to fill that gap right away we need someone who can speak to the leaders of our local companies and persuade them to come and speak at our meetings would you be interested
840822 while no decisions have been made at this time they will be made collaboratively with senator clinton and her staff the dnc and senator obamas campaign and released at the appropriate time
840823 im waiting too to see if bill shows up at the convention
840824 obama never said clinton was a racist and neither did anyone in his campaign
840825 if you do not know who taylor marsh is and youre claiming to be a hillary supporter you are nothing but a fraud
840826 because if he loses hillary clinton is going to be deeply reviled by many in the democratic base
840827 we did exactly what we should do as a campaign
840828 obamas candidacy is historic and ground breaking for many reasons not least of which is that he doesnt look like the other presidents on the dollar bill
840829 are you sure you want to vote for him ya know he doesnt look like the other presidents on the dollar bill
840830 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
840831 some republicans gave up on winning the african american vote looking the other way or trying to benefit politically from racial polarization i am here today as the republican chairman to tell you we were wrong
840832 we cant call ourselves a true majority unless we reach out to african americans and make it the party of lincoln there was a time when african american support turned democrat and we didnt do enough to retain it now we want to build on the gains we made in the last election
840833 john mccain has spent his entire life fighting for equal rights
840834 give luda a special pardon if im ever in the slammer better yet put me in office make me vice president
840835 paint the white house black and im sure thats got em terrified
840836 i want to thank mccain for calling obama out on his incessant race baiting i hope he continues to vet obama to the full extent
840837 yesterday on cnn david gergen said obama is tanking and needs hillary as vp to seal the deal
840838 for me either hillary as the nominee as she is more qualified she should not accept the vp spot
840839 remember obama mccain are running neck and neck whereas hillary clobbers mccain
840840 which was a comfortable 15 to 17 points for most of last and this year has shrunk significantly
840841 mccains narrowing lead traces not to any sudden up swelling in support for obama whose support has hovered around 38 percent for the past year and remains at that level today rather it traces to a decline in support of mccain especially among men registered independents and latinos simultaneously the proportion of voters who are uncommitted rose to 16 percent from only nine this may and ralph nader drew a small but important three percent mostly from mccain
840842 you know john mccain has spent most of the last month not talking about his ideas but talking about me
840843 and frankly i say this respectfully hes doing that because he doesnt have any new ideas
840844 unfortunately instead of talking about these real choices my opponent has been spending most of his time getting negative distorting my record using the same old washington political attacks john mccain is an honorable man we can have a serious debate about the issues but we shouldnt be spending time talking about britney we shouldnt be spending time talking about paris the american people deserve better
840845 light coming out of the sky to tell you to vote for obama
840846 just 10 say the economy is in good shape while 72 say the economy is either in a recession 54 or a depression 18 on a personal level concerns about rising prices have surged beyond widespread anxiety about energy costs a growing number of americans say it is difficult for them to afford food
840847 i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest
840848 you know hes new he doesnt look like the other presidents on the currency
840849 you know john mccain has spent most of the last month not talking about his ideas but talking about me
840850 and frankly i say this respectfully hes doing that because he doesnt have any new ideas
840851 unfortunately instead of talking about these real choices my opponent has been spending most of his time getting negative distorting my record using the same old washington political attacks john mccain is an honorable man we can have a serious debate about the issues but we shouldnt be spending time talking about britney we shouldnt be spending time talking about paris the american people deserve better
840852 i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest
840853 im proud of my campaign im running a respectful campaign
840854 if you ask what is meant when people say that senator obama has a post racial candidacy or that the reverend wright controversy burst the post racial bubble
840855 machiavelli and sun tzu working in tandem couldnt have put together a week for john mccain that would have rivaled the favorable coverage that obamas getting from his foreign tour
840856 millions of american families losing their homes losing jobs gas and food prices rising an unecessary war thats dragged on for over 5 years costing thousands of lives and trillions of dollars no wonder john mccain would rather talk about paris hilton and britney spears otherwise hell have to talk about his plans to continue the failed policies of george bush that got us into this mess thats not leadership thats a lack of ideas and now he wants to suggest someone else isnt ready to lead
840857 im not for quote privatizing social security i never have been i never will be
840858 without privatization i dont see how you can possibly over time make sure that young americans are able to receive social security benefits
840859 as part of social security reform i believe that private savings accounts are a part of it along the lines that president bush proposed
840860 we can also afford to spend more on national defense which currently consumes less than four cents of every dollar that our economy generates far less than what we spent during the cold war
840861 mccains top economic adviser doug holtz eakin blithely supposes that cuts in defense spending could make up for reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 to 25 and the subsequent shrinkage in federal revenues get that the national security candidate wants to cut spending on our national security wait until the generals and the admirals hear that
840862 mccain promised hed offer a balanced budget by the end of his first term
840863 i would like the next president not to talk about deficit reduction
840864 that plan when appropriately phased in as it has always been intended to be will bring the budget to balance by the end of his first term
840865 the media often overlooked how compassionately she spoke to the concerns and dreams of millions of americans and she deserves a lot more appreciation than she sometimes received
840866 i did not that was in prepared remarks and i did not in the business of commenting on the press and their coverage or not coverage
840867 most great civilized countries have an income tax and an inheritance tax
840868 in my judgment both should be part of our system of federal taxation
840869 the estate tax is one of the most unfair tax laws on the books
840870 i think that presidents have the obligation to obey and enforce laws that are passed by congress and signed into law by the president no matter what the situation is
840871 so is that a no in other words federal statute trumps inherent power in that case warrantless surveillance
840872 i dont think the president has the right to disobey any law
840873 n either the administration nor the telecoms need apologize for actions that most people except for the aclu and the trial lawyers understand were constitutional and appropriate in the wake of the attacks on september 11 2001
840874 its ambiguous as to whether the president acted within his authority or not
840875 im not interested in going back im interested in addressing the challenge we face to day of trying to do everything we can to counter organizations and individuals that want to destroy this country so theres ambiguity about it lets move forward

840907 until traveling there one month ago mccain had made just one public tour of new orleans since hurricane katrina touched down in august 2005

840911 youre on cape cod youre supposed to do nothing just relax
840912 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
840913 you can see how for people who were exhausted it would have been nearly impossible for them to descend without the ropes
840914 once their hands and feet are frozen they really are unable to move on their own power and it takes other people to carry them down
840915 its more technical its steeper the weather is more intense
840916 unfortunately injuries happen in sport the team gathers itself and moves on its a setback for her we are going to try and use it within the team to try and be better

840926 you can have it high quality fast or cheap pick two of the three
840927 the three rs of the postal network plan realignment right sizing and responsiveness
840928 when the four allied companies went bankrupt we spent the first six months just fighting for survival
840929 those were tough times and culminated in two of the companies merging by the end of the year the new firm had found its feet and we were able to invest in new kit we now have around 64 employees and can offer a complete range of print related services
840930 we hadnt previously run any kba presses but we were looking for a two coater press that could print unusual substrates in a reliably high quality following the merger of boom planeta and van ketels we needed to boost capacity as quickly as possible with the active support of wifac and kba we succeeded
840931 we work closely with unitedgraphicsgroup so outsourcing would be a possible option
840932 but its not that simple our allied enterprises focus on pre press services primarily for the b2 sector while we are out to shine in the b1 market what is more whenever we have to run our presses at weekends so do all the other print providers in the region in other words during peak periods its hard to find an external printer with spare capacity we conceptualised our press specifications and production structure after conducting a careful analysis of the jobs our customers submitted our press crews work in three shifts of eight hours each weekends excepted
840933 we deliberately chose kbas high performance b1 rapidas because theyre the best on the market and so are their changeover times run lengths average around 10 000 prints and falling but even when printing short runs we are faster and cheaper than our competitors we earn money with high speed plate changes and conversions and a higher throughput
840934 at present we are going through our customer lists with a fine tooth comb to see which customers help boost our bottom line and which ones dont were not doing this out of arrogance but in order to safeguard the companys future turning away low margin work creates capacity for jobs that are more profitable but which we would otherwise have been unable to take on in the present day market environment print providers sometimes have to take painful decisions such as these
840935 we are proud to be recognized as best of show by infotrends at the past two on demand shows
840936 the transpromo summit is a great opportunity to demonstrate how our breadth and depth of products address every aspect of transpromo for the enterprise
840937 our improving cost structure and strengthened balance sheet continue to reflect the companys enhanced operating discipline and the success of our business improvement plan
840938 despite the negative impact of reduced u s equipment sales in the quarter the companys lean cost structure drove a net profit
840939 adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization were 4 2 million a 20 increase versus last year and debt net of cash at june 28 2008 was 22 6 million a 31 improvement over last year at the same time our third quarter 2008 results will include the benefits of the previously announced sale of the land and building of our lasertel property in tucson arizona for 8 75 million
840940 while european revenue recovered in the second quarter u s equipment sales were disappointing as economic headwinds challenged our ability to offset the expected erosion in our traditional portfolio with increased sales of our growth portfolio products however the improved operating discipline and cost structure that we have successfully created will leverage the profitability of future sales growth as the economy improves
840941 we have demonstrated excellent progress in significantly improving profitability and gross margin as well as reducing net debt
840942 when we developed our operating margin targets we did not anticipate the low level of european sales in the first quarter of 2008 which resulted from our 2007 business reviews the severity of the weakened u s economic picture and increased legal expenses related to the defense of our intellectual property and regulatory matters at the end of the first half of 2008 our operating margin is 4 while we are still driving our team to achieve these targets we believe it is prudent at this time to modify our 2008 operating margin guidance to a range between our current margin of 4 and the lower end of our target range as we are not optimistic about an economic recovery in the second half of this year as we monitor the economic situation through the remainder of 2008 we will be in a better position to assess our 2009 financial goals
840943 while the economy is beyond our control we made excellent progress in areas within our control i am extremely proud of the presstek team for delivering a first half improvement in income from continuing operations of 6 4 million or 0 18 per share results like this are only achieved with focus extreme dedication and relentless hard work when the economy begins to improve we will be well positioned to leverage revenue growth into higher levels of profitability
840944 we are the worlds first and only company to fully integrate the next generation of usps barcode technology with a personalized url platform
840945 the addition of intelligent mail barcode support into the easy personalized urls www easypurl com software solidifies our position as the most advanced direct mail tracking and reporting platform in the industry
840946 even with all these exciting benefits the most revolutionary marketing possibility with this program is the ability to trigger personalized email communications to direct mail recipients based on the confirmed delivery of each individual mail piece our testing has demonstrated that this can boost direct mail response rates by 30 percent or more
840947 to put it simply easy personalized urls will now be able to report mail piece delivery along with web response information
840948 our customers will now have a 360 degree view of information about their direct mail program beginning from the moment their direct mailing is dropped into the mail stream all the way through to user response
840949 we felt that incorporating intelligent mail barcodes into our cross media platform plugged a gaping hole not addressed by any competing personalized url solution
840950 the technical challenges in this integration were daunting but the benefits and competitive advantage afforded to our customer base justified the investment
840951 in this months report manufacturers indicate no change in overall business activity when comparing july to june this continues a trend biased toward relatively minor contraction established more than 12 months ago manufacturing has maintained a reasonable level of activity during a period in which other sectors of the economy have been in recession while the pmi indicates little to no change has occurred during this period it would be hard to convince manufacturers who are faced with higher costs and uncertain demand that there is little change taking place
840952 our company has gone to a four day 10 hour week in an effort to curtail energy costs for the company and for employees
840953 competitive market forces are preventing companies from boosting prices high enough to recover raw material input costs
840954 it is almost impossible to keep up with the complexity of never ending price movement
840955 we have had two large projects cancelled that we believe are solely due to the uncertain economy
840956 there is no question that 2008 has been a turbulent economic year and the worst may not yet be behind us graph expo offers the perfect venue to share dr joe webbs insight with show attendees
840957 manrolands generosity as the exclusive sponsor of this important event has enabled whattheythink to make it free to all attendees for the sixth year in a row we are honored by their decision to support this event

840959 the printing ink industry continues to experience unprecedented increases in the supply chain of all our raw materials
840960 these increases are directly and indirectly related to crude oil increases as well as large swings in the manufacturing capacity of some of the primary raw material manufacturers
840961 unfortunately these markets will continue to be under pressure for the foreseeable future
840962 sun chemical is committed to continue providing our customers with innovative products services and constant supply allowing them to present the best value propositions in the market
840963 the brochures from printingforless com were very effective in my campaign advertising results
840964 there were five candidates running for the office of county commissioner and i received just over 50 percent of the votes i believe the brochure made a significant difference in the election
840965 we want to help you save time and money creating printing and mailing election campaign materials that reflect your specific message

840967 the attention paid by timberland to sustainability best practices as timberland and its agencies designed and rolled out this campaign is truly a modern exemplar of how it can be done and what our conference is all about
840968 at timberland we are committed to making it better by reducing our environmental footprint from the way we build our stores package and design our products and select our resources as a company with a passion for the outdoors we believe that doing our best to make it better for our planet is at the core of our business
840969 carrying the fsc and sfi certification logos on your print products tells the world that you support the highest social and environmental standards in the market place
840970 chain of custody certification means we will be able to service the increasing market demand for environmentally friendly products weve always been environmentally conscious but being chain of custody certified by both of these groups lets our employees and our customers know how high our level of commitment to sustainable forestry really is
840971 bureau veritas visited three of our facilities to verify our process and procedures
840972 the auditor checked our entire process ensuring we maintain the chain of custody have an adequate audit trail and most importantly have trained the entire staff to understand our commitment and the importance of sustainable forestry
840973 well be gathering data and challenging ourselves to go above and beyond
840974 for example we currently test and gather data on products used in the print process inks and coatings are available that are voc volatile organic compound free manufacturers are continuing to develop solvents washes and a variety of press room chemicals that are safe or safer for the environment we test these new products in our controlled environment if they produce the results our clients are looking for we move that product into our process
840975 customers at drupa will be able to discover the many innovative and enhanced products that compose has lined up for the event

840994 i was house sitting for friends who were on vacation
840995 they didnt tell me they were having experiences they wanted to see if i had anything
840996 were not only out here looking for something to happen

840998 senator mccain has always said that withdrawal has to be based on conditions on the ground and the judgment of military commanders
840999 theres not as much disagreement there as i think people may perceive
841000 the resources they consider necessary to carry out their mission
841001 no amount of additional u s forces can affect the outcome
841002 john mccains essential focus has been on the tactical issue of sending more troops
841003 hes made his entire approach to foreign policy rest on that support of bushs decision to send more troops in
841004 senator obama doesnt understand he doesnt understand whats at stake here
841005 he chose to take the political path that would have helped him get the nomination of his party
841006 if we place 30 000 more troops in there then we would see an improvement in the security situation and a reduction in the violence
841007 i think it is indisputable that weve seen violence reduced
841008 and thats a credit to our brave men and women in uniform
841009 far less was accomplished under this contract than originally planned
841010 millions of dollars in waste are likely associated with incomplete terminated and abandoned projects under this contract
841011 failure to complete some of the work was understandable because of its complex nature and unstable security environment
841012 it hasnt been completed yet for it to be handed over to us
841013 at this point the entire amount disbursed for this project may ultimately be wasted because the government of iraq currently has no plan for completing or using this facility
841014 but they report that there now appears to be a degree of durability to the gains we have made
841015 things look so much better than a few weeks ago that i think we are near to reaching agreement
841016 i dont think it will take months were looking at more like days or weeks
841017 israelis wouldnt do for olmert what talansky did for olmert
841018 the important consideration for many american donors is that they can help change israel in the way that they support an israeli businessman on the other hand may look at it as an investment and for an investment you have to get something in return
841019 setting up a government that is working for the people
841020 if were going to crow about the fact that 12 million iraqis voted and elected their own leadership we have to pay attention to their leadership
841021 we cant have it both ways we should say were heading for the door
841022 i find it interesting that prime minister maliki is now the person to go to
841023 there are some members who feel because of what is happening out there a little hung out to dry
841024 following brain stem testing that was carried out earlier today ben mullany has now passed away
841025 the thoughts of all the staff who were involved in bens care are with his family at this very sad time
841026 the state of israel faces determined enemies who seek its destruction but it also has a friend and ally in the united states that will always stand by the people of israel
841027 the way you know where somebodys going is where have they been
841028 and ive been with israel for many many years now
841029 thats an issue that has to be dealt with with the parties involved the palestinians and the israelis
841030 and its not the job of the united states to dictate the form in which that will take but rather to support the efforts that are being made right now to resolve these very difficult issues that have a long history
841031 i think we have a window right now that needs to be taken advantage of
841032 a nuclear iran would be a game changing situation not just in the middle east but around the world
841033 that could shred the nuclear proliferation framework and possibly allow terrorists to get their hands on such weapons
841034 we agreed that the greatest priority in our foreign policy is that both countries must prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
841035 mobilize the international community to offer a series of big sticks and big carrots to the iranian regime to stand down on nuclear weapons we have to do it now
841036 he needs to show that he is supportive of the israelis in order to win the votes of the americans
841037 security forces from both sides have targeted activists of the other party their abusive behavior has victimized palestinians from all walks of life and weakened the rule of law
841038 acts of detention torture and other cruel inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment against civilians in the west bank and gaza strip since june 2007
841039 definitely abuses of human rights and we are committed to fixing them
841040 the violations in the west bank stem from the fact that israel has not permitted our security forces to train and has destroyed our police stations and jails in gaza they stem from a military coup and a refusal to accept the other it is a mistake to compare these two situations
841041 officials on both sides listened to our concerns and said they would consider them each also said the violations were much worse on the other side
841042 they said they do hold violators accountable but those words are inconsistent with the facts on the ground
841043 laid the groundwork for a new philosophy for iraqis respect of human rights rights of suspects to a fair trial whoever they are and regardless of the cruelty or viciousness of their crimes
841044 no matter how high someones position is and how much power he has at his command one of these days he will be held accountable
841045 our deepest regrets of sympathy and condolences go out to the family
841046 why did they do this to us my father liked the americans very much
841047 the american soldiers are guilty why did they do this why
841048 when the vehicle failed to respond to the soldiers warning measures it was engaged with small arms fire
841049 people of the world look at berlin where a wall came down a continent came together and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one

841051 it is the one way the only way to protect our common security and advance our common humanity
841052 id love to give a speech in germany a political speech or a speech that maybe the german people would be interested in but i would much prefer to do it as president of the united states rather than as a candidate for the office of the presidency
841053 you have billed this event as a presidential town hall and i sincerely hope that the next president is here today
841054 my opponent of course is traveling in europe and tomorrow his tour takes him to france in a scene lance would recognize a throng of adoring fans awaits senator obama in paris and thats just the american press
841055 defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
841056 the walls between old allies on either side of the atlantic cannot stand
841057 the walls between the countries with the most and those with the least cannot stand the walls between races and tribes natives and immigrants christian and muslim and jew cannot stand these now are the walls we must tear down
841058 president bush has been working with the iraqis to encourage them to work out their differences and get the provincial elections law passed
841059 is inconsistent with israels commitments under the road map and does not contribute to an environment supportive of negotiations
841060 they are destroying all credibility among our people its absolutely undermining everything were trying to do
841061 i cant put a number on it but there are going to be more were short of nato troops were short of american troops were short 3 000 trainers of the afghan army
841062 if were going to come out of there successful weve got to have more troops
841063 seems like the talibans built back up and its becoming a problem again
841064 finish the job increase the troops or otherwise withdraw theres no point in sacrificing lives if you dont accomplish your job
841065 there is no consensus as to what secularism is and how it should be maintained
841066 what you have is leaders who are not secular who are trying to change the rigorous aspects of secularism the ruling party has accepted the continuation of secularism what it is trying to do is adjust it to take it to the wishes of the electorate
841067 i think he does still have issues with the jewish community
841068 in the end i think hes going to do as well as any democratic nominee with the jewish community but people still have to feel more comfortable with him
841069 there was some very serious thought that went into this
841070 there is an extraordinary amount of attention and its for good reason
841071 people believe senator obama is going to win the election and become the next president of the united states
841072 as impressive and phenomenal as the senators campaign has been he just hasnt been on the scene as long as others have been
841073 and the jewish community is one that has a special feeling when it comes to roots
841074 i believe that the best way to support iraqi sovereignty and to encourage the iraqis to stand up is through the responsible redeployment of our combat brigades
841075 its unrealistic to expect that a u s president alone can suddenly snap his fingers about bringing about peace in this region
841076 the notion is is that either i do exactly what my military commanders tell me to do or im ignoring their advice
841077 no im factoring in their advice but placing it in this broader strategic framework thats required
841078 i will leave it to the voters to make that decision
841079 by continuing his opposition to the surge strategy long after it has proven successful and by admitting that his plan for withdrawal places him at odds with general david petraeus barack obama has made clear that his goal remains unconditional withdrawal rather than securing the victory our troops have earned and the surge has made possible
841080 senator barack obama arrived in baghdad on monday meeting with prime minister maliki and other senior iraqi politicians as an iraqi spokesman said that the government was hopeful that foreign combat troops would withdraw in 2010
841081 sen barack obama received a fresh boost monday to his troop withdrawal plan from the iraqi government which directly affirmed for the first time that it shares obamas goal of pulling u s troops out of iraq by the end of 2010
841082 republican sen john mccain on monday drew closer to his democratic presidential opponents timetable on iraq saying that u s troops could be largely withdrawn in two years
841083 the iraqis have been sending signals for months they didnt want long term u s bases they didnt want u s troops acting independently any more they wanted some sort of drawdown
841084 in iraq it means that maliki now feels confident that he is in charge of the government and that the governments internal opposition the sunni insurgent remnants and the followers of muqtada al sadr dont have the strength to threaten him or his kurdish and hakim family allies
841085 if we wait until the next administration it could be a year before we get those additional troops on the ground here in afghanistan and i think that would be a mistake
841086 i think the situation is getting urgent enough that weve got to start doing something now
841087 our message to the afghan government is this we want a strong partnership based on more for more more resources from the united states and nato and more action from the afghan government to improve the lives of the afghan people
841088 the discussions focused on the significant progress that weve made but also on the unmet challenges we still have ahead of us
841089 the discussions also focused on the difficulties were facing the difficult challenges of the fight against corruption counternarcotics and also the continuing threat of terrorism and fundamentalism not just threatening the way of life in afghanistan but also in the region
841090 losing is not an option when it comes to al qaeda and it never has been
841091 and thats why the fact that we engaged in a war of choice when we were not yet finished with that task was such a mistake
841092 number nines purpose was to not only chart the race but see what the earth looks like from a birds point of view the perspective that all good poets should have seeing places that we think we know from a whole new perspective
841093 the camera will probably be found by a bushwalker at thirroul or somewhere
841094 what we found from the trial was that people who used the guide with small amounts of telephone support had significant reductions in their level of depression
841095 it meant an awful lot to marcella to be able to help people less fortunate than herself and that is why she worked at lifeline
841096 she always felt the guide would be of great benefit for people to have something to hold something to work with
841097 she didnt really like to talk about what she was doing but we all knew if she wasnt working at lifeline she was thinking of lifeline
841098 it sends the message that it is ok to pull out a knife and stab someone this is outrageous
841099 there used to be a saying that the gun was a form of communication id say its definitely knives now
841100 we get kids stabbed on a train or at parties
841101 the message is this is not a fashion accessory they can really cause a lot of damage

841150 illicit behavior by local officials could expose western firms to potentially vast environmental human rights and financial liabilities
841151 the odds of an average corrupt official going to jail are at most 3 out of 100 making corruption a high return low risk activity
841152 corruption in china is concentrated in the sectors with extensive state involvement
841153 the absence of a competitive political process and a free press in china makes these high risk sectors even more susceptible to fraud theft kickbacks and bribery
841154 beijing punishes only a very small proportion of party members or government officials tainted by corruption
841155 corruption puts western firms intellectual property rights particularly at risk because unscrupulous local officials routinely protect chinese counterfeiters in exchange for bribes

841173 the actuality of god karl barth in conversation with open theism
841174 the act of electing is the act of a someone it cannot be an act of no one which upon its occurrence constitutes a someone
841175 the book is well worth its price tag for this essay alone
841176 in a nutshell if i can put it rather crudely it is because of the man jesus that god is god
841177 it is because god is god that there is the man jesus
841178 in a nutshell if i can put it rather crudely it is because of the man jesus that god is god
841179 gods own being is constituted by his decision to be god for us in jesus
841180 jesus christ is the electing god we must not ask concerning any other but him in no depth of the godhead shall we encounter any but him there is no height or depth in which god can be god in any other way
841181 protological immanent reality that precedes gods decision of election to be god for us
841182 we must guard against disputing the eternal will of god which precedes even predestination we must not allow god to be submerged in his relationship to the universe or think of him as tied in himself to the universe under the concept of predestination or the election of grace we say that in freedom its affirmation and not its loss god tied himself to the universe under the concept of predestination we confess the eternal will of the god who is free in himself even in the sense that originally and properly he wills and affirms and confirms himself
841183 there is for example the distinction between his willing of himself and his willing of the possibility and reality of his creation as distinct from himself
841184 it seems that gods being precedes gods act and is the source thereof
841185 your way of defining gods immanent being and will posits a completed given reality that god is which is above behind gods act of election in christ
841186 the immanent trinity is complete for barth before anything that has been made was made including time itself
841187 clearly nothing in gods act of election in christ can take us further back than that act itself
841188 jesus christ is the electing god we must not ask concerning any other but him in no depth of the godhead shall we encounter any but him there is no height or depth in which god can be god in any other way
841189 we cannot say anything higher or better of the inwardness of god than that god is father son and holy spirit and therefore that he is love in himself without and before loving us and without being forced to love us and we can say this only in the light of the outwardness of god to us the occurrence of his revelation
841190 there is no such thing as godhead in itself godhead is always the godhead of the father son and holy spirit
841191 jesus christ reveals to us our election as an election which is made by him by his will which is also the will of god
841192 can only follow his prior election and that means that it follows the divine election which is the basic and proper determination of his existence as the son of the father he has no need of any special election we must add at once that he is the son of god elected in his oneness with man
841193 god is fully the immanent trinity with or without us nonetheless he is not limited to that being and act and is free to act for us and that is what takes place in election as the election of grace
841194 the whole point of barths theology is to say that gods act of election takes us into who and what god eternally is within his own immanent divine life

841199 we are going to be fighting for every vote here in missouri
841200 dont let the other side scare you from what you know in your gut you know in your gut we have to bring about change
841201 people all over the state need to have a sense that a candidate cares about them and if you dont bother to show up in rural missouri if you dont bother to ask for peoples votes all over the state then youre not going to win statewide in missouri
841202 southwest missourians are much more focused on substance at the end of the day than style
841203 no question he has style he gives a great speech but theres a reason missouri has been called for years the show me state
841204 call back thursday or friday and i should give you a more definitive answer
841205 what rural missourians dont like is a candidate who dismisses whole communities out of hand
841206 a lot of people in this state would think nobody would show up for barack obama
841207 whats unique about obama and his candidacy is that almost none of the stuff the press throws at him sticks
841208 you could call obama the teflon coated candidate but this would miss the fact that his slickness goes all the way to the core
841209 weve had nothing but challenges all the way through so what else is new
841210 republicans are in desperate need of new fresh ideas and faces
841211 stevens should resign immediately the only thing he does by staying in is continue to damage his party
841212 hes been a fighter for his state for his country
841213 for all of us it would be something to consider because youre losing a lot of institutional memory
841214 the message from them is clear alaska needs ted stevens in the u s senate
841215 did senator barack obama cross a political line as he and his advisers quietly feared and some republicans hoped by coming across as too presumptuous
841216 when i first heard this sort of radically optimistic speech in iowa i have to confess my american soul was stirred it seemed like the overture for a new yet quintessentially american campaign
841217 but now it is more than half a year on and the post partisanship of iowa has given way to the post nationalism of berlin and it turns out that the vague overture is the entire symphony the golden rhetoric impresses less the evasion of hard choices strikes one more
841218 the great illusion of the 1990s was that we were entering an era of global convergence in which politics and power didnt matter
841219 mr kaine also said differences that he has with mr obama such as the politicians respective stances on abortion can be a strength mr obama is pro choice and mr kaine says that as a catholic he is personally pro life but does not think doctors or women who receive abortions should be criminalized
841220 some analysts now say mccain might gain more of an advantage by waiting until the last possible moment obama must announce his pick by the time of the democratic convention during the last week of august mccain can wait until the following week when the republican convention is held
841221 is this going to result in a kind of blessed censorship of a whole host of areas of medical care and research
841222 they are manipulating the system by manipulating the definition of the word abortion
841223 its another example of this administrations disregard for science and medicine in how agencies make decisions
841224 its a redefinition of abortion that does not match any of the current medical definitions its ideologically based and not based on science and could interfere with the development of many new therapies to treat diseases
841225 the executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisors in this or any other context
841226 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
841227 it was a victory for all who believe in checks and balances it certainly strengthens our hand
841228 the process of negotiation and accommodation that most often leads to resolution of disputes between the political branches
841229 each and every one of the core conclusions of the oig opr report is consistent with and indeed derived from ms goodlings testimony before the house judiciary committee
841230 following the way which is called heresy milton and the heretical imperative
841231 if the underlying basis of a free society is the practice of individual religious choice what then becomes of those who refuse to engage in this practice
841232 indeed the normative centre of miltons theory is constituted precisely by its exception
841233 they refuse to make the individual conscience the locus of religious authority
841234 faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god
841235 if we take your word constitute seriously then it seems you are saying that the exception is somehow a condition of the possibility for toleration and presumably this could generalize beyond miltons own case to apply to all notions of toleration
841236 i have never knowingly submitted a false disclosure form required by law as a u s senator
841237 the impact of these charges on my family disturbs me greatly i am innocent of these charges and intend to prove that
841238 it is within the power of writers and artists to do much more to defeat the lie for in the struggle with lies art has always triumphed and shall always triumph visibly irrefutably for all lies can prevail against much in this world but never against art
841239 there arent a lot of role models for us in the world or people we can look up to
841240 people who are not afraid to stick their neck out people who are not afraid to stand up for things and be unpopular to go against the grain think outside the box

841242 im a millionaire im a multi millionaire im filthy rich you know why im a multi millionaire cause multi millions like what i do thats pretty good isnt it theres millions that believe in what i do pretty cool huh
841243 the governor has been pretty clear from the beginning when senator obama asked him to be a national co chair that any conversation he has with the campaign on any topic are conversations that he is keeping private
841244 with independence whos willing to tell me where he thinks or she thinks im wrong
841245 i know how politics is i really dont think its going to matter either way
841246 how many voices in our materialist society tell us that happiness is to be found by acquiring as many possessions and luxuries as we can but this is to make possessions into a false god instead of bringing life they bring death
841247 the deathly retail silence contrasts with optimistic predictions of a bumper week of trade by the state government and the local chambers of commerce a jewellery shop reported one sale in the week a cross new south wales business chamber chief executive kevin macdonald had predicted a 231 million boost for business or 1155 per expected visitor but traders reported pilgrims unwilling to spend even haggling over the price of one banana clothing store john serafino said the popes visit was a disaster
841248 i ek claims that the universe originated in some disruption that interrupted the harmonious balance of the abyss of pure potentiality which is to say that existence itself emerged out of a fundamental imbalance to understand humanity properly then one must not follow the typical procedure of reducing all human behaviour to some natural explanation instead one must throw out the customary idea of nature as internally consistent and harmonious
841249 the key question in i eks context is within what ontology are we ethically playing for keeps
841250 just as kierkegaards god must be understood as the lack of an overarching guarantee of lifes meaningfulness so also the properly theological level is that which exposes the human subject as self legislating with no master meaning that for i ek theology properly understood refers to the most radical atheism
841251 tak ing the risk of an authentic i ekian ethical act in the sense of a self directed choice for the worst by abandoning the shell of its institutional organization
841252 the double glory or paradox versus dialectics on not quite agreeing with slavoj i ek
841253 a certain humourlessness could be said to dominate the entire christian tradition
841254 these atheist theologians get christianity right while those believers have perverted everything
841255 in any case kotsko argues that christianity can regain its subversive kernel only by
841256 kotsko argues that christianity can regain its subversive kernel only by tak ing the risk of an authentic i ekian ethical act
841257 the absolute christian vision of ontological peace provides the only alternative to a nihilistic outlook
841258 the only non nihilistic perspective and the only perspective able to uphold even finite reality
841259 the christian vision of ontological peace provides the only alternative to a nihilistic outlook
841260 the christian vision of ontological peace provides a helpful way of avoiding nihilism
841261 the fact that this is bad theology scarcely needs to be pointed out
841262 which i know z comes close to saying sometimes you think he wants us to side with judas but then he changes and tells us that that is precisely the perverse trap to be avoided
841263 the only way to be faithful to christianity is to betray it
841264 confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead and thou shalt be saved
841265 the politics of god is often not the same as the politics of the people of god i e america the real question is not
841266 our religious congregations are not meant to be social organizations that merely reflect the wider cultures values but dynamic countercultural communities whose purpose it is to reshape both lives and societies
841267 we bring faith into the public square when our moral convictions demand it but to influence a democratic society you must win the public debate about why the policies you advocate are better for the common good thats the democratic discipline religion has to be under my emphasis when it brings its faith to the public square religious people shouldnt be told just to be quiet they should be invited to participate as citizens in the democratic discourse on the most important values and directions that will shape our society
841268 turn from the idol america to serve the living and true god and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the dead that is jesus who delivers us from the coming wrath
841269 there is something fundamentally idolatrous about walliss theological discourse it is certainly no less idolatrous than the discourse of the religious right which wallis is very good at exposing
841270 by claiming the ultimate loyalty of its citizens the essentially religious character of the modern state is revealed
841271 speaking the word of truth to the nations for their judgment and healing
841272 he really hasnt said anything much about the church at all
841273 america does not have any real tradition of radical or prophetic left wing politics or theology
841274 martin im surprised that you almost always get the point despite the little systematic thelogy that youve done
841275 karl im surprised that you almost always get the point despite the great deal of systematic theology that youve done
841276 is not an armchair academic who takes ill advised and uncharitable potshots at others
841277 my problem with wallis is that he thinks he can trace gods work in the world without reference to the church and to the crucified christ his talk of the ethical and spiritual values of jesus and the prophets is simply inadequate
841278 how then do people get truly political they believe the gospel they are baptized into the body of christ they worship the triune god and they participate in the eucharistic life of the congregation
841279 the church is only herself when she is for the world
841280 i think wallis mistake and richard john neuhauss too et
841281 the future of politics must become a discourse about values which includes moral and religious ones we should talk less about the ideological categories of left and right and more about what kind of people we want to be what kind of community what kind of world
841282 most of the biblical prophets whom we pass over week after week in our congregations would offer a quite searing indictment of contemporary american society specifically that we have become a nation of endangered souls and that our society and politics are governed by values quite foreign to the heart of our religious traditions how does a nation of endangered souls recover an authentic faith that is true to the gospel the example of jesus the witness of the prophets and the crushing needs of our time
841283 recover an authentic faith that is true to the gospel
841284 when either party republicans or democrats tries to politicize god or co opt religious communities for their political agendas they make a terrible mistake
841285 the best contribution of religion is precisely not to be ideologically predictable nor loyally partisan both parties and the nation must let the prophetic voice of religion be heard faith must be free to challenge both right and left from a consistent moral ground
841286 the kind of talk we dont want to hear much these days in america but we need it
841287 the first subject of christian ethics is how to sustain the moral resources of american society
841288 the very notion that a christian theological understanding of political discourse would not be coterminous with our understanding of the church is to make quite a radical ecclesiological claim namely that the church can be described without reference to the political
841289 the church can be described without reference to the political
841290 is wallis giving us an understanding of political discourse or a description of the church
841291 if as you imply public political discourse about community the common good etc is one thing and ecclesiology another that seems to presuppose the very problem that harink and hauerwas are calling into question
841292 but you are a chosen race a royal priesthood a holy nation gods own people in order that you may proclaim the mighty acts of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light
841293 but all i read in gods politics is an updated version of reinhold niebuhrs realism
841294 wallis says x but x really implies y so wallis is saying y
841295 who or what really determines fashion the fashion to which man thinks he must subject clothes headgear and hairstyle the alternation of assurance and then of exposure first to the rather sympathetic astonishment and then to the horror and amusement of those who think they must follow the new fashion
841296 what we need is a critique of visual culture that is alert to the power of images for good and evil and that is capable of discriminating the variety and historical specificity of their uses
841297 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
841298 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
841299 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters know is who uses that language for what purpose
841300 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
841301 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
841302 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
841303 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
841304 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
841305 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
841306 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
841307 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
841308 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
841309 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
841310 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
841311 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
841312 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
841313 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
841314 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
841315 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
841316 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
841317 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
841318 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
841319 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
841320 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
841321 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
841322 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
841323 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
841324 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
841325 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
841326 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
841327 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
841328 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
841329 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
841330 scripture and reason the wisdom and folly of the cross
841331 through unflinching accounts of the eight years he spent in the soviet gulag solzhenitsyns novels and non fiction works exposed the secret history of the vast prison system that enslaved millions
841332 you spoke earlier of two gay men who acknowledged that same sex relations were part of the tragic aspect of human sexuality and not what god intended they accepted the biblical teaching on this point but nonetheless desired fellowship as christians with other christians on this basis they were accepted into the church but i do not feel that a same sex relation such as i experience with my partner is contrary to biblical teaching our relationship is not promiscuous and we are as faithful and fully committed to each other as any heterosexual married couple i do not see our situation as tragic does this disqualify me from being a member of your church
841333 i understand if i had only experienced my sexuality as oriented toward the same sex and if i had felt the same rejection and even hostility directed toward you by society and even the church i would feel the same way but the two men we are talking about were welcomed into the body of christ not because their view of the teaching of scripture conformed to ours but simply as persons who confessed christ as lord and savior the kingdom of god places no conditions upon humans in the invitation to enter children enter the kingdom without knowledge of the tragic according to jesus matt 18 2 3 let me turn your question around it is not whether or not your sexual orientation and practice disqualifies you from belonging to the body of christ but are you willing to enter the kingdom of god based solely upon the grace of christ who has already reconciled you to god 2 cor 5 19
841334 suppose i am willing and become a member of your church on that basis how do you think i will feel when i am confronted with the biblical teaching that my sexual partner and i are living in sin to go back to the quotation you used from the newspaper
841335 i understand that each one of us is confronted by the fact that when the bible calls us to love our enemies give to whomever asks of us set aside filial responsibility for the sake of the kingdom of god take up our cross and follow christ we enter the realm of the tragic the demands of the kingdom of god are not hostile to our humanity but call us to what it is to be truly human we seek a truth beyond our own we are searching for the teaching that calls us out of our sin and places our lives under the promise of redemption
841336 so then you do say that homosexuality is a sin
841337 each of us must discover for ourselves what it means to be a sinner and we cannot discover that nor find redemption from sin apart from a relationship with god that is the irony of the kingdom of god the same grace that welcomes us into the kingdom as though we were children places us under the rule of grace that is it exposes what is lacking in our humanity and brings us more and more into conformity with the humanity of christ that is the ministry of the body of christ to one another
841338 will your church recognize and affirm my ministry to the body suppose that i feel a calling to be ordained to pastoral ministry will my sexual orientation and practice disqualify me
841339 it is not our responsibility to decide who receives the gift of ministry within the body of christ the apostle paul wrote that a spiritual gift is given to each of us so that we can help each other he then added it is the one and only spirit who distributes all these gifts he alone decides which gift each person should have 1 cor 12 7 11 there is no one qualified by their own life to receive the gift of the spirit for ministry and there is no one disqualified
841340 but i asked about ordination if that is true does this mean that if i become a member of your church i could be a candidate for ordination
841341 ordination as we commonly speak of it today was not known by the early church even though they later began to set apart bishops and elders for the sake of doctrinal continuity and pastoral oversight actually each person baptized into christ is baptized into his ministry and this can be understood as the basis for what we call ordination we assume that those set apart by the church for full time ministry through ordination have the gift of the spirit in one sense ordination can simply be understood as the way each church denomination sets apart some within the body of christ ordinarily a full time vocation to teach lead and minister to the body in accordance with the authority of scripture while only members are qualified to be set apart through ordination being a member does not in itself qualify one for this office there are other requirements
841342 thats what i was afraid of if every member who is baptized into christ is called into the ministry of christ and if every member has the gift of the spirit for ministry what are these other requirements
841343 it is kind of like the saying if its everyones responsibility to do the work it often ends up with no one doing it because the church is a manifestation of the kingdom of god through a human institution it suffers from the limitations and weakness of all human organizations the church in its teaching and ministry based on the authority of scripture brings kingdom truths to bear through an institution that is fallible provisional and often failing to live by the very truths it proclaims thus the relation between the church and the kingdom is also tragic in recognition of this the church established a polity and structure by which certain members could be set apart as those most responsible to hold the body of christ accountable to the kingdom truths as revealed in scripture those who are ordained to this office are really servants of the body of christ not superior to it
841344 you still have not told me what some of these other requirements are
841345 let me try for example because we hold that scripture teaches that sexual cohabitation outside of marriage is not what god intended a member of the body who is living with someone not their husband or wife would not be qualified to be ordained in the same way a member of the body who is known to be abusive to other family members including children would not be qualified those who are set apart for the office of teaching and leading others in the body are expected not only to uphold by conviction the truths of scripture that are taught but to demonstrate maturity and responsibility in their own lives and relationships with others they must be committed to the mystery of the faith now revealed and must live with a clear conscience the apostle paul wrote 1 tim 3 9 do not ordain anyone hastily cautioned paul 1 tim 5 22 while the church must embrace the tragic in its ministry of the kingdom of god excluding no one who has experienced the grace of salvation in christ those set apart for ordination must be able by knowledge and conviction to uphold and teach kingdom truth and to hold the body of christ in conformity to it apart from commitment to celibacy our church holds that a member of the body whose lifestyle is homosexual would not be qualified
841346 that is very interesting in a recent newspaper article there was a report of the general assembly of your denomination voting to remove the restriction upon the ordination of homosexuals do i assume that your church will follow this ruling
841347 didnt i say that the relation between the church and the kingdom of god is tragic well this may be one instance of that we feel that our position regarding ordination is biblical and in accordance with kingdom truth under biblical authority the denomination cannot force us to change our belief and practice at the same time we bear the name brand of the national church body and will be in the awkward position of not being able to support a denominational policy while at the same time holding fast to our view of what the bible teaches while there are a variety of views regarding biblical authority and what the bible teaches within the denomination regarding many issues relating to social personal and sexual ethics there is a steadfast commitment to the apostolic faith as represented in the ancient creeds we hold denominational leaders accountable to the confession of faith rooted in these creeds if they fail at this point then it becomes a matter of kingdom truth rather than merely unbiblical practice is this not part of our own protestant tradition the denomination is our spiritual home it connects us to each other though often with pain and to those who went before us in the faith it is our family and to leave would make us orphans
841348 i didnt realize that belonging to a church is so complicated i am tempted to find one that conforms more to my own belief and lifestyle but i have read enough of the bible to know that jesus was always on the side of kingdom truth that seemed to be what attracted people to him and i must confess im not sure i want a church that looks just like me one more question i have a friend who does belong to your denomination and is considering being ordained she was quite dismayed at the recent ruling by the general assembly as she feels that the ordination of homosexuals is not based on biblical truth and questions whether or not she should go ahead with ordination what would you say to her
841349 how does the idea of matthew 18 15 17 fit into your thinking
841350 the same grace that welcomes us into the kingdom as though we were children places us under the rule of grace that is it exposes what is lacking in our humanity and brings us more and more into conformity with the humanity of christ that is the ministry of the body of christ to one another
841351 could anything be more obvious than to conclude from this clear indication that the image and likeness of the being created by god signifies existence in confrontation i e in this confrontation in the juxtaposition and conjunction of man and man which is that of male and female and then go on to ask against this background in what the original and prototype of the divine existence of the creator consists
841352 we ought to live and act in conformity to who we are
841353 this is what anderson means by the word tragic i understand what he means but do not agree with it for the following reasons
841354 choose your rut carefully because youll be in it for a long time
841355 when god in jesus christ claims space in the world even space in a stable because there was no other place in the inn god embraces the whole reality of the world in this narrow space and reveals its ultimate foundation so also the church of jesus christ is the place ort that is the space raum in the world where the reign of jesus christ over the whole world is to be demonstrated and proclaimed this space of the church does not therefore exist just for itself but its existence is already always something that reaches far beyond it the space of the church is not there in order to fight with the world for a piece of its territory but precisely to testify to the world that it is still the world namely the world that is loved and reconciled by god it is not true that the church intends to or must spread its space out over the space of the world it desires no more space than its needs to serve the world with its witness to jesus christ and to the worlds reconciliation to god through jesus christ
841356 300 faded from the national conciousness here comes the miami hurricanes weight room group hug photo h t jc ridleys photo
841357 has acquired a deeper meaning in the order of salvation in which we live
841358 a wedding is only the regulative confirmation and legitimation of a marriage before and by society it does not constitute a marriage
841359 ought to be how much we want our sexual activity to communicate how much we want it to display a breadth of human possibility and a sense of the bodys capacity to heal and enlarge the life of other subjects
841360 that marriage is not only a matter of producing children but also of educating them to be obedient to jesus christ
841361 start with baseball and also teach them to read dont teach kids a bunch of rules help them submit their lives to something that they find to be a wonderful activity that transforms them
841362 the fundamental concern in all of them is to affirm marriage as a permanently binding commitment in which man and woman become one at the same time there are complex differences mark and luke categorically prohibit divorce but matthew and paul both entertain the necessity of exceptions to the rule situations in which pastoral discernment is required
841363 if one purpose of marriage is to serve as a sign of gods love in the world how can we reject the possibility that a second marriage after a divorce could serve as a sign of grace and redemption from the sin and brokenness of the past
841364 christians have far too readily underwritten the romantic assumption that people fall in love and then get married we would be much better advised to suggest that love does not create marriage rather marriage provides a good training ground to teach us what love involves
841365 is at once the most private and the most public of our institutions
841366 if sexual virtue and vice are defined covenantally rather than biologically then it is possible to place homosexual and heterosexual activity in the same context
841367 however the notion of indissolubility smuggles in a metaphysic quite alien to the bible divorce is not an ontological impossibility
841368 it is always sad to hear a couple say that their wedding day was the happiest day of their lives
841369 it is also possible to see same sex relationships blessed by the church as an analogue of the relationship between god and his people and a model
841370 i cant see that the new testament easily allows any straightforwardly positive evaluation of sexual intimacy outside a relationship that is publicly committed in marriage
841371 but it does not suggest that the essential test of christian orthodoxy lies in a willingness to treat all other relationships as incapable of sharing in the love of god
841372 a ceremony does not make a marriage consent makes a marriage
841373 i always wanted to have children but after getting married when i was 25 i discovered that my wife could not and would never be able to conceive a child yes adoption was one possibility but my dream of having a child of my own well never be realized
841374 when i was in my 20s i thought for sure that i would be married all of my friends found someone i never did i have lived all these years hoping for someone to love me in a special way it never happened
841375 i knew that i was homosexual from the time i was a teenager i tried to deny it but finally accepted it and though it is against what the bible teaches i have someone to love me and to live in a relationship that i could never have otherwise
841376 you have had several husbands and the man you are living with is not your husband
841377 but if i am casting out demons by the spirit of god then the kingdom of god has arrived among you
841378 living a life of goodness and peace and joy in the holy spirit
841379 it is of no benefit to the kingdom of god to call someone a sinner instead offer the grace of god so that they discover this for themselves
841380 when i was in my 20s i thought for sure that i would be married all of my friends found someone i never did i have lived all these years hoping for someone to love me in a special way it never happened
841381 if love is intrinsically tragic because it offers possibilities of fulfillment to human desire hopes and needs that can never be met in even the most perfect human relationship then sexuality itself is intrinsically tragic
841382 people have all sorts of unrealistic expectations about what having a relationship will do for them but thats not a tragedy its just a false belief accompanied by some frustration but surely the frustrations attendant on ones foolish beliefs dont count as tragedies do they
841383 for example it is patently tragic for a person to be created with a desire for the sublime which it is impossible short of the eschaton to fulfill
841384 when i eat the cannoli i realize that i could also have had cheesecake and i want cheesecake but my actual choice for cannoli precludes actualizing the choice for cheesecake ergo the structure of human hunger includes an infinite desire for objects incapable of fulfillment and is therefore tragic
841385 since robert w jenson could hardly be charged with closed minded conservatism or simply howling with the pack
841386 desertion in the face of the threatening other sort of human defection from the burden of co humanity
841387 then god said let us make human beings in our image to be like ourselves
841388 it is not good for the man to be alone
841389 you cant depend on your judgment when your imagination is out of focus
841390 the infinite grace of the triune god precedes all desire as its origin and upholds all true desire as its end
841391 but the kingdom while bringing redemption within the tragic did not promise redemption from the tragic until the end of this temporal order and the coming of the kingdom of god in glory
841392 how long can this absurd discussion go on some people are gay many gay people fall in love with other gay people and often set up housekeeping together
841393 but what is completely unquestionable in scripture is the assumption because it seems no argument is thought necessary that in the realm of human sexual relationships
841394 in the final analysis then i still read prof andersons position as essentially pagan and not christian
841395 come to the church homosexual person i dont want to condemn you for your sin but i want to help you were all sinners after all
841396 looking beyond without failing to see what is here before us
841397 looking at what is here before us without failing to look beyond
841398 it is of no benefit to the kingdom of god to call someone a sinner instead offer the grace of god so that they discover this for themselves
841399 the capacity to love is also the capacity to hurt
841400 isnt your only change that instead of calling it sin you call it tragic
841401 specifically what does an offer of grace look like in a context such as the context of the above comments where there are differing definitions of sin
841402 now that lambeth is almost over ive got to get back to the tardis
841403 ive been struggling to keep from frowning the whole week and now i think im stuck like this

841407 i think the problem stems from the lack of transparency around the subject clients dont want to feel they are paying for something they dont need seo experts dont want to feel under valued hopefully dialogue like this can find us all meeting in the middle somewhere

841419 you dont know when that tap will stop working so get as much out of it as you can
841420 no but this is the only way that we have found it possible to live and love while others may say that we have a choice for our part we feel that this relationship is the only one that fulfills our life and meets our needs
841421 had i had faith i would have remained with regina
841422 there will be no more death or sorrow or crying or pain
841423 marriage and family require time and energy that could be used to make the world better to take the time to love one person rather than many to have these children rather than helping the many in need requires patience and a sense of the tragic
841424 the tragic structure of finitude and the human capacity for deception and cruelty together account for the possibility and actuality of suffering and evil
841425 but to overcome the tragic structure of finitude to be free animate beings from all suffering to determine finite freedom so that it will always love the good and have the courage to pursue it these things are not possible the potential for suffering and evil lie in the tragic structure of finitude and cannot be overcome without destroying creation
841426 if a person is forced to choose between two sinful alternatives she bears lesser culpability or perhaps even none at all
841427 a tragic dilemma has to be a situation where you are forced to choose between two evils what are the evils here supposed to be and what is forcing the choice
841428 because the greeks didnt have a word for loving equitable homosexual relationships paul must be condemning pederasty not homosexuality in our sense
841429 that being said im uncomfortable with the idea of the tragic as prelapsarian
841430 the tragic as an ultimate irreducible form of the relation of the transcendent to the familiar
841431 if the christian vision had anything to contribute it might be not a consolatory word but a recognition that tragedy was inbuilt into a contingent world not even jesus choices could be unshadowed the triumph of the cross is the shipwreck of judas and the beginning of the pathologies of anti semitism donald would not allow you to evade the particular and his hostility to grand schemes that answered the problem of evil has much to do with this
841432 theologians must not embrace madkinnons suggestion that the crucifixion be read as a kind of tragic drama in the hope that tragedys concern for the irreconcilable contradictions of the particular might put theology on the guard against any metaphysical solace that would ease christian discomfort before the terror and desolation of the cross metaphysical solace is precisely what the tragic is it turns attention not toward the one who suffers but to the sublime backdrop against which the drama is played out it assures the spectator that this is how things are this is the constitution of the universe and that justice is strife tragic wisdom is the wisdom of resignation and consent a wisdom that is too prudent to rebel against what is fixed in the very fabric of being and that refuses to suffer inordinately enraged by death or resentful of civic order tragedy legitimates a particular regime of law violence and war it teaches that moira gk fate places and displaces us and so leads us to a serene and chastened acceptance of where we are placed and how we are displaced tragedy resists every motion outward beyond the sentineled frontier and reinforces the stable foundation of the totality christianity however feeds upon a different wisdom
841433 can be read as a protest against the essentialising of violence
841434 position that allows the past to speak to the realities of the present without determining it
841435 i think the tragic viewpoint is flawed because it is to narrow a view almost to conservative i think it should be balanced against god sovereinty to make it carry the weight of the homosexuality argument

841441 you do not have an ethical right to penalize websites that buy links

841446 test the move process by moving the contents of one directory or subdomain first then use a 301 redirect to permanently redirect those pages on your old site to your new site this tells google and other search engines that your site has permanently moved
841447 its best to make sure you retain control of your old site domain for at least 180 days
841448 you will not be able to get the new site indexed at all or it will be very poorly indexed theres no reason to index duplicate content
841449 my thinking is to speed up the whole process the engines need to know about the target pages before 301s are implemented
841450 hopefully googles technology will advance to the point of automatically determining when a domain has been moved then automatically giving all the benefits to the new site
841451 the key is to treat googlebot as you would a typical user from a similar location ip range etc i e dont treat googlebot as if it came from its own separate cloaking

841456 learning through films is actually very helpful because they reflect the society and you tend to understand the societal dynamics through movies

841498 the common law often requires legislation to correct it for example in recognizing the rights of women
841499 there is an underlying implication that challenging and destroying social and political institutions that threaten the cause of freedom is unacceptable in the name of their freedom
841500 bond offers a stunning insight in the 1990s the bush clinton arms embargo against moslems in the balkans got a lot of innocent moslem men women and children killed by the better armed serbs let me emphasize children killed the embargo created for america a lot more terrorist enemies

841516 apparently the best way to deal with a complaint is to act completely insane
841517 the primary function of emotion is to mobilize the organism to deal quickly with important interpersonal encounters prepared to do so by what types of activity have been adaptive in the past
841518 subserve patterns of motor behavior which were adaptive for each of these emotions preparing the organism for quite different actions
841519 may be better regarded as a cognitive state rather than an emotion
841520 emotional plots more specific more enduring than the basic emotions specific contexts in which a number but not all of the basic emotions can be expected to occur
841521 you get bored with something not when you have exhausted its repertoire of behavior but when you have mapped out the limits of the space that contains its behavior

841538 stiamo parlando di monarchie dove il capo del governo riveste una posizione costituzionale non dissimile da quella dei ministri
841539 istituisce una riserva di foro speciale sezione penale del tribunale supremo a garanzia del membro del governo posto in stato di accusa
841540 il premier e i membri del governo rispondono civilmente e penalmente alla magistratura ordinaria di ogni loro azione compiuta nellesercizio delle funzioni di governo

841547 some obama backers are right to worry that the relentless daily attacks on the candidate will take their toll on the campaign
841548 its time for the obama campaign to build a political firewall by using outside surrogates unaffiliated with the candidate to debunk these misleading attacks
841549 what we have learnt this week is that when the republican attack machine cranks up as hillary clinton predicted obama is actually pretty vulnerable
841550 obama will put his face on the 100 bill mccain w video
841551 in south milwaukee we call a guy like that a real

841554 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
841555 the message that needs to be communicated to these people is your problem is not global warming
841556 your problem is not global warming your problem is your nuts
841557 theyre going to the gore movie an inconvenient truth and being fed all this its ridiculous
841558 well look back on all of this in 10 or 15 years and realise how foolish it was
841559 the human impact on the atmosphere is simply too small to have a major effect on global temperatures
841560 it bothers me that my fellow scientists are not speaking out against something they know is wrong
841561 but they also know that theyd never get any grants if they spoke out i dont care about grants
841562 this is the fastest temperature change in the instrumental record and it puts us back to where we were in 1930
841563 human rights activists everywhere to condemn this violation of mr juarezs civil rights child rape is one of the basic civil rights guaranteed by the un civil rights commission
841564 the united states our future colony refuses to recognize that child rape is an important part of our superior mexican culture
841565 mr juarez is missing work at the factory farm of one of my big campaign contributors so i have asked president bush to pardon him so he can get back to work where he belongs he will be whipped for missing work while he was fooling around with that girl
841566 because we say so since we duke professors are smarter than anyone we know
841567 mr juarez is doing the kind of raping that americans wont do we have many 10 year old girls in the us but not enough skilled us rapists my proposed legislation will grant mr juarez full citizenship upon payment of a fine of 50 00 payable to the republican national congressional committee which desperately needs the money if mr juarez doesnt have enough money to pay the fine he should go rob someone
841568 if she had taken the ride in my car that i offered her she would not have been home to be raped by this future democrat voter we offer him sanctuary in massatwochits hic
841569 the girls family didnt buy carbon rights i bought from a chinese farmer who promised not to burn a million tons of coal this year so there was a cyclone which caused this rape
841570 conservatives say that we just need to focus on maintaining free markets and let everything sort itself out through the miracle of the invisible hand but the political tide is turning against unfettered free markets and toward greater regulation
841571 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
841572 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
841573 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
841574 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today
841575 big hurdle is fund raising even among a business community that is desperate to throw out mr mcgraw
841576 10 thinks you didnt know about west virginia gov joe manchin
841577 in my 31 years of social work i dont think ive seen a crime this heinous perpetrated against a social worker in the line of duty
841578 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
841579 they do not receive checkups or any of the common screenings during their pregnancy
841580 there is no way for us to all live together like a normal family
841581 so i live in bethlehem while my wife and two children live in jerusalem
841582 that was really tough because a guy like myself wants to be on the field at all times
841583 i just became more of a vocal leader that comes with maturity
841584 just always encouraging guys to do the extra work go the extra mile
841585 my roommate freshman linebacker andrew sweat he came in and he had two three suitcases full of stuff
841586 the last thing youre worrying about is what youre wearing in the morning
841587 you just want to get out of bed slip on some clothes and go on our way its like we live here and at the hotel
841588 ill tell you what i brought and this is what you need you need a flat screen tv and video game console a refrigerator lots of water
841589 water is a must and a pillow and a blanket
841590 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
841591 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
841592 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
841593 can you please tell me what the lottery numbers will be in the next drawing
841594 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance
841595 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
841596 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
841597 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
841598 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
841599 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
841600 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
841601 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
841602 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
841603 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
841604 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
841605 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
841606 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
841607 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
841608 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
841609 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
841610 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
841611 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
841612 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
841613 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
841614 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
841615 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
841616 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
841617 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
841618 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
841619 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
841620 i choose to reach across the aisle with john kerry to protect homeowners against foreclosure
841621 kerry advocates all kinds of additional socialism at home appeasement abroad and what that means is weakness for the future
841622 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
841623 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
841624 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
841625 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
841626 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
841627 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
841628 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
841629 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
841630 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
841631 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
841632 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
841633 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
841634 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
841635 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
841636 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
841637 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
841638 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
841639 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
841640 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
841641 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
841642 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
841643 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
841644 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
841645 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
841646 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
841647 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
841648 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
841649 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
841650 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
841651 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
841652 but i resent when you throw out stupid allegations that have no merit and really no purpose other than to inflame
841653 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father rom 8 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body rom 9 4 who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises gal 4 5 to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons eph 1 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will

841666 i would never fight in the armed forces with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels
841667 it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment
841668 you know i have been very clear in my denunciation of minister farrakhans anti semitic comments i think they are unacceptable and reprehensible i did not solicit this support he expressed pride in an african american who seems to be bringing the country together i obviously cant censor him but it is not support that i sought and were not doing anything i assure you formally or informally with minister farrakhan
841669 but if the word reject sen clinton feels is stronger than the word denounce then im happy to concede the point and i would reject and denounce
841670 if you lie with dogs you are going to get fleas
841671 he was a man take him for all in all i shall not look upon his like again
841672 bill ayres thought he and barry were friends and the wives were friendly too but they werent prepared for that big ol bus that runs right over you
841673 if we go into iran with the idea of reducing the co2 output of its leaders maybe the could get the dhimms to be on our side probably not
841674 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
841675 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
841676 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
841677 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
841678 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
841679 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
841680 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
841681 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
841682 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
841683 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
841684 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
841685 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
841686 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
841687 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
841688 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
841689 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
841690 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
841691 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
841692 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
841693 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
841694 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
841695 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
841696 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
841697 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
841698 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
841699 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
841700 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
841701 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
841702 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
841703 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
841704 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
841705 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
841706 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
841707 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
841708 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
841709 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
841710 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
841711 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
841712 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
841713 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
841714 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
841715 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
841716 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
841717 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
841718 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
841719 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
841720 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
841721 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
841722 we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
841723 some obama backers are right to worry the relentless daily attacks on the candidate will take their toll on the campaign
841724 these types of campaigns which the media often helps todrive as it analyses the effectiveness of the attacks before questioning the accuracy of theinformation will continue from now until election day on november 4
841725 and its time for the obama campaign to build a political firewall by using outside surrogates unaffiliated with the candidate to debunk these misleading attacks
841726 there is some evidence that the balance of enthusiasm has shifted and that young people who seemed to turn out and vote for senator obama in unusually high numbers in the primaries and caucuses are no longer so enthusiastic about him
841727 i think they are cynical and want to distract people from talking about the real issues
841728 im young im new to the national scene my name is barack obama im african american i was born in hawaii i spent time in indonesia
841729 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
841730 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
841731 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
841732 when you engage with reporters from 8 30 a m till 8 at night youre bound to make a gaffe
841733 people are yearning for the kind of president who takes tough questions and thats who john mccain is
841734 id encourage anyone who has concerns about john mccains age to join him on the campaign trail he keeps an exhausting schedule often visiting two or three states a day answering dozens of questions from voters and the media along the way
841735 the media is in love with barack obama if it wasnt so serious it would be funny
841736 gaffe after gaffe after gaffe come from john mccain and they are forgotten there is no way barack obama would be able to get away with something like this
841737 mccains mistakes raise a serious if uncomfortable question are the gaffes the result of his age and what could that mean in the oval office
841738 people wonder if mccain is kind of like a pitcher seven or eight years past his prime and misses a few here and there
841739 when youre about to turn 72 people are going to be watching to see if youre slipping
841740 far less was accomplished under this contract than originally planned
841741 millions of dollars in waste are likely associated with incomplete terminated and abandoned projects under this contract
841742 failure to complete some of the work was understandable because of its complex nature and unstable security environment
841743 it hasnt been completed yet for it to be handed over to us
841744 at this point the entire amount disbursed for this project may ultimately be wasted because the government of iraq currently has no plan for completing or using this facility
841745 iraq and our strategic position in the middle east in ruins risking a wider war in the near future
841746 amounted to a real time test for a future commander in chief
841747 america passed that test i believe my judgment passed that test and i believe senator obamas failed
841748 a pretty good timetable as we should have horizons for withdrawal but they have to be based on conditions on the ground
841749 the american people are looking for a serious debate about the way forward in iraq and afghanistan and angry false accusations will do nothing to accomplish that goal
841750 so far i think we have not seen the kind of political reconciliation thats going to bring about long term stability in iraq but theres no doubt that security has improved
841751 we did not want for this law to be a reason for tension or poisoning the political atmosphere but unfortunately this took place
841752 the vote is a useless act other than to delay and paralyze
841753 we have lost the chance to conduct the elections this year
841754 this is the first time to use a secret vote in an important law like this we believe its illegal
841755 the kurds understandably are not excited about being a minority the history here runs very very deep the last time they were a minority they suffered a great deal at the hands of some of the same people that would be taking office
841756 then we could only call then we were scared of the street
841757 im just happy because im between my family and relatives
841758 president bush has been working with the iraqis to encourage them to work out their differences and get the provincial elections law passed
841759 women were hurt as men started to run and flee inside police vehicles i saw flesh dead bodies and blood the protesters went crazy hitting nearby buildings with bullets shoes and rocks
841760 the explosion was huge stronger than the rockets we usually hear
841761 people were confused running in all directions many people were thrown on the ground
841762 we cant give any schedules or dates but the iraqi government sees the suitable date for withdrawal of the u s forces is by the end of 2010
841763 we dont think that talking about specific negotiating tactics or your negotiating position in the press is the best way to negotiate a deal
841764 senator barack obama is a candidate and we are talking to the administration which is in power
841765 it will not have any discussion about troop levels the next commander in chief is going to have to make those decisions
841766 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
841767 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
841768 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
841769 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
841770 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
841771 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
841772 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
841773 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
841774 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
841775 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
841776 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
841777 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
841778 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
841779 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
841780 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
841781 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
841782 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
841783 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
841784 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
841785 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal
841786 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
841787 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
841788 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
841789 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
841790 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
841791 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
841792 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
841793 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate
841794 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record
841795 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
841796 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
841797 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
841798 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
841799 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
841800 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
841801 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
841802 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
841803 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
841804 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
841805 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
841806 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
841807 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
841808 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
841809 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
841810 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
841811 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
841812 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
841813 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
841814 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
841815 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
841816 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
841817 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
841818 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
841819 you dont see where all the carbon goes so there is a misconception that woody species such as trees and shrubs store more carbon thats just not the case
841820 a political promise to do something 40 years from now
841821 because everyone knows thats meaningless ten years is about the maximum time that we as a nation can hold a steady aim and hit the target
841822 are the very same measures needed to renew our economy
841823 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
841824 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
841825 in one month than an average american family uses in an entire year
841826 burned through enough electricity to power 232 average american households for a month
841827 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
841828 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
841829 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
841830 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
841831 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
841832 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
841833 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
841834 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
841835 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
841836 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
841837 the way to bring gas prices down is to end our dependence on oil and use the renewable sources that can give us the equivalent of 1 a gallon gasoline
841838 will attend a weekend meeting with irans chief nuclear negotiator the meeting is part of ongoing efforts to persuade iran to stop its nuclear program
841839 abba and pierce brosnan thats the best movie i have seen in a long time
841840 gore new yorker cover way too far over the top
841841 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
841842 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
841843 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
841844 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
841845 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
841846 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
841847 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
841848 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
841849 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
841850 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
841851 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
841852 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
841853 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
841854 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
841855 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
841856 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
841857 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
841858 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
841859 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
841860 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
841861 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
841862 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
841863 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
841864 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
841865 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
841866 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
841867 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
841868 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
841869 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
841870 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
841871 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
841872 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
841873 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
841874 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
841875 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
841876 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
841877 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
841878 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
841879 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
841880 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
841881 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
841882 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
841883 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
841884 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
841885 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
841886 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
841887 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
841888 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
841889 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
841890 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
841891 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
841892 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
841893 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
841894 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
841895 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
841896 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
841897 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
841898 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
841899 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
841900 the defeat was due to mismanagement by the speaker and his deputies and then the sudden sharp rejection by the kurds
841901 i think everyone now expects that elections will be delayed until next year
841902 we cannot simply pull off fair and transparent elections in a day and a night
841903 laid the groundwork for a new philosophy for iraqis respect of human rights rights of suspects to a fair trial whoever they are and regardless of the cruelty or viciousness of their crimes
841904 no matter how high someones position is and how much power he has at his command one of these days he will be held accountable
841905 we do believe al qaida is doing some measure of re assessment regarding the continued viability of its fight in iraq and whether iraq should remain the focus of its efforts
841906 its not known yet whether he would come back or not
841907 the rumors now are saying that he escaped and this is not true he just traveled
841908 he will come back to iraq anytime he wants like he has done before
841909 but they report that there now appears to be a degree of durability to the gains we have made
841910 things look so much better than a few weeks ago that i think we are near to reaching agreement
841911 i dont think it will take months were looking at more like days or weeks
841912 i believe that the best way to support iraqi sovereignty and to encourage the iraqis to stand up is through the responsible redeployment of our combat brigades
841913 its unrealistic to expect that a u s president alone can suddenly snap his fingers about bringing about peace in this region
841914 the notion is is that either i do exactly what my military commanders tell me to do or im ignoring their advice
841915 no im factoring in their advice but placing it in this broader strategic framework thats required
841916 i will leave it to the voters to make that decision
841917 by continuing his opposition to the surge strategy long after it has proven successful and by admitting that his plan for withdrawal places him at odds with general david petraeus barack obama has made clear that his goal remains unconditional withdrawal rather than securing the victory our troops have earned and the surge has made possible
841918 hes mad at your son for making his kitty go away
841919 yeah because you need something that large what with all the babies youre going to have
841920 well i know this whole fairy tale she has about having a surrogate is just a pipe dream and is never going to happen its ridiculous but i listen when she talks about it because thats the nice thing to do
841921 actually it is you know shes talking to someone now and while it might not be her and it might not be right away it almost definitely is going to happen
841922 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
841923 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
841924 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
841925 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
841926 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
841927 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
841928 bhatt is a postgraduate in computer sciences and a software expert this helped him set up and run a respectable business here
841929 you know its not about you its about your country
841930 if al gore is upset about carbon we must need more of it
841931 my bet would be on policy decision as usual however
841932 even my other son is no more he was so cheerful after he recovered at a hospital he became silent he didnt talk to anyone he is always lost
841933 when we got the forensic evidence there was nothing nothing there were no fingerprints and little else we got no lead from the site we do not use scientific evidence in india to fight terrorism
841934 it was a high pressure situation for us the bomb was timed to go off after 25 minutes of the railway station blast we had only a few minutes left
841935 in the meantime completely disconnected to all this two boys who had received training in balochistan pakistan had been arrested they were being tracked for months after our inputs
841936 they mentioned a man who they said had carried out the varanasi blasts
841937 if we had a beat constable system he would have noticed three strangers at the seminary and inquired
841938 the beat drill failed and the ayodhya attack happened then waliullah was charged but the absence of pota prevention of terrorism act made it easy for him to get bail
841939 when he got bail he went to bangladesh and set up a network to send indian youth to help carry out bombings with training in pakistan
841940 shall i tell you things out of thin air ask the varanasi police
841941 i lost my son to a tragedy i didnt want to waste his death at least those two can see through his eyes
841942 there are too many questions i shall get into trouble if i talk about them
841943 every time there is a blast the entire machinery swings into action but in mumbai everything gets back to its old self after a fortnight
841944 collecting dna samples is practically not feasible in a place like mumbai and especially when such an incident happens on a crowded suburban train
841945 the problem was how do you link them to the mumbai blasts
841946 i do think theres an opportunity for us to shine a light on some of those questions
841947 i think youll see that we will answer the call
841948 when theres news we will deal with the issues as they come
841949 we arent going to go there as the guests of the chinese government and deliberately poke sharp sticks in their eyes
841950 were not going to go out of our way to do it but we think there are going to be a lot of opportunities to bring the subject up based on the events of the day
841951 we are iraqis and you shouldnt say such a thing
841952 during a drenching rain wednesday night the contest broke up into smaller groups and one woman wound up dancing naked on a bar top
841953 prior to this study the gravity tractor deflection technique had been proven in only a conceptual way
841954 we know they have been interested in having a relationship with our company for some time
841955 we will of course be looking forward to how this will evolve
841956 i remember the next morning my friend looked in her wallet and said oh apparently i spent 165 buying three rounds of shots for everybody
841957 one has to play according ot needs of the team not according ot his whims and fancies i would prefer a player who atleast is consistent even though he doesnt score triple hundren rather than this guy who blasts his way to triple hundred and then for the next few innings is useless identify one player in any international team who has such an attitude
841958 its the hardest decision ive ever had to make but also the easiest
841959 i put my heart and soul into the job but if i kept on going my career could have come to an abrupt end i think this decision will prolong my career
841960 i thought it might be time to go in new zealand where my body was working well but my mind was not working well i will always cherish the support ive had but this is a weight off my shoulders
841961 i had every ambition to lead the england team to the next ashes series but as england captain i feel ive run out of steam
841962 i believe that the best thing for the team is to embark on a new direction under a new captain
841963 i also believe the best thing for me is to try and get back to being best batsmen i can be ill still have all the experience and knowledge to pass on and i hope to be a valuable player for both my county and the england team
841964 id like to take this opportunity to thank all the fans who have always been so supportive and have provided a huge inspiration to me as captain a captain is only as good as his teams and ive been fortunate enough to captain some terrific players and great blokes
841965 hes led from the front and always led with integrity and honesty hes been the best possible ambassador for the england cricket team
841966 ive made the decision to step down as englands one day captain as i want to give myself the best chance to perform for england and enjoy my cricket
841967 whilst i am humbled to have been given the opportunity to captain englands one day side i feel the captaincy diminished my ability to perform for england across all forms of the game i feel the england captaincy impacted on my ability to enjoy my cricket and contribute to the team
841968 ive always enjoyed representing my country at the highest level
841969 and it has always been my ambition to play cricket across all forms of the game but ive found the extra workload of the captaincy to be very difficult
841970 the last thing i want is for the captaincy to impact my performance and that of the teams which is why ive arrived at this decision after a huge amount of consideration i will continue to make myself available to england for all forms of cricket and look forward to playing a significant role in englands future success
841971 paul feels this is the best decision in terms of benefiting the england team and his contribution to the team across all forms of the game vaughn is a classy guy
841972 but you can put it on the agenda and try to move the country
841973 a 90 percent chance that the us has contributed 2 degrees f of temperature increase in the last 50 years

841975 and the quickest and easiest way to back out the coal which is the worst of the problem and oil is to look at electricity generation

841980 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
841981 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
841982 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
841983 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test

841985 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
841986 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
841987 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
841988 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living

841994 103 were submitted for the prize and nine were called in by the judges

841996 gee i guess we ought to drive a bit less
841997 we need more onramps and parking lots and big box stores to fuel our auto centric lifestyle and bring in more tax revenue
841998 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
841999 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
842000 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
842001 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous

842159 thats an interesting hilt on your sword who designed it
842160 i created this sword but my master helped me figure out a design for it it matches the style i use though i have no name for this blade
842161 a sword with no name do you have a death wish going into battle with a nameless blade is asking for trouble
842162 pulling a weapon with us around is dangerous remember that
842163 a javelin interesting weapon modification too it could give coatl a run for its money
842164 master ang told me that folk tale i know that my blade has a name i just dont know it i want my blade to tell me its name instead of me making one up
842165 hellia tri key and coatl are all good names but i want to know this souls name from the soul itself until the day i find the name this blade is nameless i dont care about superstition like dying in battle because of a nameless weapon

842169 i heard all of what you said kurt san are you really cousin
842170 why dont you name that sword just change the name when you do learn its name
842171 brother is just touchy about names you see when i was younger mother and father always called me little one and then when they called me trent for the first time he was confused he knows that names have power so he wants to know the true name of his blade
842172 why does he wait for a name though bestowing a name is power itself so why wait
842173 there was a rumor around the village before it was destroyed that brother used a rare metal found in the mountain wall that guarded our village that metal is called shinki named after the two who originally found it first shinji akamaru and kisuke akamaru
842174 yeah that was the villages name which means that our names are ben akamaru and trent akamaru shinji and kisuke were members of villages early history the fact is trent and i are descended from kisuke the older brother and it could be coincidence or destiny but i study the same style that kisuke invented and trent is the same with shinji

842476 investments in public transportation have the benefit of supporting higher density land uses that allow for fewer vehicle miles of travel the results range from a reduction in vmt of between 1 4 miles and 9 miles for every transit passenger mile traveled the outcome would be more efficient use of roadways reduced road maintenance shorter highway commute times and reduced need for street and off street parking

842539 the line outside of varsity theatre wrapped around the block saturday night but those waiting werent there for a movie they were waiting for ralph nader
842540 this act is a clear evidence that the iraqi state seeks to liquidate trade unions in this important iraqi economic sector it is important to note that the south is the main source of oil in iraq
842541 we told hussain al shahristani the iraqi oil minister that this was not acceptable and informed him that we were aware of the measures being taken by the oil ministry

842552 the conservatism that speaks to us through its actions in washington is institutionally opposed to those baseline good intentions we learned about in elementary school its leaders laugh off the idea of the public interest as airy fairy nonsense they caution against bringing top notch talent into government service they declare war on public workers they have made a cult of outsourcing and privatizing they have wrecked established federal operations because they disagree with them and they have deliberately piled up an everest of debt in order to force the government into crisis the ruination they have wrought has been thorough it has been a professional job repairing it will require years of political action
842553 we are a free and sovereign people we govern ourselves and the government is ours but that is the point we are responsible not our leaders since we follow them we let them divert our loyalty from the united states to some party we let them boss the party and turn our municipal democracies into autocracies and our republican nation into a plutocracy we cheat our government and we let our leaders loot it and we let them wheedle and bribe our sovereignty from us

842599 dear god the only thing i ask of you is to hold her when im not around when im much too far away
842600 we are the only country trying not to tell the truth about ufos
842601 thats the last thing i remember until the next day
842602 i told him what happened last night thats what happens when a ufos around
842603 now i wonder if the others saw and didnt tell
842604 if they took me and checked me out they probably threw me back because i had a complete hysterectomy and im no good to them
842605 i dont think they want to hurt us i think they want to save us from destroying our planet
842606 the et was standing upright in the space shuttle payload bay having a discussion with two tethered us nasa astronauts
842607 i asked my brother about this recently and he said he remembered it as well he is four years older than i am i remembered the community and my brother remembered the exact spot it had happened
842608 an old man was crossing the road in front of the vehicle in front of ours
842609 my parents brother and i were driving down the road and an old man started slowly walking across the road
842610 they just kept on driving while the man kept slowly walking further out into the road
842611 the vehicle narrowly missed the man and he didnt flinch one bit
842612 the hairs are the most positive evidence yet that a yeti might possibly exist because they are tangible we are very excited about the preliminary results although more tests need to be done
842613 we fully expected them to come from a known animal
842614 we failed to find that so the mystery remains and we go on to the next stage of investigation
842615 so there is every chance that we will be able to get even closer to the truth
842616 it could easily be an unknown primate even if it is not a yeti
842617 with a mccain avatar that whether it was a mccain avatar or someones member both were dicks
842618 you are way too cool to do that stupid dance move
842619 dude you are so not sexy and you walk like a fucking man in those six inch stilettos
842620 ive been doing this search and rescue for 14 years fossett should have been found
842621 its not like we didnt have our eyes open we found six other planes while we were looking for him were pretty good at what we do
842622 what ive strived to find out is what happened to this man in the run up to his disappearance why did he disappear
842623 i spoke to reporters who were on the scene people who were helping out with the search efforts anyone whom i thought could shed some light on this
842624 i discovered that there is absolutely no proof that steve fossett is actually dead im not a conspiracy theorist im a man who deals in facts and i dont really care if he is alive or dead it make no difference to me
842625 much derided as a group of upstart technophiles of little work ethic and even less loyalty gen yers arent exactly a perfect fit for big brown in fact its hard to imagine a worse match
842626 but if theres one group that isnt down to be engineered its generation y people who cant even be bothered to use punctuation let alone memorize anything
842627 thanks for taking the time to work with someone like me
842628 father if you are willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done
842629 lord show us the way i am the way and the truth and the life
842630 be for every christian a renewed experience of gods love given to us in christ a love that each day we in turn must
842631 at a time when the anglican communion is calling for a listening process on the issue of homosexuality how does it make sense to exclude gay and lesbian people from the discussion
842632 i have to reserve the right to withhold or withdraw invitations from bishops whose appointment actions or manner of life have caused exceptionally serious division or scandal within the communion
842633 we dont like that well have a tea party well fight you
842634 we curse the spirit that would come to bring about same sex marriage we ask you to just look over this place today cause them to be shaken in their very heart in uprightness lord to do what is right before you
842635 the holy spirit took over and i had to pray what he said
842636 you were being nice and tiptoeing and all of a sudden boom
842637 then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free
842638 life is an unanswered question but lets still believe in the dignity and importance of the question
842639 since jesus said i am the way the truth and the life and no man cometh to the father but by me doesnt that mean people from other religions jews and the rest are going to hell
842640 im sure glad that god is the judge of peoples hearts and not me and i trust god to decide those questions justly and mercifully
842641 well god doesnt really ask my advice on those matters
842642 the majority of more than 30 years of social science evidence indicates that children do best on every measure of well being when raised by their married mother and father
842643 the apa supports the protection of parent child relationships through the legalization of joint adoptions and second parent adoptions of children being reared by same sex couples
842644 although most people own a bible and know some of its content
842645 our research found that most professed evangelicals have little idea how to integrate core biblical principles to form a unified and meaningful response to the challenges and opportunities of life
842646 if we capture and embrace more of gods worldview and trust it with unwavering faith
842647 then we begin to form the appropriate responses to questions on abortion same sex marriage cloning stem cell research and even media choices
842648 i feel a lot of sympathy for ted having been a pastor you live in a fishbowl anyway it must be very painful for ted and his family
842649 compassion for haggard and accountability for the national association of evangelicals
842650 teaching units what they needed to know before they went over to a combat area we pretty much put them through a month long simulation of combat
842651 it was more of like there wasnt a lot of action it was more of its hard to explain down there action over there is like getting ied or maybe getting shot at a few times or a car bomb goes off its not exactly what youre expecting its more like hunting season youre the deer
842652 in my case i had lost a lot while i was over there and it just started the more you lose and the less they do for you the more you start to see how jacked up things really are
842653 and theres plenty they could do and they just they did nothing i lost a lot of money i lost my family while i was there you know pretty much and when i get back id lost so much it was like i needed to start over
842654 man i got to have a reset i got to find a way to get myself out of this and start over start my life over you know i have nothing to work with
842655 in other iraq news the british government has announced there will be no prosecutions over the death of journalist terry lloyd despite an investigation that blamed us troops terry lloyd was shot dead in iraq in march 2003 along with a french cameraman and an iraqi interpreter two years ago a british coroner ruled that us troops should be prosecuted for the unlawful killing of lloyd who was a well known foreign correspondent for the british television network itn the coroner ruled that lloyd was shot in the back by iraqi soldiers then as he was being driven to a hospital in a civilian minivan lloyd was shot in the head by us troops
842656 coroner andrew walker concluded just under two years ago that terry lloyd was unlawfully killed by american troops and itn has done everything it could to try and ensure terrys killer is brought to justice we are disappointed that the cps has decided they cannot take this matter further and that despite the coroners call on the attorney general and the director of public prosecutions to demand that the americans bring the perpretator of a possible war crime before a british court of law the us authorities remain unco operative

842670 but before we get into logistics i dont often get calls from 16 year olds can you tell me how you know about ralph
842671 two years ago mr nader came to my high school
842672 i helped organize that there was a standing room only crowd what did you think of ralphs speech
842673 i was a freshman and i was in world history class and my class didnt go i guess they thought that ralph didnt fit with world history
842674 yeah but ive been interested in mr nader since then reading about him and i want to help him
842675 today was truly amazing no more than a few days ago i felt an overwhelming feeling of worthlessness i felt that there was nothing that i could do due to my age and transportation issue then we talked and i went out and did something i truly felt like i was a part of something that i was making history i could have volunteered for many other political campaigns but it was the nader gonzalez campaign that truly inspired me i can openly support every policy of the campaign and sleep at night this is a campaign that puts national interest before personal interest we the people not for sale gives me chills it is truly amazing to see an entire organization of everyday people working towards one beautiful common goal and putting power back into the hands of the people

842678 my own view is that we have been wrong in taking communication as secondary many people seem to assume as a matter of course that there is first reality and then second communication about it we degrade art and learning by supposing that they are always second hand activities that there is life and then afterwards there are these accounts of it our commonest political error is the assumption that power the capacity to govern other men is the reality of the whole social process our commonest economic error is the assumption that production and trade are our only practical activities and that they require no other human justification or scrutiny we need to say what many of us know in experience that the life of man and the business of society cannot be confined to these ends that the struggle to learn to describe to understand to educate is a central and necessary part of our humanity this struggle is not begun at second hand after reality has occurred it is in itself a major way in which reality is continually formed and changed what we call society is not only a network of political and economic arrangements but also a process of learning and communication

842687 theres an interesting report from research firm wtrs on how mobile device users are getting more frustrated angrier and disenchanted with mobile technology thanks to clunky user interfaces and stalled functionality features the report says users want plug and play features easy to use applications and better service stability just like in any industry the winning product and tool makers will be those who listen to customer feedback and bring about technologies that meet the needs and solve the problems facing wireless users today
842688 overall the predominant wireless sensor markets that will develop over the next year include home automation commercial control and industrial automation applications
842689 on top of all that a very clean gmail like interface that makes it so easy to understand and work with i always thought it is smart to build applications based on email platform look definitely giving the feeling you already know what to do before you actually do it
842690 both the labor and liberal parties are running big media campaigns using donations from property developers and refusing to disclose to voters in advance of the election where the money comes from
842691 its more important than ever that voters have a chance to question the major mayoral candidates in person unplugged from all that expensive media hype
842692 i say to mr greg rowell good on you for doing the right thing and organising the debate
842693 the best guide to future action is past action and the greens have logged the disastrous record of labor and liberal on public transport issues and produced the shame file it is hard to pick out the most nonsensical things the major parties have done as the shame list is so long
842694 council have stalled for more than 10 years on this issue and it is time for action
842695 people are sick of waiting they are supporting my proposal because theyve been waiting since 1997 for this terminal to be built
842696 it would also form a public transport hub by linking with the cross river ferry and bus services including the 199 buz that stop at the end of commercial road
842697 i am worried that labor and liberal are not prepared to use a small amount of public money to build essential public transport infrastructure to me it shows a real lack of commitment
842698 the quality of a transport system can be measured by how its treats its most vulnerable users
842699 and our system often neglects the needs of people in wheelchairs children and pedestrians
842700 please try to understand i have to see you have to feel you

842703 if people get to my age and they have the people love them that they want to have love them theyre successful it doesnt make any difference if theyve got a thousand dollars in the bank or a billion dollars in the bank success is really doing what you love and doing it well its as simple as that ive never met anyone doing that who doesnt feel like a success and ive met plenty of people who have not achieved that and whose lives are miserable

842726 if we want health reform to meet our needs weve got to speak up get involved and make sure we have a place at the table
842727 american solution that provides quality affordable health care for everyone
842728 a brand new action project called with the goal of persuading our elected leaders to provide quality and affordable health care for all
842729 a standard for health benefits that covers what people need to keep healthy and to be treated when they are ill
842730 provision of the full range of womens health and reproductive health services
842731 reproductive health care is not the only issue we address but it is an important feature of our vision of quality affordable health care for all
842732 we are placing reproductive health just where it should be as an integral part of primary and preventive health care for women
842733 americans know that the last people we can trust to fix the health care mess are insurance companies
842734 taking on a multi billion dollar industry means tv advertising and massive organizing well need serious money to take these guys on
842735 when women find out they can be denied health coverage because they are pregnant or because they had breast cancer they are just outraged
842736 women are being hurt badly by the high cost of health insurance many cant afford to buy health insurance any longer and even women who have insurance are going without the health care they need because insurance companies are finding more and more ways to shift costs to consumers
842737 getting health coverage for underserved women is definitely the first step toward eliminating disparities but it cant be the only step
842738 we know that even when people have the exact same health coverage such as medicare some of the people still get second class health care

842754 similarly many corporations in other asian countries have set their own targets to reduce the usage of energy
842755 this is our attempt at breaking the link between business economic growth and carbon emission
842756 in the long run we plan to introduce similar energy saving technologies in other tesco lotus stores throughout thailand
842757 growth dependent on fossil fuel is not going to be sustainable if companies want to survive in the long run they must look for options to move to other sources of energy at the same time companies must drastically cut down on their energy consumption
842758 this is only the beginning energy efficient technologies have a long way to go and private sector can take the leadership in promoting these

842761 ive been asked again and again for my response to the now infamous mccain celebrity ad
842762 i actually have three responses it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
842763 if you go back through the history of the national and olympic teams we have come up against top countries and people said weve got no chance
842764 but players like those of serbia and argentina have only two legs two arms and only one head and the balls round our attitude should be who cares who were playing we are never overawed by big names and thats our strength
842765 the good thing about these situations is that there are generally no major expectations going into such matches
842766 i remember those games against yugoslavia and argentina very well nobody gave us a chance but we went out there and won against yugoslavia charlie yankos even missed a late penalty which was very unusual for him
842767 brazil and nigeria were in our group too and everybody was saying the brazilians would win it with yugoslavia coming second and we were expected to just turn up and be the whipping boys
842768 that seems to be the scenario now with the olyroos but this can serve as a motivation to our players
842769 the conditions will favour us because as arnold says the team has had a long qualifying campaign through asia and will know what to expect
842770 i would not be surprised at all if we were to get something from each match
842771 in the match against argentina in sydney once we scored that first goal and got a sniff of victory we did not give a rats about who we were playing against
842772 the argentines threw everything at us and we knew we were in for a battle but we were so mentally tough that nothing was going to spoil out day
842773 in the olympics yugoslavia were among the favourites for gold but we left no stone unturned in our preparation
842774 we would do things like train at the st george stadium car park to get used to a bad surface we were expecting in gwangju
842775 our coach frank arok knew exactly how the yugoslavs would play and he told me exactly which part of the field i should play in and it worked so well i hardly left an impact on the match but i did my job
842776 technically they serbia and argentina should be a lot better than us but if you are organised as a team things can change very easily and very quickly
842777 and if all 11 players are focused and on the same wavelength you can achieve so much
842778 they know that when they play australia they have to be prepared to play 95 minutes
842779 we never give up you might score but you should never assume that the closer you get to the 90 minutes that you have won

842785 japanese food was created here and only japanese know it how can a bunch of foreigners show up and tell us what is good or bad
842786 as some new post superflat artists emerge in japan we take a look at the japanese contemporary art scene at the beginning of the 21st century
842787 the thematic premise behind the show has to do with the idea of the intimate moments in our daily lives that we miss by walking through our worlds and not seeing what is right in front of us it also has to do with the more infinite sense of being part of the larger universe and finding ourselves on the inside and looking out

842792 the north american churches believe that the truth was revealed to them and that the other churches in the communion need to follow them
842793 i think its really very dangerous when someone stands up and says i have the way and i have the truth and i know how to interpret holy scripture and you are following what is the right way
842794 i think its really very very dangerous and i think its demonic
842795 christs faithful have the right indeed at times the duty in keeping with their knowledge competence and position to manifest to the sacred pastors their views on matters which concern the good of the church they have the right also to make their views known to others of christs faithful but in doing so they must always respect the integrity of faith and morals show due reverence to the pastors and take into account both the common good and the dignity of individuals

842808 we do after all possess a vague empirical concept of christian mysticism the religious experiences of the saints all that they experienced of closeness to god of higher impulses of visions inspirations of the consciousness of being under the special and personal guidance of the holy spirit of ecstasies etc all this is comprised in our understanding of the word mysticism without our having to stop and ask what exactly it is that is of ultimate importance in all this and in what more precisely this proper element consists
842809 the difficulty in defining with precision just what it is we are reflecting on when we meditate on mysticism has more causes than one

843055 aries tend to be very organized and are therefore able to organize others with ease
843056 aries are full of nonstop energy when working on something they love they will continue to work tirelessly after all the others have gone home
843057 while they welcome challenges if they do not see results quickly enough they may quickly decide to move on aries are very good at starting things but often may leave tasks unfinished
843058 has anyone ever been tried at the hague in recent years and been found not guilty
843059 gbc which is my point it could be argued with a certain force that being indicted in itself prejudices the court against the defendent i personally prefer to think that isnt the case but in a sympathetic court hearing the extradition defence that could be seen as valid

843081 there are some things my tribe is not good at at all
843082 its impossible to create socialism in one country surrounded by a world capitalist market
843083 it is often argued that socialists simply want to share out the wealth this it is asserted would only mean increased misery for the rich as the wealth would not be enough to obliterate poverty but we are not interested in merely doing this
843084 of course it would be nice to take some of bill gates 36 billion 24 billion but in order for socialism to work it would be necessary to do much more than that

843106 the average biotech bull market has been good for 566 gains in under three years
843107 biotech giant genentech shot up as big pharmaceutical company roche offered to buy it out completely
843108 if 100 billion genentech can sell to a big pharma company then every biotech stock has to be in play right now
843109 assets in the fund absolutely collapsed bottoming earlier this year at around 60 million thats more than a 95 fall in assets
843110 biotechs are an exceptional bargain now when you size them up on simple traditional measures of biotech value like price to sales for instance
843111 if you catch just one biotech bull market youll never have to work again
843112 one simple way to buy into biotech is through the s amp p biotech etf xbi but no matter how you do it now is finally the time biotechs next big bull market should be starting right now
843113 i think that the most compelling stocks are dry bulk shippers
843114 the dry bulk shipping group had been under a fair amount of pressure after a meteoric rally that said rates would come on with a tiger woods like rebound after swooning at the start of the year
843115 i consider the dry bulk index the best barometer of the health of the global economy
843116 there is no doubt that at some point higher crude oil becomes the headwind everyone says it is but im still not sure that level has been reached yet
843117 on the global stage many nations are paying substantially more for gasoline than the u s and yet their economies continue to improve obviously on the one hand we would like crude oil to respond to a demand tipping point by way of americans saying no mas
843118 by the same token however it would also be encouraging to know see the economy getting better even in the face of this would be headwind
843119 i have to say that recent slide in dry bulk rates could be more technical rather than some sort of reaction to higher crude oil the long term trend is intact and todays action is compelling

843133 i think every fed official would be likely to conclude that inflation pressures would be in danger of rebounding if the economy started to come back

843192 with the rising tide of boomer retirees employers will be losing key talent at a time when attracting and retaining skilled workers will be more important than ever

843225 i think the fact dawkins in all his programs and interviews seem to emphasize to people and tell them that it is so obvious with the ludicrousness of religion and interviews people who believe in ghosts and so on and try to reason with them as to show the nonsensicalness
843226 another problem is the way dawkins is calling people towards atheism the fact that science is a logical way to approach things and it is but calling people towards atheism in such a manner can turn atheism into something more organized and having something more organized can lead to a complacency in thinking and fall into all the traps religion have fallen into but nnot as much worse the way dawkins has categorized atheism and what it is and the role of it he has made it seem as so if someone was to question science they would be shot down i think the scientific method should be open to criticism and people like dawkins should advocate rather than make it the absolute position in ones thinking
843227 the most obvious level is the modern disappearance of god as collective murder a little behind comes the collective murder of the pagan gods as the generative power behind their existence and way behind the most difficult level of all is the passion of jesus that cannot be the death of the christian god if the murders of the gods are always their birth but that could well be the death of all other gods in the banal sense we have in mind when we talk pf
843228 a process of imaginative conjectures and empirical refutations advancing the truthlikeness of theories about reality but necessarily in a state of finite knowledge and infinite ignorance
843229 1 the theory that physical matter is the only reality and that everything including thought feeling mind and will can be explained in terms of matter and physical phenomena
843230 by the standard of empirical causality in science thats the best scientific explanation and has the most real meaning
843231 the thesis that religious experiences are merely a hijacked response to concrete situations which stimulate natural cognitive processes is empirically testable and has real meaning whether or not its completely true is certainly debatable
843232 as most of those who founded modern science and philosophy were christians
843233 would have to conclude that there was some sort of designer personally guiding the process
843234 whenever a theory appears to you as the only possible one take this as a sign that you have neither understood the theory nor the problem which it was intended to solve
843235 a process of imaginative conjectures and empirical refutations advancing the truthlikeness of theories about reality but necessarily in a state of finite knowledge and infinite ignorance
843236 in order to recognize an explanation as the best one neednt be able to explain the explanation in fact so requiring would lead to an infinite regress of explanations so that nothing could ever be explained and science would be destroyed so in the case at hand in order to recognize that intelligent design is the best explanation of the appearance of design in the universe one neednt be able to explain the designer
843237 they had some gaps there and i just took advantage of them the ball found me and i was able to make them pay
843238 in that kind of situation where the game is kind of seesawing back and forth we have so many weapons it could be lebron it could be d wade one of us is going to kick into high gear
843239 its great to be so far from staples center and still have so much support i feel like im home
843240 russia did a good job of slowing us down a little bit but we still made our run at the end of the third quarter
843241 if you take a look in past games the american team most points they score is fast breaks and its dunks i think for the most part we contained the ball
843242 for the most part i think we did a pretty good job to stop them
843243 russia is a team we could see in the gold medal game and a team thats been playing very well of late so it was good competition they made us run some sets slow us down a little bit but i think overall we played good defense
843244 just did a great job of being aggressive so he played well
843245 it didnt seem like there was any doubt it was going in
843246 i wish i wanted it as much as i used to but i dont
843247 ive been with her for 10 years a lot of wins she hit every green today it is the sign of a champion to come out when you dont have a chance of winning and play like that shes great nobodys done it better ill never forget this
843248 i think i was born to compete there were times i wish i didnt have it but i probably wouldnt have achieved what i have maybe there were times the last few months when i wish i had the desire and the motivation and the drive then i wouldnt step away
843249 but i just dont have that when you have the mind of a champion and the mind of a competitor but then theres a few pieces missing thats hard to accept sometimes
843250 i came up 18 made the corner turn and there was a sign saying annika you will be missed
843251 i thought that was very special i waved to the guys they clapped and then i came up 18 and everybody was cheering it just makes you feel good when you get that type of applause ive been out here for 15 years and ive experienced a lot of joy a few setbacks but overall its been great
843252 im going to miss it no doubt about it i love the majors i try to gear up for them and kind of be ready for them ive had happy tears there ive had unhappy tears this game and this championship just sucks everything out of you
843253 the competition the cheering being under the limelight to hit that perfect 6 iron and make that putt

843270 forget tom daschles blog the south dakota politics blog is where you want to go if youre interested in well south dakota politics and hey who isnt
843271 bloggers like south dakota politics have done a great job of exposing the incredibly biased reporting of the states dominant newspaper the sioux falls argus leader
843272 first the nyt now the sioux falls argus leader bloggers subject their state paper to close scrutiny
843273 the influence of blogging on politics is nowhere more obvious than in south dakota
843274 a credible counterweight to local south dakota papers such as the sioux falls argus leader which too often falls into the habit of ignoring new angles to the race and uncritically running mr daschles press releases

843312 a lot of people in america see this as a confrontation between good and evil including me
843313 there was a stark change between the culture of the 50s and the 60s boom and i think theres change happening here
843314 a framework for analyzing the movements that shaped the egalitarian creed in america
843315 steeped in the rationalism of the enlightenment and harboring suspicions of the established churches the leaders of the revolution tended to view all political issues through the prism of natural rights rather than divine revelation
843316 preached that the american mission was to build gods kingdom on earth an array of reform movements eg temperance abolition of slavery elimination of graft in government sought to make america a fit place for the second coming of christ
843317 laid the basis for the welfare state providing both the ideological foundation and the politic drive for the labor reforms of the 1930 1940s and 1950s and for the civil rights reforms of the 1950 and 1960s and for the new feminist reforms of the late 1960s and early 1970s
843318 in the powerlessness of the church the church has clutched at politics but the nature of politics inevitably produces divisiveness which produces a hardening on the part of those in the world and because politics is human fleshly effort this will result in discouragement and a failure to achieve expectations among christians reliance upon politics to secure change is evidence of how sickly the church has become politics has become an obessession with some christians and its an indication of the weak state of the church
843319 the alliance between the baathists and jihadists which sustains al qaeda in iraq is not new contrary to what you may have been told

843338 what came first creative reason the spirit who makes all things and gives them growth or unreason which lacking any meaning yet somehow brings forth a mathematically ordered cosmos as well as man and his reason
843339 as christians we say i believe in god the father the creator of heaven and earth i believe in the creator spirit we believe that at the beginning of everything is the eternal word with reason and not unreason
843340 from the enlightenment on science at least in part has applied itself to seeking an explanation of the world in which god would be unnecessary
843341 and if this were so he god would also become unnecessary in our lives
843342 would then be nothing more than a chance result of evolution and thus in the end equally meaningless
843343 but whenever the attempt seemed to be nearing success inevitably it would become clear something is missing from the equation
843344 when god is subtracted something doesnt add up for man the world the whole vast universe
843345 the evidence for evolution seems far from compelling it seems compelling only to those with a prior commitment to metaphysical materialism for whom darwinism is practically the only reasonable explanation available for life as we know it
843346 the term darwinism conveys the suggestion of a secular ideology a global system of belief so it does and so it surely is darwins theory has been variously used by darwinian biologists to explain the development of a bipedal gait the tendency to laugh when amused obesity anorexia nervosa business negotiations a preference for tropical landscapes the evolutionary roots of political rhetoric maternal love infanticide clan formation marriage divorce certain comical sounds funeral rites the formation of regular verb forms altruism homosexuality feminism greed romantic love jealousy warfare monogamy polygamy adultery the fact that men are pigs recursion sexual display abstract art and religious beliefs of every description
843347 darwins theory of evolution is the last of the great 19th century mystery religions
843348 if it should come to pass in the fullness of time that we discover that there is no explanation for life we will have to accept it if it should come to pass that we discover in the fullness of time that the only explanation for life is that it is a process designed for transcendental purposes by a transcendental figure we will have to accept that too and if that should come to pass i would like to ask who among us will genuinely feel diminished

843384 to be in hiroshima is a great honour i am deeply saddened and moved and also greatly inspired by the stories of the hibakusha the survivors of the atomic bombing
843385 we must do everything we can to amplify their story their message their cry for an end to nuclear weapons i share the dream of the hibakusha and i join their call never again no more hibakusha no more hiroshimas no more nagasakis
843386 the australia and japanese governments are working together towards a nuclear weapon free future
843387 australia and japan can begin this effort by taking their own advice if we want the nuclear weapon states to put down nuclear weapons we must also find the courage and the trust to put down the nuclear umbrella
843388 by remaining under the us nuclear umbrella our countries use nuclear weapons as symbols as part of security policies and as part of our national identities
843389 we can continue to have alliances but let those alliances be between equal sovereign states and let those alliances be nuclear weapons free

843396 u s sen barack obama said today he would be willing to open floridas coast for more oil drilling if it meant winning approval for broad energy changes my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices obama said in an interview with the palm beach post if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done obama said
843397 obama would consider off shore drilling as part of comprehensive energy plan
843398 now the latest scheme is well were going to drill offshore now i want to be absolutely clear to everybody about this if i thought that i could provide you some immediate relief on gas prices by drilling off the shores of california and new jersey i understand how desperate folks are i met a guy who couldnt go on a job search that lost his job couldnt go on a job search because of the high price of gas just couldnt fill up his tank i met a teacher in south dakota who loved her job as a teacher on an indian reservation she had to quit because the drive was too far it was taking up too much of her paycheck i know how bad people are hurting so if i thought that by drilling offshore we could solve our problem id do it
843399 i played in these conditions all week so maybe i was more used to it
843400 there were lots of long long rallies which took a toll and we were both tired at the end

843403 i had a good finish there at the end i kept hitting a lot of good shots but my putting was not the best all day
843404 i struck the ball really well especially with my irons

843408 we will come out of the financial crisis but we still have to confront that problem of a changing balance between growth and inflation or what we like to call stagflation
843409 with corporate adjustments just beginning the euro area is at risk of significantly underperforming the u s and global economy for some quarters to come
843410 we expect the fed to stay on hold at 2 0 percent at the next four meetings
843411 as inflation eases and the economic recovery fails to materialize we expect the fed to make two quarter point cuts in the first half of 2009
843412 even back in the old days there was a screening process for people who work in those laboratories
843413 there are time honored procedures to examine security clearances on a regular basis to verify information provided by the security clearance holder and traditional steps to ensure that only the appropriate level of security access is granted largely based on the nature of the persons government job
843414 i dont know whether this is just another false track and a real diversion from where they need to be
843415 i dont think its helpful to respond to piecemeal judgments by individuals who are not informed about the case or the evidence
843416 we will make public what we can at the appropriate time and well try to do it all at once with considerations for the victims and their families first
843417 obviously it coincided with the events everyone is talking about
843418 hes a top horse it was little more than i was expecting he really struggled out there to run this horse down but zitos horse ran great

843420 but he got down on his belly and he won though
843421 i hear that girls suffer not just physically but psychologically
843422 but i am afraid i dont want my daughters to have uncontrollable demands for sex
843423 i dont care what everyone thinks i was really harmed and i didnt want this for my daughters
843424 when i talk about my experience many become convinced they also see how my daughters are good and religious
843425 sixteen years after brett favre came to the packers he is returning for a seventeenth season
843426 he has had a great career with our organization and although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
843427 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage this has been a tough situation but the packers will make the most of it
843428 that is the team that has hit me three times already it seemed so obvious to me
843429 im not going to bring a guy in that throws 85 miles an hour to hit somebody

843437 gimp is an acronym for gnu image manipulation program it is a freely distributed program for such tasks as photo retouching image composition and image authoring
843438 unfortunately its not all good news for the gimp its not as user friendly and intuitive as photoshop and does take some effort to learn how to use it properly in fact even though it can do many of the things that photoshop can do many photoshop users get a bit annoyed with it as it isnt a direct clone and many features are in different places and under different menus
843439 how can a photographer take advantage of these findings if you want to draw the eye first to something nonhuman in a photograph leave out faces be they human dog or mask
843440 out of all the weddings i have done this is my favorite
843441 i get cranky when talk turns to an ipo drought
843442 vcs may be frustrated but they should be happy about having to wait longer going public requires a lot of time and focus and energy on things that dont involve growing a business and companies that wait longer to go public tend to perform much better once they do
843443 the biggest happy surprise for me is number of companies that are thinking of ipos in late 2009 and 2010 and that what to know what they should be thinking about from now
843444 i dont know if youll ever want to go public but i bet that having been on the other side of the table i could be helpful to you
843445 you have people going to the home page why not put ads there
843446 we dont want to we think itll be better for users in the long run to have a simple interface had they been subject to greater pressure from investors with a shorter term perspective its not clear they could have made decisions like that
843447 im contacting you from the information you supplied on your blog
843448 i saw you have posted about disability and i wanted to tell you about an organization in the uk you may or may not be aware of
843449 dance in the darkroom so it was extremely informative and educational to listen to john paul explain demonstrate that process it was a great foundation on which to build on with his photoshop dodging amp burning techniques
843450 shots of nature and show you how to make it
843451 image into one with so much depth you feel like reaching or walking into it
843452 i could not disagree more because what john paul is teaching you is how to put back into the image what your eyes can see but your camera cannot capture the depth subtly and the details found in the shadows and in the light
843453 not to simply try and emulate what he was teaching
843454 the pavement is a mess the sidewalk is a mess and the curbing is a mess
843455 the biggest concern really of our group and i think a lot of people in the room is the speed of the traffic on the roadway
843456 if speeds are increasing because you have two lanes and you have all this more distance for pedestrians to cross it seems to me that youre going to have more pedestrians getting hit

843631 all gods children can dance is based on the short story of the same title by haruki murakami first time filmmaker robert logevalls stylish interpretation is as deceptively simple as his source material and
843632 like many of murakami harukis english reading fans i read a wild sheep chase and dance dance dance without knowledge that the former book was the third in a trilogy and that the latter book was an addition that came a few years later however if the reader pays closer attention to a wild sheep chase one can really see that the characters within the book seem to be established and that they already have their personal histories which are not coming completely new from the pages of a wild sheep chase almost a year after picking up a wild sheep chase for the first time i read jay rubins highly informative book haruki murakami amp the music of words and learned about murakamis first two novels hear the wind sing and pinball 1973 both of which had been translated into english by alfred birnbaum hear the wind sing begins with the narrator aged 29 talking about writing and how difficult it was for him to finally put down words on paper it took him eight years in fact to put down his thoughts on the summer of 1970 and the people he was involved with during that year why 1970 1970 was the year after the student activist group the zenkyoto was forced out of the building they had commandeered and soon afterwards those who had been its greatest supporters were sucked back into the system to become automatons of mainstream society for murakami the destruction of the student movement left a deep wound in his being and it pained him to see his fellows go to a more conservative rightist path however within the being of the narrator it might be hard to find a politically charged individual this is instead found within the being of the narrators best friend the rat yet the rats sense of aggravation towards modern society is quite impotent so he instead fills his emptiness with beer and liquor the narrator a more introspective fellow spends his time consumed in the books of dead writers the memories of his dead girlfriend and pursuing the girl with four fingers on her left hand at the time he wrote this thin tome murakami owned a jazz bar called the peter cat and had little time for actual writing so his sentences within this volume tended to be quite pithy also the short pithy styles of kurt vonnegut and richard brautigan influenced his writing the book itself is more a collection of vignettes than one coherent novel and the order of the book was originally quite different that the final version while it does not hold a candle to some of his later works murakamis first novel is quite important in his body of work and it shows his early interest in such subjects as language memory china and the student movement definitely a book worth seeking for the murakami fan hopefully one day along with pinball 1973 it will be given a wider release to murakamis english reading fans

843656 habr una mejor convivencia cuando los adultos mayores a oran los viejos tiempos en que sal an al portal a tomar un cafecito a platicar con los amigos es porque la gente viv a cerca se pod a desplazar a pie y se encontraban en la tortiller a en la cantina y en los parques con esta ciudad desparramada est el fen meno que tenemos de grandes desplazamientos aspiramos a tener una ciudad m s humana a escala humana no a escala del autom vil una ciudad m s amable con los ni os y ancianos
843657 si no redensificamos la ciudad no es viable porque si tienes un origen y un destino a 25 kil metros de tu casa tendr as que ser un atleta para recorrerlo en bici
843658 no se trata de meter edificios en toda la ciudad habr que priorizar algunos corredores viales o avenidas que lo soportan que por su anchura calidad de banquetas y espacios p blicos son aptos para que vivan m s personas sobre ellos
843659 hablamos de edificios de cuatro o cinco niveles pero hay corredores que hay que potencializar como tales que podr n soportar mayores densidades tal vez edificios de 15 o 20 pisos hay corredores secundarios en el municipio donde lo ptimo es redensificar de una manera m s moderada
843660 si una zona la tienes consolidada y llegas a potencializarla tienes que adaptarla con nuevas capacidades
843661 la redensificaci n no es una minusval a para las propiedades si se sabe manejar es una oportunidad excelente para crear infraestructura hay zonas en la ciudad consolidadas con carencia de infraestructura si los corredores cerca de estas colonias se potencializan se redensifican a trav s de ello se puede conseguir inversi n que el municipio quisiera destinar pero no tiene la suficiencia presupuestal para renovar toda la cuidad

843675 the ones i know are some softball parents out of brisbane and that is a sport that were trying to see if we can find some tickets to replace them
843676 but if theyve also purchased their travel and accommodation through the sham organisation theres certainly nothing we can do there
843677 the us olympic committee is taking action to close down some of these sites to eliminate them from that territory
843678 but we dont have other tickets to replace them with sadly
843679 we feel for those people some of whom i know
843680 official tickets that the tickets must be fake because the games have sold out in a letter to one of the victims the aoc said there was nothing it could do to recoup any money defrauded while the aoc is sympathetic to the consumers duped by unauthorised offshore websites it is powerless to take any action against an offshore operator aoc brand protection director alan grover wrote to the victim the aoc regrets the fact that bocog and cosport have advised olympic games tickets have sold out owing to an unprecedented demand texas based travel agent jolanta sochacka is one of the scams biggest victims after she purchased us57 000 a60 600 worth of tickets for a family of seven when ms sochacka asked a friend in phoenix to check out the address the friend found an empty office and no sign the company had ever resided there ive been in business for 18 years im aware that theres fraud out there sochacka told the la times but they looked so legitimate their website was so elaborate in another case computer savvy california based victim jonathan murray paid us4950 a5260 for olympic equestrian events i work for a fairly large software company and the team i manage is responsible for dealing with internet crime mr murray originally from britain told the la times newspaper so it was quite amusing to everyone at work that i had been scammed on the internet the important point im making by talking about this is that this was a bloody good scam
843681 the slow steady and silent subversion of the constitution has been a revolution that americans appear to have slept through unaware that the blessings of liberty bestowed upon them by the founding generation were being eroded
843682 a constitutional fence around government power by cordoning off areas of individual liberty that are immune from government intrusion

843694 the independence party occasionally endorses a candidate from a different party when we do not have a candidate from our own party
843695 to be cross endorsed the candidate must agree with at least 75 percent of our key issues and meet several other qualifications we look forward to having steve sarvi represent us in congress
843696 as i have gotten to know the members of the independence party it has become clear to me that if anyone wants change a change in course its them
843697 they want real fiscal responsibility not politicians who run up our deficits and spend endlessly in iraq while talking about fiscal responsibility they want government that represents everyone not just members of one party or donors with powerful corporate interests they represent one special interest making sure we leave a better world for our children and grandchildren thats what i want and its what my supporters want im proud to have this endorsement and i look forward to having the independence party as an integral part of our team working for victory
843698 the braves family and braves fans everywhere will sadly miss him our thoughts are with his wife paula and his children
843699 how can you attack the democrats when we have such a bulletproof administration ruling the roost in washington

843716 brothers if someone is caught in a sin you who are spiritual should restore him gently but watch yourself or you also may be tempted
843717 if your brother sins against you go and show him his fault just between the two of you if he listens to you you have won your brother over but if he will not listen take one or two others along so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses if he refuses to listen to them tell it to the church and if he refuses to listen even to the church treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector
843718 death and life are in the power of the tongue
843719 when we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us we can turn the whole animal or take ships as an example although they are so large and are driven by strong winds they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go likewise the tongue is a small part of the body but it makes great boasts consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark
843720 what is the one thing you can tell me about owning a dog what is the one piece of advice youd give
843721 look at her she dont need no one she just sits with herself and laughs
843722 its the first time in my life i have won tournaments back to back
843723 usually i would win a tournament and the next week i would lose in the first round
843724 so i was happy when i won the first match and then i was just taking it one match at a time
843725 i would say i was maybe more experienced in the final and it really paid off
843726 i hit some good shots she gave me some points in the crucial moments she gave me some good mistakes
843727 i could say thank you that helped me to win in two sets
843728 i won a tournament in japan this year and my dad thought it would be good for me to play there and gain more experience
843729 but now i think i might change my plans and go to america a little sooner
843730 to win a major is a dream come true i couldnt sleep last night and i was very nervous today but i spoke to my dad last night in korea and he told me i had a chance
843731 i just had to be comfortable over it i hit on the right edge and it actually started right where i aimed and went in the hole im really relieved
843732 i had a good finish there at the end i kept hitting a lot of good shots but my putting was not the best all day
843733 i struck the ball really well especially with my irons
843734 it is better to let the doctors explain the situation but i can say that it doesnt look good
843735 there is a possibility it could be the cruciate ligament it is a serious injury we hope it will prove to be not as bad in the end
843736 i played in these conditions all week so maybe i was more used to it
843737 there were lots of long long rallies which took a toll and we were both tired at the end
843738 my wimbledon win against richard gasquet gave me a lot of confidence and this will give me even more
843739 its a tough start to the week u s consumption is worsening more than expected
843740 when toyota cuts its production there will be steel glass and tyres in excess inventory
843741 i havent seen any surprises in first quarter earnings so far but the outlook for corporate earnings is getting worrisome
843742 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
843743 we do know we have no systemic problem in this company
843744 it is our job to make sure we get that reputation back
843745 there is a shift in the market the market has moved from being concerned with inflation pressures to realising that perhaps growth is slowing enough across the board to eventually contain inflation pressures so they have started to reprice risks
843746 in areas like the u s it does help the central bank
843747 both debt and equity investors as well as policymakers should cheer
843748 further decline in commodities will be equity market friendly to the extent that headline inflation also recedes subsequent fed eases should steepen the u s yield courtesy of a front end rally
843749 this suggests that even with the ecbs higher weight on inflation since the july rate hike a near term rate hike is unlikely
843750 however we expect that with inflation rates around 2 percent in mid 2009 and ongoing weak economic growth the ecb will cut rates eventually
843751 it makes it relatively easier for central banks but it doesnt mean they dont have to hike interest rates especially in places in india or brazil
843752 theres still no sign that its out of the near term downtrend and we are still very near to the 890 895 supports
843753 the only thing thing that could perhaps help gold is if jewellery demand picks up in august september
843754 it is below the previous 1 684 support and likely to head towards 1 574 50 its below all supports and i think its on freefall mode
843755 the bear trend continues the target price is 1 500
843756 we may see the price below 1 500 this week
843757 and as far as people griping that there are no
843758 the fetus will reach up and wonder what this scope is
843759 and even though his or her eyes are fused so they cant really see the scope theyll grab the scope sometimes because its an object in their cavity
843760 i will return to tv when i understand it better because i didnt understand it when youre 16 you dont know what the hell youre getting into like i had no clue los angeles was a shock to the system
843761 id like to see him win every game but one not us
843762 but its good if i cant be there id just rather him be next
843763 my fathers more accustomed to handling this question than i am but i think itll definitely elevate competition
843764 i understand the history and i understand the tradition that we have at florida state
843765 i was a fan long way before i became a player and i would be asking the same questions weve been working extremely hard but we just havent gotten it done thats what it comes down to
843766 its a starting block for us to know where were at to see what people think about miami
843767 its scary in the sense that the young guys on the team might buy into it us old guys we understand how this thing goes it really doesnt matter
843768 he said coach fulmer ive got something for you and gave it to him
843769 this is not the place for that kind of thing the great fans that are very passionate about the southeastern conference arent interested in that kind of b s
843770 and i would have some other choice words if there werent so many cameras in here
843771 i was getting out of the car and was tossed a piece of paper that i picked up stuck it in with a whole bunch of things that i had been reading on my way in from the airport and handed it to media relations official bud ford to put in his briefcase and forgot about it
843772 about being in birmingham i wasnt trying to mislead anybody i hadnt looked at anything
843773 he wasnt dodging us because i dont think he knew we were trying to serve him
843774 we had hoped we could get him last night before fulmers part in media days began but this was the best we could do

843785 where were looking out at next generation architectures whats oslo all about well were planning on giving as much early coverage on this as possible
843786 i guess what im hoping for is that we see a team that is well organized plays with a lot of heart gives great effort and is well prepared
843787 you cant say it has to be a certain number of wins
843788 this is a team that has been pretty much inherited
843789 in three or four years that will change youll have to say recruiting is part of it are the players here are they functioning well at this point all you can hope for is that the players play hard that they know what theyre doing and that there seems to be a good chemistry between them and the coaches those are the things that im hoping will come to pass
843790 exactly what the problem was i dont know whether it was talent approach to the game leadership within the team coaching leadership
843791 hes been here for me hes been there as a resource
843792 he says youre not tom osborne he makes suggestions but hes not overbearing he says youve got to do it the way you see fit

843795 copyright renewal copyright restoration and the difficulty of determining copyright status
843796 everybody wants to say i couldnt win because of this or that
843797 to my way of thinking it doesnt matter if your goddamn head fell off or your legs exploded if you didnt make it you didnt make it one excuse is as good as another
843798 theres only one rule the guy who trains the hardest the most wins period because you wont die even though you feel like youll die you dont actually die like when youre training you can always do one more always as tired as you might think you are
843799 i hope some 16 year old doesnt read this and then go kill himself on the bike
843800 i read something like that and i trained like that and yeah i was pretty damn depressed for a while then it got better
843801 if you overtrained it means that you didnt train hard enough to handle that level of training
843802 so you werent overtrained you were actually undertrained to begin with so theres the rule again the guy who trains the hardest the most wins
843803 i saw firsthand what lance did and it was superhuman
843804 i saw how his system worked its not necessary for me to be like lance in every way but there are some things that i want to take from that and use
843805 his boldness at taking charge of things his willingness to say this is what i want and im going to take it its very hard to compete against that

843810 we need more women in the house in the senate and in the boardroom as well we are going to be in a war of terror for a considerable period of time you can reposition men in kuwait we need more in afghanistan where the taliban has a resurgence we know there are problems in the horn of africa and we know that southeast asia remains a place for terrorists and a place for insurgents there are terror cells operating in this country and in some 60 countries so we are going to be fighting this war for some time to come

843815 the court therefore strikes as invalid the definition of routine husbandry practices
843816 this is a major victory for farm animals in new jersey and will pave the way for better protections of farm animals nationwide

843843 there are these things called standards that the corps and other military and police groups are obligated to follow it is to avoid giving someone the wrong idea about who you are and your application in society i guess blackwater and the federal marijuana plant warriors dont care what people think
843844 what is most disturbing is the claim of several blackwater mercenaries we spoke with that they are here under contract from the federal government and the state of louisiana
843845 that raises a key question under what authority are blackwaters men operating a spokesperson for the homeland security department russ knocke told the washington post he knows of no federal plans to hire blackwater or other private security

843870 no part of any appropriation contained in this or any other act shall be used for publicity or propaganda purposes within the united states not heretofore authorized by the congress
843871 the failure of an agency to identify itself as the source of a prepackaged news story misleads the viewing public by encouraging the viewing audience to believe that the broadcasting news organization developed the information the prepackaged news stories are purposefully designed to be indistinguishable from news segments broadcast to the public when the television viewing public does not know that the stories they watched on television news programs about the government were in fact prepared by the government the stories are in this sense no longer purely factual the essential fact of attribution is missing
843872 over the years gao has interpreted publicity or propaganda restrictions to preclude use of appropriated funds for among other things so called covert propaganda
843873 look i didnt know look i think that you guys should take a step back and look at this look dod has made a decision theyve decided to stop this program but i would say that one of the things that we try to do in the administration is get information out to a variety of people so that everybody else can call them and ask their opinion about something and i dont think that that should be against the law and i think that its absolutely appropriate to provide information to people who are seeking it and are going to be providing their opinions on it it doesnt necessarily mean that all of those military analysts ever agreed with the administration i think you can go back and look and think that a lot of their analysis was pretty tough on the administration that doesnt mean that we shouldnt talk to people
843874 scant credible evidence that iraq had any significant collaborative ties with al qaeda
843875 saddams regime is intensely secular and is wary of islamic revolutionary movements moreover baghdad is unlikely to provide assistance to a group it cannot control
843876 in desperation saddam would share chemical or biological weapons with al qaeda
843877 sporadic wary contacts with al qaeda since the mid 1990s rather than a relationship with al qaeda that has developed over time
843878 if iraq regimes sic continues to defy us and the world we will move deliberately yet decisively to hold iraq to account its a new world were in we used to think two oceans could separate us from an enemy on that tragic day september the 11th 2001 we found out thats not the case we found out this great land of liberty and of freedom and of justice is vulnerable and therefore we must do everything we can everything we can to secure the homeland to make us safe
843879 with every step the iraqi regime takes toward gaining and deploying the most terrible weapons our own options to confront that regime will narrow and if an emboldened regime were to supply these weapons to terrorist allies then the attacks of september 11th would be a prelude to far greater horrors
843880 the battle of iraq is one victory in a war on terror that began on september the 11 2001 and still goes on that terrible morning 19 evil men the shock troops of a hateful ideology gave america and the civilized world a glimpse of their ambitions they imagined in the words of one terrorist that september the 11th would be the beginning of the end of america by seeking to turn our cities into killing fields terrorists and their allies believed that they could destroy this nations resolve and force our retreat from the world they have failed
843881 now were in a new and unprecedented war against violent islamic extremists this is an ideological conflict we face against murderers and killers who try to impose their will these are the people that attacked us on september the 11th and killed nearly 3 000 people the stakes are high and once again we have had to change our strategic thinking the major battleground in this war is iraq
843882 we know that iraq and al qaeda have had high level contacts that go back a decade some al qaeda leaders who fled afghanistan went to iraq these include one very senior al qaeda leader who received medical treatment in baghdad this year and who has been associated with planning for chemical and biological attacks weve learned that iraq has trained al qaeda members in bomb making and poisons and deadly gases
843883 w e we need to think about saddam hussein using al qaeda to do his dirty work to not leave fingerprints behind
843884 evidence from intelligence sources secret communications and statements by people now in custody reveal that saddam hussein aids and protects terrorists including members of al qaeda secretly and without fingerprints he could provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists or help them develop their own
843885 w hat i want to bring to your attention today is the potentially much more sinister nexus between iraq and the al qaeda terrorist network a nexus that combines classic terrorist organizations and modern methods of murder iraq today harbors a deadly terrorist network
843886 the battle of iraq is one victory in a war on terror that began on september the 11 2001 and still goes on t he liberation of iraq removed an ally of al qaeda
843887 may 1 2003 speech of president bush on uss abraham lincoln
843888 statements and implications by the president and secretary of state suggesting that iraq and al qaida had a partnership or that iraq had provided with weapons training were not substantiated by the intelligence
843889 the intelligence community did not confirm that muhammad atta met an iraqi intelligence officer in prague in 2001 as the vice president repeatedly claimed
843890 a substantial amount of iraqs chemical warfare agents precursors munitions and production equipment were destroyed between 1991 and 1998 as a result of operation desert storm and unscom actions t here is no reliable information on whether iraq is producing and stockpiling chemical weapons or whether iraq has or will establish its chemical warfare agent production facilities
843891 t he notion of a saddam hussein with his great oil wealth with his inventory that he already has of biological and chemical weapons is i think a frightening proposition for anybody who thinks about it
843892 in defiance of the united nations iraq has stockpiled biological and chemical weapons and is rebuilding the facilities used to make more of those weapons
843893 all the world has now seen the footage of an iraqi mirage aircraft with a fuel tank modified to spray biological agents over wide areas iraq has developed spray devices that could be used on unmanned aerial vehicles with ranges far beyond what is permitted by the security council a uav launched from a vessel off the american coast could reach hundreds of miles inland
843894 the iraqi report also failed to deal with issues which have arisen since 1998 including attempts to acquire uranium and the means to enrich it
843895 the british government has learned that saddam hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from africa
843896 we do know that there have been shipments going into iraq of aluminum tubes that really are only suited to high quality aluminum tools sic that are only really suited for nuclear weapons programs centrifuge programs
843897 our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production
843898 h e has made repeated covert attempts to acquire high specification aluminum tubes from 11 different countries even after inspections resumed by now just about everyone has heard of these tubes and we all know that there are differences of opinion there is controversy about what these tubes are for most us experts think they are intended to serve as rotors in centrifuges used to enrich uranium
843899 statements by the president and vice president prior to the october 2002 national intelligence estimate regarding iraqs chemical weapons production capability and activities did not reflect the intelligence communitys uncertainties as to whether such production was ongoing
843900 the secretary of defenses statement that the iraqi government operated underground wmd facilities that were not vulnerable to conventional airstrikes because they were underground and deeply buried was not substantiated by available intelligence information
843901 in making the case for war the administration repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when in reality it was unsubstantiated contradicted or even non existent as a result the american people were led to believe that the threat from iraq was much greater than actually existed
843902 states such as these iraq iran and north korea and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil arming to threaten the peace of the world by seeking weapons of mass destruction these regimes pose a grave and growing danger they could provide these arms to terrorists giving them the means to match their hatred they could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the united states in any of these cases the price of indifference would be catastrophic
843903 simply stated there is no doubt that saddam hussein has weapons of mass destruction he is amassing them to use against our friends our enemies and against us
843904 the history the logic and the facts lead to one conclusion saddam husseins regime is a grave and gathering danger to suggest otherwise is to hope against the evidence to assume this regimes good faith is to bet the lives of millions and the peace of the world in a reckless gamble and this is a risk we must not take
843905 n o terrorist state poses a greater or more immediate threat to the security of our people than the regime of saddam hussein and iraq
843906 on its present course the iraqi regime is a threat of unique urgency it has developed weapons of mass death
843907 but the president also believes that this problem has to be dealt with and if the united nations wont deal with it then the united states with other likeminded nations may have to deal with it we would prefer not to go that route but the danger is so great with respect to saddam hussein having weapons of mass destruction and perhaps even terrorists getting hold of such weapons that it is time for the international community to act and if it doesnt act the president is prepared to act with likeminded nations
843908 today the world is also uniting to answer the unique and urgent threat posed by iraq a dictator who has used weapons of mass destruction on his own people must not be allowed to produce or possess those weapons we will not permit saddam hussein to blackmail and or terrorize nations which love freedom
843909 but the risk of doing nothing the risk of the security of this country being jeopardized at the hands of a madman with weapons of mass destruction far exceeds the risk of any action we may be forced to take
843910 statements by the president and the vice president indicating that saddam hussein was prepared to give weapons of mass destruction to terrorist groups for attacks against the united states were contradicted by available intelligence information
843911 authorization for use of military force against iraq resolution of 2002
843912 whereas iraq both poses a continuing threat to the national security of the united states and international peace and security in the persian gulf region and remains in material and unacceptable breach of its international obligations by among other things continuing to possess and develop a significant chemical and biological weapons capability actively seeking a nuclear weapons capability and supporting and harboring terrorist organizations
843913 whereas members of al qaeda an organization bearing responsibility for attacks on the united states its citizens and interests including the attacks that occurred on september 11 2001 are known to be in iraq
843914 b presidential determination in connection with the exercise of the authority granted in subsection a to use force the president shall prior to such exercise or as soon thereafter as may be feasible but no later than 48 hours after exercising such authority make available to the speaker of the house of representatives and the president pro tempore of the senate his determination that 1 reliance by the united states on further diplomatic or other peaceful means alone either a will not adequately protect the national security of the united states against the continuing threat posed by iraq or b is not likely to lead to enforcement of all relevant united nations security council resolutions regarding iraq and 2 acting pursuant to this joint resolution is consistent with the united states and other countries continuing to take the necessary actions against international terrorist and terrorist organizations including those nations organizations or persons who planned authorized committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on september 11 2001
843915 one question for you both do you believe that there is a link between saddam hussein a direct link and the men who attacked on september the 11th
843916 i could find no evidence of links between iraq and al qaeda the documentation and interviews indicated that al qaeda regarded saddam a secular leader as an infidel
843917 weve been looking at this hard for more than a year and you know what we just dont think its there
843918 nothing in this joint resolution supersedes any requirement of the war powers resolution
843919 the president is authorized to use the armed forces of the united states as he deems necessary and appropriate in order to 1 defend the national security of the united states against the continuing threat posed by iraq and 2 enforce all relevant united nations security council resolutions regarding iraq

843987 when ive lived abroad ive always been reasonably happy with the situation and yet i cant help but feel nostalgic from time to time american movies provide a glimpse of home without the plane ticket often with recognizable landmarks or cityscapes of l a new york or san francisco and they bring a taste of american life american people interacting with one another being very american and speaking english you never feel more american for better or for worse than when living abroad you start daydreaming avout gas dryers and twenty four hour safeways you find yourself in arguments defending kraft american cheese it tastes good on a burger i even know a grown man who cried all the way through dances with wolves which he saw in pargue in 1991 just because it was filmed in south dakota his home state

844022 the most common scenario is where the officer will tell the person you are going to be detained for a long time
844023 said claudia valenzuela managing attorney for the centers adult detention project
844024 i think its critically important that they have this option of a stipulated removal if they want it but they need to know what they are getting into
844025 there has been a deliberate choice on the part of the administration to get people out of the united states as quickly as possible often with little or no regard to what rights they might have
844026 a lot of people i think want to get out of detention as soon as possible and are not aware of the gravity of a stipulated order
844027 its a tremendous savings in tax dollars to be able to remove them from the country and get them out of our facilities
844028 is this helping to clear the backlog yes as long as the aliens agree and understand what they are signing everybody is happy

844069 dramatize our opposition to the inclusion in the bangsamoro juridical entity jbe
844070 we christians and muslims alike have spoken and resoundingly voted against this
844071 before mindanao or the philippines was colonized by foreigners now muslim counterparts not foreigners are colonizing our own people
844072 i am an official of moro islamic liberation front i am a spiritual leader now i can say that those agreeing to the territories given by the government are not milf like me they are maguindanaoan iranon liberation front
844073 when we were young we did not highlight the differences in us we looked at the commonalities and appreciated it with this ongoing development we are now seeing differently the government should have done something to make people meet and see on common ground not further divide them
844074 we engage actively in business not because they are muslims christians or lumads indigenous peoples in fact our co existence is not just mere toleration but appreciation
844075 we are not barbaric we guarantee that we will respect their rights while we are in islamic state we will still follow a democratic form of government
844076 we are asking the people of mindanao to widen their thinking and not to entertain selfish desires the past administrations tried but failed to address the bangsamoro problem now the agreement we will sign in malaysia on august 5 will not benefit the people of mindanao but the entire nation
844077 why should we be included again in another referendum when iligan city twice rejected the move to include the city in the autonomous region in muslim mindanao armm
844078 we are not against the peace process nor are we against the expansion of the armm however we cannot allow divisions to destroy the harmonious relationship among muslims christians and lumad

844082 promoting corporatization the sucs can be freed from the shackles of government bureaucratic provisions
844083 empowered to engage in business ventures raise endowments and other income generating activities
844084 her support for the continued corporatization of sucs can only mean higher costs that will push tertiary education beyond the reach of even more students
844085 by announcing corporatization as a cornerstone of her leadership it is evident filipino students and their parents shouldnt expect much in the way of meaningful and much needed reforms in tertiary education
844086 will further drive the profit oriented nature of education in the country
844087 tantamount to the states abandonment of its role of ensuring an education for all it promotes the notion that governments role in the delivery of basic social services is limited to subsidizing a select few
844088 does not mean well push for the privatization of suc owned properties
844089 with the countrys food security problem in mind were seriously considering converting idle suc lands into agricultural estates well put them to good use
844090 its a social space built around video communication that is searchable taggable and mashable
844091 it is a space where identities values and ideas are produced reproduced challenged and negotiated in new ways
844092 i dont care about making money i just want to make energy
844093 the key is to try to get some stability in the price of homes which appears to be happening in california
844094 since california constitutes 25 percent of the housing stock in the u s any stabilization can have a profound impact on national averages
844095 by extension a stabilization in home prices is required before any sustainable rally in financials can be expected
844096 it is our belief that we are moving in that direction
844097 we think a temporary bottom in housing is at hand
844098 at last the carrying cost of purchasing a home equals rental rates a condition that should lead to more stable home pricing going forward
844099 dont try to tell i what to do jah helps me all the way through
844100 in an environment where everybody is armed the breakout of violence is a possibility
844101 the mnlf and the milf are brothers we have the same ideologies and aspirations for the bangsamoro people were hoping that the government will find a certain mechanism to avoid conflict in territory
844102 unfortunately bringing peace to mindanao is very complex the important thing is the presidents determination to move the peace process forward
844103 mnlf lost commands and breakaway groups in pursuit of genuine peace in mindanao
844104 some even went with ji jemaah islamiyah and the abu sayyaf just because they were very disappointed
844105 we have been talking with our comrades to be patient and wait until the technical review of the tripartite peace agreement is finished
844106 but many of them especially the younger ones are getting restless we cannot control them anymore
844107 many of them are asking why are we still poor
844108 the government is moving so fast on signing agreements with sister organizations like the milf its not proper the 1996 mnlf grp accord should take precedence before any other agreements
844109 we are willing to support other agreements if it will not result in the ejection of the mnlf in the equation
844110 if that happens the bangsamoro people will be like palestine a nation without a state
844111 as such we should be consulted on the moa the existence of armm should be respected
844112 say what we want you to say where we want you to say it at a time thats convenient for us
844113 place sport at the service of the harmonious development of man

844115 i told you not to tease those spider monkeys theyll come at you well like spider monkeys
844116 thats what happens when you actually try to do the
844117 youre right i can hear the little peas screaming as theyre thawing out thats just weird
844118 this is a great script but its not quite what were looking for its too insert relevant or occasionally not so relevant adjective here but we really like your style what else do you have for us
844119 but its not a disney movie im looking for projects like liar liar high concept but youre a great writer what are you working on now
844120 its all systems go for the signing of the agreement on aug 5
844121 our men on the ground want to see peace in mindanao and we have been talking for a long time already
844122 effectively ceded part of the territory of the philippines to the milf
844123 ancestral domain does not form part of the philippines public domain
844124 obviously gma ms arroyo is not empowered to give up any part of our country to any group only the filipino people can do that in their sovereign capacity and only via amending the constitution
844125 will argue that the power of negotiations is with the executive branch
844126 any plebiscite will be pursuant only to an enabling law enacted by congress
844127 it was not saying we will confiscate or revoke all land titles
844128 thats why i dont see anyone can say that there is a violation and this would be an impeachable offense
844129 if congress will pass something else then the moa will not hold its up to congress
844130 whats being given is an enlarged autonomous region never in the discussions have we agreed to secession
844131 there is no such thing as peace at any price but we will give a chance to peace because peace is better than shooting
844132 in the highest form it could be a state within a state if it comes to that
844133 but if our lawyers will say that the bje will be under an expanded armm that will be enough then we dont have to have an amendment in the constitution
844134 there was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war with iran
844135 the one plan that interested me the most was why dont we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our boats goes to the strait of hormuz start a shoot up
844136 might cost some lives and it was rejected because you cant have americans killing americans thats the kind of thats the level of stuff were talking about provocation
844137 look is it high school yeah are we playing high school with you know 5 000 nuclear warheads in our arsenal yeah we are were playing you know whos the first guy to run off the highway with us and iran
844138 the tests involve flowing the lasers chemicals through the laser to confirm sequencing and control once these tests are completed the test team will fire the laser aboard the aircraft on the ground for the first time
844139 the airborne laser team has done a great job preparing the high energy laser for these fuel tests which will lead the way toward achieving first light of the laser aboard the aircraft
844140 once again we made and demonstrated enormous progress toward ushering in a new age of directed energy weapons repeated laser firings aboard the aircraft will demonstrate lasing duration and power at levels suitable for the destruction of multiple classes of ballistic missiles the laser will then be fired through the aircrafts beam control fire control system including the nose mounted turret this will be followed by functional check flights of the entire abl weapon system the test campaign will start with the first airborne intercept of a ballistic missile in 2009 the abl aircraft consists of a modified boeing 747 400f whose back half holds the high energy laser designed and built by northrop grumman before being installed the high energy laser completed rigorous ground testing in a laboratory at edwards the aircrafts front half contains the beam control fire control system developed by lockheed martin and the battle management system provided by boeing boeing is the prime contractor for abl which will provide speed of light capability to destroy all classes of ballistic missiles in their boost phase of flight

844177 a brand is a promise by identifying and authenticating a product or service it delivers a pledge of satisfaction and quality
844178 we listened and watched with disbelief as the images we saw and the statements made by ms arroyo were a far cry from our reality that of increased poverty worsened hunger and further marginalization
844179 instead she has only exaggerated the benefits of one which obviously does not represent the true circumstances of all
844180 i cannot believe thats happening with the current crop of miners we have
844181 the small lands we till for vegetables corn and other root crops for our food are threatened with conversion to dams mine sites and energy plants the entry of plantations timber license agreements and mining mean the loss of our sustainable livelihood practices
844182 our rights to self determination and to self governance are continuously violated the government and private corporations interested in our lands have connived to employ tactics to undermine our traditional processes and customary laws
844183 the governance of the nation should be more decentralized inclusive and cognizant of the different systems of governance particularly in indigenous communities and territories

844215 its not like the order is some think tank issuing consensus pronouncements or a political group where ideological conformity is expected
844216 there are but two reasons to not return the order of canada one is the belief that morgentaler is not a mass murderer of children who paved the way for two million more child murders the other is that the order of canada is so utterly trivial a distinction its not worth dignifying with the bother of returning it when it is specifically awarded for mass murder of children

844226 our days are spent trying to get some poor unsuspecting third world country to pony up to spending a year in a sweltering desert full of pissed off arabs who would rather shave the back of their legs with a cheese grater than submit to foreign occupation by a country for whom they have nothing but contempt
844227 i guess the next thing theyll ask for is 300 us citizens with hungarian last names to send to iraq

844240 uscentcom commanders announced today that they intend to maintain their presence in qatar
844241 were working on a plan for that we dont have one yet but not having a plan or an intelligent reason to do something has never been much of an impediment for us in the past we dont foresee it being a big show stopper for us in the future either
844242 we are going to actively encourage the military members in qatar to intermarry and raise children that will replace them in the future sure it may be a little hard on some of our female service members since there currently are about 8 men for every woman over there but we expect that to be obe as the sex ratios will even out in a generation or two in any case the key to the plan is to make these assignments not only permanent but inheritable and hereditary for example if you currently work the joc weather desk so will your children and their children and their children ad infinitum we like to think of it as job security

844288 the level of job advertisements remains at high levels particularly internet ads and in july the overall rate of decline has slowed

844314 the mayor and the county executive want to see a plan for affordable housing and for replacement and growth housing so all that has to be done before we really want to talk about moving anyone but if you want to look at a sense of urgency we feel it

844331 we know from experience that the graduating class will be fewer than two hundred and fifty
844332 if the school could get students to sign a piece of paper saying they intended to get their ged it wouldnt count against our dropout rate
844333 of course the kids all signed but most had no intention of getting a ged
844334 this is a list of the students who are assigned to johnston but have not enrolled
844335 if we can show that a student has transferred to another school or moved out of the district or is in jail it doesnt count against our dropout rate
844336 the question is not what game johnston will win its what year
844337 the average incoming freshman is reading at a fourth to fifth grade level
844338 the volunteers donated 100 bottles of blood we feel that the terror attack was on humanity at large so in the time of such calamity everyone should stay united and join hands with each other said khurshid bapu a mobile shop owner who was one of those who organized the blood donation camp
844339 but officials realized that he was a patient of chronic bronchial disorder and had repeated chest pain complaints they had to take him to civil hospital on friday
844340 we got news that a man has jumped from the main building in the parking lot at 3 30 am on sunday shaikh was later shifted to the trauma ward as he had severe head injuries his skull was fractured a team of doctors tried to save him but in vain he succumbed to his injuries at around 4 am
844341 we did not find any sedatives or suspicious material or even injury marks that can point to any kind of conspiracy shaikh must have been suffering from severe chest pain as his damaged lungs must have made breathing quite laborious for him
844342 c ove r t simi members have long abandoned their usual haunts and modus operandi they had met in minuscule groups of twos and threes at residential localities for indoctrination of freshers into jihad in complete secrecy the new recruits would then indoctrinate another three thus the network expanded sadly the police authorities concerned were determined to look the other way then
844343 grassroot intelligence gathering was effectively aided by inputs from central intelligence agencies many terror conspiracies were busted the only black mark was several controversial police encounters took place in the period
844344 in april 2007 the arrest of dg vanzara along with two other ips officers and 10 other junior pol i c e m e n proved to be the last nail the urgency in t e r ro r c o m b at seemed to evaporate and police began treating it as pariah even central intelligence agency tip offs were ignored
844345 a network of terror operatives in ahmedabad and other major cities of gujarat is now a forgone conclusion the bombs at ahmedabad and surat could not have been planted with such precision without their help
844346 till the last part of 2006 we were keeping an eye on certain religious institutions in ahmedabad we kept surveillance on certain covert simi activists as they went about meeting youth to build their network
844347 this activity lost momentum especially after april 2007 as the top brass suddenly seemed disinterested in this subject so much so that even basic infrastructure needed for surveillance and intelligence gathering was suddenly missing gradually all the good work was undone and today we do not know who met whom and how this new age terror network came into existence we have started work from scratch
844348 at the moment we have records of more than 10 lakh numbers it will take up an entire room to keep the call details if printouts are taken however after going through the entire database we are hopeful of getting some concrete leads
844349 in todays fast developing world the mobile phones are like a persons identity ones mobile phone and its contents speak a thousand words about what the person is like we are sure of the usage in this case
844350 forensic experts are unable to detect the origin of the email
844351 we are working on it and will submit the report once we complete the examination she said
844352 so far we have not met with much success in locating the origin of the mail found on the harddisk an officer said
844353 we are working on some clues which may turn into a breakthrough but so far there has been no specific outcome
844354 in this case the router does not have the computers from where the mail originated unique number
844355 investigation of these terror attack cases points to involvement of locals along with members of organized crime gangs as evident from use of stolen cars pilfered detonators and smuggled integrated circuits the security agencies are looking at factors which might have made the deadly liaison possible
844356 it is a matter of grave concern for all hindus in india that jihadi terrorism and government appeasement of those involved in jihadi terrorism may destroy india very soon said pravin togadia international general secretary of vhp
844357 does not want to have a compromised quality of life for her own child and can not afford the expensive treatment which may or may not give results
844358 we didnt want to take a chance that any of them would die while we were extricating them
844359 many of the survivors had severe injuries and would have likely suffered had we not taken measures to prevent this
844360 but feared that some of the hostages might be caught in the crossfire and suffer serious or even fatal injuries to prevent this we thought it best to simply ensure the relatively quick demise of the contents of the building
844361 we had fears that the nine trapped miners would die before we could extricate them
844362 we thought it would be best if we prevented a prolonged dying process
844363 we didnt want to take a chance that he might have a poor quality of life
844364 we feared that some of the survivors might yet starve before a rescue could be mounted we did not want to risk some of them dying prior to our arrival
844365 and with technology advancing by the day this apparatus and implantation procedure will only grow simpler
844366 it might be hard to have a member of the family that needs food and shelter and clothing but cant contribute anything of monetary value
844367 some parents in india and other poverty stricken areas have taken to maiming their children so they can be good beggers a maimed child brings in more money obviously her choice or lack there of should be easy posted by jess at august 1 2008 1 06 am
844368 at certain hindu holy sites youll see people who have been deliberately maimed so that theyll be better beggars as well as saddhus or holy men who make their living from alms
844369 however what does not meet the eye is the force behind this ever escalating problem of beggary the organised
844370 it turned out that children were being trafficked from cambodia possibly after being sold by their parents by vietnamese middlemen solely for begging they were kept in slavelike conditions and one or two were even maimed police suspected they had been maimed on purpose to earn more money an injured child means more compassion and therefore more dollars
844371 my chinese friends and relatives advised me that mainland chinese gangs kidnap and maim children from early childhood to make beggars out of them in mainland china life is cheap
844372 organised african gangs deliberately mutilate these child beggars before sending them into saudi arabia
844373 not sure if shes so well known in catholic circles
844374 we are being forced by law to offer you these brochures they were put together by religious zealots passing off their dogma as if it science the only purpose of these materials is to try to shame and humiliate you do you want to view these materials
844375 under duress i am required to recite this religious dogma to you these words are only intended to harass shame and intimidate you
844376 at the core of liberalism is the spoiled child miserable as all spoiled children are unsatisfied demanding ill disciplined despotic and useless liberalism is a philosophy of sniveling brats
844377 they call it safe abortion you wont feel any pain and you wont see any blood
844378 it absolutely conveys to the patient that continued living isnt worthwhile
844379 or doesnt cover life prolonging treatment unless there is better than a 5 chance it will help the patients live for 5 more years
844380 well pay for you to die but youre not worth it if you want to live
844381 people get old get in the way cramp styles cost money theyre better off dead if unwanted
844382 there is a line a line where beyond it we are using vast resources to care for the few when those same resources could save improve the lives of the many

844389 i heard he was a real horndog once the cameras quit rolling
844390 in thyolo district malawi one nurse keeps 400 patients alive by following up their essential treatment but her basic salary amounts to just 3 a day
844391 it is intolerable to then be told by governments and donor countries that it is unsustainable to raise her wages even though she is responsible for 7 500 worth of drugs a month for her patients those willing to support funding for medicines must find ways to cover recurrent costs like salaries for health workers
844392 it is devastating to stand by and watch people growing sicker and sometimes dying as they wait weeks and even months before being treated simply because there are not enough health care workers
844393 overworked underpaid and undervalued health care workers in southern africa are increasingly scarce just as the number of hiv patients is rising antiretrovirals may be present on more hospital and clinic shelves but without the health staff to administer them a deadly gap will only grow wider

844398 nel novembre 1920 abbiamo previsto che il fascismo sarebbe andato al potere cosa allora inconcepibile per i fascisti stessi se la classe operaia non avesse fatto a tempo ad frenare con le armi la sua avanzata sanguinosa

844402 how is it compassionate to hold a womans hand and tell her that its okay to kill her child and mislead her into thinking that shes not hurting herself
844403 isnt that quaint but you are at least going to need to masturbate
844404 getting the serious attention of prosecutors in cases involving allegations of animal cruelty is an essential step in protecting community safety the connection between animal cruelty and human violence is well documented studies show a correlation between animal cruelty and all manner of other crimes from narcotics and firearms violations to battery and sexual assault strong carefully considered sentencing that includes incarceration psychological treatment and a ban on pet ownership is the most effective available tool for reducing recidivism and interrupting the cycle of criminal behavior

844406 isnt that quaint but you are at least going to need to masturbate
844407 i guess the way to tell the good research from the bad is not the quality of peer reviewed work but the ideology of the researcher what i get from clay s article is this when an apa approved policy position is supported it is science otherwise it is ideology

844413 esistono tragedie e comportamenti a cui chi crede ancora di poter cambiare il mondo non pu permettersi di assistere immobile
844414 non possiamo esimerci dal sentirci vicini alla sofferenza del popolo tibetano e dallaffiancarla a quella di chi nel nostro paese costretto alla soglia della povert da uno stipendio da fame o da un licenziamento situazioni in vero molto diverse ma originate dalla stessa sprezzante violenza ed ignoranza di quelle regole di rispetto per luomo e per i popoli che dovrebbero rappresentare le fondamenta di qualunque stato ed questa diversit congenita che ci impedisce di accettare questi giochi olimpici lo sport pu e deve avvicinare ed unire serve a riscoprire una radice di valori comuni laddove questa radice non esiste una manifestazione sportiva come le olimpiadi perde il suo senso e rimane solo una vuota scatola pubblicitaria a servizio degli interessi di legittimazione e sdoganamento di un regime criminale
844415 di fronte ai recenti accadimenti in tibet ed alle proposte di boicottaggio che alcuni esponenti della societ del mondo sportivo o politico hanno avanzato si levata una serie di voci contrarie in nome degli ideali olimpici della non politicizzazione della manifestazione dei cinque cerchi
844416 non pensabile che le federazioni boicottino le olimpiadi allora chiediamo che tutte le societ che sponsorizzano la manifestazione o che grazie ad essa beneficeranno di lucrosi ricavi pensiamo alle concessionarie pubblicitarie di tv e carta stampata devolvano una quota a sostegno del tibet e della sua lotta non violenta per lindipendenza gesto concreto che varrebbe forse pi di mille parole combattiamo questa battaglia perch la nostra battaglia quella per la libert dei popoli e per la difesa dei nostri valori se chi ha nelle mani i fili del potere ha timore di schierarsi pubblicamente contro il colosso cinese noi non possiamo certo abbassare la testa e tacere noi non vogliamo renderci complici di un tale gioco noi non guarderemo le olimpiadi

844420 era un galantuomo la sua unica colpa fu di essere incompetente
844421 sa in linea generale in giro c sempre voglia di spubblicare la chiesa poi del caso in questione penso che la teste sia una millantatrice una che vuole spillare denaro con la vendita delle sue memorie a giornali e case editrici come dire una persona poco affidabile una che meriterebbe il carcere per quello che sta dicendo e facendo non mi meraviglierei se la santa sede ci costituisse parte civile contro di lei
844422 monsignor marcinkus lo scriva pure era un galantuomo magari ingenuo e impreparato nel senso che era luomo sbagliato al posto sbagliato come mi aveva confermato qualcuno che contava allepoca in vaticano il buon marcinkus di finanza capiva poco o nulla e per questo fu raggirato nel caso del fallimento del banco ambrosiano ma posso assicurare che era una persona onesta
844423 fu monsignor de bonis con il quale intrattenevo numerose frequentazioni a confidarmi che ebbene s marcinkus non sapeva nulla di finanza finir nelle mani di persone senza scrupoli mi predisse lo stesso de bonis prima del crack del banco ambrosiano e infatti come mi ha poi confermato un mio conterraneo che apparteneva alla banda di calvi cos avvenne
844424 le risponder dicendo che oggi i magistrati indagano solo a destra o contro berlusconi ma allepoca si mossero molto attivamente
844425 le do una risposta precisa un alto prelato di curia di cui per ovvii motivi non riveler il nome mi confid che renatino de pedis si era convertito al cattolicesimo in maniera sincera aveva cambiato vita e donato uningente somma alla chiesa da devolvere in opere di carit in cambio sapendo di dover morire a breve chiese al cardinale poletti che allepoca era il vicario del papa per la diocesi di roma di essere interrato nella basilica di santa apollinare poletti avrebbe potuto rifiutarsi ma con grande leggerezza acconsent ecco come andarono davvero i fatti il sequestro orlandi non centrava nulla
844426 il paese ha unideologia tradizionale e quando qualcuno pretende di imporre altre idee diverse ed estranee la nazione reagisce come un organismo con anticorpi di fronte ai germi e nasce cos la violenza i soldati adempiono il loro dovere primario di amare dio e la patria che si trova in pericolo non solo si pu parlare di invasione di stranieri ma anche di invasione di idee che mettono a repentaglio i valori fondamentali questo provoca una situazione di emergenza e in queste circostanze si pu applicare il pensiero di san tommaso daquino il quale insegna che in casi del genere lamore per la patria si equipara allamore per dio

844430 i wanted to introduce a visual and sonic world that is a contained entity of the 70s
844431 this was one of the richest eras of music harlem was as much about the music as it was about drugs and whatever else was going on
844432 i wanted to write music that had a groove not songs that followed that traditional pattern of verse chorus and middle eight i wanted a sound that was more hypnotic more driving songs that would draw you in in a different way songs
844433 captivating greatly contributing to the sense that tectonic forces lie beneath the drama
844434 on a craft and technical level the film is of the highest quality not least in the sound department where the mix is exceedingly complex and expressive
844435 put simply they are brilliant i can highly recommend using these eqs on guitars keyboards and vocals if you find that 10 db is not enough do what they did back then use two of them
844436 i dont expect you to understand about the immorality of birth control when you dont even recognize the immorality of pre marital sex
844437 women are less likely to work at a full time job outside the home
844438 just because i am not a believer myself doesnt mean i dont respect and accept those who are
844439 mommy why do we only see daddy on weekends i know kids whose daddies live with them and tuck them in every night why dont i have that
844440 because mommy wanted to have sex more than she cared about you and your future
844441 the downside is it is expensive weve sacrificed a lot we never drove fancy cars or took the expensive vacations or anything we dont have the plasma tv where we chose to put our resources was into our kids
844442 thank god men and jesus are around to protect us
844443 is an attack at stay at home moms she called them worthless poor weak little ladies with no authority besides the kitchen and baby factories thats a scathing attack if i ever heard one
844444 thank god men and jesus are around to protect us poor weak little ladies from having to think or have some authority outside our kitchens or having any value besides spitting out babies
844445 up until the mid sixties the question of the beginning of pregnancy wasnt a subject of serious debate it was well accepted based upon sound science that that conception occurred at fertilization that is the union of sperm and egg
844446 all the measures which impair the viability of the zygote newly created human at any time between the instant of fertilization union of sperm and egg and the completion of labor constitute in the strict sense procedures for inducing abortion
844447 the big bang concept of children babies coming into being the instant a sperm penetrates an ovum is ludicrous
844448 almost all higher animals start their lives from a single cell the fertilized ovum zygote the time of fertilization represents the starting point in the life history or ontogeny of the individual
844449 the development of a human being begins with fertilization a process by which two highly specialized cells the spermatozoon from the male and the oocyte from the female unite to give rise to a new organism the zygote
844450 zygote this cell formed by the union of an ovum and a sperm gr zygtos yoked together represents the beginning of a human being
844451 although human life is a continuous process fertilization is a critical landmark because under ordinary circumstances a new genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed the combination of 23 chromosomes present in each pronucleus results in 46 chromosomes in the zygote thus the diploid number is restored and the embryonic genome is formed the embryo now exists as a genetic unity
844452 the term conception refers to the union of the male and female pronuclear elements of procreation from which a new living being develops it is synonymous with the terms fecundation impregnation and fertilization the zygote thus formed represents the beginning of a new life
844453 fertilization is a sequence of events that begins with the contact of a sperm spermatozoon with a secondary oocyte ovum and ends with the fusion of their pronuclei the haploid nuclei of the sperm and ovum and the mingling of their chromosomes to form a new cell this fertilized ovum known as a zygote is a large diploid cell that is the beginning or primordium of a human being
844454 embryo an organism in the earliest stage of development in a man from the time of conception to the end of the second month in the uterus
844455 every time a sperm cell and ovum unite a new being is created which is alive and will continue to live unless its death is brought about by some specific condition
844456 embryo the developing individual between the union of the germ cells and the completion of the organs which characterize its body when it becomes a separate organism at the moment the sperm cell of the human male meets the ovum of the female and the union results in a fertilized ovum zygote a new life has begun the term embryo covers the several stages of early development from conception to the ninth or tenth week of life
844457 there has been around 100 million tonnes of cereals moving from human consumption to energy production with other factors this has an impact on the world supply of cereal
844458 we need to have a debate on such issues in a neutral forum and to try to arrive at an international framework
844459 on the supply side we have the impact of climate change drought flood serious problems with hurricanes and winter blizzards in places such as china this is a trend which is expected to continue
844460 on the demand side the world population is increasing by 78 5 million every year
844461 with irrigated agriculture you can double or triple your production
844462 we still have some legal issues to resolve and in due course after sentencing we will be lodging an appeal

844469 it was a crapshoot every night and an adjustment every game
844470 one game in a north american sized rink the next game on an olympic sized venue not easy
844471 i played in johnstown two years rebecca is from here and it seems like a perfect fit

844476 they couldnt match up with us we beat ourselves again
844477 the defense made a 180 degree turn from last week and our special teams just was not on point and it cost us the game
844478 we dug out of it last year but we really didnt want to do it again this year
844479 weve got to regroup we need a home win if for no other reason than to keep fans coming to our games
844480 weve probably been playing these type of tournaments for 20 or 25 years and this is the first time weve ever won together
844481 it was three great days of golf and the winners were very deserving
844482 saturday was a real solid round i hit almost every green in regulation and didnt make many mistakes
844483 sunday i was all over the map i think i made six birdies a double and five bogeys
844484 we wanted to give everybody an opportunity if you cant win the gross to win the net
844485 its to get more club members to participate thats what its all about
844486 i was on the free agent market just one minute before they called
844487 it didnt take very long for them to make me feel really wanted and for me to realize that they were the right fit for me
844488 arrowhead stadium in kansas city is the loudest place ive ever played but i think ralph wilson stadium is the craziest place ive played
844489 i just love it its almost like a college atmosphere that definitely was another factor in making me feel that this was the right place for me
844490 we thought before that he could be a good mike backer middle linebacker but last year proved that he was even more valuable on the outside
844491 that game he had against us told us that he was what we thought he was plus some
844492 he brings a physical and mental toughness to our defense and hes a smart football player
844493 weve enjoyed having him not only on the field but in the classroom he gives our young corps of linebackers some expertise because hes been there and done that and has the hardware to prove it
844494 the sky was filled with the confetti being tossed from the buildings
844495 they said there were three million people there it was crazy
844496 it was good seeing the guys i had shared a championship with
844497 a lot of them said they missed me but they understand that football is a business and i had to do what was best for my family
844498 more and more economists seem to think that this recession were in is going to be a long and painful one
844499 how long it lasts depends on the credit situation were in the hands of the banks

844501 my clients intended to sell rights for the first photographs of knox and vivenne to people magazine for 14 million with hello magazine getting international rights for an extra 5 million
844502 but they didnt notice that the contract technically said they were selling the twins into paparazzi slavery with people getting legal custody of them both
844503 the democrats have nominated a man who is a mere fad or meme win or lose they will have a horrible case of buyers remorse
844504 if this man should fall who will pick up this flag
844505 who cares how you got there steff what matters is what you do now that you are there hell most people are too worried about what everybody else is thinking about them to worry about you so just show up and act like you know what you are doing and no one will know the difference

844508 as people drink less beer than they used to they also look for better more flavoured beers people are turning back to ales now
844509 in a year that saw the british beer market suffer such hefty decline fullers actually grew its volume last year
844510 we are seeing a resurgence of english ales and english cask ales because people are looking for more personality and character in their beer
844511 people were enamoured of this new beer style that was sold in flashy cans it was served colder you never had a bad pint but you never had a good pint so people flocked to it
844512 and maybe women saw it as more glamorous than a pint of real ale
844513 sales are falling because four global breweries have more than 80 percent of the uk beer market and all they seem to produce these days are global beer brands that youll find anywhere in the world so its very boring
844514 the only breweries that seem to be brewing more beer now than before that are seeing their sales rise are the smallest breweries
844515 there are 600 microbreweries in the uk and 35 family brewers this sector of the market is very active

844542 january 9 2008 w h o estimates deaths the world health organization publishes a study estimating the number of iraqi civilian deaths from the start of the war through june 2006 as between 104 000 and 223 000 it estimated that the actual total was 151 000
844543 about 600 000 iraqi civilian dead between the wars start in march 2003 and july 2006
844544 worst sectarian killings during the latter half of 2006 and the first eight months of 2007

844547 an associated press poll in february 2 24 07 that asked americans how many iraqis have died received a median response of less than 10 000
844548 while i think on the whole charlie and george did an admirable job i believe the most substantive part of the debate occurred after the cameras were turned off
844549 ive decided to release this transcript to make clear abcs commitment to excellence in journalism were confident youll agree that the questions asked in these remaining minutes address substantive issues that are of the utmost concern to pennsylvanians and every american

844554 he texted me immediately imho you still rock then he called me directly on his cell needless to say i was pretty flattered
844555 i wish mark all the best he worked his heart out for us and im sure hell do the same for satan who full disclosure counseled me on my decision in 2006 to vote against banning cluster bombs in civilian areas that wasnt easy my gut said i have to vote for this contrary to what samantha power thinks im not a monster but the devil made clear it wasnt worth jeopardizing my copious financial support from the defense industry and that turned out to be a prudent choice
844556 for example most people today have no idea i started my career as an angel
844557 but whoopi thats only one side of the story not a balanced view i think working with mark will help people see the real me
844558 you know im so much more than the scary guy with the pitchfork and the horns spreading war and pestilence i have feelings too i shed a tear when suharto passed away i enjoy gardening in my downtime catching the latest american idol inciting suicidal ideation like regular people i also get a little acid reflux if i snack too late and puppies almost make me smile
844559 though john mccain does agree with president bush on the necessity of the war in iraq and staying there to get the job done seeking to overturn roe v wade immunity for telecom companies illegal wiretapping not speaking with our enemies offshore drilling limiting legal rights of detainees targeting iran for attack school vouchers banning same sex marriages opposing increased education benefits for veterans making current tax cuts permanent the economy healthcare expanding genetically modified food production and eliminating habeas corpus or that he voted 95 of the time with the president in 2007 and 100 of the time in 2008 senator mccain differs greatly with president bush on a wide variety of issues
844560 we were all very excited about pennsylvania another big night for the best political team on television but the truth is
844561 viewers only saw john with his map on camera off camera he didnt leave her side john didnt step away for refreshments the entire evening not even for a skittle
844562 later that night long after pennsylvania had been called for clinton and most of us had already gone home one of our producers brought a krispy kreme over to john she found him with his pants around his ankles and his hand on florida i wont get into what was resting on new jersey
844563 i pleaded with her find a jewish man these goyim with all their facocta gadgets i warned her something like this would happen relations with a map this is a man he may have already converted but you know what you can have him back
844564 good evening we have much to cover tonight the death toll in myanmar grows the price of gas keeps rising and more troops were killed today in iraq but first a truly shocking story about a newsman his map and the unpredictability of the human heart to help us sort through the details is our own nbc news special correspondent tom brokaw tom tell me in all your years in the news business have you ever seen something like this john king affair
844565 i guess the closest example i can think of would be the 1982 rumor of roger mudds affair with a rather fetching filing cabinet but roger and his wife emma jeanne weathered that storm and to this day he denies those allegations
844566 i wish john king all the best ill cherish the moments we shared you know sometimes a girl meets her prince and lives happily ever after and sometimes that prince turns out to be f ing
844567 ill admit i almost played a few holes that day brit hume but president bush no no i didnt i told the american people i dont waver in other words im not a waverer no i went mountain biking instead that day i made a promise to our courageous soldiers a botched tivo job wasnt going to cause me to break that sacred oath to them and the american people brit hume truly inspiring mr president positively churchillian president bush i should also mention golf wasnt the only sacrifice i made in honor of our troops and their families another thing i gave up during this difficult time was lollipops im a big fan of lollipops but you can imagine a president in a time of war walking around with a stick hanging out of his mouth well i didnt think it sent the right signal either also that candy bit o honey its taffy like but nutty with just a touch of honey but its a little too chewy during wartime you know what i mean
844568 more than 20 percent of black voters do not have access to a valid photo id
844569 about 50 of the liberals say the media is unbiased
844570 the price of a barrel of oil name your price three hundred four hundred dollars a barrel
844571 that could be the shock from such a military action
844572 whatever issues people had with tim russerts political coverage during the george w
844573 i dont know where bob schieffers been these last seven years but he thinks that the white house might have an credibility problem
844574 if the pentagons decision to allow reporters to embed with troops
844575 hes a great guy that doesnt mean i agree with him
844576 the yankees opened the season there there were 55 000 people in the stands
844577 look its been a very divisive primary season between barack and hillary i thought my support would aid the healing process and help unify the democrats
844578 im actually registered with the green party but no amount of faith and prayer will get their candidate elected
844579 you dont have to be the son of god to prophecy mccain wants to carry out bushs third term
844580 incidentally maybe one of you guys can tell david brooks there isnt a salad bar at applebees schmuck
844581 well im certainly not perfect and i wont be a perfect president
844582 youre not the second coming barack and though shes right i am proud and honored to tell you today that jesus is by my side in this campaign for the white house and im not speaking figuratively arlington ladies and gentlemen all the way from the celestial realm the prince of peace the mack daddy of nazareth the original change agent you know him you love him many of yall even pray to him lets give it up for je suuuuuuus christ
844583 of course were thrilled to have the support of jesus
844584 and he would certainly make anyones vice presidential shortlist but weve promised not to say anymore on the subject until we announce baracks running mate
844585 we know jesus is a very recognizable brand but he has no prior campaign experience so the jurys still out on his impact how is christ on the stump he may be a skilled shepherd but does he have that fire in the belly for the rough and tumble of campaigning as my father used to say brit just because you can turn water into wine it doesnt mean you can build a birdhouse
844586 well for one thing obama doesnt have to worry about finding a new church to join until after the fall campaign what will be really troublesome for mccain and the gop though is they cant have it both ways the cant question obamas faith in jesus christ while the son of god is literally riding shotgun on the yes we can express
844587 in the end wolf this may turn out to hurt the illinois senator more than it helps him we know barack obama is already vulnerable on national security so im not sure how having the blessing of a guy who coined the phrase turn the other cheek is only going to help him
844588 and you can bet that republicans will be combing through jesus past sermons which include just for starters not only extreme preaching of non violence but also impassioned instruction to and im quoting matthew 5 44 wolf love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you now in the middle of the war on terror its hard to see how mccain wont hammer obama on this
844589 look we all know that jesus means well he always has and thats who he is fine but here in the no spin zone we also cant ignore the facts and the truth is this guy was a radical going back to his original days on earth a hippie and an anarchist who couldnt hold down a job jesus christ again a fine lord and savior i give him full credit for that but this guy single handedly created the welfare state and hes the prince of appeasement trust me neville chamberlain aint got nothing on jesus
844590 thats uh just not the jesus i know its really heart breaking in other words i was once born again okay and uh now im feeling a little unborn
844591 well its puzzling and sad this is not the jesus we know
844592 and frankly his actions are not consistent with the guidance hes given us these past seven and a half years in the white house invade iraq tap your phones tortures fine dont listen to the american people or the rest of the world so now after all this time hes suddenly not george bushs personal jesus im not buying it and neither should you i think hes done grave damage to his credibility in the mind of most americans
844593 every time i see that blinky eye flutter i cant help but think helter skelter
844594 he is bush on steroids with a prostate the size of texas
844595 hes dr strangelove without the german accent and advanced degrees
844596 all they that take the sword shall perish by the sword
844597 the fact is there are many things we dont know about jesus things were supposed to take on nothing but faith
844598 we do know however that he came to the aid of prostitutes drug addicts and beggars the worst of society and that he healed leapers the blind epileptics a paralytic a man with dropsy cast out demons entering a herd of swine and raised lazarus from the dead all well and good until you consider he had no degree in medicine and no professional training which really calls into question his judgment i call on senator obama to denounce jesus immediately
844599 the tiger woods injury story was of major importance and we felt we needed to devote time to it as the lead tiger is arguably one of the worlds premiere athletes and his career is in some jeopardy with tiger halting playing the sport for the year it was certainly the most talked about story of the day and the biggest story in most national newspapers our story contained implications for sports millions of fans and many aspects of business which have by and large been revolutionized by the tiger woods phenomenon
844600 tell me the last time you saw the body of a dead american soldier what does that look like who in american knows what that looks like because i know what that looks like and i feel responsible for the fact that no one else does and the soldiers do feel forgotten they do no doubt from afghanistan to iraq they absolutely feel you know we may be tired of hearing about this five years later they still have to go out and do the same job
844601 deadly hawks come in many styles some have polished talons
844602 some of the worlds great thinkers and doers people like former british prime minister tony blair
844603 seldom in my life have i met a dumber man
844604 the state departments future of iraq project an effort that accurately predicted some contingencies that the pentagon overlooked was dismissed by feith and company out of hand said
844605 the main rationale for invading iraq was not based on intelligence
844606 i am talking about myself in the following sense expertise is a very good thing but it is not the same thing as sound judgment regarding strategy and policy george w bush has more insight because of his knowledge of human beings and his sense of history about the motive force the craving for freedom and participation in self rule than do many of the language experts and history experts and culture experts
844607 the common refrain that the postwar has been a disaster is only true if you had completely unrealistic expectations
844608 if we had mutual trust and real security you wouldnt need these agreements and if you need these agreements then it is an illusion to say that you have mutual trust and security
844609 the surprising thing is not that there are so many jews who are neocons but that there are so many who are not
844610 we certainly understood that these are the things that might happen thats why we wrote them down
844611 the united states could become so absorbed with its iraq effort that we pay inadequate attention to other serious problems the war could cause more harm and entail greater costs than expected obviously it has that it would not go on for two to four years but eight to 10 years terrorist networks could improve their recruiting and fundraising as a result our being depicted as anti muslim iraq could experience ethnic strife among kurds sunnis and shia it could damage our relationship with our allies and our reputation in the world community did you think that one or two of these would happen
844612 one of the things that is reflected in this memo
844613 is secretary rumselds deeply held view that its foolish to try to predict the future
844614 well as it turned out he was pretty good at anticipating problems because virtually all of these things have happened
844615 i was never told that there was going to be a document summarizing our views and i have never seen such a document
844616 a forceful summary of some of the best pro war arguments at the time
844617 mr zakaria was not told that the meeting would produce a report for the bush administration nor did his name appear on the report
844618 a forceful summary of some of the best pro war arguments at the time
844619 freedoms march the president has been right on some big questions now if he can get the little stuff right hell change the world
844620 no our products i think are going to be delicious
844621 all options must be on the table to deal with chinas infiltration of our flag market
844622 if we find that china manufactured and sold us these millions of american flags intentionally and for the purpose of tainting our great country in any way we might have no other option than to bomb these chinese flag production sites and trade routes their business associates and their friends and family
844623 my friends our flag is all we have ill say this to you as plainly as possible if an american flag and a baby were on fire you have my solemn word i wouldnt think of coming to that babys aid until every last ember was extinguished from old glory my friends babies of course come and go but our forefathers fought and died to preserve that flag and
844624 i will not stand by while the chinese sell millions of them to us through their handiwork and our mutual trade deals
844625 if senator obama truly loves our flag if he sees not only stars whenever hes struck in the head but as i do also stripes then he should tell the american people hes willing to attack china if thats what it takes to protect the sanctity of the red white and blue
844626 well its all about the imports currently we still receive the majority of our imports from china everything from baby bottles to shrimp and catfish to breast implants if the chinese government were to suddenly cut off that flow it would be a blow to our already reeling economy you also risk stirring the hatred of chinas 1 4 billion people
844627 but the bottom line would bombing china help us return to a time when u s flags are only made here in america
844628 well i talked to a import export analyst today brian
844629 if you carpet bomb china ninety eight percent maybe even one hundred percent of the flags thereafter will be made in the usa
844630 and thats whats at stake here the result of such a military action could finally bring our flag home thanks richard
844631 joe america must be willing to draw the line somewhere first some belgians try to buy budweiser now we hear the red chinese are making our flags whats next joe hemp baseballs falafel dogs baklava instead of apple pie little american boys and girls selling mango lassi for five cents instead of lemonade
844632 joe the infiltration of these communist made u s flags is our new pearl harbor im against any kind of occupation but americans were completely taken by surprise with this and the chinese should be hit and hit hard if theyve used our trade deals covertly to dupe us into pledging allegiance to a flag made by chinamen
844633 is the american flag barack obamas willie horton now that john mccain has taken the ultimate stand for old glory is senator obama willing to carpet bomb china to protect our countrys flag or will he stumble into the political minefield laid today by a straight shooting john mccain and add another page to the democrats long history of neglecting the stars and stripes tonight on 360
844634 a fiasco but a manageable one if the right steps are taken
844635 we would all do well to remember the chinese are human beings just like us
844636 therefore a free flowing market is also in their blood but the hidden hand of the market never works without the hidden fist so do we strike china the key word is
844637 with wednesdays quinnipiac university poll showing senator obama leading in pennsylvania ohio and florida weve redoubled our efforts regarding terror attacks here at home from mere wishful thinking to targeted planning
844638 just to be clear youre not suggesting youre involved in orchestrating attacks on these states
844639 no im not suggesting that matt im telling you flat out pennsylvania ohio and florida can expect to be hit by the mccain campaign sometime between now and election day we are taking this fight to barack obama and the american people if senator obama is really tough on terror then lets see if he can match our upcoming scheduled spectaculars personally i dont think the anti war senator from illinois has it in him
844640 charlie thanks for stopping by i look forward to the barbecue this weekend
844641 you know wolf while some might chafe at the unvarnished quality of what charlie black said it is true to the mccain campaigns straight talk on tough issues
844642 should a presidential candidates campaign carry out such attacks on american citizens wouldnt these attacks be against the law
844643 well wolf i think thats up to the american people to decide if this is the right thing for the mccain camp to do but i think many will admire the candor of charlie black here and by disclosing their plans for attack now black and the mccain team will in the long run save untold lives in ohio florida and pennsylvania people who otherwise would spend the day voting for their next president will remain home and safe from attack
844644 candi crowley part of the best political team on television that is a good point
844645 as to whether or not such terrorist attacks in this context are against the law wolf were really in uncharted territory here we saw the first major divergence from presidential campaign rules when barack obama recently opted out of public financing which many considered a major flip flop john mccains team is now throwing an elbow of its own with these scheduled spectaculars in key battleground states but charlie black shrewdly showed how they intend to be tough while keeping the shine on their straight shooting brand
844646 against the law ill leave that to legal scholars but its certainly good politics
844647 look im not going to get all caught up in this daily game of gotcha are the gloves off sure theyre off we have a campaign to win but i cant discuss specific strategies such as the exact locations of our targets in ohio florida and pennsylvania the only thing i can tell you is that it will not be another vietnam we will hit these battleground states will everything we have defeat is not an option
844648 black and mccain are old school in the best sense of such plebeian argot
844649 how does he always look so well groomed is casey affleck a better actor than his older brother ben
844650 you know matt the guy we all knew seemed completely willing to disseminate lies about a war of choice that would lead to the senseless deaths of over one million iraqis and 4 000 plus american soldiers in other words we knew him as a loyal soft spoken and honorable man scott led us to believe that he like us was little more than a soulless husk of a human being a ruthless unethical democracy killing zombie sadly thats apparently not the case
844651 yes im saying he was not the doughy faced goebbels comfortable with seeing his country irrevocably slip into the grip of murderous fascists that he presented himself to be
844652 and i think its incredibly dishonorable for scott to do this now he couldve at least waited until president bush left office but
844653 i guess that vestige of decency is gone im heart broken it makes me wonder if scott ever believed the propaganda he said from the podium
844654 could you imagine he would write such a scathing portrayal of this white house
844655 i mean before you continue did i mention what an incredibly scathing indictment this is
844656 truly puts the s in scathing dont you think im tempted dan to do a quick scat call about how scathing this book is but since im part of the best political team on television and not an improvisational jazz singer lets stay on topic
844657 sure campbell id first like to point out that innocent people suffer greatly when false allegations are made without hard evidence words like propaganda used with such reckless disregard for the consequences and truth put the american people in grave danger and you know
844658 he forced this book on us we had no say in the matter no input into the process and maybe thats why the book is so fundamentally wrong i would never portray anything in which ive participated campbell as a propaganda effort i mean hello that kind of defeats the whole purpose of participating in such activities doesnt it
844659 dan i know you and scott were pretty close are you still friends
844660 campbell if by friend you mean someone whom ive dedicated myself along with other honorable patriots to portraying as a disgruntled lying schizophrenic out of the loop mental patient then yes of course he is still a friend that hasnt changed
844661 the record on weapons of mass destruction appeared to be very clear theres no denying that saddam hussein was a threat and we took the responsible action we believed we couldnt afford the smoking gun to come in the form of a mushroom cloud our only mistake
844662 was not realizing another mushroom cloud might take the form of scott mcclellan and for that many of us in the white house myself included will have to take responsibility
844663 you know i dont think about scott so much im not so concerned with him there are much greater threats to our country right now um you know hes just a threat but i dont think hes the threat and as president i think its my job to keep my eye on the biggest threats to our country so im truly not that concerned about him i know he is on the run
844664 look when the uh levees of honor are breached thats when once good men think forget the truth im looking for a big payday in other words greed takes precedence over any catastrophic effect on peoples lives and well scott mcclellan is going to have to live with that what the american people should know is that were working closely with other governments to deny scott sanctuary or training or a place to hide or another place to raise money
844665 ive found no measurable proof that mcclellan ever served as press secretary in the bush administration therefore all of mr mcclellans accusations are based on the flimsiest of empirical evidence and seem to be supported wholly for partisan reasons once again alarmists are attempting to use the illusory power of truth to misinform the american people im not sure what could be more un american than that
844666 once again alarmists are attempting to use the illusory power of truth to misinform the american people im not sure what could be more un american than that
844667 theres a bus to cincinnati leaving in two hours be under it
844668 and i think its incredibly dishonorable for scott to do this now he couldve at least waited until president bush left office but
844669 i guess that vestige of decency is gone im heart broken it makes me wonder if scott ever believed the propaganda he said from the podium
844670 but i really do think its a strange time because were all watching to see who won but as nora pointed out 4 out of 5 or so of the hillary voters today believe shes still in the running that this is still up in the air and i think that was probably a mistake of the media i think in the effort of the media to try to keep this game going weve created the delusion that somehow this race is still open i dont think it is open i think if you look at the numbers barack has to really blow it in the weeks ahead to lose
844671 it now appears like its going to be impossible for obama to lose his lead
844672 dude if we could do that we wouldve done it a long long time ago we wouldve saved a lot of money
844673 our failure to please the fuhrer has led directly to this point in history where a schwartze might be president homosexuals can marry in california and bagels are more commonplace than f ing wonder bread
844674 you see chris like i said yesterday obama is an appeaser
844675 just tell me whose ghost is floating above the white house right now
844676 look chris an appeaser appeases those who make use of appeasement which leaves us vulnerable to another 9 11 style attack
844677 ive asked you a simple question who is hovering sixty feet above our white house sir
844678 listen you mutant just answer the question you dont know do you
844679 wow wow you really just lucked into that didnt you just stepped right in it
844680 first let me start by saying that though some candidates think the afterworld revolves around them the appearance of prescotts ghost over the white house has nothing to do with president bushs speech in the knesset yesterday
844681 quoted an indiana man saying obama is a muslim without noting the assertion is false
844682 obama has never been a muslim but bogus e mails accuse him of being a muslim who put his hand on a copy of the quran to be sworn into the u s senate and refusing to say the pledge of allegiance
844683 hes a muslim hes not even pro american as far as im concerned
844684 i cant stand him hes a muslim hes not even pro american as far as im concerned
844685 hes a muslim hes not even pro american as far as im concerned
844686 to rove or go about stealthily as in search of prey something to steal etc
844687 i heard that obama is a muslim and his wifes an atheist
844688 well heres some straight talk for you i think sadrists like jon stewart and stephen colbert have been waging a war on our troops for years and its about time my friends that we face this reality and confront them head on
844689 uh senator i dont think stewart and colbert are the sadrists i was referring to
844690 well maybe not but theyre two of the most popular out there ratings are high kids love em heres some more straight talk ive been on jons show but ill admit i was wrong to do it and i hope my democratic opponents will have the courage to denounce their associations with him too the point is anyone with military chops knows the best strategy for victory is to cut the snake off at the head my friends its time we take these jokers out
844691 look i dont come to your office at the times elbow my way threw that third world newsroom of marxist homosexual terrorists and stand over your desk telling you how to type so please please my friend dont tell me how to win a war
844692 this is further proof that senator john mccain has what it takes to lead this country a limited yet firm grip of the facts a tenuous hold on reality and bunyanesque balls of stainless steel senator mccain if posing as your patsy to win this war is wrong then i dont want to be right hand me a crave case of white castles and an elephant tranquilizer gun and ill take down michael moore for you sir
844693 huh is it hot in here or is it me
844694 well i uh thats very interesting youll have to excuse me i i seem to remember i i have a plane to catch to peru
844695 so now we know what to expect george w bush averted attention away from al qaeda and afghanistan to attack iraq and john mccain wants to avert attention away from the sadrists to attack the satirists you know chris if terry southern and stanley kubrick were alive today they wouldnt need a script
844696 look what we have here is a case of turning lemons into lemonade did mccain confuse sadrists and satirists maybe he did maybe he didnt but whatever happened he brought attention to a growing problem homegrown insurgents like stewart and colbert who are doing our troops a grave disservice im with mccain i say take em out
844697 satirists sen mccain not sadrists humorists in america not followers of a cleric in iraq sat ir ists
844698 you owe it to your democracy to know as much as you can about whats going on
844699 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist we must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes we should take nothing for granted only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that security and liberty may prosper together
844700 at no time did our analysts on my watch or to my knowledge attempt to push a rosy pentagon agenda before our viewers i think they are better men than that and i believe our news division is better than that
844701 you owe it to your democracy to know as much as you can about whats going on
844702 there are a whole bunch named and unnamed war analysts who really did carry the water but the 20 people named were not all shown by the times to have been biased
844703 the president acted with political and moral courage to strike down saddam while we had the window of opportunity our counterterrorist deterrent posture has been enormously strengthened the question is whether we have the political will to carry out the required political economic and security operations in both afghanistan in the next 36 months now is the time for resolute leadership
844704 i dont know whether to kill myself or go bowling
844705 a time comes when silence is betrayal and bowling is the only path to right a nations wrongs
844706 i am extremely proud of this book its like disney on crack so get ready
844707 his photos artistically question the very notions we all have of masculinity sexuality glam and sardonic humor
844708 captivating presentations of rugged men openly engaging in bondage on urban sidewalks and muscular hunky athletes surrounded by lush landscapes through his lens oppedisano shoves open a new door with uncensored and proudly challenges audiences both new and old with another level of artistic vision only previously imagined
844709 creating uncensored was an extremely personal intimate mind expanding and learning experience for me
844710 testosterone was great because it got people from places around the world to see the kind of work i did uncensored takes everything from testosterone and amps it up 150 its personal work not editorial so i did whatever i wanted and had no one directing me i want the reader to open up the first page as if hes getting on a roller coaster for a ride when the roller coaster goes up your stomach starts to get into knots when you see the top of that first hill youre about to drop down on its all over
844711 tremendously excited to be given the opportunity to release uncensored as our first published book through the provocateur brand
844712 i saw this picture and knew it had to be yours
844713 4 he is considered a pioneer of this style along with contemporaries john tavener though his fame initially rested on instrumental works such as choral works have also come to be widely appreciated
844714 he just seemed to shake his sleeves and notes would fall out
844715 in all honesty even with his comments and behavior over the last couple weeks this is still really difficult to talk about
844716 i should go to green bay straight up and they should send brett favre to boston that will end two soap operas at the same time
844717 a relationship is like a shark it has to keep moving forward or it dies i think what we have on our hands here is a dead shark
844718 dont worry kyle farnsworth will come in in the eighth and screw everything up for the yankees no problem
844719 if they dont have this shit in heaven i dont want to go there
844720 hanley ramirez if you dont know is one of the games brightest and best young stars
844721 rarely does he make himself look foolish going after a pitchers pitch
844722 if you put joe buck and peyton manning next to each other you would get like a solid foot of forehead
844723 he does not want to run in to the teeth of cinco ocho
844724 terry francona is the biggest reason why this story is such a huge controversy that it threatens to overshadow the all star game ever notice how passive aggressively snarky he is im not a big fan
844725 speaking as the biggest orioles fan you could ever have the misfortune to meet i have no desire to see george sherrill pitch in this game
844726 sometimes i forget what smart mofo tito is sherrill can pretty much only perform with men on base in the most desperate situation well played tito well played
844727 i vote that should count as a home run on account of the fact that i want to go to bed
844728 dan ugglas gonna go home tonight and cry so many tears
844729 id rather be on my way home to bed than sitting here watching the bullpen blow this one
844730 drew might have been a little more of an mvp if we went a couple more innings
844731 he might have pitched hes been begging me a long time to pitch and we almost got close but we were still a ways away from that
844732 but hes not even the al saves leader this year being given the top closer spot was more of a concession to his past performances than a statement about where he is this particular season
844733 hey lets go out this weekend for a few drinks
844734 friends to talk about this and they got anniliated i went to the bar to warn her cano was coming down there and as all the girls had been ignoring him for their own reasons i though it would be a nice thing to do
844735 they are all my friends we havent said anything about you at all until you showed up to check on me
844736 i cant love someone who would even think those things about me
844737 you were exectly what she was looking for when she found you
844738 but in time things changed kids bills homes attitudes future plans and when her plans changed you just werent what she wanted anymore
844739 at himself after the fourth inning seemed to help and mikey lowell rode to the rescue with a three run homer off darrell rasner who in the fifth inning
844740 while youre getting wood for a washed out has been and general club house cancah weve got a guy like charlie zink in aaa who is ready to step into a majah league rotation right now but weve already got a knuckballah stahting

844743 you took four days off without letting us know nor did you call in so i have no choice but to let you go
844744 you know i asked for the time off which you approved cindy i even penciled the time on the calendar myself
844745 i see nothing on the calendar where you asked for time off
844746 place the original calendar back on the wall and you will see in my own hand writing the days i requested off
844747 your letting me go because i went to idaho with my family to scatter my dads ashes
844748 he knew nothing of the sort but what i do know is you took too many days off without calling in
844749 whats up with removing the old calendar what the calendar was evidence my only proof that i was given permission to take this time off its obvious your asking the staff to lie for you silence
844750 jeff i had nothing to do with this i just wanted you to know that im sorry this happened she said i know you youll be back on your feet in no time
844751 id be on the road several weeks through out the year job
844752 let me get this straight you are going to charge you

844758 makes it significantly more likely that one of the many islamist terror plots will succeed
844759 could help fend off any preemptive strikes against its nuclear facilities
844760 unfortunately mr blair has had to postpone his visit to gaza due to a specific security threat which would have made it impossible to proceed
844761 the story of security threats was only an israeli invention to prevent the visit
844762 the shin bet investigation had focused on taher who had turned toward radical islam in recent years the shin bet concluded that he had contacted al qaida through the internet and agreed to participate in terrorist activities inside israel offering details on the location of israel defense forces camps strategic installations and crowded public places that could be targeted
844763 were old and had been deactivated and there was no actual security breach
844764 our political establishment is doing what it now habitually does namely ensuring that the political and corporate elite who break our laws on purpose are immune from consequences
844765 tell me your friends and ill tell you who you are
844766 the canadians have begun preparations for the 2010 winter olympics the trade delegation has been in contact with the person responsible for security arrangements in the organizing committee of the 2010 winter olympics with the help of the export institute a presentation will be prepared which will include details of israeli companies capable of supplying products or services for olympic security
844767 with the power out for more than 24 hours most alarm systems batteries would be run dry that gives csis the perfect opportunity to set up their next terrorist attack against non conservative leaning canadians

844772 electronics holiday preview show in new york a few weeks ago
844773 its a global sport now its very competitive its not easy out there
844774 we rightfully should have somebody atop the game and i think we still have some opportunities for that with the generation that were in plus the younger ones coming up
844775 we have to get to the grass roots though we have to get out here on the courts with these young ones and you have to get them interested in the game
844776 as the national governing body of tennis its our responsibility to do this and in the past we pretty much deferred to the coaching community
844777 now the usta is saying we need to take more accountability and responsibility ourselves and we need to increase the resources that were putting toward that
844778 by offering this i think itll give kids a much better chance
844779 i think with this new breed of player around i think its about the stroke production
844780 how do you teach a player to hit a forehand like federer i dont know do we have any coaches that can do that i think its just one of those things
844781 nadal he has an unorthodox game and hes able to pull it off
844782 there are a lot of slams that roddick wouldve won had federer not been there
844783 sometimes its just unfortunate roddick is a talent he deserves to be out there at the top of the game its been a tough year for him

844791 as a team you watch film on sunday and then you kind of the let the game go
844792 but then i guess going through film in the summer time you kind of realize again just how many stupid little plays here and there could have changed the outcome its really a game of a few plays
844793 what weve got to do is understand that its a 60 minute game and weve got to finish opponents
844794 our kids competed extremely hard last season but we werent good enough to win in the fourth quarter
844795 being able to seize the moment and excel on those plays thats whats going to determine if you win or lose

844803 hanura banyak belajar dari kesalahan golkar dalam menerapkan strategi politiknya oleh karena itu yang merasa tidak puas dengan golkar silakan pindah ke hanura siapapun asal punya komitmen bersama membangun bangsa kalau yang busuk busuk no way
844804 mereka bahkan banyak yang menyatakan siap menjadi caleg cadangan bila ada yang mengundurkan diri sedianya 10 agustus nanti daftar calon tetap hanura sudah selesai

844809 we will not get anywhere near the amount of storms that we did in 2005 but the intensity of the storms we do get will be of major concern
844810 last year the northeast may have dodged a bullet but unfortunately you can only be lucky for so long we are in a pattern similar to that of the late 1930s through the 1940s when the northeast was hit by two major storms
844811 there is now such creativity of new and very sophisticated financial instruments that we dont know fully where the risks are located
844812 we are trying to understand what is going on but it is a big big challenge
844813 to me the us is in a recession i know that if the us is not in a recession we will be in a recession within a year the housing sector is in worse than in a recession the automobile sector is worse than in a recession the subprime financial sector is worse than in recession and i know that before the year is over we will be in a recession i know the yield curve is inverted were overdue for a recession not the end of the world i see a normal cyclical recession
844814 you cant believe how bad its going to get before it gets any better
844815 its going to be a disaster for many people who dont have a clue about what happens when a real estate bubble pops
844816 real estate prices will go down 40 50 percent in bubble areas there will be massive defaults this time itll be worse because we havent had this kind of speculative buying in u s history
844817 when markets turn from bubble to reality a lot of people get burned
844818 any ancient deeply rooted autonomous culture especially if it is spread on a wide part of the earths surface constitutes an autonomous world full of riddles and surprises to western thinking
844819 for one thousand years russia has belonged to such a category
844820 a great writer is so to speak a secret government in his country
844821 a man sprouts a tumor and dies how then can a country live that has sprouted camps and exile

844823 the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of russian literature
844824 not only was i convinced that i should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime but also i scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything i had written because i feared that this would become known

844842 i see areas where economic development needs to be expanded one way i think we can do that is with more work force training available to more people
844843 one expects that its status as a sport that people participate in themselves would become more viable
844844 after watching all that stuff on tv its an opportunity for them to live their dream
844845 what prompted me to open a business is having so many people say i really want to learn
844846 i have doctors lawyers i have police officers teenagers i have a lady in her 60s whos been with me for three years now
844847 most professionals i deal with especially in law are competitive and they seek an outlet for that
844848 ive seen it growing a lot within the last couple of years
844849 in fact i was telling my husband i wouldnt be surprised if it was an olympic sport in 10 years
844850 to have an art form where human beings are hitting each other hard in a controlled fight is at the very most basic level a little disturbing
844851 i suppose when you get right down to it a lot of sports clearly reflect a way in which were playing out a lot of our violent tendencies
844852 in some ways theyre a way to control violent impulses
844853 for this sport to really have a chance of making its way into the central parts of the culture like football and soccer and nascar have it needed to be in many ways spruced up

844860 we need more storage in the basin and ill continue to work on that
844861 id like to emphasize residential burglary cases and get tougher on crimes that affect the average citizen
844862 i will work with law enforcement to help get those cases developed so they are better presented to a jury
844863 these are the people we need to take a look at and distribute cases with an eye to focus on getting those people convicted
844864 a lot of the crime we see is committed by a small handful of people who come back into the system
844865 this is not a novel to be tossed lightly aside it should be thrown with great force
844866 a textbook example of how not to make a horror film
844867 the fog also does something genuinely eerie it causes everyone in the cast to deliver dreadful performances and display inappropriate reactions when their friends are drowned burned stabbed or thrown into glass display cases

844887 at that meeting the council of the day will be able to make a decision on the best method of construction to implement this program
844888 one of the biggest concerns was the centre median strip
844889 the main reason we have a median strip is to allow pedestrians a refuge area when crossing the street
844890 it also helps protect poles and infrastructure and helps with drainage
844891 council will also alter the street lighting arrangement in stage six with the contribution and assistance of the powerlines relocation committee
844892 what has been important from a traditional owner perspective is the involvement of barengi gadjin aboriginal heritage advisers an aboriginal heritage consultant and gwmwater technical staff in the further evaluation of some sites in the activity area this has also occurred with a gwmwater appointed archaeologist
844893 barengi gadjin believes all information on sites is of benefit to not only the traditional owners but the wider community as well because there is great collective value in having awareness of all heritage in the region
844894 disturbance of sites is really one of the worst scenarios experienced by traditional owners
844895 it can cause great distress of a personal nature because it does affect the spirit and it can generally indicate there has been a breakdown in communication on some level and especially on bigger projects it can impact on how traditional owners feel about development
844896 from a traditional owner perspective we would like to look at ways it can be preserved and we are very open to working with all interested parties in long term protection strategies
844897 thirty four sites have been avoided by realigning the route and 29 sites remain within the pipeline construction area

844901 there will be walking tours through the residences to look at the student accommodation
844902 people will be able to see first hand what we do and there will be a show steer parade in the morning and afternoon
844903 there will also be displays of students work so people can get an insight into what they actually do at the college
844904 people must get their free admission ticket before 3pm at the college
844905 what happens is people become a member of the shop and they pay 10 for a 12 month membership although this has varied over the years
844906 that entitles them to bring their goods into the shop to sell
844907 whatever price they want we add a third to that price and then thats our money
844908 out of that money we pay our rent and our insurance and our book keeping and then we give the rest away
844909 if theres an earthquake or things that happen around the world and there is an appeal we take money and give to those appeals
844910 if we know of any appeal or a family that is in need we like to donate
844911 we just appreciate the customers the horsham and district people who have supported us all those years

845077 early on when we only had three quarterbacks working when david carr was hurt he was getting plenty of snaps but now his snaps have slowed down a little bit its difficult for a young guy to just have a couple of snaps and be able to show exactly what you can do hopefully that will work itself out

845148 most of the students actually make their decision of where theyre going to actually attend by going on a campus tour
845149 thats why i think having good information about the campus and the campus tour go hand in hand
845150 i think its important for students to ask questions about the actual application process a lot of students dont understand exactly how to apply
845151 i encourage students to do a one on one appointment with an admissions counselor
845152 its a great way to get information about what makes the school special or unique

845160 where do people get the time to build to wikipedia

845163 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
845164 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers

845172 if this is your heaven it must be my hell
845173 well im sure if he wanted us to know he would have told us
845174 what are we supposed to do just keep our mouths shut act like we dont know anything
845175 thats what he wants and thats what exactly we are going to do
845176 relevance social responsibility how can you insult him like that
845177 that may be your opinion but he happens to be one of the successful directors in hollywood
845178 dont be naive do you think brad keller is successful because he maintains his artistic integrity
845179 he loves what he does and hes damn good at it
845180 you know i may not be the brilliant uncomprising genius that you are but you know what i think i think it has nothing to do with artistic integrity i think that youre jealous because somebody wants to make a big movie out of our comic book and no one will touch your novel
845181 look you cant turn yourself into a failure to make your relationship a success
845182 hes still pretending that he is alright and i am still pretending like i dont know
845183 its easy for you to say hes not your boyfriend you dont love him
845184 if i lose you i dont know what to do
845185 maybe because i didnt want you to know or maybe
845186 not anymore i dont want you here now get the fuck out
845187 are a bit much as are the elements from the park designer kit of parts amphitheater a fountain jet water slide a signature fountain and children holding balloons but if it works to coax lincolnites out of their homes so be it the project is one of the pillars to a better future
845188 i consider myself somewhat liberal but this this is just another white elephant for the taxpayers to pay for
845189 whats the crime rate in this neighborhood what happens after the day people leave and night falls i question the money and location
845190 maybe we could do some whitewater rafting and snowsking on the slopes
845191 sounds like a good idea but i dont know if id want to walk in that area alone

845195 aids is the most complex the most challenging and probably the most demanding infectious disease humanity has ever had to face
845196 we dare not let down our guard this is an unforgiving epidemic
845197 we are going to be in this for the long haul
845198 its certainly far too early for declaring victory because the end of aids is nowhere in sight
845199 every day almost three times as many people become newly infected with hiv as those who start taking antiretroviral therapy
845200 we must categorically reject any attempt to so called normalise aids or treat this epidemic as just one of many medical problems
845201 now more than ever do we need an exceptional response
845202 the tokyo market faces a tough environment as japanese corporate earnings are taking a turn for the worse and economies at home and abroad are deteriorating
845203 it is caught between a rock and a hard place the fed will stand pat
845204 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
845205 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
845206 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
845207 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
845208 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
845209 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
845210 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
845211 it had to do with the very specific characteristics in the dna of the letters and what was in bruces labs
845212 you can see how for people who were exhausted it would have been nearly impossible for them to descend without the ropes
845213 once their hands and feet are frozen they really are unable to move on their own power and it takes other people to carry them down
845214 its more technical its steeper the weather is more intense
845215 existence is much more than what we perceive with the five senses im captivated by the spaces in between like the passage between life and death which plays continuously in my work
845216 it is far better for man to love his fellow men than to love god it is better to love wife and children than to love christ it is better to serve your neighbor than to serve your god even if god exists the reason is palpable you can do nothing for god you can do something for wife and children you can add to the sunshine of a life you can plant flowers in the pathway of another
845217 people usually fail when they are on the verge of success so pay as much care in the end as in the beginning
845218 its not batman that makes you worthwhile its the other way around never tell yourself anything different
845219 i write regarding crikeys article turning journalists into spooks by melissa sweet i am sure that what she says is entirely true one simple example is of a journalist who goes by the name of harvey grennan working for the
845220 pressure on abc to out their sources should be swift and sustained
845221 the profession and the rest of us are better off if sources know that they run the risk of being unmasked if their mendacity is egregious enough to become newsworthy in its own right
845222 id say that part of ross re reporting ought to include a full explanation of exactly who was peddling the bentonite lie in the first place and why they were doing it
845223 in practice most journalists refuse to identify their sources under any circumstances at all even when its clear that those sources deliberately lied to them
845224 if one of the great attractions of the newspaper was that it brought people together to rub noses how can it compete for readers time with sites like facebook which can also give you a real world news dump if thats what you crave

845284 no he contado con el tiempo suficiente para conocer la identidad que posee esta fundaci n para llevar adelante el proyecto
845285 obliga a extremar cuidados para evitar que las pol ticas sociales del estado municipal corran riesgos
845286 la fundaci n no ha demostrado la idoneidad carecemos de antecedentes que determinen que esta tiene la capacidad suficiente para llevar adelante todos estos programas
845287 todav a debe responder a la justicia por el defalco que sufri la municipalidad durante su gesti n
845288 cuando analizamos esta alternativa cre mos conveniente que el concejo deb a opinar ya que humildemente entendemos que con estas acciones estamos dando continuidad y profundizando pol ticas sociales m s all de los periodos de gesti n y de los partidos pol ticos qu ingenuos fuimos y qu ingenuo fue nuestro intendente
845289 vamos a tener que investigar bastante en los cuerpos legislativos de todo orden para encontrar un antecedente de esta naturaleza un proyecto consensuado que tiene toda la aceptaci n de las partes el hcd lo rechaza y no les deja alternativa de m nima es una actitud destructiva y soberbia
845290 si el proyecto especifico habla de un plazo de 4 o 5 meses por qu no le damos una oportunidad al ejecutivo y las cooperativas se pregunt lamentable y m s a n para los ediles oficialistas
845291 seguramente si el mapa pol tico fuera otro y el intendente de nuestra ciudad fuera luis leissa este proyecto tambi n estar a en el hcd y los ediles de nuevo espacio lo estar an votando

845329 its going to come down to the little things like squares and circles and double triple and so on

845332 my first presentation on using the internet for marketing and the ethical rules that apply was in 1996 i had been looking at the issues before going live with my first website in 1995 much has changed since then but its also been an area of surprising stability until recently currently we are at a time when we see changes in both the rules that apply to internet marketing and other internet usage by lawyers and more significantly changes in the technologies and options lawyers now have to use the internet to communicate and collaborate in a real sense we have to deal with two moving targets
845333 weve reached a point as youll see today where we have a solid understanding of what web 1 0 ethical compliance requires
845334 we also want to move to a point where we can have a strategy and approach that will keep us comfortably in compliance as the internet landscape transitions toward what is often referred to as web 2 0 and beyond
845335 when you leave this session you will have a better sense for the popular new forms of internet technology lawyers and as ill discuss especially solo lawyers are pioneering today the potential benefits of using these technologies the old and new ethical challenges and some useful guidelines directions and action steps for using these technologies in ethically compliant ways
845336 4 is a battle royale between showcase 4 and caps return in avengers 4 id plump for barry allens first appearance myself but the avengers comic is a great issue its amazing how much plot lee and kirby can get into 22 pages without it feeling cramped should be interesting to see what brian chooses
845337 its more to do with the fact that every appearance ever since then its all he or anyone else can talk about in the comics themselves its defined his character ever since which is to say pretty much destroyed it
845338 in the mid 80s i was the manager of the silver snail comic shop
845339 what but it only took you thirty seconds to do that
845340 no it took me thirty years to learn to do that
845341 in the mid 80s i was the manager of the silver snail comic shop

845345 we just moved its by the store on the corner
845346 we are pleased that the top wcm vendors continue to adopt editlive
845347 editlive has become the tool of choice for the vast majority of wcm users and we expect this will create further momentum for ephox in the market
845348 the need for creating professional quality websites without using it is much more important now than it has ever been
845349 editlive 6 4 is another milestone in our long term vision of enabling business authors to create high quality websites quickly
845350 i like how the shirt is light yellow if it were bright yellow i would find it uncomfortable
845351 the way i see it i have a choice i can either choose to embrace what i believe and get on with getting there or i can sit with my back to the future crying over old hurts that i refuse to let scab and fall away i can tell myself i have no idea what the hell im doing and i need someone else to tell me who what where i am complete with blueprints and ten step programs or i can acknowledge that i am not lost i am not unclear i am not broken i can swim like mad or flail about acting as if im going to drown perhaps if i did more of the former and a little less of the latter id stop wasting time
845352 we really just were waiting on the votes to come in
845353 there were a number of nights that we would have a board meeting and court was in session
845354 it really hurt the flow of operations because of the lack of space
845355 well start to discuss construction bids and possibly a timeline of events
845356 the vote was turned down with a 649 to 120 vote
845357 people thought that it was too much space for a small town government
845358 i think its wonderful a feather in the communitys cap
845359 i have always felt that honeoye central being not just a k 12 school but also a community activity center could benefit from an electronic marquee sign that would serve as a means to communicate school activities
845360 there was a lot of warfare going on between native american tribes
845361 that was one of the reasons that the iroquois confederacy was established
845362 so it didnt take long for them to have to find another piece of fertile land
845363 after testing pieces of brass on the site we concluded that the brass was european
845364 this was the earliest evidence there was some trade between europeans and native americans
845365 i think some people liked the cards because thats the way it always was and was part of the charm of the place
845366 but ive seen the benefits and more people like the new system than dont
845367 could make it look more like a place for the community and less like a residence
845368 if we do it carefully we could still do a good job of keeping it little and charming i wouldnt want to take from the charm
845369 i dont ask people to do this i think they just want to help
845370 the library wouldnt have survived this long without these people who truly care
845371 i spent the money so i could look pretty for you because i love you so much
845372 i bought these gifts for you with the money because i love you so much
845373 i am investing the rest of the money for our future because i love you so much
845374 as the event video industrys one and only all star team the eventdv 25 gives us the opportunity to recognize those videographers who are wielding the most influence today through their innovative work educational efforts and outreach to other videographers
845375 to make sure we recognized the right people we turned the selection process entirely over to the fans and let our readers pick the team over the two month online voting process the readers cast well over a thousand votes and our all star team emerged
845376 because women who feel insecure about their appearance are more likely to buy beauty products new clothes or diet aids

845391 i have things in galleries but you dont get to meet the clientele like in a good festival
845392 its not going to be the case where you have 300 artists like clothesline a festival at rochesters memorial art gallery but we maintain the quality
845393 its really hard to believe until you get into doing things like this the number of artists that are out there its just amazing youd never know they were there
845394 im excited because this is nice and local its early in the season its a beautiful venue you feel safe walking around and the barn is so cute
845395 one of those holiday things where you could make an ornament

845397 id like to get into larger pieces high end pieces people can do kiln work stained glass glass cutting glass engraving theres so much you can do with glass
845398 doesnt seem like ive been retired which is even better
845399 i know what im doing i have it all planned out plans to take care of you
845400 but the plans of the lord stand firm forever the purposes of his heart through all generations
845401 blessed are they who keep his statutes and seek him with all of their heart

845421 today we showed the worth of our team and our drivers but we lacked the total reliability which is absolutely vital felipe drove possibly the best race of his career and we are very disappointed about what happened to him just a handful of kilometres from the end he made an amazing start attacking at the right moment and then he was comfortably managing his race in the final stages heading for a well deserved victory kimis race was compromised by his poor qualifying result yesterday when you start further back its hard to climb up the order he was stuck behind alonso for much of the race but when he finally had a clear track ahead of him he showed all his and the f2008s potential we have to react to this negative moment in our usual way with grit determination and with everyone playing their part we have three weeks of hard work ahead of us to be as well prepared as possible for the european grand prix
845422 it happened completely without warning without giving the slightest indication i was managing the race because i had a good advantage over second place after hamilton was delayed with a problem and i was taking no risks whatsoever i am very frustrated at the moment because today we had a great car and we had done everything perfectly until just a few kilometres from the finish unfortunately racing can be a cruel sport we had given it our all but these things can happen now we must not give up but instead we must react quickly there are seven races to go and 70 points up for grabs which means there is plenty of time to make up ground our rivals are strong but we have shown we are at their level
845423 i am sorry for felipe and for the team as it is horrible to lose a race in this way it was tough for me because when you spend a long time behind a slower car it becomes frustrating and boring when i was finally able to push the car was behaving very well but by then it was too late i came up behind glock but in the end i had to slow as i had a mechanical problem with the rear end and the team told me to be very careful to ensure i brought the car home its true that im the one who has won the most points out of the top three in the classification which shows this championship is really unpredictable with ups and downs for everyone it was a disappointing weekend for me but at least i managed to come away with a decent result we must try and fix the problems we have in qualifying to start at the front so as to exploit the potential of the car if we can do that then we can get back to fighting for the win
845424 it hurts to see a car stop with a failure just a few laps from the end when you are solidly in the lead its a real shame because felipe drove an extraordinary race a perfect start always a fast pace and a great management of the situation in the final stages kimi was behind alonso for two thirds of the race and only when he had a free track ahead of him was he able to show what he can do today we showed our package is up to the job in terms of performance but we lacked the necessary reliability we must continue to work to improve still further as indeed our competitors are doing we can expect some weeks of hard work ahead of the next race where we want to achieve what slipped from our grasp today in the very last moments
845425 and im especially pleased with the way we won it from start to finish the scrap reminded me of the thrilling clashes we had last year with marcus gr nholm it was a very close run thing throughout and we were never able to relax the decision to keep the lead at the end of the opening day involved a certain amount of risk because we didnt know exactly how much road sweeping we would have to do it meant pushing hard all the way but the tactic finally paid off
845426 there have been races this year where i ve been in a position to challenge for victory but had something go wrong for me halfway through this race things started working for me and i started pushing felipe hard and it worked i feel sorry for felipe because he drove a great race but my car felt good and i knew i could push for the victory this is a great moment for me something i ve been targeting for many years hopefully this victory will be the first of many
845427 congratulations to heikki for his first and very well deserved grand prix win the race could have been better for me my start was okay but felipe s was better and he managed to overtake me i managed to maintain the gap during the first stint and felt comfortable in the second stint because i was matching his times but was going to be running longer to the final stops i feel i could have had a go at passing him but the damaged tyre halted my progress i don t yet know what happened but at least i scored four points and maintained my lead in the championship so this result is not too bad for me
845428 one of the oldest motor racing phrases ever coined is to finish first first you have to finish
845429 lewis s race was compromised by his losing the lead at the start but we fuelled him long for the second stint and therefore believed he was well placed to leapfrog felipe in his final pitstop sadly for him though it wasn t to be damage to his front left tyre cost him that victory chance however from lewis s perspective as bad days go it could have been a lot worse but today was heikki s day and a very good day it was and everyone at vodafone mclaren mercedes is absolutely delighted for him
845430 i m sorry for felipe and ferrari lewis had bad luck with the tyre felipe with the engine heikki s first win is sensational and he deserves it we are obviously successful with our finns first mika then kimi and now heikki without the damaged tyre lewis also had a chance of victory until then his race went according to plan and his strategy with a later second stop could have put him ahead of felipe congratulations to timo and toyota on their second place today timo kept the world champion behind him the podium showed again that the fight for the world championship will remain very exciting during the so called summer break we will continue to work hard to be well prepared for the next race on valencias street circuit which will be new for everybody
845431 im pleased with my driving but i came here to win and loeb found a few seconds more
845432 it was a fantastic rally and an amazing fight and its unfortunate i didnt win in front of my home fans i pushed right to the end but it wasnt enough im pleased to still lead the championship but one point isnt much the speed was crazy sometimes we could have thrown our pace notes away and just gone for it and ive learned that i could have made my notes quicker
845433 the rally didnt go as i expected unfortunately and i didnt achieve what i wanted which was a podium i feel quite empty it ended for me on friday morning and that was all due to an error i made on the recce when i didnt mark a rock in my pace notes at least i got my confidence rhythm and speed back and drove the new stages which is good for the future it was difficult to be motivated but the best medicine after an accident is to get back behind the wheel i know the speed is there so i hope that next year ill have the chance to fight for a win here
845434 this was an excellent result especially as i havent competed for over two months it was difficult to find the required balance of attacking hard enough and being cautious over the huge crests one error on the big jumps is enough to drain a drivers confidence and this is the ultimate confidence event im looking forward to the next rally in germany which is a very different kind of rally
845435 this wasnt the result we were looking for but having lost jari matti so early it made it more difficult for mikko because he had to think about both championships he delivered an incredible performance and learned a lot having to battle with loeb for three days which will make him stronger they were 0 5sec km quicker than the rest of the field and i think mikko drove better than last year which is a big achievement
845436 tens of thousands of spectators packed the forests to see the action while the service park in the centre of jyv skyl provided great entertainment in itself for entire families and generated the kind of atmosphere for which finland is renowned once again this rally has shown it is the championships benchmark that every event must aspire to match

845459 super powerful ultra mega emo attack with a really long name that makes me wonder why the enemy doesnt attack me while im saying the name of this attack possible killing me and winning the battle instead of standing there like an idiot waiting for me to strike with this really long attack that for some reason i have to shout blast
845460 for every second i won he took it back from me on the next stage a lot can happen on tomorrows fast stages but it will be hard to take that amount of time back on driving alone either i need some good luck or he needs some bad luck a frenchman on top of the podium in finland wouldnt be good so i have to try to prevent that
845461 it was difficult this morning and i didnt feel comfortable after yesterdays accident
845462 i went wide and got stuck on the first stage but it was better after that and my confidence is returning i drove fast but on the safe side of fast and im starting to enjoy the driving again if i was in a position to fight then i could do that now whereas this morning nothing felt right
845463 im not thinking about the position as much as the learning experience there were a lot of surprises and i slid off on some corners we had a moment in stage 15 where i went into a bush so i got back on the track and gave it everything and was going flat out in fifth gear when i hit a jump the car was really high off the ground so much so that i couldnt see the crowd below i thought there would be a big impact when i landed but it was fine
845464 jari matti took the chance to regain his confidence by winning stages which is good for the next round mikko drove at 100 per cent all day but unfortunately was unable to pull time back from loeb but its not all over yet and its going to be an exciting day tomorrow

845501 its just what the coaches wanted to see from me the past two years more consistency
845502 everyone out here has talent but the great ones have consistency and thats what it takes to get to the next level so the coaches want to see more of that out of me i just matured relaxed and am having fun out there
845503 not just me but i feel like every receiver has come in here and wanted to be the no 1 receiver so as well as everyone pushing to make the most of that opportunity where it falls it will take care of itself
845504 im out here like everyone else trying to be no 1
845505 travis has had a particularly good ota organized team activities period he began to show up and make some plays and i think that has carried over to training camp here because when the ball comes his way hes been catching them
845506 i think that helps his confidence because he has been wondering whether hes going to be able to hang on here but this year his third year hes beginning to show up and i think he has improved a lot as a receiver
845507 ive always been self driven but obviously the last two seasons didnt go according to plan
845508 that left a taste in my mouth like no other and it gave me motivation bigger than anyone else can give me
845509 i think for one he understands the system better and knows what is expected and two sometimes when you come in you think youve got it made because you got drafted and you dont understand how tough the competition is now i think he understands the whole picture so we see a better travis wilson
845510 ive been hearing little stuff about whats going on in green bay but i dont know too much about whats going on i would have thought that after the season he had last season they would have welcomed him back but who knows
845511 hes improved so much his arm strength you know its not what it was before he first got hurt but it was pretty close
845512 we made him work a little bit there in the middle innings but we didnt take advantage of it that was really the difference for us
845513 thats a good start to having him back in the rotation
845514 in the fifth inning and sixth inning i got the ball up a little bit
845515 they made me pay they put some good swings on the ball
845516 psychologically it has to be very good because we just got swept three series
845517 if we had just won this series it would have been great but getting the sweep is a lot better because it puts some space between the days that you had that losing streak
845518 every since we got these guys its made an impression
845519 the speed that we got any ball up the middles not going to go through anymore were going to give some teams some pressure from now on
845520 with that shortstop and second baseman theyre a different club much different club than we saw last time they have lots more energy more life more creativity
845521 i finished it up the way i wanted to with a strikeout thats how i envisioned it i didnt picture the home run in there but thats all right
845522 were beating ourselves were obviously not getting hits theyre making every single play in the field and were making none
845523 ah dont forget tonight on tv3 theyre gonna show the drama kekasihku seru i hope that drama thrills

845551 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
845552 this is something that i caught onto just before 2000 when there was so much search engine craze running around and started doing small just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after getting the hang of it
845553 ive actually gotten over 87 million in advertising that using my secret i never had to pay for and the largest share of which was more recently in google pay per clicks as well as other forms of pad advertising at search engines all of which i got for free
845554 wow ha this is really unique and in my expert opinion it would only serve to enhance and bring more business to us at name of search engine withheld for legal amp confidentiality reasons and not cause us to lose business in the slightest amazing

845626 she was an awesome person a great person to work with a big heart
845627 i dont know how somebody could do something like that to her she would do anything for anybody you know and i just dont see how somebody could possibly hurt her
845628 theres also a sisterhood component to this whole dragon boating
845629 when you are paddling a team and youre surrounded by people who have gone through treatment just like you have theres a bond that cannot be broken and the spirit is unbelievable
845630 theres this whole community in burlington or in vermont that have embraced the whole concept behind breast cancer survivors and dragon boating

845632 dogs are a huge part of the american lifestyle and what better way to celebrate their companionship than by being a responsible owner
845633 but responsible dog ownership is about so much more than one month long observance life with your dog should be a life long celebration
845634 and they need to be a part of a family when we address dogs social and emotional needs like companionship and leadership first then living well together becomes easy
845635 private instruction is great especially when people need to address very specific issues such as aggression or separation anxiety
845636 but group classes are the way to go if you really want to maximize your training time and money and its a terrific way for both you and your dog to socialize
845637 if you can dream of something you want to do with your dog there will be someone out here who can teach it
845638 its good for all of us to slow down and just spend time together with little or no expectation of what might happen stop and smell the roses and let your dog get a good sniff of something stinky too
845639 just like us dogs are living thinking creatures and just like us they move and breathe as well
845640 its really important that we do everything we can to understand what our dogs were bred to do and how they need to eat and move to be healthy
845641 when it comes to dog food what goes in should by and large stay in
845642 when you choose better foods you feed less but your dog actually extracts more nutrition from what you feed so cost wise youre about the same as with lower quality foods
845643 your veterinarian should be one of your dogs best friends
845644 good preventive care will help your dog live a long healthy life with you and will also enable to him spend all of his ample energy learning and growing and not fighting off parasites and disease
845645 i think the number one problem affecting american dogs today is boredom
845646 people have the mistaken impression that dogs exercise themselves in the back yard or even inside but they generally dont
845647 there are so many free and nearly free ways to take care of his needs while making sure your own get met too theres no reason to economize on your relationship
845648 ive seen floods when theres washouts but never this and my niece and the people that lived there before said if the pond ever lets go it will flood the whole valley it didnt thank god
845649 i have suggested that they voluntarily vacate their residences so far nobody has chosen to do that they still do have their electricity and their phone working however it is a concern of mine that if there was a fire or an ambulance needed to get in there its going to be very very difficult right now to get to them
845650 we love what we do if we didnt we wouldnt continue to do it
845651 we have to juggle the books its a day by day thing and we try to pay the bills
845652 youre demanding more of the cow trying to get as much out of her and the least amount of cost
845653 the price of grain and the price of fuel are just gobbling up any of the profits you might make
845654 i knew the days would be long and the vacations would be short did i foresee that we would be facing the economic times were facing today no
845655 its kind of sad to see these farms disappearing because how are people going to eat what are people going to do
845656 as kids i dont think we were aware of how hard they worked and what they gave us and what we got from growing up on this farm now i certainly appreciate what my mom and dad have done
845657 the icon will be available in all handsets and hence will remain inactive if the consumer is not using an airtel connection it then also serves as a huge branding tool
845658 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
845659 we do know we have no systemic problem in this company
845660 it is our job to make sure we get that reputation back
845661 theyre for defensive purposes were not going to attack anybody
845662 in conjunction with other economic data released in recent months the job advertisements series provides further evidence that the current level of interest rates is achieving the reserve bank of australia desired slowing in domestic economic growth
845663 the issue revolves around the continuing protection of cute brown eyed fur seals
845664 the study findings show similarities with studies into seal diet elsewhere in new zealand that have found seals prefer a diet of squid and oily fish species in coastal areas
845665 these studies show seals are not eating species sought after by recreational fishers as is often suggested
845666 we still have some legal issues to resolve and in due course after sentencing we will be lodging an appeal
845667 there are deficiencies in the summing up and other matters
845668 it was the toughest summing up i think would confront any judge in this country
845669 creasys art is death hes about to paint his masterpiece
845670 i am particularly grateful to joseph a collector amp seller of instruments in the usa who has allowed me to use these photographs of this incredible guitar this very rare guitar is almost unique to my understanding and was sold via the internet for us 1790 sorry cant get this next sentence exactly something about this probably having been the guitar synthesiser produced before the ludwing phase ii this confirms that c kayman were always ahead of their time and continually in search of innovation
845671 i have always been willing to support moderate and even liberal republican incumbents over conservative challengers because of the benefits of being a majority party in congress i wrote at length about this in painting the map red and it still is a bedrock principle of mine
845672 for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counseller the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace
845673 fear not for unto you is born this day in the city of david a savior which is christ the lord
845674 for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counseller the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace
845675 now theres an awful lot of shining glory even more than last time up here
845676 but were giving it all to god again because thats what got us here sticking together and believing that we could and i know god has looked after us on this journey and bonded us into such a tight family
845677 my relationship first is with jesus christ and he is the center of my life
845678 i try to live a christian life i would like for players to know my faith based on what they see on a day to day basis
845679 the churchs one foundation has been torn asunder by heresy and distress
845680 since the beginning the church has faced attacks from within and attacks from outside this is nothing new
845681 as i look forward into the 21st century it seems to me the great global conflict will be between christianity and islam
845682 in the seventh and eighth centuries the churches of north africa and the middle east did not acknowledge the theological and social economy and political traits of islam and they were overrun we must learn from those who have gone before us their blood cries out to us let them not have died in vain
845683 not so much by the sword but by the dollar
845684 at the same time the church is generally ignorant about islam its doctrine its ideology and its expansionist strategy the anglican leader said most churches have no plan or vision about reaching muslims and even shy away from evangelism out of fear and the prospect of retaliatory violence
845685 the religious future of india is up for grabs as the dalits the lower class leave hinduism
845686 the 20th century was the century of humanism or humanistic ideologies some of them quite perverse whether it was fascism of different kinds or communism
845687 i believe the capacity of those ideologies to shape the world is petering out
845688 militant islam is the greatest threat to our social political and cultural heritage
845689 i just dont understand what you guys in the pr industry do at the end of the day because if i need a story for one of my clients all i need to do is ask a publisher or ad rep and i get it
845690 but 19 of senior marketers saying they do it constitutes a problem
845691 one type of coverage you buy and the other you achieve through persuasive argument making it a credible source of information and not something that has to be taken with a grain of salt
845692 there needs to be credible independent media and the marketing industry should not be doing anything to undermine credible editorial quality
845693 its almost like theres a different standard for online activity and thats a little worrisome because thats the growth area
845694 thats something the industry needs to be attentive to because the reputational damage that can occur if a marketer is dishonest online is huge
845695 implicit non verbal agreement with a reporter or editor that you expect to see favorable coverage of your product or company in exchange for advertising
845696 if these numbers are true it indicates that the relationship between marketers and journalists is getting cozier and cozier
845697 and this could end up damaging the credibility of mainstream news media
845698 i get some of that and im clear about the line that we draw
845699 in general newspaper editors are talking more with their ad departments about ideas for new sections that can attract advertising and sometimes the ad department will come back to an editor and say we have a company interested but at that point the editor needs to make clear there will be no trading of ads for coverage going on
845700 theres incredible financial pressure on news organizations to create revenue
845701 so there may be the temptation to work with marketers and advertisers to trade news stories for advertising
845702 i always thought the pr industry did a poor job of explaining what it does to its advertising and media colleagues
845703 we americans are not solving problems we are the problem
845704 american fascists the christian right and the war on america
845705 the baptizing of america the religious rights plans for the rest of us
845706 the end of faith religion terror and the future of reason
845707 piety amp politics the right wing assault on religious freedom
845708 thy kingdom come how the religious right distorts the faith and threatens america
845709 religion gone bad the hidden dangers of the christian right
845710 its one thing to say people should be free to believe whatever they like but should they be free impose their beliefs on their children
845711 if there was much interest in whats happening at roys peninsula i would have expected a lot more people to be there at the open day
845712 yeah you can definitely kiss your way out of a paper bag
845713 our media choices are based on consumer understanding and whether the vehicle is effective in reaching the target consumer of a brand
845714 were happy to produce the same amount of business as last year
845715 this is one of the toughest ad markets weve had in a long time
845716 i think that this is going to extend well into 2009
845717 thats kind of the way the tea leaves are feeling
845718 im personally trying to reconcile the two very different marketplaces that are going on the very healthy upfront marketplace and the very slow scatter marketplace
845719 i would be surprised if there wasnt some breakage moving from hold to order
845720 the sellers made a concerted effort to write more business anticipating that they needed it as sort of hedge against something that might fall out
845721 it is not the consequences you would have expected from a simple tail end collision
845722 i like your pictures since your smile is too warm and perfect not to see again and again
845723 your references about cooking have continued to make me smile in fact it cracks me up to envision this ultrasmart member of my dorky profession stirring up a pot of something in the kitchen in high hopes for something tasty
845724 i had a terrific time with you i couldve talked to you for hours as evident by the fact that i did i felt terrible that you left so late i liked your shoes and kept looking at them you were right your pictures are a clear representative of how you look your earrings were quite attractive and catchy your body language was priceless as you dodged every land mine with ease
845725 as far as indoor activities perhaps a movie a topless bar or dinner
845726 hey i am totally down with a topless bar in fact afterward we can pick up some fuzzy handcuffs and head back to my apartment
845727 im not heading back to your apartment unless you promise that i can eat strawberries from between your toes a deal is a deal
845728 ok ok you can have your little strawberry fantasy as long as you let me post the video on youtube and send a copy to your mom
845729 while youre at it you may as well send a copy to the online dating site and request that it be used in their next marketing campaign
845730 ha i bet it would recruit plenty of people all the s amp m fanatics looking for love
845731 perhaps that could be a new singles website consider the theme find out how compatible you are with your partner with respect to spanking chains whips leather and all things velvet and fuzzy we should get larry flint and howard stern as spokespersons
845732 dd i think youre an amazingly beautiful girl just thought id mention that
845733 hahahahaha dont tempt me with such teasing comments not fair not fair
845734 seriously whats not fair is that youre working tonight i dont know how im ever going to get to sleep tonight in case you havent noticed i really like you i had a great time with you this weekend and i think youre smokin hot very much looking forward to seeing you again
845735 i cant wait to see you again it drives me crazy to know youre over there thinking of me
845736 im currently in a meeting bla bla bla im thinking of you and wishing we were on the couch and not watching a movie
845737 you have no idea how much my productivity dropped after getting this email not that im complaining
845738 man this is exactly why i wont touch myspace with a 10 foot pole
845739 i cant wait to be swept off my feet by you
845740 the new male prospect is a worrier and he was in full on worry mode that thursday night girl didnt think he was the shit even though he thought she was the best thing sine sliced bread
845741 what gets you through a rough period in your relationship
845742 yeah i just got back into port and i have a nasty case of the skittles all the colors of the rainbow
845743 he certainly was no worse for wear after his meadowlands experience
845744 weg was good enough to write a race like this and it was nice to get back up behind him and see that he is as good as ever i just kept him at his task but he did it effortlessly its always incredible to come and sit up behind a horse like this and watch the way the crowd has taken to him
845745 state of the art new products that our competitors arent going to be able to match
845746 think macbook screen possibly a bit smaller in glass with iphone like but fuller featured multi touch gesture library full mac os x possibly with haptic tech slot loading superdrive accelerometer gps pretty expensive to produce initially but sold at low price that will reduce margins available by october at the latest
845747 when asked if there was a desire on its part to work with open source mobile phone operating systems android or symbian mr
845748 rumor central apple dell zune sales professionals take note shrug shoulders then get back to productive work
845749 i know who jesus is but i am still hungry
845750 more computer manufacturers prepare to enter the growing ultra compact mini notebook pc market salespeople giggle gleefully
845751 absurd beliefs no matter how many people believe them do not deserve any respect from rational individuals
845752 neither catholicism nor islam a s belief systems deserve any respect people deserve respect and consideration
845753 i felt that i have to re draw the dna rose that almine
845754 they werent brought up particularly religious but they were really open
845755 i was free to make my own opinions in absolutely every way religious and sexual
845756 theres no doubt that the way you were brought up has a huge impact on how you turn out so in my specific case i wouldnt be as comfortable with who i am were it not for my upbringing
845757 and theres none of the baggage youll find in any of the churches even in the more liberal ones when you build your world view from the ground up in a rational liberal way which all atheists i know have gay rights is a no brainer
845758 imagine if they kidnapped somebody and you make a plea for that individual to please return that loved one to the family
845759 it takes a certain kind of person to believe what no one else believes 72
845760 is that it allows otherwise normal human beings to reap the fruits of madness and consider them
845761 under no circumstances will i be a candidate for vice president
845762 when we said we wanted to bring down the walls open up this convention like never before and truly speak to the american people we meant it
845763 ethereal and magical thing that seems to enthrall millions of people from all over the world
845764 my understanding is that senator obama said he would take public financing and that now hes saying he wont actions speak louder than words no matter how beautiful the words are and how well presented youve got to get beyond the words and now were seeing how the words dont even mean what we thought they meant so i think it raises some serious questions about what it is he stands for
845765 its now just two weeks before chicagos gay pride parade to be held on sunday june 29th 2008
845766 if they bring a knife to the fight we bring a gun because from what i understand folks in philly like a good brawl
845767 look i am a pro growth free market guy i love the market
845768 theyre going to try to make me into a scary guy theyre even trying to make michelle into a scary person right
845769 and so that drumbeat were not sure if hes patriotic or not were not sure if he is too black
845770 barack hussein obama is not a horrendous candidate because of his skin color some might say he is in spite of it but race was and is a factor in this election obama has become one of the most corrupting influences in our political public life exactly because of his race baiting and dishonesty
845771 de eerste diagnose is dat zijn binnenste knieband is afgescheurd
845772 maar daar wil hij nu nog niet aan denken laten we hopen dat het allemaal relatief meevalt
845773 ik heb vanmiddag hsv juventus op tv bekeken maar was nog niet in de gelegenheid om real madrid arsenal te zien dit is echt een dikke streep door de rekening want wesley is erg belangrijk voor het nederlands elftal dit is ontzettend vervelend voor oranje maar vooral bijzonder sneu voor wesley morgen vandaag red is er technisch overleg en zal de blessure uitgebreid aan bod komen
845774 i blame it on the past forty years of music
845775 well i may not know him as well as i thought
845776 historians have widely ignored the impact of mans need for something to believe in and how that can be manipulated
845777 people want a simple narrative they want a magic young prince to save them you can see this with barack obama in the us if you actually look at what hes about its just make believe the idea that he could persuade the leaders of iran and syria to sit down at the same conference table is absurd
845778 the way this campaign has been run is the way we need to be forever
845779 dont trust bloggers or someone elses opinion because people lie
845780 barack obama will require you to work he is going to demand that you shed your cynicism that you put down your divisions that you come out of your isolation that you move out of your comfort zones that you push yourselves to be better and that you engage barack will never allow you to go back to your lives as usual uninvolved uninformed
845781 look at that my purse is the perfect color palette

845784 dalam perjuangan sering kita terjebak dalam slogan slogan dan simbol simbol yang terkadang kita bergeser dari tujuan dan kita mengaanggap bahwa simbol dan tujuan itu adalah tujuan kita

845789 dawah kita seperti filosifi air akan senantiasa bergerak dawah ini harus mengalir ke muara yang lebih luas yaitu lautan bebas jangan tinggal digenangan air yang tenang memang disana ada ikan seperti ikan mujair gabus lele dan lain lain tapi jangan senang tinggal disitu masa muanfaqat dawah sudah lewat sekarang kita harus ke lautan bebas disana ikannyalebih besar besar seperti ikan paus

846271 guess we could go to the library but mary would not be able to read anything
846272 why not just hunt for a room we could furnish it for her just encase this happens again
846273 this way mary can make this room her own wow im suddenly excited
846274 come on mary lets find you another room darien obviously wants you to stay close to kami wonder why hes being so secretive
846275 if he makes a big mess again hes cleaning it up
846276 it is not exactly a good idea to go say
846277 its a mess why does he do this cant he find some other place to destroy things
846278 youre not the only person weve seen drool over him mary
846279 ill go get a couple brooms start gathering things into a pile
846280 she has come to give darien a message darien says its about mary
846281 ill see whats up with the kids where are they
846282 please my lady why do i deserve such an honor
846283 i believe you know it has something to do with your new addition to the family i see you have her well hidden i applaud you for that you know me well
846284 i know that you are aware of the situation garith has gotten himself into
846285 he went against our leader in his silly attempt to keep the woman to himself and for that he has been punished we were actually quite pleased that you have already had a hand in his suffering the man was burned to near blackness when we found him my lord also applause you for the tree stunt he wished he was there to witness it himself
846286 my lord had wanted garith to turn the furrow woman in hopes she would come stay with us however garith went with his own decision and cut off the very thing we wanted
846287 as i am sure you have already figured out where it lies anyways my lord has come into conclusion that her gift is indeed powerful and truthfully he wants it you know him darien just like when he found you
846288 if the woman remains mute she can stay with you however
846289 if somehow she breaks her silence we will confiscate her
846290 she has no choice my friend remember she was turned against her will we would normally slay those like her
846291 you are keeping the very thing she longs for this is not fair
846292 i know you have grown very attached to her your whole family has do you want her to stay or not
846293 i will return to him just remember if the spell is broken then we will come
846294 oh trust me she does not have to worry about him bothering her ever again why do you think i said if she breaks the spell
846295 she fell out of nowhere like i do not know like
846296 good thing she fell on me or she would have hit her head
846297 the woman that was speaking with darien she hinted that he was killed
846298 she must have felt it ive seen it before when i hunt there was a time james and i were after newborn mates the two of them were slaughtering villages at an alarming rate i went after the male and james the female when i destroyed the male the female instantly collapsed an easy target for james i asked darien about it that night when i returned he could not really explain it to me i just came to the conclusion that when one dies the other feels it
846299 shes fine i never knew that could happen when your mate dies

846320 all of us are really looking forward to doing a real honest to goodness western its a sexy genre and it really goes with our company name
846321 just like grunts we are going to be true to the genre this is not going to be a film about pretty boys riding rough and rugged and will look like the real deal
846322 in the process of planning next years blockbuster we decided to significantly upgrade our shooting equipment we have added a few expensive but essential pieces to our arsenal as we move toward shooting more large narrative projects weve upgraded our sound equipment by buying new lavalier microphones for recording dialog on horses and additional boom mics for group scenes we also bought a new steadicam a dolly track and a camera crane which will allow us to mix hand held work with smoother camera movements adding depth and weight to many of our shots
846323 im very excited to be working on this film with such a stellar cast and crew rugged and handsome the models for this film look like they could be right out of a sergio leone western with the added bonus of being incredibly sexy and well hung

846340 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
846341 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most

846345 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
846346 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
846347 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
846348 considering the problem didnt go away i had to learn something to overcome what had me stuck

846413 an emissions trading scheme will see the price of electricity and manufactured goods go up but that is no guarantee that the market will invest in alternatives especially if polluters can pass on the extra cost to consumers buy up environmentally dubious offsets or be compensated for extra costs that might damage their international competitiveness
846414 high price for carbon credits has to be stable enough over time to encourage long term investment in renewables
846415 why do we put so much faith in the market to solve environmental problems why do we assume that increasing the cost of fossil fuel emissions will reduce their use rather than just increase everyones cost of living
846416 the market has not been able to provide the alternatives required

846451 i think the fed is looking at fridays jobs numbers and thursdays gdp as a reflection of stimulus payments that are working their way out of the system i think they are very unlikely to raise interest rates
846452 i think they are going to continue to accentuate and maybe even ratchet up the kind of headwinds language theyve used
846453 the threats are there on the inflationary side but thats an itch they know they really cant scratch
846454 they cant poke for oil they cant plant food they can only restrain demand and thats the last thing youd want to do given the conditions in the job market

846456 there does seem to be a bottom being carved out
846457 we think the dollars cyclical downturn is over and in the next couple of months the dollar will continue to get traction as the market begins pricing in an ecb rate cut and a federal reserve rate hike
846458 the less flexible economies may have a more protracted and deeper downturn
846459 its not all that wild eyed once the turn comes its going to be significant
846460 as soon as the stock market looks like its starting to trend one way we have both sets of players in here and thats confusing

846645 one night a hunting party camping in the mountains noticed two lights like large stars moving along the top of a distant ridge they wondered and watched until the light disappeared on the other side the next night and the next they saw the lights again moving along the ridge and after talking over the matter decided to go on the morrow and try to learn the cause in the morning they started out and went until they came to the ridge where after searching some time they found two strange creatures about so large making a circle with outstretched arms with round bodies covered with fine fur or downy feathers from which small heads stuck out like the heads of terrapins as the breeze played upon these feathers showers of sparks flew out the hunters carried the strange creatures back to the camp intending to take them home to the settlements on their return they kept them several days and noticed that every night they would grow bright and shine like great stars although by day they were only balls of gray fur except when the wind stirred and made the sparks fly out they kept very quiet and no one thought of their trying to escape when on the seventh night they suddenly rose from the ground like balls of fire and were soon above the tops of the trees higher and higher they went while the wondering hunters watched until at last they were only two bright points of light in the dark sky and then the hunters knew that they were stars

846656 blessed to have a surviving storehouse of earth community wisdom and experience that indigenous people have managed to preserve despite all the best efforts of the institutions of empire to eliminate it indigenous peoples lived close to earth and were deeply aware that their security and survival as individuals depended on their deep bond to tribe and nature as modern societies awaken to the reality that for all our technologies our security and even our survival depends on reconnecting to one another and earth we are just beginning to realize that we have much to learn from the indigenous wisdom and experience we must join with indigenous peoples in a common effort to create a new earth community synthesis of indigenous wisdom and values with the capabilities of beneficial modern technologies

846664 national survey data show that the prevalence of overweight and obese adults in the u s has increased steadily over the past three decades
846665 if these trends continue more than 86 percent of adults will be overweight or obese by 2030 with approximately 96 percent of non hispanic black women and 91 percent of mexican american men affected this would result in 1 of every 6 health care dollars spent in total direct health care costs paying for overweight and obesity related costs
846666 our analysis also shows that over time heavy americans become heavier
846667 obesity is not a fat problem it is an acid problem america is not over weight america is over acid acidity is a toxic waste product of diet emotions and metabolism the body retains fat to park excess metabolic or dietary acids that are not being properly eliminated through urination perspiration defecation and or respiration away from organs that sustain life we need to understand that fat is protective and acid is destructive when one gets off an acidic diet and lifestyle the body gives up the excess fat there is no need for the body to hold on to excess fat to park excess acid you lose weight quickly and naturally
846668 is the one time you can do what you want and get away with it
846669 now i am working to maintain an alkaline body by making smart green food choices drinking alkaline water staying positive staying active and much more most importantly i am passionate in spreading the word because too many people are needlessly suffering from ailments that are completely preventable
846670 cancer is the best thing that has ever happened to me
846671 before cancer entered my life i thought that i was
846672 during the summer of 2002 i first became aware of
846673 i quickly developed a thirst for information related to healing and superior health with richards love i was humbled into realizing that i never really knew anything about true health i had been living in a fishbowl for over twenty years i basically had to throw out all of my preconceived notions of what constituted a true state of health i had to relearn everything
846674 my quest for ideal health led me down numerous paths
846675 in addition to witnessing the horrific lives of slaughterhouse animals i accepted that human beings have absolutely no need for animal products in their diets a shift in mentality was crucial i no longer wanted to be an accessory to murder from a biological environmental and ethical standpoint it made sense for me to eliminate all of the negative stressors in my life and diet was of the utmost importance with this in mind i decided to cut out all meat from my diet also consuming dairy was definitely out of the question i learned that dairy products are more detrimental to human health than meat itself due to the exponentially concentrated amount of acids being raised on dairy i was aware that i would have to be patient in my healing process as unknown amounts of toxins were embedded within the fibers of my flesh
846676 i understood that the change in my diet would cause
846677 in 2006 i was introduced to the world of raw foods
846678 in addition to altering my diet i increased my alkaline water intake looking back at my previous lifestyle i realized that there were days where i did not drink a single glass of water oh my poor body since the human body is made up of almost ninety percent alkaline water it must be stressed that water is the ideal choice of drink it is important not only for cleansing but for the rejuvenation and rebuilding of cells also with my diet being focused around fresh organic alkaline fruit vegetables nuts and seeds my alkaline water intake has increased ten fold
846679 i firmly believe that the human body is quite amazing and if given the proper tools it can repair itself to a state of superior health throughout my progression i continued to get regular colposcopies and i am jubilant in reporting that the cancer is almost completely gone rather than accepting cancer as a death sentence i embraced it as my savior i honestly do not know where i would be at this point in my life had i not been touched by this illness i believe that health is something that we earn it is not automatically awarded to us especially if we treat out bodies like cesspools ultimately health is a function of responsibility my journey to attain optimal health has been a work in progress and i realize that this journey will continue for as long as i am living
846680 for many people iced tea is potentially one of the worst things you can drink
846681 for people who have a tendency to form kidney stones its definitely one of the worst things you can drink
846682 people are told that in the summertime they should drink more fluids
846683 a lot of people choose to drink more iced tea thinking its a tastier alternative however in terms of kidney stones theyre getting it going and coming theyre actually doing themselves a disservice
846684 people concerned about developing brain breast liver gallbladder and kidney stones should cut back on eating all acidic foods that also contain high concentrations of dietary acids such as dairy chocolate alcohol coffee tea animal protein peanuts corn vinegar and soy sauce they should increase chlorophyll rich foods and drinks healthy oils drink 4 to 5 liters of alkaline water and eat 10 to 12 grams of unprocessed salt every day if you want to be healthy and strong you need to eat like a cow and exercise like an ox at least one hour every day
846685 all you need to do is test the urine ph and you
846686 when you are exercising you are moving dietary and metabolic acids out through the pores of the skin when you are eliminating acids through perspiration urination defecation or respiration you are reducing your risk for alzheimers and every other sickness and dis ease you cannot get sick without acid and when you are exercising and sweating you are removing the very cause of alzheimers
846687 so if you are losing your mind then you have acid on the brain this acid comes from the life you live the food you eat the liquids you drink and the thoughts you think alzheimers is nothing more then dietary and metabolic acids turning the brain into swiss cheese in the 60s we called it dropping acid today we call it alzheimers
846688 my strongest recommendation is to exercise every day for at least 1 hour and when you are exercising make sure you sweat sweating is the most important part of exercising because it is through sweating that you are removing dietary and metabolic acids that can make you sick and tired if you truly want to be healthy you have to pee and sweat your way to health everyday
846689 cancer angel the explanation of what cancer is its prevention and cure
846690 liver spots or acid spots accumulate on our hands and our brains this snuffs out many neurons in our brain
846691 good cholesterol increases when we are more acidic and hdl cholesterol high density lipoprotein the
846692 height and foot size would not serve as practical estimators of penis length
846693 the principal target demographic for energy drinks is young adults ages 18 25 but theyre nearly as common among younger teens
846694 this is a concern because energy drinks typically contain three times the caffeine of a soft drink and in some cases up to 10 times as much they also include ingredients with potential interactions such as taurine and other amino acids massive doses of vitamins and plant and herbal extracts
846695 all the energy drinks sport drinks and exotic fruit drinks on the market are highly acidic and saturated with hydrogen proton ions that steals energy from the body when you consume an energy sport or exotic fruit drink the body will immediately go into preservation mode to protect the alkaline design of the body from systemic acidic poisoning there is no net increase in energy when drinking these highly acidic beverages and should never be consumed true energy comes from the release of electrons from alkaline foods and drinks the electron is the spark of life and energy drinks sport drinks and exotic fruit drinks robs that energy from the body leading to eventual sickness dis ease and disease
846696 energy drink consumption is correlated with substance use unsafe sexual activity and several other forms of risk taking
846697 for parents and college officials frequent energy drink consumption may be a red flag or warning sign for identifying a young person at higher risk for health compromising behavior
846698 the energy drinks sport drinks and exotic fruit drinks compromise the alkaline design of the body they all have a ph that runs between 2 5 ph and 3 5 ph which is 100 000 times more acidic then purified water my blood research also indicates that these drinks compromise and may damage the delicate ph of the small intestine and the intestinal villi the root system of the body when this happens the body cannot produce healthy normal blood which may lead to blood disorders i e anemia anisocytosis anesthetized white blood cells shistocytes or the breakdown of the red blood cells and leukemia just to name a few my best advise is never drink energy sport or exotic fruit drinks and start drinking 4 to 5 liters of 9 5 ph alkaline water daily
846699 the workers cant easily just go out to lunch at a nearby subway or mcdonalds
846700 so not a lot of butter and eggs and cream
846701 eating liberal amounts of healthy fats from seeds and fruits like flax hemp olive and avocado will provide the foundational material for building the membranes of every body cell a source for buffering or neutralizing dietary and metabolic acid and finally the cleanest source for cellular energy i have found that when one follows my low carbohydrate high fat ph miracle diet a person will lose an average of 1 pound a day if he she needs to lose weight or gain an average of 1 pound a day if he she needs to gain weight

846742 the expression contains a function that cannot operate on a set with more than 4 294 967 296 tuples
846743 how come nobody knew about this great new feature for the last 3 months
846744 the list of set functions is a bit limited where is filter
846745 hi defining the set first definitely speeds this up however we are finding that doesnt work when delivering results via excel and using filters because of the way excel represents filters in mdx the filter context is not applied to the set and thus the rank is always based on the unfiltered set any ideas on how to speed up rank in this context
846746 is it possible in as2005 to detect and obtain subselect restriction from the mdx calculation

846774 you guys blew appearance at the vsip dev lab and we gave them a quick overview of msbuild 4 distinct customer who shall remain nameless have engaged with us after the devlab and we are currently talking with them about using msbuild in their environments

846791 i came into this room because i had to answer your sports analysts damn questions what does next weeks game have to do with the game today
846792 of course not well their team is well coached and they have many weapons on offence and defence
846793 my boys played a horrible game today turnovers aplenty poor focus bad leadership on my part and the players on the field
846794 i dunno should i lie or should i say we will win
846795 it really burns me up to have to endure the lowbrow idiocy and the indulgence in self pity and hatred and blaming of other people that make up blogs like the field negro given the tone and content of the blog he should have called it the field nigger shouldn t he the owner of the blog claims to be a lawyer in philadelphia if he is smart enough to be a lawyer he should be smart enough to be able to defend his opinions and allow everyone to comment but he has shut the public out and allows only his friends to comment i don t blame him since his content is so lowbrow if a white person has a comparable blog about the view points of white people then we are stereotyped as racist only blacks jews and other ethnic groups can get away with that that is the source of a lot of white resentment that our freedoms have been taken away and we are second class citizens in our own country the map in one of the field negro s posts shows a divided america based upon ethnic and religious identity it is my argument that diversity leads to the breakup of countries and i have talked before about the breakup of america that will result from multi culturalism i m glad to see that the field negro legitimizes my fears for america s future it occurs to me however that there is no way that blacks jews or other minorities are going to attempt to divide up america they are parasites who could not exist without white people to feed upon
846796 why is the field negros blog not considered racist and unpatriotic
846797 the rule of the tribes is stronger than that of baghdad
846798 we are ready to respect the law of baghdad but the government has to represent the people
846799 i started shooting in the air and throughout the town bursts of gunfire echoed across the sky my family understood that the time had come and we started the war against al qaeda
846800 with their help we were able to liberate al qaim
846801 there has been a surge in the number of civilian casualties caused by all sides a spread of insecurity to previously stable areas and increasing attacks on aid agencies and their staff
846802 grave concern about the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan and the serious impact on civilians
846803 act on their own in ways that are not in convergence
846804 we need to identify these people and weed them out
846805 that would spell danger to pakistan in the long run they america want to make us subservient to india
846806 every meal we eat and every bullet we shoot arrives in afghanistan courtesy of the pakistani military
846807 if they want to put pressure on us it is very easy for them to do that they just slow down approvals slow down convoys and american and nato soldiers will start to get hungry very fast
846808 start and end each day right and youll be able to handle whatever happens in between

846821 thats bread made in a bread machine because of the little indentation in the slices
846822 if a symbol should be discovered in a painting of mine it was not my intention
846823 i welcome the growing consensus in the united states and iraq for a timeline
846824 i dont want to make promises not knowing what the situation is on the ground
846825 i cannot conceive of a more disastrous president than one who did not change his policy positions to reflect changes in reality
846826 it would not be a blessing for the american people to have a president who kept every campaign promise it would be a curse
846827 i cannot in good conscience support this escalation it is a policy which has already been tried and a policy which has failed
846828 i will drastically reduce our presence there i believe we should have all of our troops out by 2013 but i dont want to make promises not knowing what the situations going to be three or four years out
846829 i have consistently said that as a consequence of us putting more troops in and the awakening in the anbar province where sunnis turned against al qaeda violence is significantly down and that there is a significant improvement in iraq but what i have also consistently said is that moving forward what we have to focus on is the need for political reconciliation thats whats going to make the ultimate difference
846830 we need troops in the numbers required to do the job in place for as long as it takes to complete their mission it would be far better to have too many reinforcements in iraq than to suffer once again the tragic results in insufficient force levels
846831 timetables was the buzzword for those that wanted to get out
846832 as a veteran i would say are you kidding me i would say why would you take such a hard stance i understand you have to think of the future but as a player i would say you know what lets go out and give them an equal opportunity and let the best man win
846833 i understand aaron rodgers its a delicate situation for him but if you let the competition decide who wins no one can be upset about that and brett may not win and if that happens youre in the best of all situations because aaron has proved to you that he can go out there and get it done

846841 your reaction to the struggles of life is a direct indication of your level of vision
846842 your level of vision will determine whether god will work through you or work around you
846843 yeah but last time he drooled on me all night so i get one rotation off

846852 its a lot more work than i thought it would be
846853 we get together with other homeschoolers at least once a week
846854 i homeschool my kids so i can teach them my christian values
846855 all the sex ed and evolution they teach in the public schools goes against my values
846856 this cant go on until september people will want an indication from him sooner than that
846857 he knows that the majority of the party wants him back now theres no reason for him to be silent any longer
846858 hes come back from overseas he must have made his mind up by now
846859 if he doesnt come back he would have allowed john hewson to write his epitaph
846860 with the liberal party youre dealing with not a question of personalities its policies
846861 what weve inherited from 12 years of mr costello as treasurer is the second highest interest rates in the developed world together with his being part and parcel of a government which was engaged in climate change denial and work choices
846862 so on that score ive got to say its quite clear cut to me that the liberals whoever their leader is have a real problem with their policy direction for the nations future because of the legacy they left us from the past
846863 ive got to say their problem is one of policy
846864 this is a guy that whenever hes been wooed hes never consented and whenever hes chased hes never succeeded
846865 compare it with the way kevin rudd and wayne swan are going were on the verge of a rudd recession after 11 golden years of costello and howard
846866 now of course wed like costello to come back because he can manage the economy and rudd and swan cant
846867 a year ago the conventional wisdom was yep there are problems out there but theres still significant value
846868 there were many contrarians in the market a year two years ago that said the model is still fundamentally a good model but just needed to be reconfigured

846875 dent blames gordon and batman for what happens to rachel
846876 its because gordon built his major crimes unit by including officers who were under a cloud of suspicion
846877 gordon first insinuates that when dent was at internal affairs he had been bringing bogus corruption cases against clean cops in order to build his career
846878 but now i see that he was never really that good to begin with
846879 though i cannot be said to be a flattering honest man it must not be denied but i am a plain dealing villain
846880 if i didnt work with people you investigated when you were making your name at ia id have to work alone i have to do the best i can with the people i have available
846881 now we have freedom and responsibility its a very groovy time
846882 as unions have matured their leaders have realized that it is more efficient to lobby state legislatures on particular provisions than to negotiate district by district every few years as contracts expire
846883 the teacher contract still figures prominently on such issues as teacher pay
846884 on the most critical issues of the teaching profession the state is the real powerhouse
846885 for electricity to flow through all of us we need a closed circuit how do you think we can close it
846886 earl saw a movie of frankenstein when he was a little boy that inspired him with the idea that electricity could actually bring people back to life

846891 i thought it was something that would be nearly impossible to do from home
846892 there are people working full time the pay scale rate identical to what you would make corporately according to your skill sets
846893 you of course want to schedule yourself during the times when there are infomercials running or around meal times because thats when a lot of the restaurants will be calling
846894 when im waiting at the airport my flights been delayed i can pull out my laptop put my headphones on and work

846899 we dare not let down our guard this is an unforgiving epidemic

846904 the environmental summit is a perfect way for us to get input and ideas from the community and elected officials
846905 by gathering ideas from the community we can continue to improve the services our dedicated staff members provide to the residents of galveston county

846907 the plan approved by the galveston county united board of health is designed to make measurable improvements in the health of galveston county

846909 ghf is really pleased to see this type of interest in our employees and naming it for doug is a special incentive to recognize the role of volunteers in the mission of ghf
846910 the doug kanoy fund really sets a great model for others to follow
846911 we hope that other donors step forward to add support to the philanthropic vision of mr leopold and mr evans so that the fund will increase in years to come allowing for greater participation
846912 we are extremely proud of the many heroic and brave achievements of our son and brother gerard
846913 he brought honour not only to us his family but the whole country when he became the first irishman to summit k2 on friday
846914 the last few days have been a rollercoaster of emotions as we celebrated with joy his historic achievement and now must try to come to terms with the untimely loss of a great son brother and friend
846915 mr mcdonnell had climbed everest in 2003 but was unsuccessful during an attempt on k2 in 2006
846916 i was on numerous expeditions with ger and he was one of the best climbers in the world
846917 he was safe fast and strong but that isnt anything in the face of nature
846918 gerards love of mountain climbing was surpassed only by his love for his family and friends

846928 the flag of la antigua guatemala it is green because as you mentioned the people of antigua are known as panzas verdes green bellies why green bellies it is a nickname from the amounts of avocados they ate in the past
846929 i know theres legislation which describes to the t what a guatemalan flag is supposed to look like but like always in guatemala laws are beautiful abstract texts that live inside very dusty books reality dictates that the guatemalan flag can be blue any blue really with or without the emblem or coat of arms

846940 ive got a terrible secret ive never read george eliots
846941 im terribly ashamed of not having read the joy of sex first of all because it is a great cultural totem of the late 20th century and secondly because ive reached the age of 33 without the special contribution it could have made to my life but im sure it could have improved my life a little bit and other peoples possibly a lot more
846942 but while western expats flock to the city and skyscrapers reach upwards locals are becoming increasingly alienated by the foreigners flocking to their homeland and are enjoying precious few benefits from the experience ordinary people have no way for their voice to be heard except in the streets and mosques where fury is reportedly growing
846943 when you are taking a bath in the bathroom you are unable to see the one opposite us it does not mean there is pollution therefore we should approach the issue from a right angle which sometimes involves common sense when asked how to judge the sky with a deep blue or ashes
846944 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change but if we grab hold of that common thread and pull it hard all of these complex problems begin to unravel and we will find that were holding the answer to all of them right in our hand the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
846945 there are few places in the world where the cause and effect of global warming are so closely juxtaposed an hours drive from the glacier the road passes coal fired power plants and factories that belch carbon and sulphur into the sky
846946 the wars featured several innovations most significantly the modern pa these were maori fortifications engineered to nullify the british advantage in superior weaponry and numbers which consisted of anti artillery bunkers and fighting trenches defenders could sit out artillery bombardments then decimate storming parties from concealed firing positions pa were formidable defences and british forces suffered heavy losses when attacking pa

846951 did i imply somewhere that all guerrilla warfare throughout history is maoist in origin mao wrote an impressive book on the subject you might want to have a read but to imply that ive insisted that he was advising the picts makes you sound a trifle unbalanced

846959 the suburbs are already being hit in the face of expensive fuel and crashing property prices the one time embodiment of a certain american dream will become crime ridden dotted by empty lots and home to the poor and unemployed that is already happening as crime and gang violence has risen in many suburban areas and tens of thousands of homes have been repossessed because of the mortgage crisis in effect suburbs will become the new inner cities even as once abandoned american downtowns are undergoing a remarkable renaissance even malls the ultimate symbol of american life since the war are undergoing a crisis as consumers start to stay away

846989 but the solitary aspect of running appealed to me i joined an athletics club and within three months of starting training was asked to represent england in some races
846990 it started with me cutting out foods i considered unacceptable which was anything high calorie but that soon became any carbohydrates or fats then anything other than certain vegetables salads or fruits
846991 in the meantime i began doing frantic exercise programmes pushing my body to physical extremes training twice a day or more
846992 i had bed sores and my knee bones rubbed together when i walked my blood pressure was low and my heart rate slow but i still wanted to run and still didnt want to eat
846993 i starved myself until i was left with a black and white choice between eating or dying
846994 i would consume other peoples leftovers and even found myself rummaging through dustbins to get my fix i hated myself afterwards and would vomit and starve myself again
846995 at one world cross country championship i can confidently say that of six of us in the great britain junior womens team four had some form of eating disorder
846996 it is so common in the sport yet no coach or team manager ever expressed concern i was never told that i was too thin and was never withdrawn from a race because of my weight
846997 outside of sport people would think i ate too little and exercised too much but within athletics my behaviour was not only accepted but endorsed and encouraged
846998 there were lots of others like me so it was easy to hide
846999 on international trips virtually all the girls had weird eating habits
847000 you would look around and see top runners eating just the inside of a bread roll for a meal and it sort of confirmed that it was ok not to eat
847001 eating disorders are not easy to explain as each case has a range of psychological factors unique to the sufferer
847002 there is always going to be a higher number of sufferers in sports where thinness is normal because they provide an environment for vulnerable personal types to exacerbate and conceal their disordered behaviour
847003 lose some weight and the oxygen goes directly to the working muscles instead enabling faster and more efficient running
847004 but the danger is that some runners then get caught up in the mindset that they need to be even thinner to be a winner there is actually a thin line between an optimum racing weight and one that is too low and it is easy to overstep the mark
847005 the body has a tremendous ability to cope with calorie deprivation for a while
847006 eventually though it becomes too weak to sustain the activity becomes prone to viruses and stress fractures and has to draw on all its reserves just to stay alive
847007 i was so weak and undernourished that i didnt have the energy to sprint for the line
847008 there are female athletes whose coaches call them tank thighs or lardy legs or make repeated remarks about the size of their arses
847009 for someone who has underlying insecurities such comments can be a trigger for them to start cutting down on food
847010 its been a long struggle but my christian faith and my fianc lewis have really helped me
847011 i will enjoy watching the triumphs at the olympics but part of me will be deeply saddened by the sight of athletes who are there even winning medals at the expense of their health its not worth it

847103 the singular feature of the great crash of 1929 was that the worst continued to worsen what looked one day like the end proved on the next day to have been only the beginning nothing could have been more ingeniously designed to maximize the suffering and also to ensure that as few as possible escaped the common misfortune the fortunate speculator who had funds to answer the first margin call presently got another and equally urgent one and if he met that there would still be another in the end all the money he had was extracted from him and lost the man with the smart money who was safely out of the market when the first crash came naturally went back in to pick up bargains not only were a recorded 12 894 650 shares sold on 24 october precisely the same number were bought the bargains then suffered a ruinous fall even the man who waited out all of october and all of november who saw the volume of trading return to normal and saw wall street become as placid as a produce market and who then bought common stocks would see their value drop to a third or a fourth of the purchase price in the next twenty four months the coolidge bull market was a remarkable phenomenon the ruthlessness of its liquidation was in its own way equally remarkable

847121 ethnic weapons that wipe out one race and leave another unharmed could soon be developed according to leading geneticist carl larsen a norwegian said recently ethnic weapons would employ differences in human genetic configurations to make genetic variations which would make genocide a particularly attractive form of war im quoting this is not my opinion writing in the u s army military review larsen argues that enzyme levels can vary according to race the absence of certain enzymes can cause death enzyme deficiency could be exploited by chemical warfare
847122 more genetic research was needed before ethnic weapons became a practical reality

847244 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china

847252 surprising as it may sound the mind exists in and for an integrated organism our minds would not be the way they are if it were not for the interplay of body and brain during evolution during individual development and at the current moment the mind had to be first about the body or it could not have been on the basis of the ground reference that the body continuously provides the mind can then be about many other things real and imaginary this idea is anchored in the following statements 1 the human brain and the rest of the body constitute an indissociable organism integrated by means of mutually interactive biochemical and neural regulatory circuits including endocrine immune and autonomic neural components 2 the organism interacts with the environment as an ensemble the interaction is neither of the body alone nor of the brain alone 3 the physiological operations that we call mind are derived from the structural and functional ensemble rather than from the brain alone mental phenomena can be fully understood only in the context of an organisms interacting in an environment that the environment is in part a product of the organisms activity itself merely underscores the complexity of interactions we must take into account

847280 the hippocampus is envisioned as critically involved in the rapid encoding of events as associations among stimulus elements and context in the encoding of episodes as sequences of events and in linking episodes by common features into relational networks that support flexible inferential memory expression
847281 associations among stimuli actions and places that compose discreet events
847282 the organisation of an episode as a sequence of events that unfolds over time
847283 mediated by declarative and non declarative strategies involving distinct memory systems and these forms of representation are independant
847284 the hippocampus rapidly learns about individual experiences and prevents interference by separating representations of those experiences whereas the cortex gradually extracts regularities over many experiences
847285 a prevalent property of hippocampal firing patterns involves the representation of unique associations of stimuli their significance specific behaviours and the places where these events occur
847286 the hippocampal network encodes routes through space as a meaningful sequence of events that characterise a particular spatially extended experience
847287 compelling evidence for the notion that some hippocampal cells represent common features among the various episodes that could serve to link memories obtained in separate experiences

847311 the by election could either be the beginning of the end or a call to action which unites the labour party from top to bottom there is no doubt that millions of people on fixed income are feeling insecure and we need to demonstrate we are the party of fairness and aspiration there are no quick fixes or easy solutions we need to roll up our sleeves and show the discipline and unity which is non negotiable if we are to earn the right to a fourth term

847355 we had a great tournament but made one mistake too many
847356 we were lacking of power against a great spanish team we couldnt keep up with them

847416 his statement in a foreign financial newspaper recently that he would take over the government on sept 16 has caused irreparable damage to the countrys economy
847417 it caused many potential foreign investors who were planning to set up their businesses in malaysia to review their plans this shows that anwar doesnt care and will do whatever it takes to become the prime minister
847418 anwar has now shown his true colours he is a man who cannot be trusted and i hope the malays will fight him by rejecting him in the coming by election in permatang pauh

847429 i think the time has come for me to speak out about something that has been troubling me for a long time i have not found the words to say it sensitively and then i realised that is the whole point
847430 instead we prefer moral neutrality a refusal to make judgments about what is good and bad behaviour right and wrong behaviour bad good right wrong these are words that our political system and our public sector scarcely dare use any more
847431 of course as soon as a politician says this there is a clamour
847432 our relationships crack up our marriages break down we fail as parents and as citizens just like everyone else but if the result of this is a stultifying silence about things that really matter we re double the failure refusing to use these words

847553 well i discovered this gift pretty young and i wanted to help the government so i told the cia about my gift and in no time they had me jetting from country to country sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders because no one figured a dog would be eavesdropping
847554 the jetting around really tired me out and i knew i wasnt getting any younger and i wanted to settle down so i signed up for a job at the fbi doing some undercover security work mostly wandering near suspicious characters and listening in i uncovered some incredible dealings there and was awarded a batch of medals had a wife a mess of puppies and well thats all in the past and now im just retired
847555 that dog is absolutely amazing why on earth are you selling him so cheap

847564 young womens breasts are dense and if they get mammograms their breasts show up very white on mammograms and cancer shows up as white
847565 but as women get older their breasts are less dense and show up gray on a mammogram which makes it easy to identify the white cancer if there is a family history and women are worried they can start earlier and in this case a digital mammography may work better than a traditional mammography
847566 in fact most of the women who get mastectomies dont need them
847567 and for women to lose their breasts in addition to the normal emotional turmoil that they go through having breast cancer is harmful emotionally and physically
847568 women with early stage breast cancer usually do not need a mastectomy and will benefit from chemotherapy almost always
847569 women who get a lumpectomy will need radiation and thats the difference women who get a mastectomy will not need radiation but with a lumpectomy you always need radiation
847570 breast cancer in women younger than 30 is so rare and this is one of the things that concerns me
847571 i think the media focuses on young women because its so shocking when someone in their 20s gets cancer but what you end up with are women in their 20s and 30s who are terrified that theyre going to get cancer and women in their 50s who think they dont need to worry about it when the opposite is true
847572 its still a significant number but when you compare it to the overall number of women who get breast cancer its a small percentage
847573 what makes it fatal is if it goes into other parts of the body and gets into the lymph nodes lungs and other organs
847574 also if it gets into the blood or the bones it can kill a person thats the risk of metastasized cancer that means it has spread and once it hits the lymph nodes it can become out of control

847618 how could jesus dismiss part of the law in the same breath that he criticized the pharisees for dismissing gods commandments
847619 it is the common practice of all the great scholars of galilee to do so
847620 nothing that a man eats can defile him because it doesnt enter his heart
847621 these are the things which defile the man but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man
847622 why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders but eat their bread with impure hands
847623 rightly did isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites as it is written
847624 neglecting the commandment of god you hold to the tradition of men
847625 you are experts at setting aside the commandment of god in order to keep your tradition
847626 for moses said honor your father and your mother and he who speaks evil of father or mother is to be put to death mark 7 11 but you say if a man says to his father or his mother whatever i have that would help you is corban that is to say given to god mark 7 12 you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or his mother mark 7 13 thus invalidating the word of god by your tradition which you have handed down and you do many things such as that
847627 are you so lacking in understanding also do you not understand that whatever goes into the man from outside cannot defile him mark 7 19 because it does not go into his heart but into his stomach and is eliminated
847628 that which proceeds out of the man that is what defiles the man
847629 for from within out of the heart of men proceed the evil thoughts fornications thefts murders adulteries
847630 all these evil things proceed from within and defile the man
847631 are you so lacking in understanding also do you not understand that whatever goes into the man from outside cannot defile him mark 7 19 because it does not go into his heart but into his stomach and is eliminated
847632 the gentiles must be circumcised and required to obey the law of moses

847634 the average biotech bull market has been good for 566 gains in under three years
847635 biotech giant genentech shot up as big pharmaceutical company roche offered to buy it out completely

847637 come on you rascals i know you couldnt do it let me lower my standard for you
847638 so it shall be when all of these things have come upon you the blessing and the curse which i have set before you and you call them to mind in all nations where the lord your god has banished you
847639 if your outcasts are at the ends of the earth from there the lord your god will gather you and from there he will bring you back
847640 the lord your god will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed and you shall possess it and he will prosper you and multiply you more than your fathers
847641 moreover the lord your god will circumcise your heart and the heart of your descendants to love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul so that you may live
847642 the lord your god will inflict all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate you who persecuted you
847643 and you shall again obey the lord and observe all his commandments which i command you today
847644 when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah jer 31 32 not like the covenant which i made with their fathers in the day i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of egypt my covenant which they broke although i was a husband to them
847645 but this is the covenant which i will make with the house of israel after those days
847646 i will put my law within them and on their heart i will write it and i will be their god and they shall be my people
847647 they will not teach again each man his neighbor and each man his brother saying know the lord for they will all know me from the least of them to the greatest of them
847648 for i will forgive their iniquity and their sin i will remember no more
847649 then the offspring of israel also will cease from being a nation before me forever
847650 if the heavens above can be measured and the foundations of the earth searched out below then i will also cast off all the offspring of israel for all that they have done
847651 for i will take you from the nations gather you from all the lands and bring you into your own land
847652 then i will sprinkle clean water on you and you will be clean i will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols
847653 moreover i will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you and i will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh
847654 i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you will be careful to observe my ordinances
847655 that you make all things according to the pattern which was shown you on the mountain
847656 how could any commandment be set aside given jesus words alone
847657 you are a jew yet you live like a gentile and not like a jew how is it then that you force gentiles to follow jewish customs
847658 do not call anything impure that god has made clean
847659 it is against our law for a jew to associate with a gentile or visit him
847660 these things are good to do but theyre not going to save you
847661 as one who is in the lord jesus i am fully convinced that no food is unclean in itself all food is clean
847662 but food does not bring us near to god we are no worse if we do not eat and no better if we do
847663 the gentiles must be circumcised and required to obey the law of moses
847664 for this commandment which i command you today is not too difficult for you nor is it out of reach
847665 it is not in heaven that you should say who will go
847666 but the word is very near you in your mouth and in your heart that you may observe it
847667 unless you are circumcised according to the custom of moses you cannot be saved
847668 it is necessary to circumcise them and to direct them to observe the law of moses
847669 brethren you know that in the early days god made a choice among you
847670 and god who knows the heart testified to them giving them the holy spirit just as he also did to us
847671 now therefore why do you put god to the test by
847672 but we believe that we are saved through the grace of the lord jesus in the same way as they also are
847673 therefore it is my judgment that we do not trouble those who are turning to god from among the gentiles
847674 for moses from ancient generations has in every city those who preach him since he is read in the synagogues every sabbath
847675 you are a priest forever in the order of melchizedek
847676 what then is to be done they will certainly hear that you have come
847677 therefore do this that we tell you we have four men who are under a vow

847680 a gentleman who had never in his life experienced a days illness and who was constantly in the habit of drinking half a bottle of madeira wine after his dinner was taken ill three hours after dinner with a severe pain in the stomach and violent bowel colic which gradually yielded within twelve hours to the remedies prescribed by his medical adviser the day following he drank the remainder of the same bottle of wine which was left the preceding day and within two hours afterwards he was again seized with the most violent colliquative pains headach shiverings and great pain over the whole body his apothecary becoming suspicious that the wine he had drank might be the cause of the disease ordered the bottle from which the wine had been decanted to be brought to him with a view that he might examine the dregs if any were left the bottle happening to slip out of the hand of the servant disclosed a row of shot wedged forcibly into the angular bent up circumference of it on examining the beads of shot they crumbled into dust the outer crust defended by a coat of black lead with which the shot is glazed being alone left unacted on whilst the remainder lead and arsenic the shot being a compound of these metals which no doubt had produced the mischief

847684 the duty upon strong beer is ten shillings a barrel and upon table beer it is two shillings the beer that is at a price exceeding the price of table beer without the strong beer duty being paid in the next place the brewer suffers because the retailer gets table or mild beer and retails it as strong beer
847685 if any common brewer shall mix or suffer to be mixed any strong beer
847686 they are generally brewers who carry on the double trade of brewing both strong and table beer it is almost impossible to prevent them from mixing one with the other and frauds of very great extent have been detected and the parties punished for that offence one brewer at plymouth evaded duties to the amount of 32 000 pounds and other brewers who brew party guiles of beer carrying on the two trades of ale and table beer brewers where the trade is a victualling brewer which is different from the common brewer he being a person who sells only wholesale the victualling brewer being a brewer and also a seller by retail
847687 more particularly i speak from having had great experience from the informations and evidence which i have received that the retailers carry on a most extensive fraud upon the public in purchasing stale table beer or the bottoms of casks there are a class of men who go about and sell such beer at table beer price to public victuallers who mix it in their cellars if they receive beer from their brewers which is mild they purchase stale beer and if they receive stale beer they purchase common table beer for that purpose and many of the prosecutions are against retailers for that offence
847688 paris is great on tv and bosses over her have been keen to snap her up for ages fronting her own show in the uk for the first time is a big risk but producers are confident they have a ratings hit they are shelling out a fortune not just on paris but also on production costs
847689 the full language of the human situation can be the vehicle of truth
847690 obama did you know hes black doesnt belong among previous presidents
847691 you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know
847692 i am horrified for different reasons because to me both sides have killed children
847693 allah willing i will get the chance to kill more israelis
847694 this time yesterday i was still in their hands but right now there is nothing id like more than to face them again
847695 no one cut off his ears tore out his fingernails or raped him he ate three meals a day watched television and read newspapers he was even allowed to study at one of israels open universities where he received an academic degree
847696 at lga half the people walking around could be bad guys
847697 you lebanese are all in a huff that america tries to protect herself and her guests from islamic fascists yet you regularly roll over for hizbullah
847698 cost hizbullah over 7 billion more than 1 200 dead and 4 500 wounded lebanese citizens
847699 shameful to see members of the government in beirut join the celebrations of hizbullah
847700 if i were convinced that america is a safer place because i get hassled at the airport i might put up with it but i doubt it i expect my story is similar to hundreds of thousands of people who are on this list and find themselves inconvenienced
847701 members of congress nuns war heroes and other suspicious characters with names like robert johnson and gary smith have become trapped in the kafkaesque clutches of this list with little hope of escape
847702 putting a million names on a watch list is a guarantee that the list will do more harm than good by interfering with the travel of innocent people and wasting huge amounts of our limited security resources on bureaucratic wheel spinning
847703 causes the deaths of over 1 million innocent iraqis all on the basis of a big fat lie
847704 how many innocent lebanese infants died at the hands on your beloved israelis hundreds thousands who is the bigger terrorist here
847705 this means that it will be a criminal offence to belong to fundraise and encourage support for the military wing of the organization
847706 hezbollahs military wing is providing active support to militants in iraq who are responsible for attacks both on coalition forces and on iraqi civilians including providing training in the use of deadly roadside bombs
847707 hezbollahs military wing also provides support to palestinian terrorist groups in the occupied palestinian territories such as palestinian islamic jihad it is because of this support for terrorism in iraq and the occupied palestinian territories that the government has taken this action
847708 but it sends out a clear message that we condemn hezbollahs violence and support for terrorism
847709 the release of the prisoners thanks to the german mediator is a huge failure for the policies of israel
847710 the success of hezbollah in the negotiations led by a third party is a national success for the party and for the struggle of the lebanese because it secured national goals which israel always refused to respect
847711 you dont like this ministry mr aoun then fuck offffff back to france

847716 hizb is hoping that by lending an olive branch to m14 that it will heal some of the wounds of their strong arm tactic back in may and will enable them to get back in the good graces of the lebanese whom they have shamelessly violated
847717 it is even sadder when the so called leaders of the cedar revolution such as jumblat and hariri rejoice at his return is there anyone left with a shred of conscience in this miserable place called lebanon is there anyone left with the courage to speak up and tell all the lebanese that samir kuntar is the epitome of evil on this earth
847718 the hero motevasselian one of the four diplomats kidnapped in lebanon and

847723 rami makhluf uses his access to high level syrian government insiders to enrich himself at the expense of the syrian people
847724 we will continue to target makhluf and his commercial empire as well as others who follow in his footsteps
847725 to have contributed to or to have benefited from the public corruption of senior officials of the syrian regime
847726 now the syrians must prove that they truly intend to play a responsible role to bring about peace and security in the middle east and that they want to work together constructively
847727 if syria aims to show its good will with this announcement then it could also follow up with good deeds and that would include for example a readiness to ensure that the alleged at least never ruled out weapons smuggling over the land route to the hezbollah militias is stopped
847728 we want to see actions now because enough words have been exchanged
847729 syria has fulfilled its obligations regarding the conflict in lebanon
847730 it is imperative that all of the middle eastern countries sit at the table together

847741 thank you for everything michel aoun if you give the lebanese outside lebanon the rights to vote i will vote for you or any opposition leader that you will name on and i will even come and live in lebanon because i know christians rights are back because of you specially for the armenians and i am not armenian please someone can tell me how the march 14 got christians lebanese rights when they asked to seperate the army in two in those 2 last weeks all they want is to seperate all the lebanese and do a civil war worse than irak pro americans shame on you thank you
847742 christians rights are back because of you specially for the armenians
847743 march 14 asked to seperate the army in two in those 2 last weeks all they want is to seperate all the lebanese and do a civil war worse than irak
847744 the recent operation in lebanon was just that a demonstration
847745 can it get worst http abumuqawama blogspot com 2008 05 nasrallahs dumb speech html heh unfortunately ramzim i am pretty sure there are a lot more people who think that way than most of us would like to believe thats whats most discouraging about this most of reasonable folks know that they will disagree with each other but we also realize that as long as we are dealing with reasonable folks on the other side there is hope that we might convince them or for that matter that they might convince us this is at the very basis of civilized debate and is the heart of what makes blogging debating democracy free media a useful platform for exchanging ideas the problem is when youre dealing with people who are not reasonable and i use the term here in its most literal sense the ability to reason and logic in a rational way then it makes almost everything were doing here pretty moot which is very discouraging after all whats the point of blogging writing debating educating if the other party is not at least a bit open to debate theres a reason we dont waste time trying to argue or reason with our pets dogs cats fish etc its a waste of time obviously because a pet or an inanimate object for that matter are incapable of reason sometimes when reading the above comment or the one i posted earlier i wonder if there are enough lebanese out there that are this devoid of reason why do we bother at all funny how all the well spoken commentaators share aouns dislike i am as baffled as anyone else by his blinded group of supposedly educated
847746 the 11 will act as a stone wall to all major decisions
847747 no really we mean it this time were not gonna tolerate civil strife
847748 come on now youre not being reasonable didnt you hear our warnings this is for real we really are serious
847749 i have no idea what are the foundations for the expectations that ha will give up its weapons
847750 there will be hope for lebanon once the voters start demanding accountability from these pols
847751 sol seems to be under the impression that suleiman is going to take a stand be a real leader and start breaking some heads
847752 but one fears the day they start terrorizing them out of their own homes
847753 the sadness burdening your souls is due to a feeling of humiliation and to the pangs of conscience this should constitute a motive to consolidate your unity and cohesion by taking advantage of the past
847754 president michel suleiman told a hizbullah delegation thursday israel is the
847755 repercussions that reflect negatively on national principles topped by the national resistance
847756 president michel suleiman told a hizbullah delegation thursday israel is the
847757 repercussions that reflect negatively on national principles topped by the national resistance
847758 they accuse us of terrorism so lets serve terrorist bread why not
847759 my goal was to make people laugh before they ask me why weapons the important thing is that they laugh
847760 it attracts customers in an unconventional way you noticed the moment i opened the restaurant there was a lot of business
847761 22 10 un chief ban ki moon welcomed the agreement on the exchange of prisoners between hezbollah and lebanon and hopes this will be implemented soonest possible he hopes this will lead to further implementation of other points in the un resolution 1701 and the improvement of the security situation in the area
847762 had we not accepted this then something worse would have happened
847763 the election of a president even if he is the troubling michel suleiman opens a new phase in lebanon one in which it is possible to imagine consolidating a state gradually breaking free from syrias grip
847764 hizbullah has been about the negation of the state if the post doha process is about the building of a state then the party and that state will eventually clash
847765 just take the clerics and politicos out of the way and see what we can do
847766 giving a veto power to hizbolla mind you it is only a veto power as long as the aounists vote with him and only on limited issues only and they have no right to resign is like retracting the two government decisions regarding the communication network and the airport secruity since they are both irrelevant to hizbolla
847767 hizbullah and amal movement tend toward nominating hariri as prime minister to defuse sectarian tension
847768 hizbullah will not approve a ministerial statement that would not acknowledge the legitimacy of the resistance
847769 what it is is a militia that given an opportunity decided to turn its guns on its own people it is never going to live that down
847770 so for all those who are planning tourist trips to lebanon and rejoicing the summer vacation to come at the expense of the nation
847771 still the question isnt about hizbo or nass its about the brainwashed masses and their insistence how to reach out to a wider audience is what m14 should be looking at before the next elections
847772 the lebanese are lebanons real problem they love it far more or less than they should they also err in how they love they love it from artery to artery
847773 the regime in tehran and ha by extension is driven by one thing only destroy israel at any cost
847774 it is forbidde for any moslem state to have commercial and diplomatic relations with israel and it is the duty of all moslems to oppose such relations by every means available any businessman having commercial dealings with israel its representatives or its agents is a traitor to islam and to all moslems
847775 holy war means the conquest of all non moslem territories the final aim of which is to put koranic lawin power from one end of the earth to the other
847776 whatabout your leader how can you trust him look at his past
847777 we shall have 30 blonde people in parliament and there must be x blondes in the cabinet
847778 ideas both when they are right and when they are wrong are more powerful than commonly understood indeed the world is ruled by nothing else practical men who believe themselves to be exempt from intellectual influences are usually the slaves of some defunct thinker
847779 which seems to have come to the conclusion that lebanon cannot be the birthplace of its middle east project
847780 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
847781 how could you dissipate my suspicion and bring me to your side
847782 the president in lebanon is just above a figure head
847783 when war broke out in lebanon in 1975 jumblatt warned that
847784 there seems to be a death squad targeting people based on a list of names it is a continuation of the military operations carried out by hezbollah in beirut and the mountain and is aimed at besieging regions where mp saad hariri has influence in the hope of deterring residents there until the legislative elections are held
847785 he also called for setting up a procedure for liaising with people who are threatened and assaulted amid reports of a number of citizens being followed or finding themselves under surveillance by some partisans
847786 i believe saniora called them partisans and not criminals as an exercise in politically correct newspeak criminals are any thug off the street partisans belong to a group the old sly devil was hinting
847787 you guys go ahead and sing your kuluna lik watan and celebrate on martyrs square but absolutely nothing has changed
847788 if youre so damned smart why is it your country is constantly mired in war why is it you havent put a man on the moon yet or accomplished anything significant as a people since the invention of the alphabet or whatever that dumb accomplishment 5000 years ago that everyone is so proud of
847789 march 14 won the elections with amal ha alliance the it did not come into play till december 2005
847790 the main raison daitre of the alliance was is to rid themselves of the syrian influence they had sucked egg too long 30 years
847791 do you thing ha will not invaded beirut in 2005 6 7 if the government took any decisions that were against their wishes do you think bashar was going to let them be
847792 but please do not oversimplify just because you want to attack march 14
847793 march 14 made a lot of mistakes like abandoning their shia independents among others however them the breaks
847794 if you think it is easy putting down 40 of the population after 25 years of ha rule of integrating them into hizbastan and brainwashing them intto believing that ha is their sole protector then good for you
847795 to begin with m14 did not need ha amal alliance to win any elections
847796 rolling over and playing dead is not what i consider to be taking decisive action do you
847797 throughout history when a force invaded a country the people of that country would divide this was the state in lebanon in 1982 people break into numerous groups
847798 what is important to us is lebanon and its future and the relationship between the lebanese parties and the lebanese state and its respect for the uniqueness what is special of the lebanese society
847799 the relationship between ha and the state must be clearified at the military level in order to subject the defensive strategy to a definition through national dialogue
847800 he blinked 20 times as opposed to 50 and that means he is afraid
847801 there are non violent ways of dealing with israel and bringing justice finally for the palestinians
847802 how can i make it better and or where did i fail you
847803 decision as for mufti amin hes considered one of the main components of march 14 movement ak you were upset when in a prior post when i equated ha with the shia in lebanon heres the proof that ha has taken total control of every shia voice and are muzzling the few faint ones
847804 holy war means the conquest of all non moslem territories it is therefore necessary for the islamic government first to be created under the authority of the imam in order that he may undertake the conquest
847805 anynonreligious power is necessarily an atheistuc power the tool of satan
847806 in this democracy islamic republic the laws are not madeby the will of the people but only by the koran and the sunna
847807 it is forbidden for any moslem state to have commercial and diplomatic relations with countries which play the role of puppets for the great powers as is the case with israel and it is the duty of all moslemsto oppose such relations by every means available
847808 i was in lebanon a few weeks back and was incredulous to hear people in the street hoping for israel and or america bail them out
847809 who will stand up for the poor the down trodden and the disinherited
847810 defense strategy will be implemented after the liberation of shebaa
847811 after carefully studying the deal struck in doha we came to the conclusion that lebanon lost as a result the veto power given to the opposition which is openly serving iranian and syrian interests is a black day for freedom democracy and the rule of law we currently expect that the weapons of hezbollah will become the tool of a never ending blackmail scheme with the final aim of complete domination of lebanon politically paving the way for the establishment of the so called wilayat al faqih we draw attention to the fact that no serious discussions of these weapons were undertaken in the doha talks due to hezbollah intransigence and its insistence not to do so we also observe that the so called electoral law affects only beirut in favor of the opposition in the next election whereas hezbollah controlled areas came out unscathed from such law that means expect hezb and co to form the next government after 2009 elections we do not expect much from general suleiman as president his poor performance during the last invasion of w beirut and the mountain is indicative of the way he will handle security and social peace during his tenure we expect him to be another lahood type syrian stooge there are strong suspicions that leads one to believe that the army under his leadership colluded with the hezb thugs in carrying out the occupation of w beirut so suleimans allegiance will rest not with the fa ade of his democratic election in parliament but rather with the forces which brought about an actual coup which is a first in lebanon we fear that this will set a precedent and we expect such coups to become a common feature in lebanese politics in the future
847812 president michel sulieman slams hizbollah and calls for immediate disarmament
847813 the shabaa farms issue was discussed during talks between sarkozy and president michel suleiman who saw an israeli withdrawal from the area
847814 russian ambassador sergei poukine from the baabda presidential palace we have high expectations that all lebanese leaders will unify their positions
847815 the only way we can have peace is if we all agree
847816 law gets its legitimacy primarily from the social contract and the consent of the governed
847817 in the heat of battle soldiers do not commit acts of heroism and sacrifice for ideas such as freedom liberty etc but they do it for their comrades in their company or platoon that was an eye opener for me but i have no idea whether it is in general true or not
847818 how would one explain the frenchmen who fought in the american revolution or the americans who fought in the spanish civil war or even the arabs who fought the russians in afghanistan
847819 no other country in the world even comes close to the us in the number of immigrants applying for citizenship every year
847820 apparently not all immigrants are equal sacrifices service or not
847821 it is true that they have a veto but we hope that they do not use it to disrupt lebanon

847829 anyone even the most incompetent idiot is better than no president
847830 you were given the choice between war and dishonor you chose dishonor and you will have war
847831 but its strength is in deferring to the states institutions and committing parties to never resorting to violence to achieve political gains
847832 over the past weeks jumblatt and hariri and others were driven by a single idea avoiding war
847833 so i hope bv and others who seem to keep promoting war mongering and partition can finally get this through their heads hezbostan is only a figment of bvs imagination
847834 this country folks cannot survive another civil war between its communities

847839 a writer and geopolitical analyst based in ottawa who specializes on the middle east he is currently research associate at the centre for research on globalization

847841 created by the iranian mullahs for the sole purpose of establishing on the ground the conditions that will favour the return of the lost imam
847842 qatar has suggested that the pro and anti government leaders meeting in doha postpone a decision over the controversial electoral law and move directly to the election of army commander gen michel suleiman as president it also proposed the formation of a unity government of 30 ministers with 13 from the parliamentary majority 10 from the opposition and seven to be chosen by the elected president
847843 hezbollahs tactic in doha what is ours is ours what is yours is negotiable
847844 we forgot the palestinian cause and at times acted outside our core arab principles
847845 we were not calling for sovereignty in order to isolate lebanon but if anyone imagines that mp walid jumblatt will abandon his history they would be totally wrong
847846 we will not beg for any alliance or any position we had our independent position within march 14 coalition and we believe that we should provide new open horizons and directions this is the conviction of the march 14 alliance as well as that of walid jumblatt
847847 jumblatts talk of arabism and palestine is not a love note to hizbollah it is a flirtation with damascus and it may not be an altogether bad thing god forgive me

847939 the closed fundamentalist doctrines that cannot co exist with other belief systems the world as it is must be erased to make way for their purist invention rooted in biblical fantasies of great floods and great fires it is a logic that leads ineluctably towards violence
847940 an economic system that requires constant growth while bucking almost all serious attempts at environmental regulation generates a steady stream of disasters all on its own whether military ecological or financial the appetite for easy short term profits offered by purely speculative investment has turned the stock currency and real estate markets into crisis creation machines as the asian financial crisis the mexican peso crisis and the dotcom collapse all demonstrate

847945 david and goliath revisited is typically meant to mislead today as it happened about a month ago a palestinian terrorist went on a rampage to kill israeli civilians
847946 the international community has pledged 8 billion in aid to the palestinians now a palestinian human rights agency has detailed systematic torture carried out by the moderate fatah in the west bank as well as by hamas in gaza the jerusalem post reports what happened to detainees in the west bank according to the al haq human rights group majdi jabour a 33 year old construction worker said he was detained on nov 17 by military intelligence in the city of nablus near salem he said interrogators demanded to know where he had hidden the automatic rifle of his late brother a member of the hamas military wing killed by israel in 2002 jabour said he insisted he had no ties to hamas and did not know of a weapon he said that for the next six days he was beaten severely with sticks and fists including on the soles of his feet his legs became so swollen and his feet so sore that he couldnt stand up he said he was also forced to kneel on glasses placed upside down on the floor and made to stand in the cold winter rain for hours jabour said he was taken to nabluss rafidiyeh hospital after an interrogator rammed a screwdriver into his back making him pass out another man from jabours village 50 year old hosni jabara said he was arrested by the preventive security service in nablus on jan 28 and was tied up in painful positions off and on for 32 days at times he was pulled off the ground by a rope hanging from the ceiling and attached to his hands tied behind his back said jabara when will we hear calls from british universities of a boycott of the palestinians on account of their human rights violations
847947 i recently had the great pleasure of meeting roya hakakian an iranian jew whose family was forced to flee the terror of the iranian revolution

847949 the letters dont differ on major points but obamas is extremely focused on the clarity of his message and isnt about to sign onto others roughly similar words or views
847950 but i am deeply concerned that israels security has been put at risk both because of renewed threats from implacable enemies like iran hizbollah and hamas and
847951 does obama really want to go around blaming israels security problems on the u s let alone do it in the same sentence he notes the threats presented by iran hizbollah and hamas well youd certainly be hard pressed to find many people in congress willing to sign on to that notion
847952 anyway the wind blows thats the way obama gos youll see youll see

847956 south africa remains an example of freedom while devaluing and undermining the freedom of others
847957 these are the words of sunday times photographer simphiwe nkwali whose image of a foreign man being burned alive has been included into a harrowing photo journal entitled our country is at a crisis point and still the army has not been brought in to calm the violence the police force has been outgunned in many of the informal settlements where the xenophobic attacks have taken place over 20 people have been brutally killed in a week of xenophobic attacks where not only foreign africans but local south africans in minority tribes have been targeted these scenes remind me of rwanda 1994 not to the scale and of course this violence is not sanctioned by the state but as far as intent of the aggressors is concerned its goringly close simphiwe nkwali is calling on president mbeki to declare a state of emergency and to deal with the thugs with the full force of the law i can imagine the presidents response
847958 you begin to understand why so many south africans are bemoaning a lack of leadership in this country
847959 of course we were aware there was something brewing it is one thing to know there is a social problem and another thing to know when that outburst will occur
847960 it is totally unacceptable and indeed unfortunate that such a huge calamitous violent episode in our country which could have been avoided escaped our intelligence communitys eyes
847961 its very cold at night its almost like one or two degrees its been raining in the last few days
847962 and then legal protection most of them do not have any status no legal status no temporary status

847968 there were a few tense moments on monday when a crowd of several hundred refugees marched to parliament to air their grievances over the recent xenophobic violence
847969 the verdict means we have the right to say france 2 broadcast a fake news report that shooting was a staged hoax and that they duped everybody without being sued
847970 undoubtedly damaging to the honor and reputation of information professionals
847971 it is legitimate for a monitoring agency to investigate the media because of the impact of the images which were reviewed across the world and on the conditions in which the report was filmed and broadcast
847972 did not allow it to rule out the opinion of france 2 professionals
847973 the examination of the rushes makes it no longer possible to dismiss the views of professionals heard during the case
847974 the verdict means we have the right to say france 2 broadcast a fake news report that shooting was a staged hoax and that they duped everybody without being sued
847975 by exchanging prisoners with the proxy organizations like hizbullah as if they were law abiding states israel can be seen as upgrading the status of the organizations unlawful combatants from terrorists and war criminals giving them the same rights as lawful soldiers without demanding from them the reciprocal obligations at the same time israel downgrades the rights of its own captured soldiers by overlooking the organizations systematic depravation of pow rights for israeli soldiers under the geneva conventions
847976 american dominance in global affairs is the foundation on which the status quo rests and everyone knows that it will not last forever

847978 the suicide bombers do not remotely pose a strategic threat to israel
847979 it is an essential part of our moral fibre of our soul
847980 it is a promise we make to every israeli mother that when we send her son or daughter away to fight we will bring them home whatever happens to them
847981 the zionist fantasy the fantastic lie that six million jews were killed
847982 it seems that the interest of the zionist movement however is to inflate this figure of holocaust deaths so that their gains will be greater this led them to emphasize this figure six million in order to gain the solidarity of international public opinion with zionism many scholars have debated the figure of six million and reached stunning conclusions fixing the number of jewish victims at only a few hundred thousand
847983 the zionist movement led a broad campaign of incitement against the jews living under nazi rule to arouse the governments hatred of them to fuel vengeance against them and to expand the mass extermination
847984 when i wrote the other side we were at war with israel
847985 since the ceasefire additional rockets weapons and military equipment have reached hezbollah
847986 we assume they now have about 20 000 rockets of all ranges a bit more than they had before july 12
847987 according to new intelligence obtained by the defense establishment in the four months since the war hizbullah has received weapon convoys carrying short range missiles anti tank missiles and long range missiles most of the weapon convoys crossed into lebanon from syria at night
847988 more than a year after the summer war in southern lebanon ended the united nations said wednesday the hezbollah militia has
847989 deeply disconcerting and stands in stark contradiction to the terms of resolution 1559
847990 hezbollah has tripled its arsenal of c 802 land to sea missiles and has rehabilitated its military strength north of the litani river according to information handed over by israel to the united nations
847991 security resolution 1701 did not work doesnt work and is a failure hizbullah continues to arm itself with syrian assistance
847992 your friends will listen to you if you make them your enemies they will not

847994 there is no documentary evidence for the gassing of even one human being in a german camp
847995 as long as israel is not burned and wholly destroyed peace and tranquility will never prevail in the region
847996 but i personally and in the light of this imaginary tale complain to hitler even saying to him from the bottom of my heart
847997 jews are the most vile criminals on the face of the earth let us give thanks to hitler of blessed memory for taking revenge against the jews although muslims do have a complaint against him hitler that his revenge was not enough
847998 everyone who has been selected believes that israel should exist
847999 not commemorating israel 60th anniversary but instead 6 decades of catastrophe for the palestinian people
848000 the fact the many jews have made aliyah after being a part of habonim is not an occurrence that habonim can claim as her own
848001 in 2003 he was secretary general of habonim a jewish youth movement committed to a progressive jewish identity and to a just resolution of the palestinian israeli conflict
848002 we want to support those palestinians and israelis working to bring an end to the post 1967 israeli occupation to end all human rights abuses and breaches of international law and to move toward peaceful relations and a just settlement
848003 the delegations visit has two purposes they can teach us about political activism abroad and we can show them our situation here
848004 they havent come to learn anything new but to reinforce their anti israel agenda
848005 i do not agree with using apartheid rhetoric because it is inflammatory but i think the comparison is legitimate
848006 one purpose of the visit is to see if indeed the comparison is legitimate in their eyes
848007 we are trying to show them facts on the ground like the wall road blocks and the lack of ability to move freely
848008 after 41 years of occupation it is appropriate for the international community to influence israel to change its policies
848009 a movement for palestinian freedom based on universal human rights
848010 please remember that the maps on former palestinian leader yasser arafats uniform and in palestinian childrens textbooks show a palestine encompassing not only all of the west bank but all of israel while palestinian leaders loudly proclaim that palestine extends from the jordan river to the mediterranean sea from rosh hanikra in the north to rafah in gaza
848011 please remember danielle shefi a little girl in israel danielle was five when the murderers came she hid under her bed palestinian gunmen found and killed her anyway
848012 think of all the other victims of terror in the holy land with rare exceptions the targets were young people children and families please remember that israel having lost too many sons and daughters mothers and fathers desperately wants peace it has learned to trust its enemies threats more than the empty promises of neutral governments
848013 we are jews who hate israel and love hamas and hezbollah
848014 if you are able to volunteer to drive to the various shelters to deliver food clothing etc it would be much appreciated we are looking for assistance in that area as donations are piling up
848015 sustained humanitarian action to bring vital emergency assistance to the victims
848016 the situation is getting worse not better we must make sure that the needs of people forced out of their homes by these attacks often with nothing more than the clothes on their backs are met now and for the forseeable future
848017 it is cold and raining and families often with young children are sleeping on the ground under simple tents putting their health at risk

848021 what the orthodox rabbinate says is what god wants for us
848022 adapting to living in the rapidly changing modernising and industrialising world and throwing off rigid excessive ceremonialism and ritual
848023 we fought apartheid we see no reason to celebrate it in israel
848024 israel is our home and we are not going anywhere
848025 the logic is quite simple the anc rightly hates supporters of south african apartheid if they believe that israel is an apartheid state then they will hate israel and its supporters so if you are a zionist let it be known the anc officially hates you and would probably prefer it if you left south africa if there was no affluence in the local jewish community i wonder whether we would still have our place in the south african sun
848026 we fought apartheid we see no reason to celebrate it in israel now
848027 people of all colours and all faiths should get out of south africa if they have the chance to do so

848064 what were trying to do is take the burden away from the schools so they can focus on teaching and learning
848065 the idea is to build an edumall which is evaluated by its users so that good resources will be highlighted
848066 resources that arent so useful will sink to the bottom of the pile and can be removed as necessary
848067 as edumall grows its going to be very big and this is how people like to work online they want things to be personalised they want to talk to other people to have a home online and the personal space provides that
848068 independent learning for instance students dont always have to go through the teacher

848104 actually this has already been solved 2 months ago to be exact before phusion passenger was released some libraries keep resources open yes but the only things that we have to worry about are open file descriptors we used to close file descriptors upon forking based on a black list of file descriptors to close but we quickly found out that that doesnt work very well and easily resulted in file descriptor leaks so now we close all file descriptors except those that are specified in a white list i e stdin stdout stderr and a few others everything has been working flawlessly since then

848122 investments over the long term in bakery technology distribution systems and information technology have helped make flowers foods one of the most efficient operators in our industry we continue to face the most dramatic cost increases the baking industry has ever experienced but our team remains focused on executing our strategies further improving our efficiencies taking costs out of our business wherever possible and maintaining the quality and value of our products these efforts along with pricing actions helped offset our higher input costs in the quarter and allowed us to achieve another good quarter
848123 as soon as we heard of the interest in robbie those of us who know him wanted the deal to happen
848124 we know what he can add to the side and alongside fernando torres we feel weve a strikeforce to rival any in the premier league
848125 a lot of liverpool fans see similarities to when we signed gary mcallister in 2000 youd hear people say how we should have signed him years ago
848126 its true we have a great attack this year i dont know if this is the strongest attack since ive been at juventus
848127 ive been here nine years and also played with strikers of the calibre of filippo inzaghi and zlatan ibrahimovic
848128 now we have a very interesting quartet and it is certainly the largest offensive department weve had in recent juventus history
848129 we must improve the build up play versus arsenal wasnt always smooth but everything here in the juventus camp is normal
848130 we are working and training very hard we dont take into account the results of these friendlies only the commitment to reaching the champions league
848131 i think you have to be open minded because of the division were in
848132 we want to take somewhat of a look at him
848133 theres a wealth of knowledge in this clubhouse with a few guys
848134 i hope people realize that and take advantage of it
848135 so right now he leads our team in hitting 293 and on base percentage 385
848136 heads up we got one in the zone yups looked like a named player call the boys
848137 its her again way over conned let me tell you
848138 she is not attacking yet just standing here looking at me i think she knows we are up to something
848139 oh gods its another one they are going to take a pick to me any morment hide the rare ore quick
848140 she is going to try and move me again i can just tell cant wait to see the look on her face when i fall a part ha that will teach her
848141 so i was talking to one of the griffens in antonica and oh hang on a sec i have one of those pesky players wanting a ride
848142 it would probably be a post dated contract if he waits that long
848143 if youve laid off and dont get out till that time really the rest of the minor league season is an exercise in futility to waste that protection year
848144 he had major league dehydration it was a combination of flying in from the chicago game a delayed flight he didnt land until 1 in the morning
848145 brian wilson closed in on my timmy and lured him to the new york nightclubs after a long night of unspeakable acts timmy realized that hes about a foot shorter and 200 pounds lighter than brian at which point those last seven limoncellos did him in
848146 i heard he dressed up like josh hamilton for the 1st and 2nd rounds of the home run derby and bombed a bunch of homers then went to save 55 orphans from a burning building during the finals letting the real josh bat for himself id be dehydrated too after that
848147 if i ever think about that the giants are going to be the first to know
848148 its satisfying to come out of the controversy i am happy and now i want to keep playing and take more and more wickets for the country
848149 i was more patient here than the previous test in colombo despite hard work no plan worked in our favour there i also tried to do something different here
848150 i decided to bowl a little bit faster to use the breeze blowing across the ground it helped me to drift the ball
848151 we stuck to our plans and played accordingly we did well in all the departments when it mattered most
848152 the wicket was uneven so i didnt try anything different i thought if i bowl at the right areas i will get assistance from the pitch
848153 with the new bowl if you can get the early breakthroughs it gives you a lot of confidence and also boosts the moral of the team
848154 i pulled out my credit card swiped it at the outside credit card machine waited until i saw the authorization response on the screen lifted the handle placed the pump in my filler and proceeded to fill the tank
848155 akulah jalan dan kebenaran dan hidup tidak ada seorangpun yang datang kepada bapa kalau tidak melalui aku
848156 we had signed them a long time ago and now we are in the process of launching the website at the end of august we are going to make it the most popular cricket website in the world

848159 arpita looked radiant and happy salman arbaaz and sohail love her very much salman walked in when the party was on in a full swing as he was shooting for a television show earlier in the evening
848160 arpita had invited a lot of her friends and everyone had a great time
848161 arpita and arjun called off their relationship a long time ago but are still very good friends
848162 the wickets will be made up of soil brought in from india australia south africa england west indies so that these are similar to the wickets in those countries
848163 so for example if england has to tour india their players can come here and practise on wickets similar to indian wickets before embarking on the tour
848164 it only takes a minute to whip out your card and get into debt but getting out of debt can take years although paying off credit cards is best done sooner rather than later it s not always possible and that s where careful planning will pay off

848216 this weekend we spent the entire day at the beach
848217 thats nothing we spent the entire weekend out on our boat
848218 you think thats great we flew to mazatlan to watch the mating of the wildebeests
848219 bears only the faintest resemblance to most work in the real world
848220 weve done flights to lithuania poland honduras guatemala and mexico
848221 but out of about a dozen cases a year we probably fly only a couple back
848222 i can think of three different scenarios that would have led to a fatal outcome if they had moved her
848223 the good outcome today is due to the treatment that the hospital provided reluctantly and sadly enough only in response to legal and public pressure
848224 or the government should step in and otherwise exercise its authority for deportation or whatever it wants to do
848225 once you take that step for how long are you going to do that a year 10 years 50 years
848226 if a hospital in florida asks if we can take care of a guatemalan patient the tendency is to say yes

848230 al snel bleek ze niet helemaal normaal te zijn ze had gedronken en wilde er met de auto waarin onze rugzakken lagen vandoor maar mijn vriendin kon nog net op tijd instappen
848231 het is gewoon een kwestie van je gezond verstand gebruiken het voordeel als meisje is wel dat je eerder wordt meegenomen
848232 this man does not have a bigoted bone in his body
848233 i have supported hundreds of pieces of legislation which would help americans obtain an equal opportunity in america i am proud of that record from fighting for the recognition of dr martin luther kings birthday in my state to sponsoring specific legislation that would prevent discrimination in any shape or form in america today
848234 in arizona a bill to recognize a holiday honoring mlk failed in the legislature so then gov
848235 in a vote likely to haunt him for the rest of his public career mccain voted against 1983 legislation establishing the third monday in january as the federal holiday marking kings birthday
848236 hes tried to back pedal that this was some youthful ignorance on his part but he was 48 years old when he voted against the mlk holiday
848237 and trust me nothing would make me happier that just isnt going to fly
848238 i am saddened that the house leadership has chosen the washington style path of partisanship by rejecting a good and capable man the secretary of the commonwealth has no i repeat no role in the enforcement of virginias is my source for anti kaine discussion but i wanted to point this out because it really is egregious i know that democrats in conservative areas have to speak in certain ways to communicate and work with their constituencies and the various elites in their areas and that this leads to some inevitable friction but there are certain principles you dont compromise or else getting democrats in office becomes irrelevant supporting right to work laws which make it impossible to organize a union is one of them its just not ok for workers to have no opportunity to stand up for themselves against abusive labor practices someone like kaine shouldnt just be off the table he should be toxic
848239 who will pick a worse running mate obama or mccain
848240 all the obama running mate trial balloons or rumors being bandied about in the media sound absolutely horrible tim kaine joe biden evan bayh
848241 if the media is to believed obama is veering way to the right of the republican party to look for a running mate
848242 mccain of course is obamas most constant saving grace although i suspect that most of the brilliant electorate who gave us 8 years of bush cheney will be easily fooled again and eager to find an excuse to vote for the white man
848243 newsflash obama to most voters campaigns are not an egghead mental olympics between two walking policy platforms theyre that test how candidates respond under fire and for the last several weeks obama has been failing that test crying about mccains attacks and then surrendering to most voters this sends a simple message if obama cant stand up to a babbling incompetent like john mccain how is he ever going to stand up to the oil executives the health care lobby or for that matter osama bin laden class president
848244 finally obama cant afford to repeat the democrats 2004 mistake of trying to run a positive convention of which the democrats were very proud but which produced only a two percent bump in the polls about 1 5th the minimum bump parties usually get
848245 when it took over dow jones amp company in december news corporation said it intended to sell dows ottaway chain of small papers but it shelved the idea for lack of interest
848246 the market capitalization of the journal register company publisher of the new haven register and hundreds of smaller papers fell below 1 million last week down more than 99 percent since the start of 2007 in the same period gatehouse media another publisher of hundreds of small papers has dropped almost 98 percent to a market value under 26 million the sun times media group is down 91 percent to less than 34 million
848247 it suddenly turned the area into a carnage scattering body parts of the street cleaners into a large area
848248 there were pools of blood everywhere i have never seen such mass killing
848249 the organisation is moving ahead with a major power development programme of some 500 million as it positions itself to meet the escalating operational cost of delivering the electricity service
848250 the authority is facing major challenges in meeting the national power demands due to the constraints of rising fuel costs for its diesel power plant
848251 the authority is also actively seeking to have 90 per cent of its generation through clean renewable sources by 2011 this includes working with the private sector to set up renewable energy power plants and selling their energy directly into the fea grid
848252 i replied that i was unable to receive an award from a government that had led russia into such dire straits
848253 putin inherited a ransacked and bewildered country with a poor and demoralized people and he started to do what was possible a slow and gradual restoration these efforts were not noticed nor appreciated immediately in any case one is hard pressed to find examples in history when steps by one country to restore its strength were met favorably by other governments
848254 today i continue to be extremely worried by the slow and inefficient development of local self government but it has finally started to take place in yeltsins time local self government was actually barred on the regulatory level whereas the states vertical of power i e putins centralized and top down administration is delegating more and more decisions to the local population unfortunately this process is still not systematic in character
848255 no i am not afraid of death any more when i was young the early death of my father cast a shadow over me he died at the age of 27 and i was afraid to die before all my literary plans came true but between 30 and 40 years of age my attitude to death became quite calm and balanced i feel it is a natural but no means the final milestone of ones existence
848256 that all those other worlds are only being temporarily prevented by wicked governments or by heavy crises or by their own barbarity or incomprehension from taking the way of western pluralistic democracy and from adopting the western way of life countries are judged on the merit of their progress in this direction however it is a conception which developed out of western incomprehension of the essence of other worlds out of the mistake of measuring them all with a western yardstick the real picture of our planets development is quite different
848257 the most striking feature which an outside observer notices in the west in our days
848258 the western world has lost its civil courage both as a whole and separately in each country each government each political party and of course in the united nations
848259 to an extent their fathers and grandfathers could not even dream about
848260 even biology knows that habitual extreme safety and well being are not advantageous for a living organism
848261 a statesman who wants to achieve something important and highly constructive for his country has to move cautiously and even timidly there are thousands of hasty and irresponsible critics around him parliament and the press keep rebuffing him as he moves ahead he has to prove that every single step of his is well founded and absolutely flawless actually an outstanding and particularly gifted person who has unusual and unexpected initiatives in mind hardly gets a chance to assert himself from the very beginning dozens of traps will be set out for him thus mediocrity triumphs with the excuse of restrictions imposed by democracy
848262 destructive and irresponsible freedom has been granted boundless space society appears to have little defense against the abyss of human decadence such as for example misuse of liberty for moral violence against young people motion pictures full of pornography crime and horror it is considered to be part of freedom and theoretically counter balanced by the young peoples right not to look or not to accept life organized legalistically has thus shown its inability to defend itself against the corrosion of evil
848263 and what shall we say about the dark realm of criminality as such legal frames especially in the united states are broad enough to encourage not only individual freedom but also certain individual crimes the culprit can go unpunished or obtain undeserved leniency with the support of thousands of public defenders when a government starts an earnest fight against terrorism public opinion immediately accuses it of violating the terrorists civil rights there are many such cases
848264 such a tilt of freedom in the direction of evil has come about gradually but it was evidently born primarily out of a humanistic and benevolent concept according to which there is no evil inherent to human nature the world belongs to mankind and all the defects of life are caused by wrong social systems which must be corrected strangely enough though the best social conditions have been achieved in the west there still is criminality and there even is considerably more of it than in the pauper and lawless soviet society
848265 the press too of course enjoys the widest freedom i shall be using the word press to include all media but what sort of use does it make of this freedom here again the main concern is not to infringe the letter of the law there is no moral responsibility for deformation or disproportion what sort of responsibility does a journalist have to his readers or to history if they have misled public opinion or the government by inaccurate information or wrong conclusions do we know of any cases of public recognition and rectification of such mistakes by the same journalist or the same newspaper no it does not happen because it would damage sales a nation may be the victim of such a mistake but the journalist always gets away with it one may safely assume that he will start writing the opposite with renewed self assurance
848266 very well known representatives of your society say we cannot apply moral criteria to politics thus we mix good and evil right and wrong and
848267 no weapons no matter how powerful can help the west until it overcomes its loss of willpower in a state of psychological weakness weapons become a burden for the capitulating side to defend oneself one must also be ready to die there is little such readiness in a society raised in the cult of material well being
848268 how did the west decline from its triumphal march to its present sickness have there been fatal turns and losses of direction in its development it does not seem so the west kept advancing socially in accordance with its proclaimed intentions with the help of brilliant technological progress and all of a sudden it found itself in its present state of weakness
848269 this means that the mistake must be at the root at the very basis of human thinking in the past centuries i refer to the prevailing western view of the world which was first born during the renaissance and found its political expression from the period of the enlightenment it became the basis for government and social science and could be defined as rationalistic humanism or humanistic autonomy the proclaimed and enforced autonomy of man from any higher force above him it could also be called anthropocentricity with man seen as the center of everything that exists
848270 this new way of thinking which had imposed on us its guidance did not admit the existence of intrinsic evil in man nor did it see any higher task than the attainment of happiness on earth it based modern western civilization on the dangerous trend to worship man and his material needs everything beyond physical well being and accumulation of material goods all other human requirements and characteristics of a subtler and higher nature were left outside the area of attention of state and social systems as if human life did not have any superior sense that provided access for evil of which in our days there is a free and constant flow merely freedom does not in the least solve all the problems of human life and it even adds a number of new ones
848271 however in early democracies as in american democracy at the time of its birth all individual human rights were granted because man is gods creature that is freedom was given to the individual conditionally in the assumption of his constant religious responsibility such was the heritage of the preceding thousand years two hundred or even fifty years ago it would have seemed quite impossible in america that an individual could be granted boundless freedom simply for the satisfaction of his instincts or whims subsequently however all such limitations were discarded everywhere in the west a total liberation occurred from the moral heritage of christian centuries with their great reserves of mercy and sacrifice state systems were becoming increasingly and totally materialistic the west ended up by truly enforcing human rights sometimes even excessively but mans sense of responsibility to god and society grew dimmer and dimmer in the past decades the legalistically selfish aspect of western approach and thinking has reached its final dimension and the world wound up in a harsh spiritual crisis and a political impasse all the glorified technological achievements of progress including the conquest of outer space do not redeem the twentieth centurys moral poverty which no one could imagine even as late as in the nineteenth century
848272 as long as we wake up every morning under a peaceful sun we have to lead an everyday life there is a disaster however which has already been under way for quite some time i am referring to the calamity of a despiritualized and irreligious humanistic consciousness
848273 we are now experiencing the consequences of mistakes which had not been noticed at the beginning of the journey on the way from the renaissance to our days we have enriched our experience but we have lost the concept of a supreme complete entity which used to restrain our passions and our irresponsibility we have placed too much hope in political and social reforms only to find out that we were being deprived of our most precious possession our spiritual life in the communist east it is destroyed by the dealings and machinations of the ruling party in the west commercial interests tend to suffocate it this is the real crisis the split in the world is less terrible than the similarity of the disease plaguing its main sections
848274 it would be retrogression to attach oneself today to the ossified formulas of the enlightenment even if we are spared destruction by war our lives will have to change if we want to save life from self destruction we cannot avoid revising the fundamental definitions of human life and human society is it true that man is above everything is there no superior spirit above him is it right that mans life and societys activities have to be determined by material expansion in the first place is it permissible to promote such expansion to the detriment of our spiritual integrity
848275 if the world has not come to its end it has approached a major turn in history equal in importance to the turn from the middle ages to the renaissance it will exact from us a spiritual upsurge we shall have to rise to a new height of vision to a new level of life where our physical nature will not be cursed as in the middle ages but even more importantly our spiritual being will not be trampled upon as in the modern era
848276 this ascension will be similar to climbing onto the next anthropologic stage no one on earth has any other way left but upward

848500 one the indispensable books of the last fifty years not least because it undermined the moral and political legitimacy of the entire communist enterprise it allowed readers on both sides of the iron curtain to encounter totalitarian oppression as though for the first time
848501 at their root was mankinds and solzhenitsyns nemesis ideology unlike the conventional analyses of academic historians and political scientists solzhenitsyns understanding never treated the soviet union as merely one tyranny among others rather it was an ideological regime built upon the twin pillars of violence and lies it was thanks to ideology that the 20th century experienced evildoing on a scale calculated in the millions ideology allowed tyrants and intellectuals alike to justify the unjustifiable and to amplify violence to nearly unimaginable levels
848502 how has this unfavorable relation of forces come about how did the west decline from its triumphal march to its present sickness have there been fatal turns and losses of direction in its development it does not seem so the west kept advancing socially in accordance with its proclaimed intentions with the help of brilliant technological progress and all of a sudden it found itself in its present state of weakness
848503 this means that the mistake must be at the root at the very basis of human thinking in the past centuries i refer to the prevailing western view of the world which was first born during the renaissance and found its political expression from the period of the enlightenment it became the basis for government and social science and could be defined as rationalistic humanism or humanistic autonomy the proclaimed and enforced autonomy of man from any higher force above him it could also be called anthropocentricity with man seen as the center of everything that exists
848504 the turn introduced by the renaissance evidently was inevitable historically the middle ages had come to a natural end by exhaustion becoming an intolerable despotic repression of mans physical nature in favor of the spiritual one then however we turned our backs upon the spirit and embraced all that is material with excessive and unwarranted zeal this new way of thinking which had imposed on us its guidance did not admit the existence of intrinsic evil in man nor did it see any higher task than the attainment of happiness on earth it based modern western civilization on the dangerous trend to worship man and his material needs everything beyond physical well being and accumulation of material goods all other human requirements and characteristics of a subtler and higher nature were left outside the area of attention of state and social systems as if human life did not have any superior sense that provided access for evil of which in our days there is a free and constant flow merely freedom does not in the least solve all the problems of human life and it even adds a number of new ones
848505 however in early democracies as in american democracy at the time of its birth all individual human rights were granted because man is gods creature that is freedom was given to the individual conditionally in the assumption of his constant religious responsibility such was the heritage of the preceding thousand years two hundred or even fifty years ago it would have seemed quite impossible in america that an individual could be granted boundless freedom simply for the satisfaction of his instincts or whims subsequently however all such limitations were discarded everywhere in the west a total liberation occurred from the moral heritage of christian centuries with their great reserves of mercy and sacrifice state systems were becoming increasingly and totally materialistic the west ended up by truly enforcing human rights sometimes even excessively but mans sense of responsibility to god and society grew dimmer and dimmer in the past decades the legalistically selfish aspect of western approach and thinking has reached its final dimension and the world wound up in a harsh spiritual crisis and a political impasse all the glorified technological achievements of progress including the conquest of outer space do not redeem the twentieth centurys moral poverty which no one could imagine even as late as in the nineteenth century
848506 over half a century ago while i was still a child i recall hearing a number of older people offer the following explanation for the great disasters that had befallen russia we have forgotten god thats why all this has happened since then i have spent well nigh 50 years working on the history of our revolution in the process i have read numbers of books collected hundreds of personal testimonies and have already contributed eight volumes of my own toward the effort of clearing away the rubble left by the upheaval but if i were asked today to formulate as concisely as possible the main cause of the ruinous revolution that swallowed up some 60 million of our people i could not put it more accurately than to repeat men have forgotten god thats why all this has happened

848582 he wasnt ready to win a championship i think until this year

848591 unfortunately after all those years out on the trail the meet and greets the fundraisers the stump speeches ive finally come to terms with the fact that this is a mantle i wasnt meant to hold
848592 dont get me wrong though i was really shocked and happy lucy said i actually blushed when i heard the news so i cant thank you enough for that
848593 i have won a lot of titles in my career but now i want to win some with marseille
848594 the start of the season is crucial especially at marseille where youre always under a great deal of pressure
848595 when i arrived my first job was to make sure all the fans were behind the team which was not that obvious then
848596 for this season once my players have made clear that they will do their utmost to defend the clubs colours well have 60 000 fans behind us and that will help tremendously
848597 the bosses let me have the players i wanted and i believe well have a good championship
848598 it feels good to finally say were in first place for at least a day
848599 we cant sneak up on anybody anymore this year everybody knows we are for real this year
848600 i think were at the point of the season where these guys all know what they need to do now
848601 every one of them will compete every one of them will attack
848602 lyon have a good team but were starting from scratch and lyon might suffer for a change
848603 you have to be honest and recognise everybody would love lyon to stumble
848604 it will be hard for us to do better than last season but well try
848605 we had the feeling we needed a change for a new challenge
848606 ric flair is no longer under contract with wwe it was a friendly parting which will allow ric to pursue things that were rejected by wwe in the past and it will mean a more streamlined process than ever before just you guys and me and ric lets pull something together and make some money
848607 the iq story started a few years ago when we at toyota began thinking of the environmental impact of automobiles we came to the conclusion that in order to ensure a sustainable future there was a need for a radical change in vehicle packaging we needed to create a break through away from the traditional belief that small is basic our answer to this is toyota iq

848610 we still have two employees from bettenhausen motorsports and it is their shop i still sit tonys chair at his desk with his plastic potted plants in the corner people think we are a new team with a new driver but weve been around for seven years weve been the last car in gasoline alley for a long time the crew that is with us now most have been with us for five years
848611 it means ive done just about every series there is now
848612 obviously the timing and the way this all came about was probably different from anything else weve ever done in january it wasnt planned and a week later we were doing it everything in motor racing tends to be an adventure but this is a slightly different one
848613 we competed in formula one from 1994 95 got our ass kicked
848614 it was more of a fact we had won in every other championship so we had to do it it was ambition i think we have the record for doing it on the smallest budget our best result was sixth in brazil
848615 in those years we had a lot of drivers come through the ranks that we developed like david coulthard ayrton senna j j lehto a lot of drivers came through the ranks that we developed christian fittipaldi and cristiano da matta those are all drivers that we had and took to championships in europe i got out of team ownership after formula one when youve been successful in everything and formula one is a tough animal the motivation wasnt there as a team so i changed roles
848616 so i came over here as president of lola cars
848617 it became hvm in 2001 with herdez and the rest of it is the way weve run it weve changed names a few times we were hvm until 2006 in 2007 we rebranded it and ran the minardi program so when that stopped we are back to hvm again
848618 there is never a good time to find a sponsor is there the changes with the way we did it the business model is probably a little light on paperwork when we made the change
848619 if you looked at motor racing the same way you do a lot of businesses you probably wouldnt be doing it
848620 no doubt it takes a lot of investment personally and from other teams
848621 having said that the year is still a learning curve when we came in we knew what the costs would be but were still learning with experience its doing what is needed and planning on the following year when we will have two cars and more budget
848622 when we tested him it was in champ car and the plan was to run him on road courses which he is more familiar
848623 he has certainly lived up if not surpassed the expectations

848626 ward amp i talk over the ef vote of no confidence document
848627 maybe its because of the neighborhood some people have a temper and some people dont hes never hurt anybody never killed anybody its just part of him he doesnt have a criminal or thug bone in his body
848628 the government had complete access to tim donaghys phone records and thoroughly investigated this matter including conducting an interview of referee scott foster
848629 the government has said that they have found no evidence of criminal conduct aside from that of mr donaghy once again the only criminal conduct is that of mr donaghy
848630 we sort of estimated 1 million and he submitted a response that said prove it document it so we did initially the commissioners david stern view was 1 million is a big enough number but once he lauro wanted the math done we sat down and tried to be pretty precise about it
848631 came immediately after mr donaghy raised issues concerning the governments conduct in this case and the possible influence exerted by the nba
848632 this is a time to especially if youre farther west assess where you are with your hurricane plan
848633 sleep disordered breathing and mortality eighteen year follow up of the wisconsin sleep cohort
848634 i think the time is of the essence even more while we are talking iran continues and any kind of hesitation coming from the international community is being perceived by the iranians as weakness and these kinds of messages that talks doesnt measure dont measure needs to change the attitude of the international community intensive and sanctions can be effective
848635 it is clear that iran doesnt pay attention to talks and this is a clear message to the international community to continue to with real and effective sanctions
848636 and clearly iran is a threat not only to israel but this is a global threat and the international community should act accordingly
848637 so only by waiting it doesnt create a better situation but worse and sanctions are effective only when the iranians know that there are other options but lets focus on the sanctions today
848638 nature has endowed the great white shark with more than enough bite force to kill and eat large and potentially dangerous prey
848639 pound for pound the great whites bite is not particularly impressive but the sheer size of the animal means that in absolute terms it tops the scales it must also be remembered that its extremely sharp serrated teeth require relatively little force to drive them through thick skin fat and muscle
848640 our interest in using genomics to study metabolic diseases led us to screen dna from liver cells that expressed foxa2 with an assay called chip on chip
848641 we were surprised that a cluster of genes involved in lipid and steroid metabolism was identified by being bound to foxa2
848642 im not some cute little indian boy who grew up in america with political aspirations
848643 i just thought it would be kind of funny to create an e mail address based on a random senator whose name no one could spell
848644 weve found that cb1 expression is lost in most colorectal cancers and when that happens a cancer promoting protein is free to inhibit cell death
848645 potential application of cannabinoids as anti tumor drugs is an exciting prospect because cannabinoid agonists are being evaluated now to treat the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy
848646 turning cb1 back on and then treating with a cannabinoid agonist could provide a new approach to colorectal cancer treatment or prevention
848647 people have looked at cannabinoids in cancer earlier mainly in cell culture experiments
848648 the molecular mechanisms for loss of the receptor and its effect on cancer have not been previously shown
848649 just increasing the levels of cannabinoids to treat colorectal cancer wont work if the cb1 receptor is not present

848655 cuba s not a bad word to anyone outside of the united states
848656 it is palpably untrue that the cuban government is not criticized outside of the u s the list would include but not be limited to the eu mexico spain and france
848657 provided specialized technical computer software and computer training which was then used to create a model for the potential exploration and development of oil and gas within the territorial water of cuba
848658 knowingly exporting sensitive u s technology to cuba amounts to trading with the enemy under federal law and wont be tolerated
848659 platte river sold software to a spanish company that then fed data into the program relating to areas around cuba
848660 is microsoft going to go to jail for selling excel to a canadian company that then uses the program to analyze its sales figures including sales to cuba

848664 i would say that in the last year and year and a half weve seen a big jump
848665 i liken it to building an addition to your house youre not going to take an old light fixture and put it in a new room
848666 there are special conditions with an overhauled it environment and you have to look for a backup solution that is tuned for it
848667 its important in that someone is spending time and money to look at different ways to design and use computers
848668 if its somebody elses core business to handle an exchange server let them do that
848669 i think the technical cios are going to migrate over to these hosted companies
848670 what i think youll see is the cio role dissolving
848671 are no longer going to buy technology artifacts like erp systems
848672 more and more people are really thinking about the environment in ways they hadnt before
848673 the vendors are paying a tremendous amount of attention to this
848674 the industry has made great strides and certainly there are companies that take design for the environment to heart
848675 wouldnt i want to focus them on the most strategic areas possible
848676 very deep in the business people who have vendor relationship management skills who can help the managed service provider or outsourcer to understand how to facilitate the business
848677 somebody in the customer company will have to deal with that in a technical fashion
848678 i think the human capital flow is going to change
848679 i think the technical cios are going to migrate over to these hosted companies
848680 what i think youll see is the cio role dissolving

848690 what the graphics and general data parallel application market needs is an architecture that provides the full programming abilities of a cpu the full capabilities of a cpu together with the parallelism that is inherent in graphics processors
848691 larrabee provides that and its a practical solution to the limitations of current graphics processors
848692 what stands out is that intel views the cpu as the best gpu
848693 intel is able to apply x86 to rendering graphics rather than adopting a new or different architecture which is clearly directly opposite of nvidias view of the world
848694 these companies intel and nvidia are sure to engage in a public jousting match over whose architecture is better the one that comes out on top though will be determined by performance and how well accepted the architecture is by developers

848714 the march symbolizes both the evil and hopeful sides of humanity the evil with the constant balancing act of power within government religion and our financial institutions there lies the chance of those most hungry for power to alter and restrict our freedoms for their gain the hopeful this represents the faith in mankind as the most powerful force on the planet if we come together and do not fight over religion class and borders then we hold the key to a peaceful world there are two possible futures in store either a march of power and greed or a march of a unified human race

848736 we want to be the definitive publisher of games for the iphone we think there is a tremendous opportunity
848737 you have a ds and you have a telephone why not buy just one
848738 the iphone has excellent hardware in it it is as capable as the ds or psp
848739 the games that you currently have are very appealing but that doesnt last for long

848745 i really feel like i enjoy swimming now more than i ever have i enjoy competing more than i ever have
848746 i had literally just breast fed my daughter got on the blocks and got ready to swim
848747 i didnt know what to expect so i was pleasantly surprised
848748 i couldnt count the number of people who came up to me at that meet and said it would be great to see someone our age at the olympics
848749 whos going to believe me if im just getting a urine test
848750 she showed up without a lawyer without an agent without a coach
848751 and withstood probably the worst cross examination of any of the other athletes
848752 the science is not at the stage where we can give a 100 guarantee to any athlete that they are clean
848753 but if they arent clean then they would have to be a fool or a huge risk taker to do a program like this
848754 the guy who invented them is great friends with my coach who is also german
848755 after talking to him and learning more about them why not take a product where you know the person who made it and know exactly what is in the product why take a chance with something on the market where you dont know if its tainted or not
848756 because it helps my recovery and its not illegal so why not
848757 so in the water its not about power but more about making my stroke more efficient
848758 i decided to become an open book and asked to be tested in any way they want to show im clean
848759 i understand if i just sat there and said i passed my tests that people wouldnt believe me ive gone beyond the call of duty to prove im clean but you are guilty until proven innocent in this day and age so what else can i do its a real bummer
848760 i feel like i have so many middle aged women who look up to me i want them to feel proud and feel like they can do what they set out to do
848761 to preach the gospel of cleanliness and economy and sanitation in every nook and corner of this city
848762 each laundry operator is instructed that besides wearing a snow white uniform they must be physically as well as morally clean when they handle the work of the customers
848763 a survey of the plant shows that over 95 percent of the laundrys owners are satisfied and not involved in any manner in the present difficulty
848764 i feel like im still a teenager because im perpetually in high school
848765 i think its nice for the town to have an identity
848766 we sold quite a number of them and we had to get a subsequent order
848767 we sort of grinned to ourselves but didnt say anything
848768 we pulled it off with all the drama weve had this season it felt like we won the championship game
848769 but we know it was only step one of our journey
848770 we got the fumble and came up with the play we needed
848771 we needed to keep them inbounds and just had to play our best coverage
848772 we know what they wanted to look for on the play
848773 the whole tone of the series was set by the pitchers
848774 anytime you get pitching like that the way we swing the bats i like our chances
848775 i got ahead of hitters got a lot of ground balls and easier outs than if i had gotten behind
848776 it was a left handed pitcher and lefty lefty matchups are tough
848777 a home run was the furthest thing from my mind i was trying to battle through and have a good at bat but i got good wood on it and it went out
848778 for us to go where we want to go we need to continue to get better and pitch like we did the last three days
848779 we wanted to get to where we were at last year around this time now were starting to do it
848780 i definitely think the pitchers can do what we did last year
848781 we still look upon him as our go to guy
848782 he will continue to be that as we go forward
848783 now i think weve figured out a little bit of an identity i think the roles are in place now
848784 weve been throwing the ball well as of late from the starters all the way through its getting a lot more of that feel like we had last year where guys are going in and theyre just expecting zeros
848785 its been very encouraging to see the consistency of the bullpen
848786 i think were confident about every guy we send to the mound
848787 the pitching staff has been very good and very consistent for the most part since april
848788 weve had some bumps along the way well probably have those bumps as we go forward the biggest thing i think is that to a man confidence continues to grow
848789 were supposed to be right in the median throughout the southern part of the state
848790 bedford has always tried to stay in the middle sort of maybe the high middle not the top
848791 as a taxpayers association i am not interested in having people the lowest paid
848792 you get what you pay for i want reasonable and affordable
848793 from the ice core you can actually tell a whole bunch about past climate and temperature
848794 for instance you can see exactly when the industrial revolution happened because you can see it in the snow
848795 its always amazing to think that even though there arent many cars in antarctica or greenland we still see lead in the snow because its traveling in the snow
848796 the upper layers of the atmosphere get transported all over the planet
848797 you can look at tree rings for information about the not too distant past but it doesnt give a lot of evidence about interlinked climate events even sediment in lakes or oceans deposited over time gets stirred up by currents or critters so the record is disturbed
848798 most of the worlds fresh water is locked up in the antarctic ice sheet and as that water is released we want to know what effects it has on sea levels and precipitation around the world
848799 right now its totally unknown mercury is a byproduct of coal fired power plants so figuring out what the pre industrial mercury content was will give us the first evidence of what earths natural background of mercury is supposed to be
848800 with the 2007 nobel peace prize going to the intergovernmental panel on climate change is huge
848801 people are finally listening and as scientists we feel the message is finally being heard
848802 the reason i can spend three months in antarctica now as opposed to earlier in my career is that my kids went off to college that freed me up and proves that theres something to do in every stage of life
848803 its a tradition of the more senior scientists nurturing the younger ones and giving them opportunities with the expectation that the zoes of the world will do the same for the next generation
848804 i try to help out at the museum when i can over the last few years ive been trying really hard to get kids excited about science as frustrating as the problems of global warming can be where the real hope lies for the future is in making sure we have a generation of kids who are excited and want to fix the problems
848805 new hampshire rivers are running at high levels and full strength as a result of recent storm events and it is very easy to underestimate the strength of the current while standing on the shoreline
848806 people should not be swimming in new hampshire rivers until they return to more normal water levels
848807 swimming kayaking or canoeing on our rivers can be extremely dangerous under these conditions
848808 were still not sure why or how she was straddling the two lanes
848809 close the enron loophole the enron loophole allows billion dollar traders to evade speculation limits and manipulate oil markets anonymously artificially driving up prices in an attempt to make huge profits
848810 the task forces preliminary assessment is that current oil prices and the increase in oil prices between january 2003 and june 2008 are largely due to fundamental supply and demand factors during this same period activity on the crude oil futures market as measured by the number of contracts outstanding trading activity and the number of traders has increased significantly while these increases broadly coincided with the run up in crude oil prices the task forces preliminary analysis to date does not support the proposition that speculative activity has systematically driven changes in oil prices
848811 stop filling the strategic petroleum reserve and release 30 million barrels of oil
848812 if the enemy cant reach you but you can reach him thats a huge advantage
848813 its that kind of engagement our folks are dealing with

848816 you can avoid collateral damage because theres a man within the loop
848817 right now this weapon will fit into the same launcher and the same hole a hydra fits in they have to do absolutely nothing
848818 we took two active units out of fort campbell and flew em up these are the guys who actually go to war
848819 they were so excited these are the guys we really care about the guys who actually have to use it
848820 its an easy weapon to use its readily available they dont have to do much to shoot and they love it
848821 it was a very good feeling it was pretty much the same reaction the pilots had
848822 there were six ships in our two destroyer divisions at vella gulf we had the dunlap craven maury lang sterett and stack i was on the stack and i cant wait to see how many of my shipmates are still alive
848823 we were running parallel to what they called the slot and we got to the gizo strait just before midnight
848824 thats when the japs came steaming in from the other way
848825 they called it the tokyo express we caught them just off kolombangara

848829 hakigaze and arashi threw their helms hard a port too late
848830 one or two torpedoes stabbed into a fireroom of the first two maybe three torpedoes burst in the others fireroom and as kawakaze wheeled to starboard an american fish gouged her in a magazine below the bridge and her whole forward part burst skyward in a ball of ruddy flame
848831 her gushing fuel tanks still feeding a circle of flame around her survivors

848838 without comrade xiaoping china would not be strong like it is today or have the ability to host an international event like the olympics he added deng died in 1997 at the age of 92
848839 finally after so much heartbreak in sichuan and a postponement the torch is here this is indeed a day for rejoicing
848840 i love china t shirts stickers of the olympics symbol and chinese flags as well as red headbands with
848841 its embarrassing when europeans come over here they all speak english they speak french they speak german and then we go over to europe and all we can say is

848876 for israelis the assassin that killed benazir bhutto removed another barrier shielding the jewish state from the islamic bomb
848877 the chaos precipitated by the killing poses dangers beyond pakistans immediate neighborhood said jack rosen a past president of the american jewish congress noting that pakistan is one of a handful of declared nuclear powers and the only muslim country with the bomb if the government fell into extremist hands the bomb also falls into the hands of extremists rosen told jta you dont need to worry about a nuclear iran you have a nuclear pakistan in the hands of extremists
848878 she wrote me of how she admired israel and of her desire to see a normalization in the relations between israel and pakistan including the establishment of diplomatic ties
848879 according to a report in israels daily maariv bhutto reached out to the mossad among other security agencies for protection ron kampeas bhutto assassination sets off alarms over pakistans nukes san francisco sentinel december 28 2007
848880 the hebrew daily newspaper maariv further revealed that bhutto had asked israels mossad spy agency along with the cia and britains scotland yard to help protect her in the run up to pakistans january 8 election
848881 in a move that may endear her to western supporters and moderates in her country but which is also sure to be exploited by islamist opponents the top contender for pakistans premiership benazir bhutto conducted a private meeting this week with israels ambassador to the united nations dan gillerman
848882 a three hour dinner at the mandarin oriental hotel in midtown was attended by the exiled former prime minister of pakistan the israeli ambassador and a few associates
848883 prior to her return from exile in october bhutto 54 had been reaching out to israel as part of a broader strategy of garnering western support for her confrontation with the military regime led by musharraf
848884 the ex shah of iran and mobutu were both of the view that the road to power in washington lies through the israel lobby it isnt entirely surprising then that benazir should have tried to grease her way back into power with friendly overtures to the apartheid regime over jerusalem that will perhaps also explain why the quickest to mourn her departure were the us congresss inhouse ogre tom lantos and the lobbys other water boy arlen specter
848885 for jews and pakistanis in america the assassination presents an opportunity for dialogue said rabbi marc schneier president of the foundation for ethnic understanding
848886 coincidentally schneier said a meeting between american jewish communal leaders and pakistani officials had been set just prior to the assassination
848887 i had to let go of trying to control and have everything fo the way i wanted to go i needed to look at what i did with my life the camino reminded me that life is always going to have both ups and downs i need to accept this as a natural process of growth and stop trying to hard to make it go my way

848891 what public sector workers are asking for is entirely fair that they are not forced to pay for economic problems which they are not responsible for
848892 further strike action is being planned now and greens believe that this should be coordinated between trade unions as much as is possible
848893 united action can force the hand of the employers and overturn their plans to impose pay cuts all public sector workers deserve a pay rise not only to cover inflation but to make up for 10 years of below inflation pay deals which are pay cuts in all but name
848894 the government has been bending over backwards to help the nuclear industry revive its fortunes for many years with the recent planning bill just the latest in a long line of measures to prevent communities from having their say about whether they want new nuclear power stations as neighbours
848895 this deal to sell british energys eight power station sites to edf was an important stage in their plans to fill the uk with another round of dirty dangerous and expensive nuclear power
848896 however although this particular deal has broken down there is no reason to suppose that gordon browns enthusiasm for this outdated technology has been blunted
848897 the green party wants to see a really sustainable future for our energy industry a green new deal with investment in clean economically wise renewable energy and the creation of thousands of skilled long term jobs
848898 those who share this vision will need to be vigilant watching for renewed efforts to ease the way for edf to build new power stations we must also continue to resist new coal power stations like that at kingsnorth in kent which may get a boost if any more problems arise with new nuclear the answer is not nuclear or more burning of fossil fuels but real clean energy technologies that come with real economic and environmental benefits

848907 the isps will target suspects which means many people on shared internet connections will be cut off under these rules these rules risk cutting many vulnerable people off from their livelihoods and their means for engaging as a citizen
848908 geoff taylor from the bpi says there is not an acceptable level of file sharing
848909 record companies typically want to develop software along the lines of itunes a monopoly where individuals sign up and pay to legally share music thats clearly unsatisfactory the money collected wont find its way to musicians the companies typical charge against filesharing
848910 the advent of mass social networking allows developing artists to promote themselves without immediate recourse to studios pr teams so whatever deal is produced should help sites that support independent artists such as magnatune not just multinationals that distribute record industry fare

848934 the concern is that its a very expensive undertaking for businesses both small and large to install and operate cameras that would operate 24 hours a day
848935 its definitely a public safety thing it is to protect the patrons
848936 we would just like them to defer it to give them time to consider the issue
848937 what i hope to accomplish is this they will certainly give us an idea of whos committing these crimes and they will certainly give law enforcement a better opportunity to solve these crimes
848938 the technology is there and the cost is extremely low
848939 we all like it when some burglar gets caught by a camera but theres a cost incurred
848940 i think it would also deter people if you look up and see a camera youre not going to want to do anything
848941 cada vez son m s elevadas las probabilidades de que el crecimiento del pib mundial sea negativo por ejemplo para el 2010 las posibilidades de que sea as ya alcanzan un 20 una cifra que en t rminos macroecon micos se considera muy elevada
848942 a trav s de este estudio se ha observado que la evoluci n del pib es similar a la del petr leo por lo que podemos prever que habr una crisis econ mica y social gradual a partir de 2010 explican los autores del estudio
848943 todo el mundo habla de los problemas derivados de la consideraci n del petr leo como combustible en el transporte en el suministro de electricidad
848944 pero nadie habla del petr leo como primera materia de una familia numerosa de productos que afectan a la vida cotidiana como los medicamentos pesticidas aditivos pl sticos lubricantes tejidos y muchos otros
848945 los instrumentos que caracterizan nuestro sistema actual no son capaces de resolver las nuevas realidades que est n surgiendo ejemplo de ello es europa o jap n que desde hace a os arrastran un tipo de inter s real pr cticamente negativo y a pesar de ello su crecimiento econ mico no es positivo
848946 debemos dirigirnos hacia un sistema econ mico m s regularizado en relaci n con el suministro de petr leo de manera que crecientemente dejemos de depender de su precio ya que ste no puede asumir el desarrollo de un mercado de estas caracter sticas
848947 el consumo de petr leo deber a ser estrictamente el esencial evitando as su derroche puesto que su utilizaci n est ntimamente ligada con su disponibilidad

849018 before and immediately after aug 8 we will not see persistent heavy rainfall
849019 specifically on the 8th the weather in beijing will be cloudy and overcast and we will see some rain showers and thunder showers
849020 it is impossible to tell at what time the rain will fall on aug 8 but we cannot exclude that there will be periodic rain then
849021 we have confirmation now that 145 people have been killed
849022 we found eight to 10 stones which had fallen off and probably scared the people causing the stampede
849023 many children and women were shouting for help and i saw people tumbling down the hillside
849024 there were rumours of boulders coming down on us and we all ran like the others
849025 we need more medicines and blood but we are trying to do our best with what we have
849026 there were too many rumours we tried our best to keep things under control but it went out of hand
849027 there is a considerable volume of material that needs to be digested
849028 you might well say that its in my interests if you like to put demands on peter costello or otherwise
849029 peter costello in my view has earned the right to make a decision in his interests and that of his family and the electors of higgins in due course and announce it when hes ready to do so
849030 i would be very happy if peter costello makes the decision to stay and he obviously would come straight on to our frontbench
849031 i respect him i respect his wife tanya and their family theyve worked damned hard for this country
849032 its not until you walk in somebody elses shoes you get a feel for what they put up with the gruelling year in year out hard decisions and work that he put in sacrifices by his family to get us into the position we were in in november last year before mr rudd took control of things
849033 as far as im concerned peter costello has made us a better country hes earned the right to make a decision when it suits him
849034 obviously i wouldnt be human if i didnt say that there are some times when you wonder what is on the mind of some people and of course your family read the papers and hear these things
849035 but thats what weve all signed up for and my job is to make sure that i do the very best i can for australians
849036 these are the key issues thats why well be making sure that anyone who breaks those and faces prosecution when they are prosecuted they will be put on this website
849037 i would hope that in the future we have no one in the list
849038 i disapprove of what you say but i will defend to the death your right to say it
849039 all women once you bleep them a couple times a week for a few months expects a relationship
849040 i need to make an appointment with my spiritual advisor
849041 they were returning from the summit when an avalanche at the bottleneck hit them
849042 our liaison officer at the base camp confirmed the death of five
849043 we dont have names of dead climbers but it has been confirmed that one dutch one norwegian and one french are in the tally of dead
849044 we were told that some climbers are still returning to the camps
849045 youre 3 years old so you need to take at least 3 bites
849046 why do we always have to pick up our stuff

849052 we are committed to supporting family life and stability and commitment in relationships precisely because the secure start in life a stable family background provides is the best guarantee of maximising opportunity
849053 i believe we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males
849054 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available
849055 we should ask those who make profits out of revelling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing
849056 the relationship between these titles and their readers is a relationship in which the rest of us have an interest
849057 the images they use and project reinforce a very narrow conception of beauty and a shallow approach towards women they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude
849058 the contrast with the work done by womens magazines and their publishers to address their readers in a mature and responsible fashion is striking

849060 our teams confirm that 145 people are dead in the stampede
849061 the bodies of the victims were brought to the civil hospital in anandpur sahib in neighboring punjab state
849062 the death toll could go up as a few more wounded could have succumbed to injuries on the way to local hospitals
849063 the rumors created a commotion that sparked the stampede as devotees on the stairway to the temple tried to push their way causing a collapse of the system of fences
849064 this panic caused a rush between crowds returning from the temple and those going up to the shrine people started running here and there
849065 this is a completely new type of dinosaur that was so far unknown
849066 nobody even expected that members of this group lived in that time so this gives us new knowledge about the whole evolution of the t rex group
849067 i hear that girls suffer not just physically but psychologically
849068 but i am afraid i dont want my daughters to have uncontrollable demands for sex
849069 i am sure they students at harvard do not show such a veneration for aristotle as is expressd at queens college in oxford where they read aristotle on their knees and those who take degrees are sworn to defend his philosophy
849070 but some of them will stay in the hospital for observation

849117 one of the most compelling unification models ive seen in years
849118 theres a dream that underlying the physical universe is some beautiful mathematical structure and that the job of physics is to discover that
849119 and its a dream that most of us are like recovering alcoholics from
849120 look in my experience the style of a well trained ph d going away thinking hard about something for a long time and coming back with something very original something thats a well worked out and well thought through point of view is an essential if rare part of how theoretical physics progresses
849121 i am forty years old and most of my net worth is in snowboards and surfboards and thats kind of weird
849122 it is of the nature of a high risk shot on goal from way down the field
849123 it was probably not the most politic thing to do
849124 but i remember walking out of this office and wondering what it had to do with any physical reality and as far as i could tell it didnt
849125 if you share an office next to a guy for twenty years and you like him and youre friends with him its hard to tell him that you think that his whole idea of how the universe works is completely wrong
849126 if a figure is so beautiful and intricate and clear you figure it must not exist for itself alone

849134 i had this algebraic structure worked out but i didnt know what the hell it was
849135 it is like a diamond with tens of thousands of facets
849136 it is easy to arrive at the feeling that a final understanding of the universe must somehow involve e8 or otherwise put nature would be foolish not to utilize e8
849137 i saw that it fit and saw it and immediately walked around the room thinking of all the different ways that this thing fit together and it was going to work
849138 i had to suppress that in order to think more about the actual algebraic structure you cannot think when youre ecstatic
849139 i didnt run through the snow shouting eureka or anything like that

849144 the scary thing is how frequently you cant tell which is which
849145 theres some really good stuff but a lot of really sloppy stuff

849254 made a fundamental mistake of accepting the demands of the governments
849255 the capacity of interfacial water layers to impose order was exposed in the process of formation of supercubane carbon nanocrystals
849256 it is important that the order imposed to molecules landing on hydrogenated diamond is more durable and superior to that realizable on any other origin of life platform for instance graphite hydrogenated diamond advances to the best of all possible origin of life
849257 origin of life models starting with a primordial soup work from two assumptions which do not exclude each other chemistry which could trigger the self assembly of abiotic organic compounds and transfer of order from preexistent orderings
849258 clearly both organization processes must occur in a bio relevant environment that is a wet milieu and both are energy consuming interestingly a hostile planetary environment such as the primitive earth subject to rapid changes including but not limited to volcanic and hydrothermal activity acidic atmosphere and virtually planet sterilizing meteorite impacts favours precisely the conditions necessary for the formation of first ordered structures regarded as possible starting points of biological evolution
849259 in our study the conductivity on natural diamond was better by a factor of 10 than that on synthetic diamond
849260 we conclude that current ideas of surface conducting diamond should be expanded to include the crystalline water layer
849261 the emergence of bio organic molecules under primitive earth conditions is one of the major unsolved origin of life questions
849262 the principal problem is to identify physical and chemical conditions that are favourable for the formation of life precursor structures panspermia tries to circumvent the problem by assuming that primitive life forms such as bacteria have arrived on earth from space as star dust or via comets
849263 the effect of deception on pollinators has been considered negligible but we show that pollinators may suffer considerable costs

849271 how can i proceed through my normal daily life as if i am not temporarily disabled
849272 i think everyone understands the offensive part of the game can go in cycles
849273 the thing thats most encouraging to me is to go along with some of the key hits weve had were mixing in the slug hit with it
849274 with the big park we have youre just trying to hit the ball in some gaps and get some base runners
849275 thats the hottest i ever remember pitching just warming up it was amazing the heat that one long inning it has to kill the defense and the pitcher being out there like that
849276 sometimes people have to have a little bit of common sense
849277 im coming into the game trying to get a double play ball
849278 im going to throw in using my sinker i was trying to get a ground ball out of that it got away from me i went to pick up the ball i look up and hes charging me yes it surprised me
849279 im not going to bring in a guy who throws 85 mph to hit somebody
849280 i guarantee it id bring in dotel id bring in matt thornton id tell them to hit them thats the way i do business
849281 most of the pitchers dont throw me inside all the time
849282 they throw me sliders away or whatever if he wouldve hit me with the first pitch i wouldve been happy to take first base but three times inside its just so obvious
849283 i signed a five year deal with this organization and we play kansas city a lot

849300 as an american i want to speak up for women in my own country women who are raising children on the minimum wage women who cant afford health care or child care women whose lives are threatened by violence including violence in their own homes i want to speak up for mothers who are fighting for good schools safe neighborhoods clean air and clean airwaves for older women some of them widows who have raised their families and now find that their skills and life experiences are not valued in the workplace for women who are working all night as nurses hotel clerks and fast food cooks so that they can be at home during the day with their kids and for women everywhere who simply dont have time to do everything they are called upon to do each day speaking to you today i speak for them just as each of us speaks for women around the world who are denied the chance to go to school or see a doctor or own property or have a say about the direction of their lives simply because they are women the truth is that most women around the world work both inside and outside the home usually by necessity we need to understand that there is no formula for how women should lead their lives that is why we must respect the choices that each woman makes for herself and her family every woman deserves the chance to realize her god given potential we also must recognize that women will never gain full dignity until their human rights are respected and protected no one should be forced to remain silent for fear of religious or political persecution arrest abuse or torture tragically women are most often the ones whose human rights are violated even in the late 20th century the rape of women continues to be used as an instrument of armed conflict women and children make up a large majority of the worlds refugees when women are excluded from the political process they become even more vulnerable to abuse i believe that on the eve of a new millennium it is time to break our silence it is time for us to say here in beijing and the world to hear that it is no longer acceptable to discuss womens rights as separate from human rights these abuses have continued because for too long the history of women has been a history of silence even today there are those who are trying to silence our words the voices of this conference and of the women at huairou must be heard loud and clear it is a violation of human rights when babies are denied food or drowned or suffocated or their spines broken simply because they are born girls it is a violation of human rights when women and girls are sold into the slavery of prostitution it is a violation of human rights when women are doused with gasoline set on fire and burned to death because their marriage dowries are deemed too small it is a violation of human rights when individual women are raped in their own communities and when thousands of women are subjected to rape as a tactic or prize of war it is a violation of human rights when a leading cause of death worldwide among women ages 14 to 44 is the violence they are subjected to in their own homes it is a violation of human rights when young girls are brutalized by the painful and degrading practice of genital mutilation it is a violation of human rights when women are denied the right to plan their own families and that includes being forced to have abortions or being sterilized against their will if there is one message that echoes forth from this conference it is that human rights are womens rights and womens rights are human rights let us not forget that among those rights are the right to speak freely and the right to be heard women must enjoy the right to participate fully in the social and political lives of their countries if we want freedom and democracy to thrive and endure it is indefensible that many women in nongovernmental organizations who wished to participate in this conference have not been able to attend or have been prohibited from fully taking part let me be clear freedom means the right of people to assemble organize and debate openly it means respecting the views of those who may disagree with the views of their governments it means not taking citizens away from their loved ones and jailing them mistreating them or denying them their freedom or dignity because of the peaceful expression of their ideas and opinions gods blessings on you your work and all who will benefit from it

849508 el observar es descubrir cosas nuevas me encanta sentarme a tomar un caf e inventar una historia de la gente que veo esa es la gracia salir a caminar y descubrir cosas hoy lo hago ya sin c mara pero yo creo que uno tiene la capacidad m gica de asombrarse y hacer historias con eso

849513 la fotograf a es lo nico que permanece a lo largo del tiempo chile es un pa s que se ha transformado muy r pido lo nico que queda es la foto
849514 l es un gran aporte de lo que ha sido la fotograf a chilena sobre todo con el fotoperiodismo no me refiero al fot grafo de barricada sino que impone una reflexi n del punto de vista cultural y adem s con un grado de an lisis acad mico de aquello todo en un pa s donde no hay investigaci n con la fotograf a
849515 por una parte es un formador de muchas generaciones adem s dio un gran espacio para la difusi n de la fotograf a y ha impuesto conceptos como la fotodigraf a ver recuadro 1 que son herramientas que normalmente su generaci n no practica l es uno de los conos de la fotograf a chilena
849516 siempre hay un pr ximo proyecto mi meta es la que ha ido y venido dejar en la mejor posici n que pueda a la fotograf a ha costado mucho convencer que es un lenguaje y en chile esas cosas son tareas pendientes siempre es bueno dejar tarea pendiente
849517 lo que se quiere hacer es romper la concentraci n de la propiedad y recuperar las radios tradicionales sobre todo en regiones y provincias las que nunca pueden pasar de am a fm lo que es un requisito m nimo para conseguir publicidad que es el nica forma de sobrevivir
849518 este criterio es para reconocer a los que han hecho radiodifusi n a los tradicionales a los que partieron en am y quieren crecer ellos son los que mantienen la identidad local
849519 hay un derecho preferente que tiene el actual titular para renovar la concesi n pero no es para una nueva lo que establece la ley es para optar a una nueva concesi n de radiodifusi n pero no para una existente por lo tanto los actuales actores al momento de renovar no est n entrando a un nuevo concurso por lo cual no entran en la reforma de la ley
849520 puede ayudar un poco a evitar la concentraci n pero es una medida un poco tard a a esta altura las radios chicas est n acogotadas por a os de problemas es como tratar de publicar decretos para replantar alerces una vez que se han sacado todos ya cambi el paisaje algo se puede hacer pero el efecto ser a muy tenue

849526 id always been a little suspicious of people who seem to have it all together hiding their flaws and appearing strong and confident too often i have to admit i probably cant tell the difference between a confident person and an over confident person and there are people who are more self assured and confident i think what id like to see is that people admit their mistakes acknowledge their shortcomings and flaws at least once in a while of course i wouldnt want everyone walking around like droopy mopey or eeyore

849528 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
849529 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
849530 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
849531 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
849532 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
849533 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
849534 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
849535 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
849536 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
849537 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy

849613 we believe that most websites and virtual tours dont capitalize on the possibilities of interactive media
849614 we plan to fully tap that potential and make it available to the masses
849615 sharaf dg aims to constantly be the leader in introducing products that offer customers the latest technology and gadgets available the annihilator is the ultimate dream machine for pc enthusiasts the idea behind the annihilator is to provide the best experience for the end user whether they are playing games working on their documents or enjoying the latest movie in high definition the pc uses the fastest components available today which have been water cooled to make them run even faster it also features two western digital raptor drives set in raid0 configuration for blazing fast speed as well as a raid5 array of 1 5tb for the users data
849616 that is the reason the annihilator uses raid5 technology for storing the users videos pictures and documents to ensure that they dont lose them
849617 we have really just started getting the word out about this program and already the response has been amazing
849618 but then again maybe not so amazing i mean people love fantasy football and people love to make money putting the two of them together seems like it should be a no brainer but as far as i know this has never been done before what we are trying to do is build a league that allows players to both play in a league that is offering innovations that most other leagues simply dont offer and make some money at the same time by getting their friends co workers and fantasy contacts to sign up
849619 one of the many things that make this league so unique is the real time functions that are going to be available to our players on game day
849620 the most exciting feature at least to me is the real time substitution option which will allow players to replace injured or underperforming personnel during the live broadcasts of the games themselves this is just one of the features you are probably not going to be able to find anywhere else on the internet
849621 peer pressure issues more than doubles once a child reaches high school
849622 the 1 percent drop however small indicates that even historically high growth companies are currently feeling some pressure from economic conditions based on historical performance one presumes these companies have stable sales practices in place and have been resilient during past periods of economic pressures but can still be impacted by an overall spending slowdown in their industry sectors
849623 the risk of revenue decline is present in a broad range of industry sectors right now
849624 and some companies can manage their way out of it
849625 weve definitely seen an uptick in requests for information on how to drive revenues
849626 i believe ceos are acutely aware of the need to keep a focus on sales and u s growth firms are more interested than theyve been in the past in expanding internationally given the dollar advantage and growth rate in developing countries

849646 this year marks the fourth consecutive year starfish has received funding from pepfar for our support of community based programs which draws from the philosophy that children who are cared for by families within communities are more likely to thrive than those in institutions
849647 while last year we focused on accelerating that program this coming year we will focus on increasing the programs quality so we are better able to address the individual needs of children affected by hiv aids in south africa
849648 the new strategy will better help community based organizations in south africa become effective mechanisms for distributing pepfar funds and starfish services to orphaned and vulnerable children
849649 continual and improved cbo training is a means to the primary goal of starfishs existence to reach as many orphans and vulnerable children as possible
849650 since 2001 starfish has been building lasting relationships with community based organizations to help address the needs of children orphaned or made vulnerable by the hiv aids pandemic in south africa
849651 this new strategy better equips starfish to stand as the linking interface that ensures a holistic approach to the orphan crisis in south africa
849652 these children have the potential to grow up and contribute to south african society
849653 if these orphaned and vulnerable children are not cared for nurtured and educated they will become a lost generation

849660 the 574 million acres of federal coastal water that are off limits are believed to hold nearly 18 billion barrels of undiscovered recoverable oil and 77 trillion cubic feet of natural gas according to the interior department
849661 as for sears my last comment was after they decided to split the management of the company into a holding company structure my take home message was that such a move would hopefully allow for faster decision making and unlocking some shareholder value but we would have to wait and see if that actually was the result since then very little has changed the retail environment remains very weak and yet the company has made no meaningful moves to unlock value or diversify its business they just keep buying back stock which is fine with me but more needs to be done with the core business i have not been adding shares of shld and in some cases have actually been cutting back the position with the weak retail market stocks like tgt have gotten cheap enough that new money might be better served going there until shld shows signs they really are more than just a sub par retailer until they show some life in that regard i likely will not become more bullish on the stock there is value there but if management does not unlock it adequately wall street wont take notice
849662 that third house i saw will be there when im done taking the real estate tour
849663 can you give some specific advice to the big airlines on how they can cut costs and become profitable i dont think you really understand their situation to compare the big airlines with the budget ones is like comparing a ford and gm plant with a toyota one ford and gm has massive legacy costs of high salaries and benefits and so do the big airlines american is one of the few or is it the only one of the big airlines that hasnt filed for chapter 11 in recent years which would have let them reduce costs and renegotiate legacy employee agreements

849687 you might well say that its in my interests if you like to put demands on peter costello or otherwise
849688 peter costello in my view has earned the right to make a decision in his interests and that of his family and the electors of higgins in due course and announce it when hes ready to do so
849689 i would be very happy if peter costello makes the decision to stay and he obviously would come straight on to our frontbench
849690 i respect him i respect his wife tanya and their family theyve worked damned hard for this country
849691 its not until you walk in somebody elses shoes you get a feel for what they put up with the gruelling year in year out hard decisions and work that he put in sacrifices by his family to get us into the position we were in in november last year before mr rudd took control of things
849692 as far as im concerned peter costello has made us a better country hes earned the right to make a decision when it suits him
849693 obviously i wouldnt be human if i didnt say that there are some times when you wonder what is on the mind of some people and of course your family read the papers and hear these things
849694 but thats what weve all signed up for and my job is to make sure that i do the very best i can for australians

849698 the world has abandoned a fortress mentality in the real world and we need to move beyond it in cyberspace america needs a network that can project power by building an af mil robot network botnet that can direct such massive amounts of traffic to target computers that they can no longer communicate and become no more useful to our adversaries than hunks of metal and plastic america needs the ability to carpet bomb in cyberspace to create the deterrent we lack

849700 john garing a retired air force colonel who now is disas cio said he and his staff have met with their counterparts at businesses such as google inc amazon com inc united parcel service of america inc and travel reservation systems operator sabre holdings corp to talk about how the companies use technology a pending trip to fedex corp is scheduled for next week he added
849701 garing is convinced that cloud based it services will be the future of military data processing
849702 we have to get to this standard environment that is provisionable and scalable
849703 user interface designers have more interactive options than ever for presenting content
849704 if interactive options make a web page seem overly complex the benefits of interactivity are lost
849705 the interactive display of content can make it harder to refer to content provide links to it bookmark it or share it with others
849706 consider whether users would want to print the content you are presenting interactively
849707 the persuasiveness of content is as important as its usability
849708 a long list of examples facts or reasons is persuasive
849709 for some web sites their breadth and depth of content is their value proposition
849710 using progressive disclosure in displaying content can help us take advantage of the opportune moment or what rhetoricians refer to as kairos
849711 we now have more and better interactive options for presenting the right content in the right place in the right amount at the right time
849712 customer research is an important factor in generating business revenues so it must be done right
849713 a brand should exude confidence it should reflect what its selling it should express the true essence of what it offers to its audience
849714 conducting customer research online lets you gain knowledge and understand your customers better
849715 the more blatantly you ask prospects and customers for information the more hesitant theyll be to continue using your service and become loyal customers
849716 feedback forms can sometimes be intrusive and are less engaging than a forum that allows instant feedback from customers to which a company can respond online
849717 people do not appreciate it when companies interrupt their task flows
849718 avoid attempting to gather personal information when customers or prospects are trying to get something done
849719 the last thing a web site should do is to display a popup survey just as prospects and customers enter the web site
849720 a passive form of feedback like a feedback form is the weakest approach a brand can take to collecting information
849721 gathering information in subtle and seductive ways provides a positive path forward
849722 so lets save some money we can use our web pages both to gather customer information and market our products and services online why not its a win win situation here
849723 brands are finding out how important it is to keep customer research going through this online medium
849724 i cannot worship the hippie diaper halo christ because i cannot worship a guy i can beat up

849726 the challenge with ortlund is to all sides to reach beyond ourselves a bit
849727 my reformed friend can you move among other christian groups and really enjoy them
849728 if your reformed theology has morphed functionally into galatian sociology the remedy is not to abandon your reformed theology the remedy is to take your reformed theology to a deeper level
849729 the proof that we are reformed will be all the wonderful christians we discover around us who are not reformed
849730 this is the acid test of a truly reformed ministry that other believers need not be reformed in order to be respected and included in our hearts
849731 loving one another when we passionately disagree is hard but probably worth it
849732 do complementarians all live in such a weird world that they even need to ask questions like this
849733 please know that in asking these questions i am not seeking to be sarcastic toward you or your position in the gender debate i am truly curious and i say that with the utmost respect for you as fellow image bearers of god
849734 a person who dresses and behaves like a member of the opposite sex
849735 while i dont read hebrew my understanding is that hebrew experts are clear on this just as the greek experts are clear that junia was a woman and an apostle
849736 what is the purpose in creation of making a first gender neutral human
849737 if adam pre fall was androgynous then was it fully human
849738 in gen 2 22 when specifically describing the process for making a woman why doesnt it specifically state the process for the making a man
849739 in gen 2 23 was woman taken out of man or woman taken out of gender neutral first adam
849740 i cant hold my view if you dont believe scripture is inerrant and i cant hold your view because i do believe scripture is inerrent
849741 the androgynous asexual gender bending role reversing view of modern egalitarianism is so unattractive to me that i cannot help but think most of us publicly embrace it simply because it saves time and bother when we are in public
849742 but we need rules and instructions and roles to follow
849743 women today are encouraged to think they can have it all career success and family fulfilment at the same time but these external measures of success leave many feeling inadequate
849744 just look at how frequently men in the comments on 42 new frontiers and women tell us how they value women for their work in the home and childcare
849745 i also want to say that i find it very insulting to my wife when egalitarians imply that staying at home raising children is some kind of second rate job for losers also i am very proud of the many amazing and diverse ministries that women have pioneered and led yes led in my own church if anything it is getting men to engage that is the problem posted by mark friday july 11 2008 at 09 54 am
849746 egalitarians are frequently accused of not valuing womens work at home and with children which is absolute nonsense to point out that women in male headship churches are limited in the roles that they can play does not imply in any way that those roles are insignificant just that the women are not allowed choice or freedom i would go further limiting all women to these roles shows a lack of respect for the role instead of saying that the role is important so we will require calling and gifts to exercise it male headship implies the role is unimportant because any women can and should do it because they cannot be called to other things
849747 but i do believe that we need to recognise a lifelong commitments to consensual stable loving monogamous same sex relationships
849748 we should not move towards proper understanding of scripture and justice on one issue in case we have to change on others
849749 what i like most about the conference isnt the teaching but that was great as i shall go into later but the opportunity to spend those few days entirely focused on god and his church worshipping him in song and in prayer but also in glorifying him by learning more of his nature and his word at the main worship session on a thursday night our church always stands in the top corner where there is room to move around and it gives you a great view of the thousands of people who are devoted to nothing other than showing god their love for him in worship and in giving their hard earned money to further the church like last year this was what left me feeling really inspired and revitalised its like a tiny glimpse of what heaven will be like reminding me of that verse in amazing grace when weve been there ten thousand years bright shining as the sun weve no less days to sing gods praise than when we first begun
849750 are we talking about prohibition in exercising roles or gifts
849751 i dont think the gift of leadership is limited to eldership
849752 our goal is the same but our means are different
849753 so here i am two hours into my sixty sixth year the truth is that im nastier than i used to be back when back when i was sixty four for instance when i was nastier than when i was at sixty two and so forth back and back always the less nasty the further back until i get to the age when i was pre nasty at least consciously when the only shame i knew was the shame of being found out which was when i was well about eight i suppose

849758 this hotel will give us a 24 hour presence downtown
849759 right now housing in the downtown seems to be a moot point the economy is just not there for condos at this time
849760 it will bring a critical mass of people to the downtown overnight visitors who will shop and eat in our restaurants and make trips out into wine country
849761 they havent told us who hotel chain is leaning toward the project but they said they do have someone interested
849762 kids who have health insurance when theyre young do better in school
849763 he had a brilliant mind in math and engineering even though that doesnt come into play much in the flower business
849764 dad was an entrepreneur at heart never afraid to try anything
849765 he was always looking for something new to do and always very good at motivating people
849766 he loved that every day that he woke up he wouldnt know what would happen that day if it rained a lot in colombia the price of roses might go up every day we went in he wasnt sure what hed run into
849767 hed brag about skiing a hundred times in a season and he loved his home in vail
849768 when he was skiing was when he was most free and most happy
849769 he had a huge spot in his heart for his home in vail and that mountain it was a sanctuary for him it was his church it was very symbolic of everything he loved
849770 dave was always very proud of that he always said he played that hole better than tiger woods
849771 im very grateful for the amount of time he put in as a father
849772 even though he had so many business responsibilities he took my friends and me skiing he took us to concerts he was very involved he was the dad of the neighborhood who took the kids everywhere and he was happy to do that he was always there for me and my friends now having two children of my own i realize how much time that takes
849773 they talked probably 20 times a day i know that dave considered kevin to be his best friend ive never seen a father and son who were friends like that
849774 you know when you finish the year theres always some plays you want back and i had that too its just everybody saw the ones i want back on national tv
849775 but i thought i had a pretty good year front to back and i think i can have a better one in this defense
849776 and anybody who is opposite a hall of fame corner is always going to feel pressure
849777 quarterbacks are going to go away from champ and dres always going to get more shots that comes with the territory some guys embrace it a guy like dre i believe embraces it and he has to
849778 one thing about dre he is probably the most competitive guy on this team
849779 he probably just knew he was going to get some action when he came here probably more than any other time in his career we talked about it a lot but he looks forward to that he relishes that opportunity
849780 overall there are always going to be some things you do wrong or you dont do as well
849781 and i know there were some touchdowns i was responsible for that i havent given up in the past but being in the system and the scheme that we were using the play was made
849782 we just gave up too many passing touchdowns but people dont see what goes on in the trenches or what doesnt work they see what goes on in the back end and a passing touchdown is an easy way a fast way to score points and everybody sees it
849783 it was basically give up the outs and the shorter stuff just dont get beat deep but pretty much this year well mix in some things
849784 but our first priority is to dominate the run we were bad in the run last year thats our main focus thats what weve been emphasizing and i just think were involved too at corner that we know if were going to the playoffs we have to deal with the run a lot better than we did last year
849785 slowik wants everybody involved in that and that means me and champ too
849786 i just think quarterbacks are going to have a harder time settling in back there if the offense cant run the ball every time they want to
849787 i can read offenses and i can read plays so much better than i could in my first three four years in the league
849788 im not getting any faster im not getting quicker i dont feel like ive lost anything but i aint getting anymore to add on either so you have to improve your awareness because it can give you an extra step
849789 having great awareness in a lot of situations can carry you a long way
849790 people say i guess and this and that well i tell people if i guess i need to go to damn vegas because im a great guesser because maybe im not guessing since ive been intercepting balls my whole life
849791 it aint like ive been exposed my whole life back there i intercepted the ball in high school and nobody in college intercepted more balls than i did at north carolina where he set the atlantic coast conference record with 20 i intercept it in the nfl i know i can get the ball and im going to show it again this year
849792 i have never known an atheist who could not identify the event or events that brought about his or her unbelief
849793 its one thing if we lose seats simply because of population loss but its another thing if we lose this seat because of illegal immigration and thats exactly what is happening
849794 michigan simply cannot afford to lose another voice at the federal level during these tough economic times
849795 the environmental summit is a perfect way for us to get input and ideas from the community and elected officials
849796 by gathering ideas from the community we can continue to improve the services our dedicated staff members provide to the residents of galveston county
849797 community input will allow staff to meet goals that were established in a strategic health plan adopted in 2004
849798 the plan approved by the galveston county united board of health is designed to make measurable improvements in the health of galveston county
849799 on behalf of his family and friends in galveston we are grateful for honoring dougs memory in such a wonderful way
849800 ghf is really pleased to see this type of interest in our employees and naming it for doug is a special incentive to recognize the role of volunteers in the mission of ghf
849801 the doug kanoy fund really sets a great model for others to follow
849802 we hope that other donors step forward to add support to the philanthropic vision of mr leopold and mr evans so that the fund will increase in years to come allowing for greater participation

849805 we were forced to respond with newly strengthened measures to counter the provocations of the south korean government which has created a confrontational mood toward the north korean republic
849806 the killing was wrong in terms of not only inter korean standards but global standards we strongly call upon the north to sincerely cooperate to get to the bottom of the incident
849807 we would like to ask what legal basis was used to expel the south koreans

849820 some insurers can make a decision in the same day or right on the spot
849821 as health care moves into the digital age there are more and more companies holding vast amounts of patients health information
849822 most people dont even know these organizations exist unfortunately the federal health privacy rule does not cover many of them the lack of transparency with how all of this works is disturbing
849823 theyre now able to ask questions like how do we enable new applications like broadband and mobile video

849825 it is one thing to attract the blue chip companies such as covance
849826 but it is equally important that we have a thriving atmosphere that is conducive to small start ups
849827 lab users like to cluster more than any other industry
849828 the cost to build the space is about three times the cost of general office space so it is very expensive up front for a developer
849829 we wanted to demonstrate the actual utility of these particles
849830 theres been about a 20 percent decrease in sales at lunch people are doing away with larger lunches the 40 to 50 steaks theyre going down to lighter burgers
849831 the damage on wall street is affecting all of our communities
849832 and the effects on our new york state financing are devastating
849833 the state does not have the property tax to fall back on like the city does
849834 this cash cow could be in for a period of decline
849835 this is not the old crying wolf kind of stuff
849836 it is time for new york and other governments to cut up our credit cards the era of buy now and pay later and later is over
849837 i know how politics is i really dont think its going to matter either way
849838 are we out of the woods yet probably not people are just going to be generally cautious in this kind of environment
849839 everybodys feeling something its just a question of what theyre feeling
849840 this market is having less of the fallout because look at the legs that balance our table
849841 its less about washington and more about their national strategy

849843 steve jobs quote me does not give a shit about music because what hes done is bifurcated the music business no longer is the test of an artists work the embodiment of an album what is considered as consumable are single songs and thats because of the apple platform hes a genius the only thing he cares about is selling his platform
849844 i played in these conditions all week so maybe i was more used to it
849845 there were lots of long long rallies which took a toll and we were both tired at the end win against richard gasquet gave me a lot of confidence and this will give me even more

849855 there is some indication and i dont have the conclusions but some of this anthrax may and i emphasize may have come from iraq
849856 but by far the more likely candidate for involvement with al qaeda is iraq
849857 if the scientific path leads to iraq as the supporter of the anthrax used by the terrorist mailers no one should be surprised
849858 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
849859 more public spending restraint could be required and we encourage the authorities that is australias federal and state alp governments sp to identify areas where additional spending cuts could be implemented

849871 i tried my best and im very impressed by how the low scores have been this week it was a great win for ji yai
849872 i kept it together pretty well today but i was emotional on the first tee and coming up the final few holes
849873 i was pleased to play well and to break 70 for the first time this week i just wish the birdie putt at the last had been for the championship
849874 i saw a sign on the scoreboard saying annika you will be missed and then i was greeted with all the applause
849875 this is what i thought seattle would be like when i moved here
849876 note that the ability to generate managed code dynamically using the reflection emit api is not supported inside the clr hosted environment in sql server such code would not have the cas permissions to run and hence would fail at run time
849877 when working with clr the deadlock monitor automatically detects deadlock for synchronization resources monitors reader writer lock and thread join accessed inside managed procedures however the deadlock is resolved by throwing an exception in the procedure that was selected to be the deadlock victim it is important to understand that the exception does not automatically release resources currently owned by the victim the resources must be explicitly released consistent with exception behavior the exception used to identify a deadlock victim can be caught and dismissed
849878 not because i lost the championship lead but because i made a mistake i couldnt see garth tander there and when i turned in it just locked the tyre it was pretty tough conditions on cold tyres but you pride yourself on no making mistakes
849879 we obviously had some problems with the steering in race one but it was very good during races two and three today
849880 if we gain respect back from our competitors and supporters we will have come a fair way
849881 i think it is a massive opportunity i am a really passionate person when it comes to the team and playing for sa it is a huge privilege
849882 i will just focus on what i can do i wont be worrying about things i cant control
849883 i have the structures in my own game to handle the workload
849884 having it all done now lets us move forward in planning and allows me to stamp a game style on the group
849885 lets get it clear the asio submission is very separate to the afp submission
849886 the problem is the material that weve provided to mr clarke a good proportion of it belongs to the united kingdom authorities and we dont have consent to release that
849887 i dont have consent to release that the organisation doesnt have consent to release it nor does mr clarke
849888 its nothing to do with the afp refusing to co operate with the inquiry
849889 but the redacted submission doesnt make sense without the other information being made available
849890 the afp would be far better off if we could publicly put our submission out into both the community and the media but we cant and its not within our control to do that or make that decision
849891 but it hasnt even finished yet weve only put our first witnesses before it
849892 long running managed code that accesses data or allocates enough memory to trigger garbage collection will yield automatically long running managed code that does not access data or allocate enough managed memory to trigger garbage collection should explicitly yield by calling system thread sleep function of the net framework
849893 im thrilled to be asked to host the academy awards for the second time because as they say the third times a charm
849894 its extremely disappointing its disappointing for the collingwood football club
849895 its disappointing for heath shaw given he is a senior player at the club
849896 when youre talking about this four weeks out from finals im sure anyone associated with the collingwood football club would be extremely disappointed
849897 anybody in society it doesnt matter if it is heath shaw anybody who continues to drink and drive is stupid
849898 thats the message that the state government all state governments around the country and the federal government are saying
849899 theres millions and millions of us dollars spent on public awareness to educate people about drink driving
849900 there are still people on weekends and nights who are still getting caught drink driving and whats disappointing about all that is it not only puts themselves at risk but others at risk
849901 the message should be there loud and clear for anybody any individual dont drink and drive its just not on
849902 at this stage hell play the season out unless he believes he cant contribute
849903 its going to mean that at times our young defenders are going to take up some big jobs to help him out
849904 he is still our best defender and he is very keen as the leader to support the team through a tough year and hes fit enough to do it at the moment
849905 hes obviously carrying an injury and been sore but i think thats the courageous defender that he is
849906 hes probably been under pressure more so this year than ever before with the amount of inside 50s the opposition sides have been having because we havent been winning games of footy
849907 the defence has been under more pressure than ever so i think those two things combined have probably put darren under a lot of pressure and its probably showing his injury to be worse than it probably is
849908 it was less efficient than having the planes electronic transmission locator working but more efficient than not having any information
849909 this is one of those searches that could have gone on for days had we not had the cellphones stuff
849910 as far as what happened we cant say we have no idea at this point why
849911 if youre talking about someone to take on both jobs then kevin pietersen becomes the number one candidate because hes one of the few people who can be guaranteed their place in both teams
849912 michael vaughans decision is his own decision but i cant believe that paul collingwood made that decision off his own back
849913 clearly they want to unite the job and get one bloke in there and theyve given paul a gentle nudge to say that this is in the best interests of the team
849914 hes been a wonderfully successful captain englands most successful in terms of test match wins and is surely one of englands greatest ever captains
849915 in terms of playing captaining leading decision making michael vaughan is the best man for the job
849916 its a wonderful job but its also a job that becomes all consuming he said hes not been himself at home and wanted to get back to being me
849917 the job gets on top of you its a great job but youre thinking about it all the time
849918 when youre supposed to be at dinner with friends or the wife youre thinking about who should be opening the bowling the next day and how to tell your mate hes not in the next team
849919 that pressure eventually bears down on you and if youre not getting runs as well then it becomes very difficult
849920 i have the highest regard for him as person sportsman and leader it is a great loss for world cricket
849921 the officer was using the baton as he was taught to
849922 but we very much keep in mind what recordings cant do they only show part of the story
849923 one of the most aggressive police departments in the country
849924 its hard to believe that these incidents arent happening a great deal more than the ones actually ending up on video
849925 using force is ugly but if you dont do that youll have a violent felon running around
849926 we do things people in an office or store or hospital dont have to do
849927 the theory is that if gas prices go up people walk or bike more or they take public transportation which requires walking to and from stops on either end
849928 also people eat out less when gas prices are high because they would have to drive to the restaurant and they have less disposable income
849929 i found that a permanent one dollar rise in gas prices is associated with a seven percent drop in overweight and a nine percent drop in obesity
849930 achieving just the minimum 35 miles per gallon fleet wide average by 2020 would cut oil use by 1 1 million barrels a day
849931 cutting the cost of gasoline at todays prices by more than a dollar per gallon
849932 further achieving a 35 mpg fleet wide average would create 149 000 new jobs nationwide in 2020
849933 ive started taking fewer trips out to see him but i stay for longer periods of time
849934 and when he comes here next month hell be here for 10 11 days
849935 spending more time together on each visit means we spend time as a couple not as two people who are dating
849936 if airfares were still low i probably would still be making lots of short trips
849937 i felt very confident i really had this feeling i was going to make it i liked it all the way but it just didnt come left
849938 i was thinking going down 13 that ive got to start getting it near the flag
849939 i thought i had to find three birdies coming in i didnt know if that was going to get the job done or not
849940 i thought if i could shoot four or five under the front nine i would be a chance
849941 i did what i wanted to do hit a lot of good shots and the back nine i played good too i hit every green except the last and just ran the edges with the birdie putts
849942 im taking a lot of confidence from this win you expect to get that after winning your first big tournament
849943 its different when you play against an opponent who plays a similar game with you
849944 he was playing a lot of slice and changing pace to my forehand i just lost the rhythm today
849945 i had a great match last night i played rocket tennis but that was not possible against andy today weve known each other since we were 13 or 14
849946 we used to watch these kind of matches on television and now we are playing them
849947 it was really hot but ive played all of my matches in these conditions
849948 but by the end we were both tired it was really getting to us
849949 i played a bit more aggressive and served a little bit smarter than i had in the past and obviously it worked
849950 its huge to win your first sort of major tournament and to do it in a match like today makes it more special
849951 the problem is not that some costs will rise but that at the moment there is no discussion of the need to compensate the state and territory governments
849952 nearly one and a half billion us dollars per year could employ more than 15 000 teachers or nurses
849953 the commonwealth has said that it will compensate households and polluters but it looks to us as though the state governments have got a much stronger case for compensation than the big emitters
849954 unless the commonwealth puts compensating the states ahead of compensating the polluters then those who rely most heavily on government services will miss out the most
849955 that reflects a concern in the community in australia for us to act
849956 but i also would say to you that i think at the moment that just as many australians are yet to fully understand what an emissions trading scheme actually is how it operates and what its going to do
849957 i respect the view in the community that people are concerned about climate change they want australia to act but i equally think its fair to say that most australians in fact an equal proportion still dont understand that its going to mean a tax that will wash through every part of australian life every household every small business
849958 people have got to understand exactly what we are going into an emissions trading scheme is in plain language a tax t a x
849959 and what that means is that pensioners carers low income households small businesses every part of this country is going to be turned upside down
849960 it will be simple no white tablecloths and homemade pastas
849961 i am not going to have an acrimonious relationship with the legislature
849962 i finally did something to get him to invite me
849963 he worked with me to fight the rockefeller drug laws
849964 real estate in the hamptons is especially strong among europeans
849965 its more reasonable for them to buy or rent in the estate section of southampton than in saint tropez cap ferrat or cap dantibes
849966 im happy to be in the midst of so many asian babes
849967 in fact im happy that the podium covers me from the waist down
849968 like a dress on a beautiful woman long enough to cover the important parts and short enough to keep your interest like my colleague jujus
849969 this kind of remark has no place in any setting and martin knows that
849970 upon reflection it was a tasteless remark that i now bitterly regret
849971 do not judge or you too will be judged for in the same way you judge others you will be judged and with the measure you use it will be measured to you why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brothers eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye you hypocrite first take the plank out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brothers eye
849972 forgive our sins as we forgive those who sin against us
849973 the dancers add a great deal to making this musical production so entertaining and classy
849974 among them zachary denison stood out for me because he really lights up the stage performing with deft skill and enormous energy and joy the dancing involves plenty of high stepping in cowboy boots and is quite athletic and very accessible and celebrational
849975 there was definitely a bit of caressing going on the body language was very romantic
849976 my heart is broken i am the mother of the most tender hearted high spirited beautiful little girl who is the spitting image of her father
849977 all that i can cling to is his presence inside her that reveals itself every day his family and i watch matilda as she whispers to trees hugs animals and takes steps two at a time and we know that he is with us still she will be brought up with the best memories of him
849978 there are plans to evacuate all children whose parents give their consent
849979 we reserve the right to strike georgian cities we have something that can reach them
849980 theyre for defensive purposes were not going to attack anybody
849981 any gringo ship that sails into brown waters river waters will itself turn brown and go to the bottom because theyll not get through
