2000089 and could i mention that sen obama a couple of days ago said that we ought to all inflate our tires and i dont disagree with that the american automobile association strongly recommends it but i also dont think that thats a way to become energy independent
2000090 every pound per square inch of tire underinflation wastes 4 million gallons of gas daily in the u s

2000100 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
2000101 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
2000102 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters know is who uses that language for what purpose
2000103 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
2000104 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
2000105 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
2000106 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
2000107 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
2000108 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
2000109 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
2000110 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
2000111 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
2000112 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
2000113 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
2000114 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
2000115 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
2000116 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
2000117 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
2000118 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
2000119 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
2000120 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
2000121 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
2000122 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
2000123 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
2000124 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
2000125 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
2000126 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
2000127 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
2000128 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
2000129 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
2000130 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
2000131 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
2000132 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
2000133 i wonder how a man can manage between two three or four he must be a superman
2000134 finally the us government placed pressure on the church to outlaw the practice

2000137 of all the injuries we see these are some of the worst
2000138 on air with no voltage mods it seems that the maximum clock speeds that can be achived are right in the neighborhood of 766mhz on the gpu cores and 1105mhz on the gddr3 memory i say this after benchmarking two reference design cards from different manufacturers that basically overclocked identically the difference between the two cards clock speeds can be counted on one hand the 166mhz overclock on the gpu core offers an increase in performance in many of the game benchmarks tested keeping the cores cool by manually increasing the fan speed to 100 percent does help in achieving a higher overclock just not more that 766mhz on the core in this case 166mhz on the core and 105mhz on the memory are respectable overclocks when it comes down to it when the cpu speed is ramped up the 9800gx2 takes off this card from palit performed almost identically the the xfx model i looked at several months ago scores of close to 19000 in 3dmark06 with the cpu at 3 6ghz show the potential of the card while you can always hope for more ultimately what you get on air is what you get

2000147 mr wickett is that rarely heard from but best of all possible reviewers the dedicated and knowledgeable fan he writes clean cutting and fresh reviews that represent a sensibility unspoiled by over exposure to the biz of books but deeply in love with them
2000148 dan wickett is serious about a good read but the ewn email list doesnt just deliver his sure footed reviews it also brings you news and connectiosn to other writers sign up now he understands what readers want to know about books
2000149 dan wickett is a readers best friend not only does he read and trenchantly review new work but he looks back to books that deserve ongoing readership ive lost track of the number of times hes led me to boks that i overlooked or never knew about and that were a delight there arent many reviewers i will let shape my library but dan wickett is one
2000150 just could not find a harmonious way to work together and that has lead to the decisions announced today

2000152 despite the fact that ive always spoken positively of the olympic ideal and never called for a boycott or asked an athlete to break an ioc rule my visa was revoked less than 24 hours before my scheduled departure
2000153 the denial of my visa is a part of a systemic effort by the chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of darfur

2000165 from the 30th of june we have no longer been able to ship a pc with a xp licence
2000166 however what we have been able to do with microsoft is ship pcs with a vista business licence but with xp pre loaded that is still the majority of business computers we are selling today
2000167 looking into the crystal ball i dont think businesses will see much value in upgrading to vista until late next year and even so microsoft will probably have come out with something else by then
2000168 given that theres a mountain of evidence to refute this report including multiple reports from forrester and other top tier analysts this appears to be more focused on making sensationalist statements rather than offering a thoughtful industry perspective based on conversations with it operations professionals or deep knowledge of enterprise deployment cycles
2000169 how is this useful guidance to customers its disappointing to see such a respected organisation like forrester take this approach
2000170 the evidence before the court satisfies that the first defendant williams has failed to attend to his contractual responsibilities
2000171 there is evidence he has entered into a contract with the second defendant toulon and intends to play in a rugby match this evening
2000172 my conclusion is that the making of an interlocutory interim injunction will not be futile
2000173 for both the elca evangelical lutheran church in america and the lutheran world federation this travel restrictions on hiv people is both an issue of faith and of human rights
2000174 as a religious leader i am convinced that lifting discriminatory travel restrictions is a responsible act of justice and mercy most of those restrictions are born out of fear and ignorance

2000176 do not go gentle into that good night blog blog against the dying of the light
2000177 one of the great joys in serving in this body is when some of my colleagues take firm stands on both sides of an issue
2000178 we stood here on this floor just a couple of months ago and we wanted to take just an itty bitty portion of windfall profits from the oil companies where last week they reported 11 billion in profits and use it to keep from laying off teachers
2000179 dont waste our time with a drill were against drills debates with foregone conclusions are of no value
2000180 if i had gone 7 months into the budget process and not made a public proposal not shared what my point of view for balancing the budget was with the people of california i might want to change the subject as well
2000181 we have a situation where the voters of california have been taken hostage but we cant get a ransom note
2000182 because its been said on this floor today people are having a tough time with gas prices well if you are going to take their public transit away they have to know people have to have the courage to tell them
2000183 people are struggling with education well if were going to take their retraining away at a time of economic downturn we should tell them
2000184 people are having trouble making ends meet well if their health care is going out the door shouldnt we tell them
2000185 because the interesting people were making comments against the sale tax on the floor
2000186 because if thats the case of course there wouldnt be a public budget you have to level with the public its time to have a budget in public you cant compromise with nothing
2000187 and we want to drive this down the middle we want to get it done we want the people to know what the issues are
2000188 the governors childlike pledge has put years of work on the high speed rail project in danger
2000189 we need to end the foot stomping and get to work given schwarzeneggers handling of the budget crisis thus far i wouldnt be surprised if his next press conference included a new pledge to hold his breath until he turns bright blue
2000190 the governor himself told a national television audience that flip flopping is a great thing that it is a wonderful thing when someone has made a mistake and is able to be honest about it and change his mind
2000191 keeping a viable high speed rail bond off the ballot at this critical juncture after decades of laying the groundwork for a system that will move this state forward would be a huge mistake the only thing remaining to be seen is whether the governor will recognize and acknowledge that fact before it is too late to correct

2000199 i would have loved to see it thrive on curry row but twas not to be i guess part of the challenge was their high prices the other places in the neighborhood are far cheaper and its tucked away so neatly

2000202 the activities of many organizations of the civil rights era
2000203 dr kings type of resistance to the u s version of apartheid could surely be considered homegrown terrorism
2000204 dr kings type of resistance to the u s version of apartheid could surely be considered homegrown terrorists
2000205 the activities of many organizations of the civil rights era could be characterized by a government so inclined as an organization of violent radicalization
2000206 called themselves muslims and had tried to recruit young people
2000207 had the intent and took several steps toward fulfilling their plan
2000208 the south florida joint terrorism task force successfully performed its mission to prevent terrorism by identifying disrupting and prosecuting these individuals before they posted an immediate threat to our nation

2000224 look i never asked anybody to be for me because i was black

2000226 i dont want people to expect me to speak about those issues

2000236 in my community living with hiv is synonymous with death
2000237 hiv reached my community 10 years ago i never thought i would get it
2000238 first i went through a process of denial and i hid the disease but later i decided to look for information
2000239 when a cuna indian in my district starts to show symptoms he is called boni which means he has a bad spirit in his body
2000240 then we go to our healers who tell us what herbs to take to strengthen our immune system but hiv is much stronger much more resistant
2000241 information is needed to curb the spread of hiv but efforts to bring information to indigenous communities must come hand in hand with our customs and beliefs and our own languages
2000242 the countries participating in the indigenous peoples conference have realised that the epidemic has now also become a rural phenomenon that the virus is in the bodies of indigenous people which makes it necessary to design culturally sensitive prevention strategies
2000243 the main problem facing indigenous people living with hiv is access to treatment and health care because of poverty marginalisation stigma and racism
2000244 how can we break down the communication barriers to ensure access to information and timely prevention
2000245 one of the great challenges we face as indigenous people because we must be able to engage in self criticism is the question of traditional customs and habits which clearly hurt women the most
2000246 indigenous people complain that outside of our communities we suffer discrimination but within our communities we dont want to recognise sexual diversity like homoerotic practices for example
2000247 our aim is to build a latin american strategy to create epidemiological indicators that allow us to gauge the number of indigenous people living with hiv and map out the spontaneous responses that are emerging in the communities
2000248 we are going to create an international secretariat for indigenous people to train leaders influence public policies and make sure we are included in the declarations of the u n general assembly special session on hiv aids
2000249 major efforts are needed to determine the intensity of the epidemic in indigenous and afro descendant communities
2000250 we need data in order to carry out this advocacy work and defend indigenous people living with hiv we need concrete statistics on prevalence rates particularly among indigenous populations
2000251 there is more information on afro descendants particularly in the northern part of central america
2000252 for example the garifuna community afro descendants who live on the coast of belize guatemala and honduras and who migrated 200 years ago from the lesser antilles had an average hiv prevalence rate of eight percent in 1998 which is very high in the regional context
2000253 it is encouraging that it has gone down somewhat but that is not a significant reduction
2000254 we believe that programmes should be designed that are adapted to indigenous and afro descendant communities they must be culturally sensitive involving the participation of traditional healers for example
2000255 i committed myself to increasing the visibility of the epidemic in these communities
2000256 i have already started talking to my colleagues on the regional u n team for latin america to see how we can identify ways to strengthen the available information and the necessary prevention efforts

2000358 the statue is an intergenerational depiction of inequality as the poverty of the woman is cast in stark contrast to the wealth of the man the children of each are chilling prophesies of the unequal future that is certain to come at the base of the statue is an inscription that forms the title of this note never again should a people starve in a world of plenty

2000421 since the mice were genetically identical except for leptin this shouldnt have happened but the inflammation was there and it was chronic

2000426 the chances of key local polls taking place in iraq this year all but vanished yesterday after parliament failed to pass a law on elections because of a row over the contested city of kirkuk which threatens to heighten arab kurdish tensions
2000427 the iraqi parliament speaker ended an emergency parliamentary session wednesday after the political blocs failed to reach an agreement over a disputed provincial election bill parliament speaker mahmoud al mashhadani said by the end of the 44th session on wednesday the parliament concluded its first legislative term and would resume sessions on sept 9
2000428 roughly half of the 48 billion dollar budget of 2008 approved earlier by the parliament
2000429 i can confirm to you that we have lost the chance to hold the elections in october
2000430 iraqi politicians officials and western diplomats have speculated that the political parties in government were never invested in holding a vote this year out of fear they would lose seats and influence at the provincial level senior politicians including president jalal talabani a kurd and vice president tariq hashimi a sunni arab have been absent from baghdad during the round the clock negotiations citing medical reasons
2000431 the elections would be the first provincial balloting in almost four years
2000432 i listened to many of them i noticed that most of them talk about kirkuk in a way as if its a prey for the greed and abmitions of their parties they never talk about it as a part of iraq because they dont care about iraq they care only about their limited personal interests
2000433 special inspector general for iraq reconstructions recent findings about how rich iraq is with oil money
2000434 yes its true that the iraqi government is spending little on reconstruction the weak iraqi capability to do big projects maybe at the end of 2008 will improve
2000435 signs of iraqs slowness to rebuild are everywhere in baghdad roughly 20 of the city is without proper sewage pipes published statistics say the baghdad is getting roughly 11 hours of electricity a day on average but many residents go days with only sporadic bursts of power iraqi officials say fixing just this problem could take up to 10 years chronic electricity shortages for another decade mean little energy for construction making iraqi hopes for a renewed capital seem distant
2000436 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects it is inexcusable for us taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
2000437 this is projected and not real money we have many reconstruction projects and as you know most of the infrastruture of the country had collapsed after the war and that needs a lot of money to rebuild the country
2000438 as of december 31 2007 the iraqi government had accumulated financial deposits of 29 4 billion held in the development fund for iraq and central government deposits at the central bank of iraq and iraqs commerical banks
2000439 from 2005 through 2007 the iraqi government generated an estimated 96 billion in cumulative revenues of which crude oil export sales accounted for about 90
2000440 with oil prices at or near all time highs it has become increasingly apparent that iraq is closer than ever to financial independence with the extreme property damage caused by an invasion of questionable legality the need for security and reconstruction monies is great but who should be held accountable many us taxpayers are becoming disenchanted due to the fact that with nearly 33 billion in oil earnings in the first half of 2008 iraq is now capable of shouldering an increased share of the burden our own economy is floundering and many simply feel that it is time for iraq to step up and assume control over its own destiny
2000441 two numbers 482 billion and 79 billion the first is next years projected federal budget deficit a record the second is the budget surplus that iraq is expected to accumulate by the end of the year is there any question which government whose taxpayers should be footing the bill for reconstruction projects in iraq
2000442 something is out of whack iraqis are very proud to say that its their country and they are right so they should fix it
2000443 many iraqis who lack adequate electricity clean water and jobs find it unfathomable their country is awash in oil dollars last year it spent less than a third of the 12 billion budgeted for major projects such as electricity housing and water
2000444 five star hotels parking garages a theater restaurant aquarium and basketball courts casino and boat rides but given the lagging basic services reporters questioned whether baghdads priorities are appropriate and realistic with temperatures hittign 130 degrees many parts of iraq dont have a steady electricity supply and some areas only get two hours a day getting clean water and adequate health care are also major issues

2000556 now that we know that the us govt believes that anthrax came from the inside shouldnt cohen be a wee bit curious about what this warning was based on
2000557 theres either a significant amount of money behind this or this is state sponsored or this is stuff that was stolen from the former soviet program
2000558 if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks then that means that the anthrax came from a u s government lab

2000629 72 of our members are from the philippines 10 us 2
2000630 said faith sabanpan ponte marketing and web services head of itzamatch
2000631 last year we decided to go out of the virtual world and meet up with our subscribers we launched our very first eyeball party mid of last year it was pretty exciting for all of us since we have only interacted with one another online and havent met any of the members personally it was successful that we now have regular eyeball parties and saturday coffee meetings since the great thing is our members have gotten to know each other even more and have really bonded as a community that they themselves organize mini eyeball parties coffee sessions or little gatherings
2000632 were really happy that weve become an avenue for starting and building relationships
2000633 we have been successful in getting the market that we want which is the 18 22 age bracket our google analytics data shows that we are getting an increasing traffic from the city where itzamatch is based we also saw potential revenue from advertisers that partnered with us this contest has actually paved for more opportunities as we recently had inquiry from a popular fmcg company about doing the same activity in manila
2000634 lastly the greatest achievement to date is we are getting the attention that we wanted from potential subscribers and businesses that complement this social networking business of bigfoot
2000635 soon users will be able to experience the features of the site simultaneously the user will be able to drag the chat window in another area of the desktop and at the same time drag the forum in another and some other features allowing the user to see and interact with what is going on at the same time
2000636 were also working on a faster and more specific itzamatch search for geographical targeting results within the philippines we are currently making our system more robust to accommodate our growing subscriber base and balancing the look and online features with speed
2000637 liking living walking talking and breathing itzamatch everyday proved to be a challenge i could not resist why i agreed to do itzamatch com lets just say i was intellectually and socially challenged
2000638 the death of this boy signals the social decomposition which weve reached
2000639 mexico doesnt deserve this reality neither do the coming generations
2000640 this cowardly act demonstrates the urgency of putting a halt to these criminal bands
2000641 my son crossed paths with soulless men people for whom there are no words to describe
2000642 the problem is corruption collusion the relationship the police have with the kidnappers
2000643 filled many families with mourning because many families live with this problem of kidnapping in mexico
2000644 why do you make me spend all my time masturbating couldnt you work on getting me into shape or reading some books
2000645 what about the pseudoscientifc one that says were all one big game of sims for some aliens or something that one is pretty scary when you think it through
2000646 benignrobot im afraid you dont understand whats an infinitesimal whenever you divide by two a distance you divide by two the time necessary to go through it if you do it infinitely you still can add all the pieces to find that the total time is finite it doesnt matter that the adding is infinite since all the things youre adding are small enough to produce a finite well defined result that ancient greek paradox was solved long time ago at least since leibniz
2000647 well what if there are six senses and we are just incapable of perceiving the sixth one and therefore every machine theory datum etc we come up with is incomplete
2000648 i wasnt talking about religion i was talking about how mankind is finite and not omniscient which would severely hinder our understanding about the universe
2000649 everything in existence can be divided by two infinitely thus nothing can ever travel from one point to another as it must first travel to the point half the distance it must also travel half the distance to the point half way between the initial points and so forth and so on infinitely each distance having to first be traversed to its halfway point before it can completely span the entire distance
2000650 what is the source of the pictures to the right of every article heading
2000651 this is why i think that abrahmic religions are implausible
2000652 you are also correct that for reproduction to be sexual it must be between two genders lala hasnt a clue
2000653 matter we havent seen yet that must be there to prevent the known universe from exploding
2000654 energy that we havent seen yet that must be there to drive the universe to be constantly exploding
2000655 surely youre joking i cant believe he did that with a government supercomputer in los alamos
2000656 i could never get into the many worlds thing i just dont buy that theres a universe out there exactly like the one im in only the diet sunkist on my desk just stood up and started singing a negro spiritual and then another where it started singing a negro spiritual but was flat on the fourth note
2000657 well its just from your point of view your mind created it therefore it did happen because you heard about it if you didnt hear about it light would bend in a different direction
2000658 could scarcely empty a scuttle of ashes so handless was the poor creature
2000659 to sit back hoping that someday some way someone will make things right is to go on feeding the crocodile hoping he will eat you last but eat you he will
2000660 good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
2000661 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
2000662 people either come out of this class totally excited about making chocolate at home and start buying all of the equipment or saying i really appreciate what it takes to make this but now i know i dont want to do it myself
2000663 for the next two and a half weeks almost all youll hear in the news will be related to the 29th olympiad in beijing
2000664 beyond this in 2010 we will see the world expo in shanghai and the asian games in guangzhou
2000665 china has been gearing up for the games for the past few years finally with a dozen new sports stadiums and a cross city underground railway to ferry visitors to different venues china will be on display to the world
2000666 if youve been investing internationally youre no stranger to china depending on when you bought you may either love it or hate it for instance in 2007 chinese stocks rocketed up the charts 97
2000667 in 2006 the gains were even more impressive at 130 but it hasnt been all fun and games in the past two years china peaked at the same time u s stocks in october 2007
2000668 since then their indexes have dropped substantially nearly 40 much more than the s amp p 500 investors in chinese equities have taken a bath over the last year but that doesnt mean its over for asian giant so why is it time to consider china again
2000669 for one the olympics will showcase china to the world in the next 18 days the middle kingdom will host more visitors in its cities than at any time in history
2000670 half a million wealthy attendees from all over the globe will descend upon beijing shanghai qinhuangdao shenyang tianjin and hong kong en masse
2000671 it will be a unique opportunity for china to highlight its stability and economic viability to international business leaders after growth stunting decades of mao led communism
2000672 but thats not all in 2010 the world expo in shanghai and the asian games in guangzhou are expected to bring in more visitors and stimulate more construction than even the olympics china has already spent nearly 35 billion on the olympics
2000673 they are expected to spend more on the other two events what does this mean for the chinese economy in the words of the u s government economic stimulus
2000674 since 1988 the host countrys stock market rose an average 38 in the year following a summer olympics the chinese market has been down since last october but china wont be down forever
2000675 since 1978 china has been revamping its infrastructure to be more business friendly the government realizes that cash is king in international finance
2000676 their government has been raising capital by depressing their domestic currency yuan and increasing exports to countries like the u s
2000677 its worked as of may china reportedly has 1 6 trillion on hand to stimulate their economic interests recently the chinese government has been strategically deploying cash to protect their market
2000678 in the past few months efforts have begun to take root no doubt as a result of chinese government intervention china seems ready to defend investors against any further decline
2000679 just like in the u s chinese consumers are the backbone of the economy however chinese consumers are not like american consumers consider this
2000680 the average chinese household saves 30 of their wages thats why most houses and apartments in china have been purchased in cash a big difference from the debt leveraged subprime laden u s economy
2000681 cash rich chinese consumers can afford to spend more because they have more to spend its just a matter of convincing consumers to part with savings for more goods and services
2000682 that problem is easier to solve than funding an economy with more debt thats why china looks more attractive than any other investment on the horizon
2000683 right now it looks very attractive the recent chart shows consolidation with an apparent double bottom in place trading over 19 million shares per day fxi is the most liquid chinese etf available
2000684 we think getting in just before the olympics is a great opportunity to profit from the buzz of the olympics and the underlying strength of the chinese economy to buy into china at a good low go with fxi
2000685 anybody who says the president of the united states is lying about weapons of mass destruction is lying
2000686 we dont believe that the three were released by coincidence
2000687 apparently they were released to pave the way for agreement on a prisoner exchange
2000688 hamas is lying when it says that its not conducting negotiations with israel
2000689 they are talking to israel through the egyptians and other arab parties
2000690 undoubtedly the release of the hamas prisoners will create a better atmosphere for negotiations to reach a prisoner exchange
2000691 but i cant tell you if this move is linked to the ongoing egyptian efforts to reach a prisoner swap agreement
2000692 when hamas signs an agreement it abides by it but the israelis want to deal with us the same way they have been dealing with mahmoud abbass authority they want the palestinians to honor all the agreements while they themselves dont abide by them
2000693 he is an arrogant politician that thinks he is already the president
2000694 windows vista operating system will run optimally when installed on the sandisk ssd
2000695 we have been so used to hard drives for so many years windows is optimized for that obviously
2000696 my guess is that samsung and microsoft are maybe working on the os recognizing an ssd with a 4kb sector size instead of a hard disk drive with a 512 byte sector size
2000697 its possible that women feel more shame when remembering their own offenses
2000698 there are some great lan events hosted around the world each year here in finland that event is the assembly with over 5000 participants this four day event offers a lot of lights noise and great people
2000699 fatah is in deep disarray losing political ground to hamas which rules in gaza and both mr abbas and mr olmert clearly hope that the release of a range of palestinians to mr abbas will boost his troubled political standing
2000700 come on folks there must be a way to avoid reelecting this guy is a sticker campaign the only way

2000702 the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
2000703 american atheists also suggests that members present printouts of aas website at the fair gate and ask for the same 2 admission discount
2000704 she tried to block the permit until her ring was kissed directly by organizers
2000705 the court basically told the city that if that is all it has it cant take these homes
2000706 it is too late for the city to manufacture more evidence so the courts ruling is a fatal blow to the city
2000707 weve always said wed like to settle this through negotiations
2000708 the historian archivist for the coca cola company for the last 30 years

2000710 vuzixs iwear vr920 399 is pitched as the worlds first fully immersive virtual reality video eyewear
2000711 we entered kfar darom this was the first time i was in gush katif i saw that it looked just like a kibbutz large lawns very nice one floor houses i had always thought that settlers meant caravans and poverty but suddenly i saw how beautiful the place was
2000712 we got to the houses of the families and then it became very very hard
2000713 at one point his father and brother said they refused to let any soldiers come into their house and that they would take the boy out by themselves
2000714 it was a traumatic experience my girl friends started to cry for the first time one of them next to me said youll hear these cries of his as youre giving birth it was truly jolting the cries of that boy are with me every day they really are
2000715 there was an ethiopian family that we moved out it really broke my heart i remember that there even i cried the father kept on giving his little daughter candies to give to us the people who came to take them out just so she wouldnt be afraid of us he asked to speak with all of us and explained that ever since he arrived from ethiopia by foot in operation solomon in 1991 he has been wandering in israel among different caravan neighborhoods and only here in kfar darom did he finally succeed in building his house he asked us not to take him out forcefully as he wanted to go out by himself he took his little daughter in his hands and his suitcase and when he reached the door he just broke down in tears and crying held on to the doorpost and simply refused to part where is he today did he ever recover from what we did to him did he end up wandering again among caravans i dont know but that moment was shocking it it something that you remember every day something you get up with in the morning if you ignore it and leave it aside everything is fine but when you really think about it and the pictures return it is shocking its alive and kicking and painful and burning
2000716 i hope the families and residents will forgive me first of all as a private individual who did this terrible thing and also as a citizen of this country
2000717 i hear much talks about additional evacuations of jewish towns and people and various concessions it seems to me that everyone can see what is happening in the place that we evacuated i remember that the chairman of my youth movement spoke to us during a seminar in preparation for the disengagement and said we are not happy at their misfortune we want to do something good if it turns out to be not good we will be strong enough to admit that we failed well i never heard that he asked forgiveness but if we have to be strong enough to admit that we failed then i feel that this move was a failure it was a wrong move
2000718 were not yet in our permanent homes we have not yet reached our rest and inheritance to come and say to us were sorry without doing something to repair what they did has no meaning the soldiers who feel bad about what they do have to tell their commanders in that well oiled machine that they will not take part in another expulsion and they must go the people they threw out of their homes and see what they can do for them and they must educate their future children not to take part in something like this
2000719 but rather a national correction that must be made the nation of israel has to know that if someone destroyed an area in the land of israel it doesnt get solved just by saying sorry when it comes to the destruction of the land of israel there is no forgiveness
2000720 i wasnt sure i had really seen what i thought i had
2000721 it was strange i hadnt encountered anything like it before i wanted to make sure so i asked the cashier what the discount was and why he was not giving it to me
2000722 he insisted that it wasnt a discount but i said cancel the purchase and scan it again so he relented and said its a discount only for minorities
2000723 i asked him what it meant and he said a discount only for arabs i said what do you mean if i was arab you would give me a discount he said yes definitively it was really strange i decided not to argue and to forgo the discount so i paid full price for the products i had purchased
2000724 i didnt expect to get a discount but i was appalled when i realized that had i been arab i would have received one i tried to think what would happen if it was a discount only for jews or sephardim or ashkenazim
2000725 home center offers a wide range of attractive discounts throughout the year as part of a plan to target specific communities the chain offers different discounts for different sectors from time to time

2000730 we defended against the al dura lie now its time to go on the offensive and get the french media to pay the price for supporting an anti semitic lie
2000731 seven years for seven years a despicable campaign of hate has been trying to stain the professional honour of charles enderlin for seven years there have been those who have tried to present as fabricated and as a staged scene his report that shows how a 12 year old boy was killed by shots fired from an israeli position
2000732 personalities who are worried by the fact i was not found guilty they say there is no right to defame and the justice system is allowing me to defame him thats not true the judge found there was no defamation
2000733 the french people aware of the case are on board with me
2000734 im not talking about most of the journalists the anti semitic politicians and the so called french intellectuals
2000735 the french media lied about the fact we won the case
2000736 the french media are all complicit in this kind of behaviour anti zionism anti israel which leads to anti semitism
2000737 france is still the most anti semitic country in the western world and it is very annoying to see that even when we can prove they were manipulating theyd rather lie and cover up the mistake of their colleague than tell the truth
2000738 signs on behalf of candidates for public office or measures on election ballots shall be erected not earlier than thirty 30 days prior to the primary election and removed within seven 7 days following the general election

2000740 lukacs understands that churchill allowed civilization to survive for another 50 years and perhaps much more as he puts it in the conclusion of churchill attempted to withstand and sweep back the wave of a monstrous revolutionary nihilism that many at the time confused with a wave of the future for his noble deeds and speech the great english statesman surely deserves our gratitude and admiration

2000752 the secular coalition for america has been successful beyond my most optimistic hopes and dreams this success is made possible by your generous contributions over the past few years
2000753 since your last donation the secular coalition has grown dramatically our office now has five paid staff your continued annual support will allow us to plan our budgets and activities on a reliable foundation of dedicated supporter a firm financial base permits us to seize opportunities to build on our successes
2000754 as you are well aware this administration has been very successful in infusing president bushs personal religious beliefs into our secular government from creating armies of compassion through faith based initiatives to his complicit approval of zealots in our armed forces both civilian and military christian evangelicals who use their positions of authority to convert the unchurched president bush has done a great dal of damage when the bush administration leaves on january 20 2009 not that im counting we must be ready to get to work repairing that damage

2000796 there is a very simple way to settle this drop the eminent domain actions
2000797 that will settle this overnight just drop eminent domain that is all the mtotsa folks have asked for they could end this tomorrow
2000798 im disappointed in having to go back to judge lawsons chambers because from his last judgment i really did not feel that he evaluated our case properly
2000799 theres a win there in that theyre saying the city did not necessarily declare our area properly blighted by the state constitution
2000800 but has advancement been made is our suffering going to stop any time soon
2000801 my initial read on it is there is enough there for both sides to claim victory
2000802 in many ways this is a good time to sit down and discuss settlement
2000803 any time is a good time to discuss resolving differences many of the allegations made over the course of the litigation that got thrown out today
2000804 now maybe there could be less rancor and we could get something done
2000805 this is just a great win for the mtotsa neighborhood and it has been a long time coming
2000806 the ruling once again reaffirms the constitutional rights of property owners
2000807 as such this is not just a victory for the mtotsa homeowners but for every citizen of this state
2000808 we agree with appellants that material facts are in dispute regarding not only whether substantial evidence supports a finding of a need for redevelopment
2000809 we agree with appellants that the city did not find actual blight under any part of the law that the record lacked substantial evidence that could have supported the new jersey constitutions standard for finding blight and that the absence of substantial evidence of blight compels reversal
2000810 i dont think the city will be able to produce a planner who will say these properties are blighted
2000811 if there is no credible evidence of blight i dont see judge lawson being able to do anything other than dismiss these complaints
2000812 there will be plenty of additional information that will not be helpful to the homeowners
2000813 the court is not going to allow them to essentially manufacture evidence after the fact

2000840 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
2000841 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
2000842 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters know is who uses that language for what purpose
2000843 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
2000844 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
2000845 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
2000846 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
2000847 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
2000848 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
2000849 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
2000850 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
2000851 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
2000852 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
2000853 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
2000854 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
2000855 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
2000856 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
2000857 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
2000858 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
2000859 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
2000860 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
2000861 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
2000862 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
2000863 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
2000864 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
2000865 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
2000866 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
2000867 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
2000868 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
2000869 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
2000870 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
2000871 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
2000872 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
2000873 he is an arrogant politician that thinks he is already the president
2000874 over 140 years ago our supreme court stated a party to an action may appear in his own proper person or by attorney but he cannot do both
2000875 we have gamers who play 24 hours a day and also gamers who turned out to be forum moderators but seldom play their characters i think loyal is being attached to the community no matter how often or seldom you play the game
2000876 it has a contemporary style but was enveloped with mystery if not all most of us were once students so everyone can relate with the game with ran online you get to start your character as a student and as you level up more skills and more maps will unfold the game is very easy to play but is challenging enough because of the other game features i guess these points make the gamers more attached to the game
2000877 we consider our community as a new breed of gamers where most are really first timers ran online is also built as a party dependent game the characters level up faster when they party up with other characters this feature made the gamers stick together form real life barkadas and also bond families together
2000878 we ensure that our valued players are having the best gaming experience we continuously come up with online and offline events for the players to meet the gaming experience they cant find in other games
2000879 of all the gaming companies we are proud to say that e games ran has very active game masters both in game and through forums the managements main objective is to make the players happy thats why our game masters are always there to assist and resolve problems as soon as possible

2000883 hamas is exercising its moral and historical responsibility to the palestinian people and to the prisoners families despite the ridiculous comments uttered by israeli leaders regarding their ability to reach the captive in the strip im telling noam shalit your son will remain forever in gaza should your government fail to comply with our demands the ball is in israels court and for long months now weve been waiting for a response to our demands which have not changed

2000901 so you are as i expected nothing but a little panty slut is that it
2000902 you had better learn to treat me with more respect you are not the one who sets the rules around here do you understand
2000903 you are right about you having strange fantasies but you are dead wrong in thinking you can just get away with it your friend misty was nice enough to record a few of your conversations for me
2000904 care to hear how you sound when you play your fairy cocksucker games
2000905 i am a little panty bitch i am a little cocksucking whore
2000906 now obviously i have more of these and i have every intention of sending them to your employers your friends even your parents if you do not do precisely what i say but i dont think i even need that threat because from that last tape i understand this is exactly what you wanted to have happen all along you wanted to get caught didnt you you wanted me to make you into the little faggot slut you only dreamed of being i always wondered about you how you pretended that you needed to shave your legs to play basketball i accepted that but i thought it was a little odd how you needed to shave your armpits too well alex youre in luck i think this game will be fun dont you now take off your clothes
2000907 and i wasnt wrong about either you bitch see how turned on you are by your humiliation you probably think im going to let you fuck me now that i am playing some sort of game well this is no game and it will be a cold winters night in hell before that pathetic little cock of yours ever touches this pussy again but i must admit i am enjoying this too i have a little idea an idea that will get you all pretty like you need to be while letting me get off at the same time
2000908 you know alex fuck bitches like you need to get a sexy tan for their men in the summer put this on
2000909 oh dont you look good almost like the perfect little whore except for that pathetic excuses for a penis poking out where it shouldnt well have to do something about that
2000910 you will keep this pathetic thing hidden from sight between the cheeks of your little faggot ass
2000911 you thought i was going to play with that pathetic excuse of a cock of yours im afraid that is not going to happen no i am afraid that you have lost the privilege of sex with me i always saw it as a burden a simple obligation of marriage i am relieved i wont have to endure having sex with you anymore but dont think i am done with you i will still use you for my amusement but first i have to get you ready
2000912 outside with you we are going to get you nice and tanned

2000932 productivity is still rising at a healthy pace that fact combined will the relatively modest unit labor costs for the second quarter and year present a picture that inflation is not getting out of control which is good news for those seeking lower interest rates and for business executives

2000943 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
2000944 some of the environmental lobbyists of the western nations are the salt of the earth but many of them are elitists theyve never experienced the physical sensation of hunger they do their lobbying from comfortable office suites in washington or brussels if they lived just one month amid the misery of the developing world as i have for fifty years theyd be crying out for tractors and fertilizer and irrigation canals and be outraged that fashionable elitists back home were trying to deny them these things

2001027 as president hu walked into the stadium the restaurant outside the place shopping center cjw erupted in applause the place is the name of the shopping center
2001028 with 945 to go all of the stadium is covered with performers dressed in silver capes standing in front of what looks to be wicker trunks glazed bronze but thats not the real show a spontaneous wave cruises around the stadium as spectators eschew what seemed to be endless instructions on what to do when and start waving their flags as they stand
2001029 expressing the idea of environmental protection which is also the key concept of taiji unity of man and nature
2001030 see that chinese flag blowing stiffly as if it were in wrigley field it s a gimmick there no breeze inside this stadium
2001031 wearing a t shirt and shorts here in stadium and im drenched in sweat how must these athletes wearing suits and robes feel perhaps
2001032 i could have watched it at home but its more exciting to be out around other people as she grows up shell always remember this moment when i was growing up china wasnt a developed nation now for my daughter were a developed strong country
2001033 spanish athletes first to break rank to crowd in front of spanish tv and wave and cheer
2001034 here come dominica and their sole representative chris lloyd hes carrying the flag not surprisingly is he driving the bus
2001035 i think how i walk and smiling will be more important i will just show up and my height will help
2001036 wondering where the cauldron will appear so were we as of 10 mins ago it was nowhere to be seen but it has been unfurled or at least placed while we were watching the parade on the upper inside skin of the stadium now the question is how will it be lit
2001037 you have chosen as the theme of these games one world one dream that is what we are tonight
2001038 these games belong to you let them be the athletes games remember however they are about much more than performance alone they are about the peaceful gathering of 204 nations
2001039 the inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings the inherent vice of socialism is the equal sharing of miseries
2001040 some have and some have not and this is not fair
2001041 forcing big oil companies to take a reasonable share of their record breaking windfall profits and use it to help struggling families
2001042 a ffording same sex couples only a separate and differently named family relationship will as a realistic matter impose appreciable harm on same sex couples and their children because denying such couples access to the familiar and highly favored designation of marriage is likely to cast doubt on whether the official family relationship of same sex couples enjoys dignity equal to that of opposite sex couples
2001043 given the seriousness of the issues youd think we could have a serious debate
2001044 but so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton and britney spears
2001045 will definitely address all the environmental issues theodore oben unep chief of sports and the environment told ips in a telephone interview from beijing
2001046 i have been monitoring the press reports on chinese governments effort on making the beijing olympics games environmentally friendly
2001047 some efforts and investments are very positive but some other efforts are purely administrative and cosmetic measures such as closing many heavy polluters factories around beijing just for olympics
2001048 refugee youth have often suffered terribly and witnessed war first hand
2001049 some refugees are born in camps others grow up in camps which can mean a lifetime with little or no access to sport or recreation the gift of sportswear from olympic athletes around the globe inspires refugees and connects them to the world of sports beyond happiness it brings them hope
2001050 i am thrilled by this success and the strong support of the olympic family so far
2001051 of course we want to go much higher now the bigger impact we can make with this campaign the better i am convinced that with our common efforts we can collect many more items
2001052 i am confident that many of my colleagues will recognise the value of this project and be eager to contribute
2001053 it really is so easy to participate sport has given a lot to all of us and it is great to be able to give back a bit by bringing joy to refugees
2001054 instead of complaining about the state of the education system as we correct the same mistakes year after year ive got a better idea
2001055 university teachers should simply accept as variant spelling those words our students most commonly misspell
2001056 if people in the district dont like what happened that can still change at the primary voting booth
2001057 kuwait has expelled a thousand workers from bangladesh believed to be responsible for violent protest demonstrations but at the same time it has announced a law against
2001058 last week hundreds of employees of kuwaiti businesses unleashed a series of demonstrations to ask for better labor conditions and fair pay the motives of the protest include forms of sexual violence suffered by women who act as domestic workers this phenomenon together with that of forced labor was denounced in june in a report from the u s state department on the condition of workers in kuwait saudi arabia oman and qatar
2001059 the kuwait authorities have already directed the companies to pay the minimum wages and warned them of tough actions in case of any failure
2001060 but similar promises were made following protests in 2005 three years later nazrul and his fellow workers are still waiting for a change
2001061 kuwait has 39 300 per capita income poor workers there get 75 per month what type of culture is this

2001065 they dont run enough to use sufficient energy to prevent weight gain
2001066 what the act of running appears to do is allow the leptin to work again its a demonstration that this simple act can reverse leptin resistance
2001067 obese animals and humans dont respond to leptin at all
2001068 our lab is interested in elucidating why this is the case we know that often single entity treatments are not successful the concept was maybe a dual entity treatment would work
2001069 this is a startling finding leptin is expected to reduce body weight not promote weight and fat gain
2001070 thats the hope and the reason for doing this type of work
2001071 the study raises many questions if we can improve leptin sensitivity and enhance the ability of the signal to get through maybe it will lead to weight loss
2001072 leptin may be the cause of obesity rather than a cure
2001073 i cannot exclude electricity from my thinking when i think of making any plans i have to factor the lack of electricity
2001074 we cannot work without electricity because generators are not dependable
2001075 when i decided to purchase an updated model of my bakery i did not think of electricity
2001076 i could not operate it at all because of the inconsistency of electricity the bakery needs stable power it cost around 45 000 dollars now im ready to sell for 20 000 dollars
2001077 now the province gets power from iran under a contract signed about two years ago between the iraqi government and iran
2001078 it is supposed to build voltage regulators each 100 kilometres from the border to the province to avoid loss in the power
2001079 there is another line of power from iran which is being worked on and should be finished within a month
2001080 this will have a great effect on the improvement of the voltage and increasing the hours given
2001081 some houses burnt down because of the extremely high voltage from these
2001082 scientists will be shocked to see what iraqis are doing it shows how much people are suffering
2001083 the shortage of rain which last winter was 30 percent of what it was in previous years has led to an obvious impact on water levels in the tigris and euphrates and their tributaries

2001095 initially we launched with very simple profile pages and there virtual world since then we have added many compelling features such as our groovenet music amp lyrics player and a music widget to add to other social networking sites early this year we also converted our entire profile pages into adobe flex which is a better technology we hosted eyeball parties in metro manila so our members can meet in person and get to know one another
2001096 generally our members are filipinos interested in meeting other people and are interested in music nightlife and even travel
2001097 however we are able to combat this with localized content such as local music and lyrics and nightlife for example you will never see bamboo or cueshe on the front pages or music pages of friendster facebook or myspace nor will you see the latest parties happening in makati or the fort on those sites either however you will see filipino bands and parties all over the groovenet site our eyeball parties also keep our members loyal as they offer a medium for them to finally get to meet and partake in nightlife and other social activities together
2001098 i think we are just scratching the surface with virtual worlds not just in the philippines but around the globe they are becoming more and more popular as people go online and the internet infrastructure improves virtual worlds are a great way to market interact and even learn about your target market

2001128 in light of the apparent increase in ridership and the recent fatal accident i have been thinking more about safe bike riding the scariest things about the death of alice swanson are that she was on a street that is generally full of traffic that is a place with a predictable flow of slow moving cars and that the street has a marked bike lane r street is not what i would have thought of as a high risk area
2001129 so how does a biker navigate a busy multiple lane avenue like independence connecticut or wisconsin
2001130 bike shops offer classes about d c bike laws bikers are supposed to abide by the same traffic laws that apply to drivers safety wearing a helmet and rider to rider etiquette
2001131 i also admit to riding on the sidewalk which is illegal in some parts of the city but i do that out of necessity even on a street with a bike lane plenty of cars pull to the side of the road buses are especially hazardous though the bus drivers on 14th street nw seem to be aware of the cyclists in the bike lane my options when a car pulls into a bike lane are few drivers in the district are permitted in restricted lanes if they are loading or unloading people or turning right i can stop and risk getting run over by a biker coming up behind me i have done this and angered my fellow bikers i can swerve into traffic to go around the car or i can jump onto the sidewalk for a few seconds to avoid the street all together to me this last option is the best
2001132 i sometimes think that etiquette for urban bikers needs more emphasis
2001133 you have a style of writing i just cant do
2001134 we now better understand the process of planet formation and can explain the properties of the strange exoplanets weve observed we also know that the solar system is special and understand at some level what makes it special the solar system had to be born under just the right conditions to become this quiet place we see the vast majority of other planetary systems didnt have these special properties at birth and became something very different
2001135 gas disks to gas giants simulating the birth of planetary systems
2001136 my own take is a variation on rare earth which says that life is ubiquitous but intelligent life rare
2001137 a rare earth is of course another way to answer the fermi where are they question theyre not here because they dont exist or at least not in appreciable numbers and the reason for that is that planets capable of producing intelligent life hardly ever form

2001151 basically what obama is talking about is creating a committee for the defense of liberal ideology and political correctness funded by a half trillion taxpayer dollars national security for this crowd is not about stopping terrorists from killing our children national security means to teach our children to understand the terrorists and their motivations so that our children can learn how to live their lives submissively so as not to offend the sensitivities of the very sensitive america haters

2001223 so it is possible that in less than 5 years the industry will have a scalable model using the technology that already exists today
2001224 there have been other instances where people open the holding container to liberate the mosquitoes
2001225 its like the free willy movie you know liberate the mosquitoes
2001226 hevts solutions apply to not just smaller passenger cars and hybrids but almost any vehicle including larger gas guzzlers
2001227 our laboratory simulations show that the larger the vehicle the greater the benefits in gas costs particulate and greenhouse emissions and sound pollution for this reason we are currently focused on psvs and will later expand to school buses as well as transit buses
2001228 our first generation 14 7 percent efficiency day4 mc module which has been in commercial production since 2006 already places us among the industrys highest performing multi crystalline products
2001229 with the second generation of our proprietary solar cell designs we are taking a major step towards making solar energy cost competitive with conventional sources of electrical power generation
2001230 but thats two fold higher than the practical storage capacity of gasoline
2001231 the process could change ethanol production in dry grind plants so much that energy costs can be reduced by as much as one third
2001232 if for some reason theyre not coordinated enough well send them their money back and give it to the next person in the queue

2001236 the united states is the saudi arabia of wind power
2001237 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2001238 this isnt something customers should have to do not something they should have to lay awake worrying themselves to death about
2001239 the methods can be summed up under three headings a a triple front penetration in politics education and journalism b the recruitment of men of ability chiefly from certain universities and the linking of these men to the group by matrimonial alliances and by gratitude for titles and positions of power and c the influencing of public policy by placing members of the group in positions of power shielded as much as possible from public attention
2001240 the potential for mischief varies inversely with ones proximity to the authority figure
2001241 firstly its the product and the taste and secondly the place and the service
2001242 its much easier for the local store to differentiate itself as being local whereas starbucks had this slightly schizophrenic positioning where it wanted to be the global local store
2001243 the american seattle based coffee of starbucks was never going to resonate and penetrate australias very big coffee drinking community
2001244 the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in ones mind simultaneously and accepting both of them to tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them to forget any fact that has become inconvenient and then when it becomes necessary again to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies all this is indispensably necessary
2001245 100 percent certain that the fatwa council will not come out in favor of something which conflicts with european law
2001246 he explains that heroin is not highly addictive withdrawal from it does not require medical assistance addicts do not become criminals to feed their habits and heroin addiction is often a spiritual problem

2001249 it seems to me that the best way to punish oil companies is to increase supply
2001250 civilizations flourish the most where the masses are passionate about their liberties
2001251 drink a frapp composed of milk strawberries and my own testicles
2001252 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2001253 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2001254 no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the dnc and with the obama campaign
2001255 welcome to the first solar hydrogen residence in north america
2001256 they said we should go smoke some weed and were talking about being in a strip bar some really explicit things

2001267 it was the cause of great excitement in virology it crossed the imaginary boundary between viruses and cellular organisms
2001268 theres no doubt this is a living organism the fact that it can get sick makes it more alive
2001269 it infects this factory like a phage infects a bacterium its doing what every parasite can exploiting its host for its own replication
2001270 these viruses could be major players in global systems i think ultimately we will find a huge number of novel viruses in the ocean and other places it emphasizes how little is known about these organisms and i use that term deliberately
2001271 people have forgotten what an earthquake feels like we should look at this as an earthquake drill for the big one that will come one day

2001275 kaine also touched on offshore oil drilling wednesday saying that while hes
2001276 new assessment of the costs and benefits in order to do that you need to look at the consequences
2001277 like obama kaine believes that the government needs to first drill in the nearly 70 million acres of land that is already leased to oil companies for drilling
2001278 they have acreage leased already that could do significant good
2001279 oil geologists say the democratic legislation ignores the long term realities of oil leasing which takes years of studies to find and drill for reserves
2001280 a very general sense of the value of the land
2001281 a lease is a line on a map it has nothing to do with the geology of where oil is
2001282 virginia hasnt voted for a democrat since president lyndon b johnson in 1964

2001286 a quote from an academic that i thought might amuse you
2001287 amuse as in make me giggle or amuse as in
2001288 so theres a kerfluffle a brewin about the scuttling of a novel concerning mohammeds marriage to a 9 year old
2001289 right sorry continue ill confine my shuddering horror to the corner over here
2001290 anyway one of the main players in the entire mess is an academic who read the novel freaked the hell out and alerted islam at large to the fact that there was a book out there depicting mohammed consummating his marriage to a 9 year old
2001291 long story short when asked what exactly got her panties in a wad
2001292 is this the part where im supposed to go into a long rant pointing out what exactly the criticisms of that movie were and then wonder aloud if perhaps this spellberg woman might be slightly erm oblivious because of the glaring
2001293 sorry i still cant get past my shuddering ewwwww phase
2001294 i think this is the most extraordinary collection of talent and of human knowledge that has ever been gathered together at the white house with the possible exception of when thomas jefferson dined alone

2001296 i know i dont look like those dead whiteys behind me

2001300 why does john mccain think its ok for hundreds of tons of dangerous nuclear waste to go through wisconsin but yet too dangerous to go through his own state
2001301 john mccain simply cant have it both ways when it comes to the nuclear waste issue right now he supports running shipments of dangerous nuclear waste through wisconsin and sticking nevadans with 77 000 tons of it forever while at the same time saying hes uncomfortable with it going through his own backyard for even a day
2001302 the agency recognizes that a number of factors have contributed to high corn food and fuel prices as a nation
2001303 is strengthening our nations energy security and supporting americans farming communities
2001304 greatly disappointed with the epas inability to look past the good intentions of this policy to see the significant harm it is doing to farmers ranchers and american households for the epa to assert that this federal mandate is not affecting food prices not only goes against common sense but every americans grocery bill
2001305 america should be focusing on viable clean energy solutions like conservation solar and wind
2001306 instead the misguided corn ethanol mandate is forcing farmers to plow up marginal land and wildlife habitat while increasing global warming and dumping toxic fertilizers and pesticides into our precious water sources
2001307 so that is going to be a key element for the future
2001308 would have sabotaged the development and growth of new technologies and a cellulosic biofuels industry

2001313 last time the exclusive brethren became the centre of attention during the election campaign
2001314 john keys interview with mike hoskings last night on closeup was very revealing not for the quality of the interview mike was ranting like a hyperactive schoolgirl but for the cool and collected way john key was handling the pressure
2001315 pushmepullu 333 add karma subtract karma 1 says august 7th 2008 at 9 40 am somebody who reads this blog eh who is pro labour sonic tane philu perhaps it is time for you to fess up now in an attempt to retain some shred of credibility before you are exposed for the bottom feeding eels that you are

2001320 the people of new zealand want nz rail to be sold
2001321 one can only hope and pray that there is a secret agenda to
2001322 td also be nice if they would commit to an investigative tribunal to try members of the labour government for treason and corruption but i realise that doing so would warn them to flee the country before the election so these plans must be kept hush hush for now but if they were leaked they would cause a massive surge in the polls the people of new zealand are not fools they want justice and they know they will not get it until the dictator clark is hangign from a gallows outside parliament
2001323 and what i want to know is what sort of scumbag would do such a thing
2001324 i can advise that no security camera footage of the cocktail function exists
2001325 if your so fucken happy with the last nine years then why are you still

2001336 mukherjee beautifully weaves the ever morphing web of technology business and organizational learning together and explains why both top executives and middle managers must care about their impact
2001337 the business world is moving toward non hierarchical networks the answer to these changes is a combination of network management and collaborative leadership mukherjee goes beyond description of best practices the four design principles that he has developed to implement networks are conceptually well thought through and actionable this book deserves to be read by anybody who is interested in tomorrows organization
2001338 an adaptive organization must count as the response in the increasingly connected world in which business will operate in the decades ahead
2001339 beyond the obvious this is a great and pragmatic book demonstrating the incredible power of collaboration in action
2001340 though many have sought to unlock the secrets of creating learning organizations few have succeeded in the spiders strategy mukherjee provides the keys to the learning kingdom and he shows what it really takes to leverage the power of networks it is that rare business book that deserves to be read from cover to cover
2001341 mukherjee has written a very thoughtful and thought provoking book the adaptive network perspective with its four design principles and the accompanying five capabilities inspired by a chief network officer will be the organizations of the present and future the book presents good theory research grounded in facts and a clear picture of what is both necessary and possible going forward

2001350 there are arabs and jews working together and making money
2001351 from my vantage point it is working they are not employing tens of thousands of people but hundreds but they are making the effort tangible they are showing that the other side doesnt have to be an enemy they can be a business partner
2001352 we needed a platform for ordinary israelis and palestinians to seize back the agenda
2001353 even if politicians want to make peace they have to have the masses on board
2001354 in order to get them on board you have to have a grassroots movement and the movement has to convince both societies that peaceful coexistence is the only way forward i strongly believe that this initiative is a valuable way to bring two societies closer together
2001355 think back theres been no major water infrastructure built since pat brown was governor everythings drying up california sort of rests on its laurels youve got to move people youve got to move goods id love to be the governor who builds the high speed rail

2001432 this ad is a lie and its part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam even though a host of independent nonpartisan organizations have said this attack isnt true senator mccain continues to lie about senator obamas plan to give 95 of all families a tax cut of 1 000 and not raise taxes for those making under 250 000 a single dime the reason so many families are hurting today is because weve had eight years of failed bush policies that senator mccain wants to continue for another four and thats what barack obama will change as president

2001454 the liberal democrat ams site is fast achieving cult status as surfers check out the latest musings on his personal web log
2001455 highly readable and in part quite entertaining the website is certainly worth a visit

2001461 to sit back hoping that someday some way someone will make things right is to go on feeding the crocodile hoping he will eat you last but eat you he will
2001462 good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
2001463 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
2001464 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future
2001465 we thought lets try and start a movement where even while walking down the street people would hold up the o and you would know that they were for obama
2001466 you interlace your hands in a circle the interlacing being a symbol of different types of people coming together and the circle a symbol of unity
2001467 we want to see it everywhere but more importantly we want this sign to take the world by storm
2001468 inflate our way out of this crisis as obama suggests in this video what a foolish statement to make my dad always used to say that stupidity is what gets us in trouble pride is what keeps us there
2001469 civilizations flourish the most where the masses are passionate about their liberties
2001470 this is the most exciting day ever in my life
2001471 its a great honor for me that my teammates chose to vote for me im here as an ambassador of my country and i will do everything i can to represent my country well

2001474 unquestionably johnny griffin can play the tenor saxophone faster literally than anyone else alive at least he can claim this until its demonstrated otherwise and in the course of playing with this incredible speed he also manages to blow longer without refueling than you would ordinarily consider possible with this equipment he is able to play almost all there could possibly be played in any give chorus
2001475 both reactionary religion and militant secularism are on the rise with both displaying a rigid certainty and a desire for power that will do nothing to benefit society in this context it is vital that people with open minded faith speak up and demonstrate alternatives altmuslim com has set many good examples in this regard
2001476 you see more hostility towards muslims now than you did the year after 9 11
2001477 i want my children to grow up in a country where they as muslims feel valued
2001478 27 years of silence broken only by a few whispers
2001479 has not worked and has left us in the dangerous predicament in which we find ourselves today
2001480 we have just enough religion to make us hate but not enough to make us love one another
2001481 a powerful tool that will help us in the future protect our victims
2001482 there are a large number of left leaning religious and political organizations that are active these days offering an alternative to the religious right
2001483 a liberal theological perspective involves less traditional views of the divine spirituality and religious authority
2001484 the core of the religious left consists of people who are liberal in both their theology and their political outlook a pattern commonly associated with the term progressive
2001485 another important sub group consists of those who have a conservative theological perspective but liberal views on political issues
2001486 the annunciation of a religious left like the heralding of the religious rights demise has become a growth industry
2001487 it will not succeed for one simple reason the religious left is really a political agenda speaking to christians just as the religious right are religious people influencing politics
2001488 the religious left is nothing but repackaging of politics for non doctrinaire spiritualists it is not a genuine appeal to people of faith
2001489 that works to elect and promote candidates who share our values through grassroots mobilisation raising our voices in the media and paid advertising

2001493 a political consulting firm that worked on connecting elected officials candidates and state parties with americas diverse religious communities
2001494 you know its an election year when certain people start grabbing headlines by attacking the faith of presidential candidates with all these stones being cast at barack obama it can be hard to know what to believe
2001495 i think we make a mistake when we fail to acknowledge the role of faith in peoples lives
2001496 spent several minutes discussing the ad and hurling accusations of dishonesty at obama
2001497 false and misleading information about senator obamas record on a number of vital issues
2001498 functioning on behalf of centrist elements in the democratic party and the partys candidate for president
2001499 it is part of a broader effort by these same elements to control the narrative of the role of religion in public life

2001503 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
2001504 suppose someone were to claim that there is a form of prejudice called anti kiwism an irrational hatred of new zealanders
2001505 what might convince us he was right criticism of the new zealand government no a denial of new zealands right to exist maybe seven thousand terrorist attacks on new zealands citizens in the past year possibly a series of claims at the un conference against racism in durban that new zealand because of its treatment of the maori is uniquely guilty of apartheid ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity accompanied by grotesque nazi style posters perhaps a call to murder all those with new zealand loyalties although they were born and live elsewhere a suggestion that new zealanders control the worlds economy that they are responsible for aids and poisoning water supplies that they arranged the september 11 attack on the world trade center that they are a satanic force of evil against whom a holy war must be fought
2001506 delete new zealand and insert israel and jews and all these things have happened in the past year
2001507 what more has to happen before an impartial observer concludes that anti semitism is alive and well and dangerous
2001508 the greater the obstacle the more glory in overcoming it

2001517 the second law of thermodynamics trumps the laws of economics
2001518 if the world was made of oil there would still be a finite supply of it
2001519 if kindness and comfort are as i suspect the results of an energy surplus then as the supply contracts we could be expected to start fighting once again like cats in a sack
2001520 one of our central tasks is the creation of the post oil megacity

2001530 say no to every candidate of every political party who supports abortion
2001531 legal and constitutional protection for the definition of marriage as the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others
2001532 marriage is a natural institution based on ancient human values that have evolved over time into a unique and deeply rooted social legal and religious institution
2001533 reflects the natural biological complementarity between man and woman which predates the state and which is woven into the social and religious fabric of every major culture and society
2001534 provides the most favorable environment in which to protect the rights and the best interests of children
2001535 give me the grace good lord to set the world at naught to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of mens mouths to be content to be solitary not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof
2001536 the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest
2001537 what does it avail to know that there is a god which you not only believe by faith but also know by reason what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him
2001538 a man who police said was storing a stockpile of weapons and ammunition in his miami hotel room is being investigated for allegedly making threats against barack obama and president bush fox news confirms

2001556 we have been deeply affected by what we have seen and intend to engage in this regard in our personal capacities with all our communities and constituencies we intend to be sensitive to the anxieties and perspectives that exist and to use our visit to promote thoughtful discussion within and between our communities

2001592 experimented regularly with drugs and we were both spiritually lost
2001593 the sacrifices and achievements of our service men and women in the first world war helped to define canada as a nation and shape the country in which we live today
2001594 we will never forget the great debt we owe them
2001595 as we mark the 90th anniversary of the end of the first world war it is also a fitting time to reflect on the men and women who continue the proud tradition of serving canada as our nations truest heroes
2001596 they are defending the same values of freedom democracy human rights and the rule of law that canadians stood up for 90 years ago and today canada is re emerging on the world stage as a strong and powerful voice for freedom we are once again investing in the equipment and resources our men and women in uniform need to do their jobs canadians expect this of us because the world needs a strong and sovereign canada

2001611 iraqs electoral commission had said the measure needed to be passed before lawmakers adjourned for the month in order to hold elections by the end of december
2001612 pedro has given up two solo shots already in the first inning
2001613 ill just throw out the warning that his 265 average since may 1 might be what we get for an entire year next year
2001614 i just think that the support for the conservatives is huge and is being down played by the msm
2001615 founding farmers is an exciting concept that is honestly derived from a great history of american farm culture and what it means to serve true food
2001616 im thrilled by the zagat survey news on eating green which only affirms what we have been working on for years its not about being trendy were serving foods that help support the environment and we are bringing the green movement right to the table
2001617 at founding farmers we are offering fabulous great tasting products and great service and are doing all we can to protect the environment we truly believe that we have created a new model to demonstrate that some profit should not be taken when the environmental impact is too great
2001618 vista parents of latino students at vistas most ethnically diverse school are incensed over a campaign by other parents to preserve an honors program there
2001619 the policy debate is taking place at lincoln middle school where the principal is proposing mixing some of the schools most gifted students with others of mixed academic abilities in an effort to pump up test scores
2001620 the proposal to dismantle the gifted and talented education or gate program at the school is supported by the latino parents opposed by parents of the gate students
2001621 we believe that the school should not create differences between students who know more and students who know less
2001622 if i had learnt it in a school i would not have learnt so much or been moulded so much
2001623 and these are the only blogs i can stomach or that can hold my attention

2001626 russias retreat from openness and democracy could have significant security implications for the united states our european allies and our partners in other regions furthermore moscow has signaled an increasing reliance on nuclear weapons as a foundation of its security all of these actions suggest a russia exploring renewed influence and seeking a greater international role
2001627 young single and on a budget going out without going broke
2001628 since it was first identified in new york city almost a decade ago
2001629 theres been a steady westward migration of this west nile virus
2001630 apparently this is may be a sign of the times there has been as more and more homes are passing into foreclosure and many of those homes have backyard pools these are being neglected theyre not being maintained this can become a ripe feeding ground and breeding ground for these mosquito populations
2001631 viruses are infinitely adaptable and they the tougher types may be pushing out the weaker strains but whats of great concern to the california officials specifically is that historically the more virulent strains have been causing a very small percentage of the cases but more recently in this year of the cases that have been identified 70 percent are caused by this more virulent more aggressive strain and this is the one that actually invades the brain and spinal cord the central nervous system
2001632 clearly if you just have the viral symptoms as many of us have the symptoms of the west nile virus in approximately 20 percent of cases are just like any other viral illness
2001633 weve been trying for the last one and a half years to develop wind energy projects here in israel but there is a lot of regulation and bureaucracy with regards to the use of the land
2001634 its also a challenge finding the right places in israel where the wind is strong enough to make it profitable the golan heights in the galilee and a number of places in the arava are suitable
2001635 israels useable wind energy potential is estimated at 600 mw it is a limited resource but nonetheless attractive because it is available in phase with the electricity demand and of course because it is indigenous and clean some very good sites exist especially in the north of the country
2001636 a number of actions was taken by the ministry of energy and infrastructure presently the ministry of national infrastructures during the last eighteen years in order to encourage exploitation of this resource
2001637 five demonstration turbines were erected in various areas with government support the emphasis has been on application using imported hardware a privately owned 6 mw windfarm also supported by the government has been operating successfully in the golan heights for the last seven years the israel electric corporation is planning a number of windfarms in the galilee in the negev desert and in the arava valley the last one in cooperation with jordan

2001640 all the doggie pictures make me want to get out my blender
2001641 you have a style of writing i just cant do
2001642 let me be absolutely clear that the picture painted by the review team report is appalling and completely unacceptable the absence of clear lines of professional responsibility has fostered an environment where there was an inadequate management of a cluster of cases at ward level or awareness at higher levels there were also inadequacies and inconsistencies in advice to relatives and in management of patients
2001643 a direct and unconditional apology for the serious failings on its part
2001644 i recognise the concerns of relatives of patients that they were not properly informed every step of the way of the infection and how to help protect themselves and others from the risk of infection
2001645 as a result of todays recommendations we will take forward further actions to reinforce leadership accountability and empowerment both at the ward and hospital level and ensure clear lines of communication and responsibility to the boards medical and nurse directors
2001646 the uncertainty over the future of this local hospital has undoubtedly been a factor in the lack of major modernisation investments i can give a commitment that this board will bring forward proposals in august and september that will set out a clear vision for the future of the site
2001647 the vale of leven certainly had more cases of c difficile than one would expect during the first six months of 2008 sadly c difficile is a germ that is in the community and there will always be sick and vulnerable patients especially among the elderly who will develop c difficile associated diseases

2001654 were encouraging parents to visit rescueyourchild org to learn how to save their children while they still can with public schools becoming sexual indoctrination centers homeschooling and church schools are no longer parental options theyre parental imperatives
2001655 this bill requires the governor to proclaim may 22 as harvey milk day the designation of a day of significance triggers statutory encouragement for public schools to observe and conduct commemorative exercises suitable to the day
2001656 on harvey milk day exercises remembering the life of harvey milk and recognizing his accomplishments as well as the contributions he made to this state
2001657 all public schools and educational institutions are encouraged to observe and conduct suitable commemorative exercises
2001658 this bad bill will teach impressionable schoolchildren the anti religious homosexual bisexual transsexual agenda of harvey milk
2001659 the democrats are so cocky they have no qualms about pushing sexual indoctrination upon children in an election year for the love of god parents and their children we implore governor schwarzenegger to veto ab 2567

2001670 this suggests that the iphone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off at the moment no apps have been blacklisted but by all appearances this has been added to disable applications that the user has already downloaded and paid for if apple so chooses to shut them down i discovered this doing a forensic examination of an iphone 3g it appears to be tucked away in a configuration file deep inside corelocation

2001691 give me the grace good lord to set the world at naught to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of mens mouths to be content to be solitary not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof
2001692 the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest
2001693 what does it avail to know that there is a god which you not only believe by faith but also know by reason what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him
2001694 minnesota welfare benefits should be provided to minnesota families in need when the state of minnesota is facing a major budget crisis we cannot turn a blind eye to the potential misuse of taxpayer dollars
2001695 the average minnesotans deserves to know why 1 3 million is being spent in illinois and 126 transactions are taking place in hawaii hundreds of thousands of transactions are taking place in the other 49 states and thats a huge concern
2001696 there is a financial responsibility on behalf of the state of minnesota to ensure that taxpayer dollars are not being abused
2001697 the welfare system is growing exponentially and receiving a greater share of the states budget we want to take care of families in need but also ensure that no one is abusing the system for their own financial gain at the expense of minnesota families struggling to pay their own bills
2001698 government must be held accountable for fiscal responsibility particularly in cases of fraud or misuse of taxpayer dollars

2001708 when fans attended a phillies game at the vet in the late 90s and early 2000s its understandable if they got the impression that the only reason anyone was there was to boo the team if and when they messed up indeed even when you adjust for their beautiful new stadium phillies fans are happy to come to a game if the team is winning as it did in 1993 or 2007 but except for the hardcore most fans are content to wait for eagles season fans fall off of the team when its losing at the second fastest rate in the league

2001714 the issues that will appeal to latino voters are the same issues that will appeal to all voters and those are pocketbook issues
2001715 john mccain doesnt need an introduction to the hispanic community as barack obama needs
2001716 john mccain has been working for more than two decades for the values positions and issues the latino community cares about
2001717 for the latino community well i think for everyone in general the main concern is the economy which affects everything
2001718 plus the price of gas the war in iraq but mostly the economy
2001719 now mccain supports enforcement first and then hell get to legalization of undocu mented workers
2001720 obama recog nizes that we need a comprehensive approach and that we should create legal avenues for students and families of workers
2001721 the human nature of gods son not by itself but by its union with the word knew and showed forth in itself everything that pertains to god

2001734 protecting the consumer against counterfeit products through interagency and sub regional collaboration
2001735 aside from being a threat to human life counterfeit goods deny genuine products of their rightful market share cost government significant amounts in lost tax revenue threaten jobs and create lack of consumer confidence in products
2001736 one which is deliberately and fraudulently labelled with respect to identity and or source counterfeiting can apply to both branded and generic products and counterfeit products may include products with correct ingredients wrong ingredients without active ingredients with incorrect quantity of active ingredients or with fake packaging
2001737 the main reasons for increasing fake drug trade in developing countries are the high cost and short supply of important medicines
2001738 if the problem is to be tackled at its source controversies surrounding the wto world trade organization trade related aspects of intellectual property rights trips agreement and the debate over access to medicines for developing countries should end in favour of finding a way for providing developing countries with the required supply of needed drugs at affordable price
2001739 i believe that the problems of pharmaceutical counterfeiting are best addressed by securing the pharmaceutical supply chain a process that is seemingly independent of the wtos trips agreement
2001740 it is unfair to provide legal protection in africa for pharmaceutical products produced by the international drug and cosmetic industry and at same time some of these products have been produced from medicinal plant genetic materials that have been taken illegally from africa and commercialised without any benefit sharing
2001741 the fund generated from benefit sharing schemes and intellectual property rights originating from the use of african medical plants should be used for investment in healthcare infrastructure which will help africa to produce some of its needed drugs

2001807 the attitude of buyers towards foreign equipment has also been changing
2001808 just two or three years ago when faced with a choice between imported and domestic machinery companies tended to opt for much cheaper russian equipment
2001809 now more russians are choosing imported machinery ensuring higher productivity and greater reliability even at a higher initial purchase price
2001810 because of the growing popularity of new and used foreign equipment the proportionate share of russian manufacturers in the market has been declining steadily in recent times
2001811 the energy of cities goes through cycles this is moscows time

2001813 based on the economic turnarounds experienced by other countries joining the eu expected infrastructure and economic improvements will certainly help to strongly increase construction equipment demand going forward

2001864 of course were incredibly pleased delighted would probably be a better adjective that nintendo approached us but its not an exclusive relationship
2001865 i cant get into details about other folks that are interested in this technology but as you might imagine of course there is more interest out there
2001866 with six degrees of freedom you can basically make any movement at all and be able to track that in combination with the sensor bar and other sensors included in the wii remote add the gyroscope capability and you have the ability to work in all three dimensions of space
2001867 we have to think to ourselves when are the midges going to be active and what can we do to put a barrier between our livestock and these midges
2001868 we will use our models to advise on best practice for measures such as stabling insecticide use and vaccination to control the spread of the bluetongue virus
2001869 the benefit of these techniques is that until very recently midge surveillance relied upon the use of light traps that sometimes did not represent what was happening on the animals very well
2001870 using these two techniques we can more easily understand the relationship between weather conditions and both background midge activity and biting attacks

2001877 when some interior movement in the soul is caused through which the soul comes to be inflamed with love of its creator and lord
2001878 why do we have to go through things like this living without feeling your presence in our lives at all
2001879 at the moment david elsworth thinks he is going to be more of an autumn horse and he has an entry in the topkapi trophy in turkey in september
2001880 that is only an option at this stage and david thinks the champion stakes at newmarket will be his main target
2001881 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
2001882 and we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs
2001883 the leadership in beijing will almost certainly find his comments irritating or objectionable
2001884 but they will clearly understand that the united states will not impose any real consequences if they do not make progress on human rights
2001885 we were disturbed to learn that the chinese had refused his visa

2001942 trafficking into belgium forms a very strong part of their investigation as does trafficking into north africa
2001943 the portuguese authorities requested and obtained the collaboration of the dutch police via interpol and the conclusions of the investigation carried out in the netherlands were sent to both portugal and the united kingdom
2001944 if there is a single country in europe which has made an effort to prevent another case like the dutroux one it is indeed belgium and it has now become common practice for the countrys authorities to offer support and collaboration to its european partners as was the case with the trial of michel fourniret and his wife monique olivier

2001949 as requested by the prime ministers office the organizers sent a draft of a gracious thank you speech that they intended to deliver after mr harper made his remarks the prime ministers office did content and grammatical edits of the speech and approved it for delivery
2001950 we felt it would be most appropriate for this expression to be made in a venue where the broader community could participate which is what the prime minster did

2001955 green shift has launched an 8 75 million suit against the liberal party of canada for infringement of trademark because of the partys unauthorized use of the green shift name for their proposed carbon tax program
2001956 im quite curious could you clear something up for me was it the mercury that sought out jennifer wright for an interview or did she want to talk with your paper if its the former then one has to wonder why the merc finds it necessary to interject this issue into the campaign if its the latter then it would appear jennifer wright actually is political despite you assertions to the contrary attempting to influence a by election with her lawsuit which is it neither seems particularly relevant to the people of guelph in the grand scheme im sure conservatives and ndp supporters will disagree which sort of says it all doesnt it
2001957 so isnt it a bit strange that she will be visiting guelph today yes thats right smack dab in the middle of a federal by election ms wright thought it would be a good time to speak to a newspaper about her non political stance and her fight with a political party unbelievable anyone care to tell how shes not gaining publicity for her company
2001958 what i dont understand here why jr finds it necessary to interject herself into a by election which makes her political which implies that she is trying to hurt the liberals in this riding
2001959 id be interested to hear who exactly it was that invited ms wright down today to the guelph riding was it the cpc the ndp the guelph mercury ill also be very interested to see in her talk to the mercury how much she injects herself into the political campaign in guelph
2001960 look the u s is committing to long term dependence and therefore demand will stay high
2001961 the next section argues that were one forced to specify a best guess estimate of the extreme bad tail of the relevant probability density function pdf of what might eventually happen if only gradually ramped up remedies are applied then mean global surface temperature change relative to pre industrial revolution levels will in two centuries or so be greater than 10c with a ballpark probability estimate somewhere around 05 and will be greater than 20c with a ballpark probability estimate somewhere around 01 societies and ecosystems in a world whose average temperature has changed in the geologically instantaneous time of two centuries or so by 10c 20c for u s readers 10c 18f and 20c 36f are located in terra incognita since such high temperatures have not existed for hundreds of millions of years and such a rate of global temperature change might be unprecedented even on a time scale of billions of years however measured the planetary welfare effect of climate changes that might accompany mean temperature increases from 10c up to 20c with probabilities anything remotely resembling 5 down to 1 implies a non negligible probability of worldwide catastrophe

2001978 any team can beat any team on any day in the nfl
2001979 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
2001980 if you say that because you are born with a certain inclination then it is god given and you should be free to follow that through in your life it doesnt make any logical sense whatever
2001981 you would then have to say that there are many different inclinations with which people are born even if it is true that this is an inherent thing and which people spend their lifetime trying to subdue
2001982 the fact that you are born with it doesnt make any moral judgement on the inclination people fight to subdue inherently bad tempers depressive streaks or lots of sexual inclinations some inclinations are good some are not good and some are mixed
2001983 i stood at the front gate of a cathedral in america last month and read a notice saying anybody going on the lgbt parade come to the cathedral first and have your relationship blessed by the bishop
2001984 theres no doubt about it its lesbian gay bisexual and transgendered for a start so the thing has widened already and you have to ask what does it mean for someone whos born bisexual to follow their inclination or inclinations
2001985 it has not yet been conclusively shown that for some males and some females homosexuality and homosexual acts are natural rather than unnatural
2001986 if such comes to be shown it will be necessary to acknowledge the full implications of that new aspect of the truth and that insight applied to establish and acknowledge what may be a new status for homosexual relationships within the church
2001987 if it is proven that homosexuality is natural it makes no difference at all
2001988 the archbishop was doing a very thoughtful piece and quite rightly pointing out that some parts of the word of god are considered as law that affects our lives and that some of the ritual laws of the old testament are not laws which affect our lives now
2001989 but he then did an exposition of romans chapter 1 if you are to say i am naturally homosexual that would make no difference to pauls argument
2001990 i would say that if that is the meaning that the church may have to reconsider its position on homosexuality then i do not agree with that
2001991 we live in a wonderful communion where you can disagree with each other
2001992 i dont think any of us knows at this point whether the anglican communion will ever be the same again
2001993 its worth holding together but its not worth holding together at all costs truth is more important than unity
2001994 i want to say this as strongly as i can as far as any church of ireland bishop is concerned and certainly speaking for myself the fact that somebody was by their inclination gay would not in any way be a bar to anything in the church
2001995 inclination is neither here nor there the issue is whether they are practising and that would be a bar
2001996 i dont think that there are any members of the church of ireland are going out on some anti gay drive or to harm gay people
2001997 i think that they are more than happy to welcome them into their churches but i think that what they find difficult is an affirmation as many people would see it that what is being said is that what is wrong is right
2001998 i went to lambeth with a lot of qualms and i have returned with a lot of qualms but there are one or two things that are very good about it
2001999 if you belong to a worldwide communion broken though it may be the opportunity to meet with fellow bishops and christian leaders from all over the world is invaluable
2002000 its undoubtedly true that anglicans and most protestants value very much indeed individual conscience and being able to think through issues in a way that doesnt muzzle people so they can raise issues and talk out about issues even if they are uncomfortable issues
2002001 there is no doubt that the church of ireland is the kind of church where people would want the freedom to raise issues
2002002 everyone agrees that there are much more important issues than this there is poverty and there is war and we are being deflected from those issues because of this issue
2002003 on the other hand one of the orthodox representatives at the lambeth conference said your questions are our questions
2002004 i think that the anglican communion is probably working through this issue on behalf of the whole church and there are other churches that know perfectly well that this is an issue but they have never been in a position to either admit it or mention it but are looking on to see how the anglican communion is going to resolve this
2002005 it got better as it went on and where we ended up on the last day was maybe as good a point as we could have arrived at
2002006 promote close cooperation in the fields of civil space exploration
2002007 presenters did identify some precedents for greater pluralism and burgeoning civil society in russia
2002008 even without political allies among the other parties the bolsheviks never seriously contemplated giving up power
2002009 in the eyes of many politically active workers in the largest cities the bolsheviks stood mostly firm for the workers government but others followed the call of the mensheviks to participate in an assembly of representatives in petrograd in may and early june 1918
2002010 the moderate socialist the mensheviks and srs who hoped for constitutional order with the gradual transition to some kind of democratic socialism were caught in between the reds and the whites
2002011 once the area was secured the new governor issued a decree reinstating all the laws of russia before 1917 this white counterrevolution shared few values with anti bolsheviks on the volga and in siberia who were promoting the constitutional assembly
2002012 in samara government called komuch committee for the constituent assemble was established with the purpose of restoring russias elected parliament
2002013 peasants in the volga region resisted the efforts of soviet authorities to establish themselves in the villages and longed for the return of the village democracy that they had enjoyed in 1917 1918
2002014 peasants purged the soviets of communist and reelected the more democratically
2002015 though they were never strong enough to destroy the soviet regime and create an unchallenged anti bolshevik authority their aid was enough to prop up the srs and the whites for a time and establish several independent power centers throughout the former russian empire
2002016 the civil war was not only a war of armies but of ordinary people who had to chose in whose ranks to serve and whether to hold their positions under fire or desert
2002017 the white forces were unable to find a social base for their movement
2002018 most importantly and with little real ability to effect its will in the peripheries the soviet government responded to the centrifugal movement of non russian away from the russian center and accepted by january 1918 the principle of federalism
2002019 by the end of the month the third congress of soviets resolved
2002020 the six republics received a formal right to secession from the union but that right was considered a fiction for the next sixty five years
2002021 despite the 1921 ban on factions the communist party remained through the decade deeply factionalized and in many ways was several parties within one
2002022 denouncing these activities as factional stalin offered the opposition a compromise if they agreed to renounce factional activities and unconditionally accept decisions of the party they would be free to express their views within the limits of the party line
2002023 the opposition made a last attempt to unseat the stalin bukharin majority
2002024 the new economic policy ended the militarization and forced mobilization of labor of the civil war years allowed a free market in labor and introduced wage differentials
2002025 the village commune remained largely autonomous of the official state and party authorities and was much more independent than it had been before the revolution
2002026 a growing consensus among scholars held that stalinism destroyed the budding civil society of the nep and suppressed the mark at a time when the state could not provide the material goods that the people required
2002027 the soviet union was long shielded from markets and liability
2002028 perestroika is the all round intensification of the soviet economy the revival and development of the principles of democratic centralism in running the national economy the universal introduction of economic methods the renunciation of management by injunction and by administrative methods and the overall encouragement of innovation and socialist enterprise
2002029 i stress once again perestroika is not some kind of illumination or revelation to restructure our life means to understand the objective necessity for renovation and acceleration and that necessity emerged in the heart of our society the essence of perestroika lies in the fact that it
2002030 to breathe new life into the state and make it a counterweight to the conservative party apparatus gorbachev took the radical step of activating what he called the human factor
2002031 we need wholesome full blooded functioning by all public organizations all production teams and creative unions new forms of activity by citizens and the revival of those which have been forgotten in short

2002037 although va has made progress on its 11 billion healthevet initiative it has also experienced significant delays and none of the associated development projects have been completed moreover va is proceeding with this complex initiative without a project management plan and validated cost estimates to coordinate and guide the effort at the same time a governance structure for healthevet has not yet been established and key leadership positions that are responsible for providing day to day oversight have not been permanently staffed further several it governance boards with oversight responsibility for healthevet have not yet performed essential reviews of healthevet projects to gauge progress and funding requirements and the department lacks a time frame for doing so until the department takes the necessary actions to fully address these matters it will face the risk that healthevet may experience cost overruns and continued schedule slippages and may not achieve the outcome it intends to achieve

2002138 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters know is who uses that language for what purpose

2002148 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public

2002153 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
2002154 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity

2002156 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
2002157 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
2002158 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
2002159 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
2002160 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
2002161 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
2002162 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
2002163 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
2002164 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
2002165 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
2002166 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
2002167 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar

2002227 the rudd government has identified homelessness as a key priority to address
2002228 each year 40 000 18 to 35 year olds become homeless and unemployed most are early school leavers who without help will struggle to hold down permanent housing
2002229 we also know that many people living on the streets are often dealing with physical and mental health issues that require a high level of personal support
2002230 linking homeless australians with education training or work opportunities is a major factor in overcoming the cycle of disadvantage experienced on a daily basis by people who face life on the streets or moving from one temporary accommodation to another
2002231 to reduce homelessness we need to increase the economic opportunities for homeless people or those at risk of becoming homeless to gain financial independence as well as participate in their community
2002232 getting a job is a significant step towards securing permanent housing

2002235 tougher enforcement and tighter economic conditions are having a combined effect but it doesnt take a migration expert or economist to know that as soon as the u s economy rebounds so will illegal immigration thats why congress cannot continue pushing this problem down the road tougher enforcement and border security are partial steps but america also needs a way for businesses legally to import cheap labor for jobs that its own citizens wont take
2002236 cordero said boyfriend henry lopez hadnt wanted her to work at the plant but when she became pregnant he agreed that she could work there after the baby was born cordero began in february working in the plants quality control department a typical work week was six days with long hours sometimes more than 12 a day with only intermittent overtime pay
2002237 a proposed federal law called the dream act would enable undocumented students who have attended u s schools and met other conditions to gain legal status and qualify for some student aid but so far the meas ure has failed to win enough support in congress leaving states to cobble together their own policies for handling these students in higher ed
2002238 heightened concern about the slowing economy and illegal immigration already has led some states to close the doors of higher education on undocumented students this summer south carolina became the first state to ban such students from all of its public colleges and universities arizona colorado georgia and oklahoma have also drawn a line in the sand and now deny illegal immigrants in state tuition benefits
2002239 the ice deportation program and the cis report are symptomatic of an immigration debate gone awry indeed no amount of enforcement at the border or the workplace can counter the draw of available jobs with better earning potential

2002251 the break in play will make for a different dynamic at the final table build more excitement for the sport and allow the public to better understand the personalities of the players

2002330 because its set in the near future code 9 allows us to sort of suspend your disbelief slightly more than a normal spooks episode
2002331 they wanted to explore the seriess wide appeal with a younger audience on bbc3
2002332 usually comes from people wanting to see their favourite characters in another way
2002333 i dont expect anyone to approach a spin off series and say really positive things about it
2002334 there is understandably negativity around it setting it in the future makes this feel vastly different but it is a difficult balance
2002335 how we could convincingly bring the agents ages right down

2002368 milk may be best known for its calcium content in supporting bone health but our research and that of others continually supports milks ability to aid in muscle growth and also promote body fat loss to my mind with milk being a source of nine essential nutrients its a no brainer milk is the ideal post workout drink for recreational exercisers and athletes alike

2002382 the idea that an average family has more money with a dual income then a single income is a myth of course there are always exceptions but if you run the numbers with all the expenses a single income families actually has the edge

2002451 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

2002490 one reason for the lack of extended argument in the god delusion is clear dawkins doesnt seem very good at it indeed he suffers from several problems when attempting to reason philosophically the most obvious is that he has a preordained set of conclusions at which hes determined to arrive consequently dawkins uses any argument however feeble that seems to get him there and the merit of various arguments appears judged largely by where they lead
2002491 science can be a hostage to the unreliabilities of observation as can any other view and may be more vulnerable than less materialistic perspectives secondarily their shared blind spot may be a matter of the expectation that evidence be communal as opposed to individual they think the best human thinking is not unique genius but groupthink consensus science think and they think we should all think like them worse they think if we are really thinking we will think like them they are persuaded that any reliable experience must be repeatable that is to say their experiment their reiteration of the experience must produce for them the same results it produced for you or your experience is illegitimate

2002549 unfortunately this sort of behavior by mexican military personnel has been going on for years
2002550 they are never held accountable and the united states government will undoubtedly brush this off as another case of
2002551 it is not an incident that we are aware of
2002552 an all out struggle to deter criminal organizations from operating on both sides of our common border
2002553 law enforcement operations have led from time to time to innocent incursions by both u s and mexican law enforcement personnel and military units into the territory of both nations and in particular along non demarcated areas of our border
2002554 withhold further comment on this incident until we see how our leaders handle it
2002555 down to a t and it matched exactly what they mexican soldiers wear
2002556 nobody was ever held accountable particularly galling is the fact that the mexican military often pulls these stunts in humvees donated to them by the american taxpayers we note that border patrol agents have historically driven worn out junk vehicles

2002567 we draw no comfort in the fact that the repudiated doctrine of separate but equal as manifest in the promise of more resources for inner city schools has become a central plank in the gallows that is now being masqueraded as the latest and greatest solution to the abysmal performance of too many of our students
2002568 were going to exercise every option we have were not going away
2002569 were hoping for some form of reconciliation so that we can feel happy and not disenfranchised
2002570 separate but equal didnt work out that well in the past this rezoning plan is a total contradiction of what the naacp stands for
2002571 the white liberals in this city are taking a pass
2002572 theyre making different excuses but the white liberal community in town seems to not care these are the people who ought to be out there leading the charge i would think its an outrage it really is this is 50 years of progress weve made on desegregating schools thats getting ready to be totally flushed down the drain
2002573 i find the notion of segregation morally repugnant id never advocate it in a zillion years on the other hand whatevers going on with the school board is rearranging deck chairs on the titanic the state is in control and the state control will continue to expand and well see where we end up but i think a lot of those debates are moot

2002584 to expand on what blackhaw said a liberal might counter that military bases and police stations contain officers who are highly trained disciplined and scrutinized with regard to adequate firearms behavior
2002585 how would that affect the rate of gun related violent wouldnt it just mean that if a soldier uses a gun to commit a crime he will use it more efficiently than someone without expert training in firearms
2002586 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

2002596 there is he who made me a child of god and opened heaven to me by holy baptism he who purified me after i had sinned who gives nourishment to my soul
2002597 at the sight of a church tower you may say
2002598 because a priest has been there and has said holy mass
2002599 the priest has the key to of the heavenly treasures it is he who opens the door he is the steward of the good god the distributor of his wealth the priest is not a priest for himself he does not give himself absolution he does not administer the sacraments to himself he is for you after god the priest is everything leave a parish 20 years without priests they will worship beasts when people wish to destroy religion they begin by attacking the priest because when there is no longer any priest there is no sacrifice and where there is no longer any sacrifice there is no religion
2002600 we must never lose sight of the fact that we are either saints or outcasts that we must live for heaven or for hell there is no middle path in this you either belong wholly to the world or wholly to god if people would do for god what they do for the world what a great number of christians would go to heaven
2002601 come now my little one he said with fatherly kindliness to the woman who confided to him her anxiety because of her large family

2002613 we are interested in holding cc salons with two notable music venues in the near future there are also a lot of filipinos who have been providing cc licensed content through their individual blogs or submission to public repositories such as flickr we still have to look into those who would pursue legal sharing of audio visual works
2002614 one can be a creator an end user or both
2002615 do you develop open source software do you use open source software do you create content whether text stills audio or video which are made available for legal reuse by others do you contribute in open content repositories or projects if yes you are already contributing to the commons more so if you do so for philippine bred projects in a way you are already contributing to the philippine commons these are the usual modes where internet users support the commons whether they intended to do so or not
2002616 if you have projects and organizations that are relevant to the commons why not connect with the movement so as to generate a concerted front not a software developer nor a content developer sponsoring a commons event perhaps or just spreading the word
2002617 medium term success is about philippine projects being similarly competitive to projects being pursued by other jurisdictions to the point that we are not merely catching up or replicating what the other jurisdictions have done before we hope that the philippines become a primary participant in the global commons in the future
2002618 real success however can be reached if the ideals of the cause and the projects are tuned to such ideals are actually translated into positive and lasting changes for the philippine society if people are more empowered to implement solutions enhanced their creativity and broaden their knowledge in light of broader options i think we will be in the right direction
2002619 t he philippines is not exactly known for respecting intellectual property

2002626 it was not a first amendment decision so much as it was a political decision that you hold the promise of statehood over the state of utah and other places he said goldberg said he believes the current supreme court might reach a different conclusion when examining the case strictly from the perspective of the constitutional right of individuals of free exercise of their religion
2002627 the court also concluded that the u s supreme courts 1878 decision in reynolds v united states upholding a ban on polygamy remains good law
2002628 suppose one believed that human sacrifices were a necessary part of religious worship would it be seriously contended that the civil government under which he lived could not interfere to prevent a sacrifice
2002629 you should consider what are to be the consequences to the innocent victims of this delusion as this contest goes on they multiply and there are pure minded women and there are innocent children innocent in a sense even beyond the degree of the innocence of childhood itself

2002632 i think well see a miserable job market and consequently an eroded standard of living for the vast majority of americans for several years
2002633 this is indistinguishable from a recession for a working family

2002635 you read the headlines and you look around and you think the world is coming to an end
2002636 but i dont think so if youre going to tell a worst case scenario story at this point its only going to be because the fed loses control
2002637 the fed isnt the whole story but its a big part of it
2002638 it allowed these absolutely insane bubbles to happen the lesson is you cant let these bubbles continue unabated with no policy making
2002639 they thought it was just a great thing that the stock market kept going higher and higher

2002644 this economy will get back on its feet no thanks to washington
2002645 theres not much that politics can do at this point for the markets
2002646 we do need some regulation smarter regulation to prevent the abuse of the safety net but first we need to fix our broken regulations
2002647 the fed deliberately and consciously refused to regulate the mortgage industry like it was supposed to have done im not a big fan of government regulation but sometimes the government can do something to help and in those cases it has to
2002648 wild fluctuations have made it harder and harder for the average american family to improve live their lives you need to strike a balance between freedom and security for your citizens this is a democracy but we need to pick between a market led democracy and democracy led markets

2002651 its not just going to affect poor people but also moderate to middle class households people are going to become more impoverished to pay for heating this winter
2002652 we are trying to avoid having angry customers having angry customers before the start of winter well thats not good business
2002653 this is going to have a huge impact it will start to pinch people in september and october and could influence this falls elections remember it is much easier for people to drive less than it is to heat less
2002654 the deteriorating demand picture reinforces our belief that oil prices are approaching a tipping point
2002655 it is one thing if you cant drive your car but it is quite another thing if you cant stay warm on a cold winter night
2002656 the economy is tough and the reality is that we will have people freezing to death this winter if there is no substantial increase in liheap funding

2002662 i have no hesitation in concluding that the sexual degradation of the child by the accused has had a very detrimental effect
2002663 you could argue that nobody is ever ready to be president

2002680 paypal has a slightly different focus it is a great place to start for a small online business but it is a big market we have more than enough to keep us very busy we always focus on providing a quality service but we are not suited to every merchant needs the level of service we offer comes at a price our discount rates are still very competitive and keeping fraud down to a minimum is a great way for a merchant to cut costs instead of looking for the cheapest solution
2002681 2008 looks set to see similar growth and the current interest in yespayments and online processing generally gives me great optimism that we will see even better results
2002682 trying to cross market or tap an existing client base is incredibly efficient but you also have to be able to support the product that you market
2002683 to successfully launch any kind of service online is not just a case of opening and marketing a website you need the commercial experience and organization behind you to actually operate the business and provide a quality service or product there are popular and successful social networks but they are not an online retailer
2002684 many people think its easy but e commerce is anything but easy we see many applications from entrepreneurs with little or no experience trying to go online and unfortunately we have to disappoint them and advise them to get their business built first before looking to sell on the internet an applicant asked me recently how much money he needed to start an online business like amazon i wished him every success and spent some time explaining that the physical aspects of any business needs to come first not necessarily a traditional shop or office but things like the necessary planning and investment product development staff supply and delivery chain we do not try to discourage start up business quite the opposite in fact and i am happy to say that many learn from us and then come back when the time is right

2002712 to our surprise all of the engineered mice lived longer
2002713 the engineered mice live longer because the diseases that kill them cancer cardiovascular disease and others are being postponed by reducing insulin like signaling in the brain

2002734 we found that even low doses of dha increased the levels of lr11 in rat neurons while dietary dha increased lr11 in brains of rats or older mice that had been genetically altered to develop alzheimers disease
2002735 is what the optimal dose should be it could be that a smaller amount might be helpful especially in a place like the south of france where people are already on a mediterranean diet
2002736 and this may contribute to the low lr11 seen in many alzheimers patients

2002754 when the decision was made to liberate iraq i was going on what my advisers were telling me and what everyone has said for nearly a century that the u s military is the best in the world
2002755 but if that were the case and we did have the most powerful army navy marines and air force on the globe we would be winning right
2002756 i know the folks on our end didnt drop the ball
2002757 the civilian oversight of this war and the plan of attack has been brilliant theres no doubt about that in my mind hate to say it but maybe our men and women in uniform just arent what theyre cracked up to be
2002758 we havent really flat out won a war since then and you have to admit even that one was pretty close
2002759 we pretty much have a 3 4 record in terms of important wars and thats being generous because im counting the civil war as a victory we got absolutely killed in vietnam which was another war where the leadership at home did a fine job only to be let down by the troops not quite sure what happened in korea and i thought we won the first gulf war but apparently we didnt because were still there
2002760 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

2002794 doch es wird ein ereignis sein in dem sich die anf lligkeit und mangelnde sicherheit des internets manifestieren wird das die regierung nutzen wird um zu handeln
2002795 man hat in den usa und europa versucht die ffnung dieses politischen fensters zu nutzen und so einiges durchzubringen was man sowieso vorhatte

2002797 if youre so critical why dont what i wrote previously
2002798 sir this is a lecture why dont you sit down and listen
2002799 be quiet and let the author continue with his lecture he has the right to give his lecture
2002800 he has no right to lecture if he is going to say things in support of israel
2002801 because these totalitarians just stopped my right to lecture and are swearing at me and who knows what they will do next
2002802 do you know that one fellow stopped my lecture and then called me a
2002803 well i have investigated and the only thing i could really charge them with would be causing a disturbance but i decided to let them go with a warning not to come back to this store
2002804 do you mean that its not a crime to use gestapo tactics to break up a lecture and tell the author that he is a
2002805 well we get 2 or 3 racial slurs a day in kitchener waterloo i cant charge everybody
2002806 but dont you see a difference between a racial slur used in a dispute over a traffic accident and one used to silence an author at a lecture he was invited to give by chapters
2002807 i cant give you any special treatment because you are an author
2002808 dont you understand what it is like for a jewish author whose grandparents were gassed in auschwitz to be called a f jew at a lecture
2002809 i heard you said some things at the lecture just as objectionable as what was said to you we are going to issue our own press release and you may not be happy with what it says
2002810 i heard that you said that all muslims are terrorists
2002811 i definitely did not say that if you put out a press release with such nonsense i will sue to protect my reputation
2002812 inappropriate behaviour and racist comments both from the guest author and some of the attendees at this particular event
2002813 this just proves that all arabs and muslims deserve to die
2002814 one suggestion is to create a series of impenetrable fences and buffer zones essentially to keep the animals in the zoo
2002815 its not that spectral force 3 is a bad game
2002816 a poll that didnt put her name in the question is a fraud and knowing the advertiser probably a deliberate one
2002817 50 per cent believe the states national party such as it is should merge with the liberals
2002818 in the advertsier poll names of candidates were not mentioned to ensure an equal playing field because neither the liberals nor labor have selected candidates for the election
2002819 its karlene thats taking the hits much more so than the government
2002820 nationals member karlene maywald has suffered a disastrous collapse in support in her riverland electorate of chaffey
2002821 i think karlene has enormous respect in her area as someone who is fighting for the river land at every turn and that will be demonstrated in the next election
2002822 i think karlene maywald is seen as an outstanding mp who is working overdrive to assist our state
2002823 without karlene maywald people would not have that direct voice in the government and that direct voice into the highest level of debate in the nation
2002824 but to actually come out and encourage cutting and pasting is odd to say the least
2002825 say what you will about obama the mccain campaign just gets more repulsive to me every day
2002826 you know why john mccain should be the next president of the united states and we need you to tell others why
2002827 copy and pasting talking points is a corruption of the whole idea of community discussion
2002828 the bottom line for the oil people is how much can i make while spending the least i can get by with on refineries synthetic fuels and for exploration and drilling on the vast unused acreage in existing oil leases
2002829 im such a work in progress at the moment its crazy and life wants me on edge i swear to you but as long as i dont forget the past im cool one must always be mindful just like you might forget that old girlfriend who tried to slit your throat but shes really still hot if you remember the stitches more than you remember the pussy youre going to be just fine
2002830 well what are you going to do when you get to heaven and the music of messiaen is being played
2002831 if i had eight hours to chop down a tree id spend six sharpening my axe

2002835 when i woke up i was in the middle of a row of bodies waiting for postmortem
2002836 my throat was parched and i asked for water towering over me the doctors and nursing staff at anandpur sahib civil hospital looked dazed they must have been surprised to see a dead man come alive like that
2002837 when we made a decision to do more interactivity on our web site we determined that it made the most sense for us to implement a content management system on an open source platform
2002838 they evangelized within the company about the merits of open source having some new people in this environment which had always been traditionally microsoft based development well they were sort of getting people excited about what could happen
2002839 buffet lifestyle you get to solve challenges in lots of different businesses we found a number of our customers didnt have the budget to purchase licensed products in university settings or museum associations or even more recently media companies theres been some issues around decelerating of their revenues they just couldnt afford proprietary for us it was a logical next step to offer those customers open source
2002840 they asked us to go out and recommend platforms in the open source world that we could help them implement and customize when we first started nine years ago we were either building custom solutions from scratch or we were implementing proprietary solutions from big name companies
2002841 not only within the framework of drupal but other open source modules and components that we can integrate and we work in a lamp environment so it is quick for us to implement new functionality that we want internally
2002842 one of the drawbacks of consultancies is that there are typically a lot of solo practitioners that cant do the bigger projects we use a team approach and by matching this with open source we think it gives us a strategic advantage because the team can implement changes very quickly for our customers thats been a terrific benefit for us
2002843 there are pieces to the puzzle that wed like to see like customer relationship management accounting all the different pieces youd see in managing a business theres still a lot of satellite initiatives that havent converged yet the disconnect is that theres no one entity or group or central place where people are thinking about how all the pieces snap together id like to see that happen but were not big enough to effectuate that we can snap the pieces for our own benefit and for our customer but that still isnt doing justice to the whole world if there was some kind of roadmap youd see a lot more companies buying into the open source vision in the same manner that theyre buying into oracle or microsoft
2002844 theres plenty of resources out there where you can get information on the different platforms available implement web servers first hire a couple of really great developers that know the lamp environment and task them with getting a roadmap for the back office using open source if you start that way you could map all your needs to readily available open source solutions out there but it starts with getting at least one person who is a technologist that could support them in the back office
2002845 as someone raised in a christian home and active as a christian student in the oxford of the mid 1960s i can report that creationism was unheard of at the time christians didnt have any problem with evolution and it was not a topic for discussion or debate i was nurtured as a darwinian and remain so today

2002885 as i view it im a control freak i love to be in control however i fantasize about that control being stripped from me and handed over to someone else namely my husband im just glad i found a site that makes me realize im not a freak for wanting to be dominated
2002886 thank you for providing such a positive validating place for like minded people to talk about this in a way that affirms the dignity of both men and women

2002903 talks on irans nuclear program in geneva indicated a shift of the us policy toward iran in line with the james baker lee hamilton recommendations of 2006
2002904 has found out that iran is a country which cannot be ignored and the presence of us under secretary william burns in the geneva talks on july 19 approves such a finding
2002905 the probable outcome is that washington will refrain from military action to forestall iranian nuclear arms developments while tehran will refrain from disrupting washingtons potemkin village in iraq in this exchange iran gives up nothing of importance for the rage of the iraqi shiites will only wax over time tehran retains the option to stir things up in iraq whenever it chooses to do so its capacity to do so will increase with time as iraq grows less stable
2002906 iran wants an independent stable and tranquil iraq in its neighborhood

2002925 when a girl has gone through the cycle of her toys she usually has a thorough course in domestic science she has her dolls which teach her various matters about dress and hygiene she has her toy house which instructs her in cooking and caring for the home

2002952 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
2002953 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors

2002957 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid

2002961 unfortunately we see major news outlets airing too many sensationalist stories on outlandish topics such as immigrants with leprosy black street gangs or mexican plots to re conquer the united states americans should be able to flip to stations where we can hear about asian american ceos revolutionizing their industries african american doctors saving lives and hispanic soldiers many of whom are not yet citizens bravely fighting overseas under the flag of the country theyre proud to call their own

2002978 republicans once hailed as the party of ideas have become the party of stupid
2002979 now i dont mean that gop politicians are on average any dumber than their democratic counterparts and i certainly dont mean to question the often frightening smarts of republican political operatives
2002980 what i mean instead is that know nothingism the insistence that there are simple brute force instant gratification answers to every problem and that theres something effeminate and weak about anyone who suggests otherwise has become the core of republican policy and political strategy
2002981 library and archives canadas international involvement is relevant to canadians as it benefits the professional community and ensures that canadian needs are represented in the field of global standards

2002987 most incidents relate to old buildings which have now been demolished at pembury hospital there is no specific problem
2002988 labour have said over and over again that they will improve cleanliness in our hospitals but these figures clearly show that they are failing
2002989 we need greater transparency in nhs infection control and publishing data like this is one way in which we can drive up overall hygiene standards
2002990 we receive a wide range of information on hygiene from different sources
2002991 clearly it may be necessary to take action against pests in these large public buildings from time to time
2002992 however it is important for hospital trusts to have robust procedures in place to deal with any pest problems and if they persist trusts should question whether they have the right systems in place
2002993 if we were concerned that the safety of patients was at risk through poor hygiene standards or in any other way we would take immediate action
2002994 hospitals must be responsible for ensuring their buildings are clean and that patient safety is not compromised
2002995 trusts should take rapid action and follow through with surveillance in place to avoid pest incidents and minimize hazards
2002996 the claim that insects spread hospital acquired infections is entirely unproven there is no evidence of their carriage of antibiotic resistant bacteria being a hazard to patients despite this we expect hospitals to take continued action to tackle pest problems

2003018 eights illustrate the test of taking action out in the world to make your dreams a reality in their respective elemental suits
2003019 we started batting around the idea back in early 05
2003020 but we had other full time things going on so didnt officially launch until the beginning of 06
2003021 we initially started out by putting out a very basic version of the site focused on a couple of simple things you could organize games with friends and put up a sports profile as we introduced sportsvite in beta we realized that the opportunity for an online community targeting recreational sports and amateur athletes was substantial
2003022 in every aspect of what we do we use open source
2003023 one of the major reasons we use it is the belief in its stability and availability and of course zero cost to get started
2003024 they were cool with it the conversation would come up from time to time earlier on when they would be talking with someone else who would mention how net was pretty good then i would have to explain the pros and cons of why we were taking the approach we took as opposed to using net which straps you to microsoft technology they understood that and bought into the philosophy that theres a world of open source resources out there and its only going to grow and get bigger over time well have more and more options available to us as we expand the site
2003025 we explain the technology were using and how that affects our costs for building and maintaining the system they were fine with it
2003026 i think people are really understanding more and more over the past few years how open source is very stable and its not just a bunch of free software
2003027 production support higher level versions of the product were not finding much need for that the software is the thing and the community is out there on the web ive found that we can stick with the stuff that remains free which is the same underlying software as in the commercial versions and were good to go maybe at some point we may want to ease into getting some kind of higher end support but there just hasnt been a need yet
2003028 knowing how to navigate all of the possible offerings out there and making sense of it and dealing with the community in an effective manner
2003029 there are so many competing frameworks sure if you go with net you dont have to think about it because youre going to use all of microsofts stack but if youre going to choose each and every component you dont want to make the wrong choices you dont want to use an open source product that has a dying community
2003030 some colleagues from cannes told me of the taxi prices there lol howd you like 80 from the airport lol
2003031 try 80 from heathrow to paddington i paid that last year

2003033 to really work satire parody and lampooning should have at least some basis in the real world as a starting point of course writers of these scripts probably dont have to worry as they are protected by the sublime ignorance of most of their audience just watch leno on an evening that the jaywalking segment is on

2003063 mr mcculloughs research clearly shows that oil prices are no longer tied to supply and demand
2003064 statistically this research shows that prices are spiking absent of a crisis like a natural disaster or supply disruption however prices then fell when congress began serious debate on how to crack down on those who may be trying to manipulate the markets research shows that traders may well be in control of the market not supply and demand and consumers have been left paying the price

2003137 home center offers a wide range of attractive discounts throughout the year as part of a plan to target specific communities the chain offers different discounts for different sectors from time to time
2003138 i wasnt sure i had really seen what i thought i had
2003139 it was strange i hadnt encountered anything like it before i wanted to make sure so i asked the cashier what the discount was and why he was not giving it to me
2003140 he insisted that it wasnt a discount but i said cancel the purchase and scan it again so he relented and said its a discount only for minorities
2003141 i asked him what it meant and he said a discount only for arabs i said what do you mean if i was arab you would give me a discount he said yes definitively it was really strange i decided not to argue and to forgo the discount so i paid full price for the products i had purchased
2003142 i didnt expect to get a discount but i was appalled when i realized that had i been arab i would have received one i tried to think what would happen if it was a discount only for jews or sephardim or ashkenazim

2003146 lest others say that you should be accused for doing wrong
2003147 but advertisers found the going a bit hard due to elastic prices unverified content metrics and the hard work and creativity needed to convince clients to go online with mcm we thought we could push some pieces forward for our friends
2003148 there is a unique demand for each one and were either in a conversation with someone about it or working to find where the opportunities for these publications are hidden
2003149 this very variety can help drive our services up the value chain by managing these choices we can deliver highly targeted campaigns at almost any range
2003150 while marketers are getting more sophisticated and the profit motives are more defined the dipstick will tell you that the first adopters are very happy with results and only time will tell when others will come around the key here is unlocking each advertisers set of opportunities in permission and influencer marketing and not merely awareness and understanding how this develops into value that other channels cannot deliver or do not deliver as elegantly and efficiently as the web can
2003151 i think you will find proof that bloggers unlike their newspaper counterparts who are often encumbered by word and editorial limits have the power to paint experiences in a way that rivals the visual efficacy of the discovery channel the intellect of a manuel quezon iii editorial and the entertainment value of the bugs bunny road runner show
2003152 i believe there is potential in hyper segmenting the market so the blogosphere population explosion is very welcome i do know that ive seen how bloggers working together can up the value of their work a hundred fold there has to be infinite potential in that
2003153 when you do the common things in life in an uncommon way you will command the attention of the world

2003156 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
2003157 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors

2003159 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
2003160 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
2003161 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid
2003162 us china relations george w bush s uncharacteristically nuanced approach
2003163 the government and people of china do not have to agree with those sentiments on human rights mostly but its important for the american president to state them

2003170 theres some cost to holding a residential summer camp and it doesnt scale as well as we would like
2003171 we would like to develop a strong affiliation with some entity that can house the kids
2003172 we dont run a residential summer camp as our core competency at red hat but what we can do is gather a community of developers and users around open content for an important social purpose
2003173 we putting together a deployable curriculum in a box and making sure we have something that is turnkey
2003174 if its only going to be 50 kids its not worth doing
2003175 it doesnt make enough of an impact the opportunity for free software to change the way kids learn is too big
2003176 we are developing the curriculum in a wiki style so that teachers can change it directly after that the next priority is internationalization
2003177 people are deeply incented to spread the goodness of free software
2003178 and the educational market is strategic to people who care about the advancement of free software its strategic to the company for obvious reasons and to the community for similar reasons
2003179 we have a very calculated social consciousness olpc is about getting that laptop into the hands of as many kids as possible red hat high is about getting the understanding of what free software can do into the brains of as many kids as possible
2003180 my assessment of his personality is hell be cautious almost fearful of returning there hes always been careful in how he conducted his kills and he was quick to break off his attacks on you and beau no hell be holed up somewhere we dont know about in order to plan his next move remember he stalked the palmer girl for three weeks before he attacked hell be too careful to return to his cottage hell have another location prepared it could be something in here weve overlooked

2003182 from what we know of him from our interviews vance was an unusually cruel child who enjoyed the torture of animals
2003183 he had no known friends growing up he learned to hide his cruel behavior at university but the people we interviewed there said he was part of a small circle of friends
2003184 my guess is whoever performed the spells to transform him into a werewolf was a fellow student at university
2003185 what can be a greater transition than of man to wolf man
2003186 do you think hq would have a list of those who expressed an interest in necromancy at cambridge between 1929 and 1933
2003187 the chief does seem to have access to esoteric resources and records
2003188 if vance has sought shelter with a friend it would most likely be the one entrusted with his secret
2003189 but i cant stop thinking that were missing something important
2003190 youre probably right but i dont see any other course of action for us today
2003191 i hate the thought of just waiting for him to kill again and were back to following his trail of corpses
2003192 this is all weve got at the moment ill go to hq and see if they have any records of these men nellie if you could check with your sources at scotland yard dr paine if you could check any directories to see if you can find any information on them lets meet at my place by 4 oclock

2003196 program managers get involved in the business with high hopes of delivering meaningful card solutions to customers while creating a large portfolio of fee generating accounts unfortunately they soon learn that working with large third party processors and service providers make it nearly impossible to control their companys destiny we are simply putting program managers back in the drivers seat

2003206 while the last decade has seen the rise of the blogger the past few years in particular has seen the rise of the social networking site
2003207 a lot of young people in particular describe their daily lives on sites like bebo or facebook and do not see a need to blog as well

2003209 the liberal democrat ams site is fast achieving cult status as surfers check out the latest musings on his personal web log
2003210 highly readable and in part quite entertaining the website is certainly worth a visit

2003212 vi har ikke helt det samme kollegiale netv rk s man kan f le sig som palle alene i verden
2003213 vi kan have sv rt ved at r be leverand rerne op mest microsoft som de fleste arbejder med
2003214 man skal for eksempel v re et vist antal for at kunne blive microsoft partner og for eksempel findes der den gamle partner guide som giver adgang til at hente nye ting og lave fejlmeldinger hvis du ikke har indgangen til det s har du faktisk et voldsomt problem
2003215 det tekniske kan v re interessant og vi kan m ske l re af hinanden
2003216 nu kommer microsoft med den nye axapta og der kunne det v re smart hvis vi gik sammen om at se p det
2003217 vi kan ikke h ndtere de store m ngder mere s du m vente op til 1 mdr p din pakke
2003218 i dont generally go in for ultra fancy mice after all even the most advanced models wont let me do the one thing i demand from the peripheral let me control the cursor with my butt thankfully the design pioneers at interaction architecture have created the backball which lets you do just that the big orange ball doubles as a giant trackball
2003219 the truth is in order to get things like universal health care and a revamped education system then someone is going to have to give up a piece of their pie so that someone else can have more
2003220 violence begets violence hatred begets hatred and terrorism begets terrorism a white ambassador said that yall not a black militant not a reverend who preaches about racism an ambassador whose eyes are wide open and who is trying to get us to wake up and move away from this dangerous precipice upon which we are now poised the ambassador said the people that we have wounded dont have the military capability we have but they do have individuals who are willing to die and take thousands with them and we need to come to grips with that
2003221 because sometimes its easier to hold on to your own stereotypes and misconceptions it makes you feel justified in your own ignorance thats america
2003222 the government lied about pearl harbor too they knew the japanese were going to attack governments lie the government lied about the gulf of tonkin they wanted that resolution to get us in the vietnam war governments lie the government lied about nelson mandela and our cia helped put him in prison and keep him there for 27 years the south african government lied on nelson mandela governments lie
2003223 we have become a nation of struggling folks who are barely making it every day
2003224 folks are just jammed up and its gotten worse over my lifetime
2003225 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
2003226 our study shows it is possible to increase lifespan in mice by modest but prolonged lowering of core body temperature
2003227 our model addresses something more basic than the amount of food
2003228 it works at the level of the thermoregulatory set point that is governed by intra brain temperature and neurotransmitters this mechanism we believe will be a good target for pharmacological manipulation or heating
2003229 an extremely reliable and well placed source in the intelligence community
2003230 his death was supremely unemotional you got god shaking in rage there is no emotional component he was a rebel against god he was taught to be a rebel by his parents he came from a rebel country they brought this wrath upon his head and it sucks to be him and it sucks to be them
2003231 you gotta connect the dots people from your idols to your filthy way of life
2003232 heres what i know he is dead and god does not do that to people that serve in his truth
2003233 i havent met him personally but he has nothing going on

2003236 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
2003237 the tension in the anglican communion is being played out in the heart of its leader
2003238 this is more evidence of the unravelling of anglicanism without a clearly agreed biblical foundation all the goodwill in the world cannot stop the inevitable break up unity without truth is disunity
2003239 for many people in the communion what this reveals calls into question the ability of dr williams to lead the communion out of the crisis it is in despite his considerable personal qualities he is so obviously torn in his very person he is bound to give encouragement to one side of the controversy this leaves a vacuum of leadership and that is why the global anglican future conference emerged
2003240 that archbishop rowan williamss theology is identical to that held by canadian and american anglican churches currently blessing same sex unions is not news
2003241 what should be news is the rank hypocrisy of williamss willingness to lay at the feet of canadian and american anglicans the blame for divisions in the communion when the only difference between whats happening in our churches and in his is that were telling the truth about it
2003242 i know dr williams thinks the church is important but this is almost saying the church is more important than belief we had a reformation to change that view
2003243 if you think the whole world has been explored think again
2003244 what can you cant have a hump day post on a thursday

2003249 at last a fully comprehensive fascinating compendium of information about psalms wisdom literature and other writings of the old testament
2003250 this volume in the acclaimed intervarsity press bible dictionaries will serve to further enhance the reputation of the series longman and enns have brought together a great team of authors to cover wisdom poetry and writings of the old testament this volume is comprehensive and up to date as for example the articles on history of interpretation and intertextuality indicate this volume will be an invaluable resource for students pastors and scholars as they seek to hear gods address through these biblical books the wisdom and poetic books have not always received the attention they deserve and this volume will play a significant role in addressing that imbalance highly recommended
2003251 boeing and british airways have a relationship that stretches back over the last 50 years and this order is a reaffirmation of this ongoing partnership
2003252 the 777 300er offers exceptional fuel economy and environmental credentials and will integrate seamlessly into british airways existing twin aisle fleet
2003253 in addition our key partner gecas continues to demonstrate confidence in the 777 with the 777s gecas has ordered in the last two years it has created five new 777 customers three of the five new customers have subsequently purchased new 777s directly from boeing

2003259 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
2003260 rejecting the un resolution calling for the establishment of both a jewish state and a palestinian arab state
2003261 a gross violation of the principle of self determination proclaimed by the allies
2003262 we have conquered territories but without settlements they have no decisive value settlement is the real conquest
2003263 obviously the very existence of the state of israel had placed jewish survival in the arab world in jeopardy this is the real price paid for the establishment of the jewish state
2003264 not only is the dissolution of jewish settlements in the diaspora something which needs not be regretted it is actually part of zionisms fulfillment it was the pressure of the jews themselves that finally forced the hand of the iraqi authorities
2003265 any analogy between palestinian refugees and jewish immigrants from arab lands is folly in historical and political terms
2003266 we are not refugees some of us came to this country before the state was born we had messianic aspirations
2003267 the colonial situation had caused insuperable rifts among various religious and ethnic groups as they adopted different strategies vis vis the french this meant that the rate of the north african jews departure reflected not only the course of arab israeli relations but the specific vicissitudes of decolonization in their countries of origin
2003268 i wont sugarcoat it this will be the hardest thing you ever do

2003278 we thought it was an appropriate measure to take at this point as we had an issue with the reports of people giving to the campaign who had no intention of supporting or voting for john mccain that was clear from recent reports
2003279 john mccains campaign is returning about 50 000 raised by a jordanian man
2003280 the campaign isnt planning right now to return the money that sargeant raised for mccain but they are checking his contributions
2003281 yeah because the firstie probably realized that mccain i and ii were both admirals

2003286 where did these men find the audacity to kill a president of the united states
2003287 all these men knew that hoffas comment about the attorney general that robert kennedy would not rest until hoffa was behind bars was true for them as well these were desperate times that called for desperate measures

2003291 at first we had no idea what it was it could have been in our solar system or at the edge of the universe
2003292 we think that in the recent past the galaxy ic 2497 hosted an enormously bright quasar
2003293 because of the vast scale of the galaxy and the voorwerp light from that past still lights up the nearby voorwerp even though the quasar shut down sometime in the past 100 000 years and the galaxys black hole itself has gone quiet
2003294 this discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the internet world

2003300 gay relationships can reflect the love of god in a way that is comparable to marriage according to the archbishop of canterbury rowan williams

2003302 what nintendo have done with the wii is truly fantastic there is no question about it but i think sometimes there is a thin line between gimmick and great gameplay
2003303 weve seen some research that says 60 percent of people who bought a wii fit play it once and dont play it again
2003304 so we have to get the balance right because what we are doing is bringing new consumers into the market for the first time in their lives sometimes
2003305 30 of wii fit owners played it less than 5 hours

2003337 researchers discovered that high concentrations of ascorbate had anticancer effects in 75 per cent of cancer cell lines tested while sparing normal cells
2003338 the researchers traced ascorbates anti cancer effect to the formation of hydrogen peroxide in the extracellular fluid surrounding the tumours normal cells were unaffected
2003339 when you eat foods containing more than 200 milligrams of vitamin c a day for example two oranges and a serving of broccoli your body prevents blood levels of ascorbate from exceeding a narrow range

2003347 we became boyfriend and girlfriend the day we met he was on a quest to meet me and he was like i think youre beautiful and i really like you and i was like oh my gosh i like you so much nick and i loved each other we still do but we were in love with each other for two years he was basically my 24 7 but it was really hard to keep it from people we were arguing a lot and it really wasnt fun
2003348 at first i bawled for a month straight i was so sad i just went into this weird funk and i dyed my hair black when we were dating nick wanted me to get highlights and so i did that and i got myself looking great and then on the day we broke up i was like i want to make my hair black now i dont want to look pretty i want to look hard core i was rebelling against everything nick wanted me to be and then i was like ive got to be by myself for now and just figure out who i really am
2003349 maybe hell be my best friend for the rest of my life or maybe ill end up marrying nick jonas since the break up ive realised that ive met so many great guys but i like being the girl nobody can have no one can touch me no ones mine im myself i think its sexy to do your own thing

2003364 i wont say were running out of time but i need to get into a camp somewhere
2003365 exposed the toxic chemistry of everyday products and whats at stake for american power
2003366 by refusing to close the loopholes in epa laws that regulate chemicals in toys and other products the u s government is jeopardizing our health alienating us from the global market and erasing our role as a world leader in environmental protection
2003367 thats because those enrolled in the program would receive what amounts to a free pass for the first i 80 mainline toll barrier meaning theyll be able to travel up to about 60 miles from home before being charged a 2 70 flat fee at the second and each additional barrier
2003368 those without e zpass will receive a toll bill in the mail along with a 1 processing fee a result of high resolution cameras that will read license plates and use computers to search out the owners

2003376 for years washington has failed to address the issue of rising energy costs and as a result the country now faces a true energy crisis one that is causing serious harm to americas manufacturing sector
2003377 for every 1 increase in a barrel of oil it costs the industry 660 million
2003378 they look at us and wonder what are they doing
2003379 in our country the grocery and beverage lobby doesnt like mandatory recycling programs
2003380 we see bottle bills as an unnecessary tax theres enough value in the containers themselves pet plastic bottles are worth about a penny
2003381 were doing our part so the american consumers can do theirs in a lot of communities its just not easy
2003382 it is an increased cost and burden on people and increases the cost of the product
2003383 recycling was looked at as a defensive posture something they have to do because consumers want them to do it
2003384 you have plastics companies saying you cant have quality with recycled plastic and were proving them wrong in the past they opposed it for the same reason as steel companies opposed recycled steel because its competitive with their billions of dollars
2003385 your coffee maker your vacuum cleaner theres just not an easy collection infrastructure and no requirements that it be recycled like there are in most developed countries even china north america consumes 4 billion pounds of plastic in electronics
2003386 biomass to fuel is there enough land the answer is no given that it makes a lot more sense to focus on biomass to chemicals

2003388 environmental groups get their money from joe average citizen who sends 35 a year and thats their disposable income giant corporations very livelihoods depend on a rule theyre going to spend infinitely more thats the system that we work with
2003389 the country is going to continue to need to use coal
2003390 its a fuel that we have available we have the infrastructure to get it out of the ground and get it to market and we know how to use it
2003391 in the last 20 years we have dramatically increased the use of coal and have dramatically decreased the emissions that we have been instructed to control through better technology
2003392 you can count on getting energy from nuclear 24 7 365 days a year and the fact that its a non emitting source is why members of congress are so supportive of it
2003393 we dont think that you should pick one fuel source over another
2003394 the easy thing would be to set a goal for climate change that is 20 years in the future and say ok weve done our job
2003395 the more difficult position would be to say we need an energy policy for the next decade
2003396 this guidance was developed to ensure that our nations critical infrastructure remains up and running and we address the needs of all of our citizens enabling the country to recover from a pandemic more quickly

2003431 i dont approve of that being on a church sign parson

2003435 gail montenegro dhs spokeswoman told the tribune in an e mail that federal agents are stationed in county court to review arrest records
2003436 while in d c you insulted my office called me a false messiah and said i am a lawbreaker you begged various entities to investigate me as if i were a common criminal what you are really doing is pandering to a small vocal constituency that supports open borders and refuses to see the collateral damage caused by unchecked illegal immigration
2003437 we all have a basic right to be left alone by law enforcement if we have done nothing wrong
2003438 federal immigration officials were taking weeks not the agreed upon 72 hours to pick up suspected illegal immigrants which led to crowding at the jail

2003445 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

2003456 we agreed that these matters will be pursued further in the continuation of australias bilateral human rights dialogue between canberra and beijing and we believe the next round of that dialogue will be scheduled for later this year
2003457 there are endless streams of abuse levelled at bush and the us
2003458 but china seems to be a sacred cow because they dont take criticism well
2003459 diogenes it is apparent that kevin rudd is laying the seeds of his future demise in his actions in so many ways such cynicism is breathtaking
2003460 i believe president bush should not plan on attending the opening ceremonies in beijing absent major changes by the chinese government
2003461 i think that exemplifies my double standards argument 40 i look forward to rons reply
2003462 ron i support the rudd policy re china he has no blood on his hands on the iraq issue
2003463 my point was that when we behave like criminals it robs us of any moral base from which to justifiably critcize china or any other country
2003464 and they may do some good by using in this instance
2003465 im a huge sports fan a big baseball fan and so to be able to do anything like this is always really cool

2003483 once again the oil companies and their friends are standing with sen mccain the candidate for president who is proposing to offer them a 4 billion tax cut
2003484 it looks like gas station tv doesnt want the american people to know about sen obamas plan to offer working families a 1 000 energy rebate that would be funded by a tax on oil company profits
2003485 the oil companies have taken sides in this race and they are standing with john mccain because they know hes been in washington for 26 years and can be counted on to pursue for another four years of the bush energy policy thats made them billions of dollars
2003486 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires

2003528 if we succeed in breaking the siege once more ships and boats will come and a channel will open between gaza and the outside world that can also transfer assistance and supplies
2003529 the israeli government is attempting to present us as eccentric but i think it will be trapped because it cant stop us
2003530 as a palestinian i am appalled at the ongoing situation in gaza and shaken at the international communitys disregard for human rights in this case
2003531 i think people must take action and so i have decided to participate in this symbolic boating trip
2003532 nothing like a little bit of ceiling space maybe i can enlarge that skylight a little and have even more space and really what better time to do construction than 3 am
2003533 ack what is that pink drippy stuff thats leaking in through the skylight hmm actually its kind of soothing maybe ill just drift off to sleep for a while
2003534 snork huh what what time is it how long was i out not good not good at all kick on the furnace its chilly in here and lets see what we can do about that skylight opening enlargement project

2003537 gah raining again and why i wonder is the rain around here so viscous its like drool nasty
2003538 my support of obama is probably worth more than any check that i could write
2003539 a poll finds that 78 of new yorkers favor raising the income tax on new yorkers who make 1 million or more per year as a way to get out of the states fiscal crisis theyre already paying the highest combined tax rate in the country and still its not enough seventy eight percent of new yorkers agree with this the poll by the way shows support for a proposal by the new york assemblys democrat majority to help fill a projected 6 4 billion deficit for the coming year opponents say a higher tax will drive employers away and it might drive some employees away 78 of new yorkers want to raise income taxes on people who earn a million dollars a year or more

2003541 anywhere near moscow folks were naturally heartbroken about the loss of the bridge but i was also struck at how much it affected people in distant parts of the state so i resolved to find some way to recover this part of our indiana heritage
2003542 as much as we all care about the bridge it would never make the cut for spending hoosier tax dollars so the best way to do this in the true hoosier way is in barn raising fashion everyone we asked to help jumped at the chance
2003543 jim schellinger was one of the people i talked to early on about helping he was excited and indicated that cso architects welcomes the opportunity to lead the private fundraising efforts to reconstruct such an important piece of hoosier history
2003544 i drove by the covered bridge in bridgeton regularly and i know how the people in moscow feel i know this can be done and its my obligation being an indiana resident to do what i can
2003545 the hardwood industry has a long history of giving and we just think its an obligation to help with this
2003546 he knows his days as a public policy advocate are over
2003547 when we first looked we saw that the warm periods were associated with the periods of heaviest rainfall but when we looked more carefully we found the models underestimated what the satellite data showed by a factor of two to three

2003550 everythings fine everythings good it was a personal issue everythings taken care of and back to normal now
2003551 it is an ill wind that blows nobody good everybody must live and what would become of the glaziers if panes of glass were never broken
2003552 stop there your theory is confined to that which is seen it takes no account of that which is not seen
2003553 society loses the value of things which are uselessly destroyed
2003554 i will put four pistols into my belt i will fill my cartridge box i will gird on my sword and go thus equipped to the frontier there the first blacksmith nailsmith farrier machinist or locksmith who presents himself to do his own business and not mine i will kill to teach him how to live
2003555 in the first place it is not absolutely impossible that the purchasers of iron my countrymen and enemies should take the thing ill and instead of letting me kill them should kill me instead and then even were i to call out all my servants we should not be able to defend the passages in short this proceeding would cost me very dear much more so than the result would be worth
2003556 it is a measure to which when once it is decreed be it good or bad everybody is bound to conform for the execution of the same a public force is organized and to constitute the said public force men and money are drawn from the nation if then i could only get the great parisian manufactory to pass a little law belgian iron is prohibited i should obtain the following results the government would replace the few valets that i was going to send to the frontier by 20 000 of the sons of those refractory blacksmiths farmers artisans machinists locksmiths nailsmiths and labourers then to keep these 20 000 custom house officers in health and good humour it would distribute amongst them 25 000 000 of francs taken from these blacksmiths nailsmiths artisans and labourers they would guard the frontier much better would cost me nothing i should not be exposed to the brutality of the brokers should sell the iron at my own price and have the sweet satisfaction of seeing our great people shamefully mystified that would teach them to proclaim themselves perpetually the harbingers and promoters of progress in europe oh it would be a capital joke and deserves to be tried
2003557 belgian iron is sold in france at ten francs which obliges me to sell mine at the same price
2003558 for every hundred weight of iron that i shall deliver to the public i shall receive fifteen francs instead of ten i shall grow rich more rapidly extend my traffic and employ more workmen my workmen and i shall spend much more freely to the great advantage of our tradesmen for miles around these latter having more custom will furnish more employment to trade and activity on both sides will increase in the country this fortunate piece of money which you will drop into my strong box will like a stone thrown into a lake give birth to an infinite number of concentric circles
2003559 what is the use of these painful means of increasing the national wealth when all that is wanted for this object is a decree
2003560 grant me o lord my god a mind to know you a heart to seek you wisdom to find you conduct pleasing to you faithful perseverance in waiting for you and a hope of finally embracing you

2003562 the brown tree snake has often been used as a textbook example for the negative impacts of invasive species but after the loss of birds no one has looked at the snakes indirect effects
2003563 it has been 25 years since the birds disappeared it seems to me the consequences are going to keep reverberating throughout the community if birds are fundamental components of the forest
2003564 these findings could have global implications since forests in areas that have had a decline in bird populations instead of outright extinction might show effects similar to those in the forests of guam
2003565 it seems logical that if there are no birds then seeds are not able to get away from their parent trees and that is exactly what our research shows
2003566 the magnitude of difference between seed dispersal on guam and saipan is alarming because of its implications for guams forests and for forests worldwide experiencing a decline or complete loss of birds
2003567 the war continues to abate in iraq violence is still present but of course iraq was a relatively violent place long before coalition forces moved in
2003568 maar natuurlijk zijn we geen lowlands het is parodi rend bedoeld gideon is underground en niet commercieel
2003569 de bands dragen bij aan een leuk festival en krijgen daar publiciteit eten drinken en een slaapplaats voor terug nee geen hotel maar een tent we houden het low profile
2003570 dat doen we bewust groningen staat bekend om gerenommeerde festivals als noorderslag en eurosonic maar daar staan bijna geen lokale bands terwijl we wel het talent hebben op gideon krijgen ze de kans om te spelen alle soorten stijlen komen langs we doen niet aan hokjes trance blues punk rock hiphop drum n bass je hoort het allemaal op gideon
2003571 er is altijd wel iemand die voor iets kan zorgen
2003572 de gemeente komt pas met geld over de brug wanneer een gat in de begroting ontstaat en wanneer blijkt dat we ook maar n euro in de plus komen moeten we het geld direct terugstorten
2003573 het is heel mooi om te zien hoe zoveel mensen zich vrijwillig inzetten voor het festival dat geeft een enorm angela groothuizen ten tijde van avros programma de uitdaging red gevoel dit jaar moet het gewoon weer lukken

2003583 we arabs have a limited patience and if we are obliged to confront then we will do so we do not want recourse to violence but we are ready and we have capacity and capability that should not be underestimated
2003584 by linking the supplementary budget to the approval over the provincial elections bill we are hoping to exert pressure on other political blocs
2003585 the only available possibility is dialogue since long time controversial kirkuk issue requires time and its solution can not be reached quickly
2003586 so should colombia give the hostages back to the terrorists
2003587 im not going to pretend that there is 100 per cent agreement among our electorate that the green shift is the best idea to ever come down the pike but when were able to get through to people theres acknowledgement that its a position and its a discussion issue
2003588 the best program of its type to ever run on network tv
2003589 you are my spirit you are my heart you are my joy and my anguish
2003590 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2003591 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2003592 no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the dnc and with the obama campaign
2003593 just when you thought all of the disciples were lining up behind their messiah bam big wrench
2003594 not even bob doles dismal candidacy in 1996 generated less enthusiasm in gop ranks than mccains current effort
2003595 while mccain receives almost 3 5 times the monetary support from the oil industry employees and pacs as a whole one might find it interesting that 3 of the top oil producers have contributed more to the campaign of sen obama
2003596 that was the theme an observation of something thats counter intuitive and also something that conflicts with the messages that the campaigns are putting out
2003597 its actually obama who has received more from the pockets of employees at several of big oils biggest and most recognizable companies
2003598 tallying contributions by employees in the industry and their families
2003599 and overall mccains campaign has gotten three times more money from the industry than obamas has 1 3 million compared to about 394 000
2003600 lets at least allow the public service commission to look at
2003601 when that happens most of the country is really going to take a new look at this what does a nuclear energy plant look like and what are the real costs and concerns

2003603 the russian peacekeeping forces told us several hours ago that they have totally lost control over the separatist forces
2003604 we are in permanent contact with the russian foreign ministry but it fails to convince the separatist s to cease fire
2003605 a deepening of the confrontation is not in either russias or georgias interests
2003606 all responsibility for the recent development of events falls on the russian federation
2003607 youre taking a big sin on yourself a big sin and youll answer before god
2003608 dont make the georgian and russian people argue with each other
2003609 this agreement would be an obligatory agreement and the country that violates the agreement will be subject to international correction
2003610 without that agreement theres no calm in the region people are afraid people are worried its a very important moment
2003611 how can they be considered a side to the conflict when they dont have a position
2003612 to sign an agreement its necessary to bring back the refugees
2003613 to tskhinvali and to abkhazia this way will not work out
2003614 the issue is not whos guilty but how to get out of this situation how to get out
2003615 exactly the same is happening now just packaged differently for the pr purposes its called an evacuation
2003616 theres no electricity no water no oil and now theres fear
2003617 i dont want to embarrass any other catcher by comparing him to johnny bench
2003618 you see you spend a good piece of your life gripping a baseball and in the end it turns out that it was the other way around all the time
2003619 id walk through hell in a gasoline suit to play baseball
2003620 he couldnt bother with casting and untangling the line in the reel
2003621 it was such a thrill to meet johnny bench george foster joe morgan and especially pete rose who made a big fuss about my grandfather i wish other people could have seen him like that having fun relaxing enjoying himself it would have tempered a lot of peoples image of him as this gruff unyielding man

2003629 as anarchists we feel the greatest problem with government is how its primary interest is to protect the profits of those in power even when it comes at the expense of the general public
2003630 wouldnt it be better if the insurgents were to lay down their arms and live under the rule of law to press any claims of land grabbing
2003631 the rule of law cannot be guaranteed except when an overwhelming majority of the people uphold it for its own sake even those who are disadvantaged at first i know this is hard to accept but that is really the way it works

2003668 did you see what happened in israel a few weeks ago pm olmert traded live terrorists for corpses if we get arrested well just kidnap some people kill them and use their dead bodies to get our employees sprung from jail no harm done
2003669 i expect both will develop until the market works out which one is most cost effective but at the end of the day only one of these technologies will emerge as the winner on cost and greenhouse grounds
2003670 has no intention of granting production tenures for underground coal gasification for at least three years underground coal gasification is a new technology untried in australian conditions and it poses some potential problems especially with groundwater systems
2003671 we will only do what is best for queensland in this case we dont believe its in the best interests of queensland to grant production tenures for technology that is untried
2003672 linc has been asked to do another more rigorous trial of its technology it is critical we make sure we dont contaminate our groundwater
2003673 no civilization can survive the physical destruction of its resource base
2003674 the second law of thermodynamics trumps the laws of economics
2003675 if the world was made of oil there would still be a finite supply of it
2003676 if kindness and comfort are as i suspect the results of an energy surplus then as the supply contracts we could be expected to start fighting once again like cats in a sack

2003689 the hundreds of thousands that big oil has given to saxby chambliss are a drop in the bucket compared to the billions in special tax breaks chambliss has given them
2003690 with oil companies reporting record high profits while families are paying record high prices georgians are going to have a lot of questions about saxby chambliss big oil record average georgians cant afford the big dollar contributions that big oil gives to saxby chambliss but they do deserve a senator who will fight for their families not the oil industry

2003695 by the way as far as capital punishment goes youre dead wrong leviticus 24 17
2003696 capital punishment is the most premeditated of murders to which no criminals deed however calculated can be compared
2003697 for there to be an equivalency the death penalty would have to punish a criminal who had warned his victim of the date on which he would inflict a horrible death on him and who from that moment onward had confined him at his mercy for months such a monster is not to be encountered in private life

2003717 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
2003718 its no sin to be ambitious and its flattering to be courted by your partys presidential nominee but if crist cares as much about florida as he says he should graciously excuse himself from the vice presidential sweepstakes hes been governor for only 17 months and its fair to say that the lives of most floridians workers retirees students have not improved even slightly if crist were to become vice president hed leave tallahassee with virtually no footprints he would be remembered more for his tan than for his leadership
2003719 there are six billion of us we all come from unique places with unique ways of looking at the world we dont always agree but for a few shining weeks we set it all aside we come together to stand and cheer and celebrate as one we think all the things that make us different and remember all the things that make us the same

2003723 you may be surprised at how many terrorists there are in your home right now video games computers cell phones teen magazines music tv amp movies all of which fall under the umbrella of entertainment and all are likely perpetrators
2003724 every time we let unsupervised media into our homes and into our kids minds we have invited a terrorist into our home

2003734 instead of complaining about the state of the education system as we correct the same mistakes year after year ive got a better idea
2003735 university teachers should simply accept as variant spellings those words our students most commonly misspell
2003736 the spelling of the word judgement for example is now widely accepted as a variant of judgment so why cant truely be accepted as a variant spelling of truly

2003738 i think it would just be kind of tragic if no one knew what it was or if no one cared
2003739 if any man would come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me 25 for whoever would save his life will lose it and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it 26 for what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life or what shall a man give in return for his life 27 for the son of man is to come with his angels in the glory of his father and then he will repay every man for what he has done 28 truly i say to you there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the son of man coming in his kingdom
2003740 divine love poured into our hearts by the holy spirit who has been given to us romans 5 5 enables lay people to express concretely in their lives the spirit of the beatitudes
2003741 would have god will that which they themselves will and are fretful at having to will that which he wills and find it repugnant to accommodate their will to that of god hence it happens to them that oftentimes they think that that wherein they find not their own will and pleasure is not the will of god and that on the other hand when they themselves find satisfaction god is satisfied thus they measure god by themselves and not themselves by god
2003742 he will repay every man for what he has done

2003745 the move is in response to one of their colleagues undergoing treatment to change from a 42 year old married man into a woman called lauren
2003746 as from today lauren starts her new life and over the next few weeks you will receive awareness training during which you will be able to read a personal letter from lauren
2003747 i trust you will have the same determination as i have to help lauren return to work with as little fear and trepidation as is possible but feel much happier than she has ever done before

2003751 according to tyson fully 80 percent of the unions 1 000 members agreed to the new holiday arrangement if a workforce with a huge muslim contingent wants to make a deal with management to have their biggest religious holiday off who cares and why are there rumblings about boycotting tyson when its the union thats driving this what am i missing is there an anti eid exception to freedom of contract

2003756 we argue against applying a pure market model to universities they are critically important to this country we dont want to see the risk of market failure as happened in the case of abc childcare effecting universities iru executive director lenore cooper told hes
2003757 special role of public universities should be preserved and that
2003758 the opening up of commonwealth supported places to private providers which are driven by the need to maximise profits for owners and shareholders will inevitably result in those providers moving into the most profitable market niches the submission states
2003759 regional and outer metropolitan universities would lose income due to community pressure to offer a full range of courses at low fees
2003760 lock institutions into their existing profiles stifle innovation in research and to deprive many australian regions of the research support that is required to stimulate regional development
2003761 irus view is that a university must be able to demonstrate research strength in a number of areas if an institution did not do enough research it could elect not to be a university and thus not to compete for research funds this would depend on how much research government specified was necessary for an institution to qualify as a university
2003762 there has been enormous change in the last decade and there will continue to be plenty of change but we dont want dramatic change cooper said source
2003763 most students can complete 13 years of school and be awarded a senior certificate without having to demonstrate minimally acceptable levels of proficiency across a range of fundamental areas
2003764 some things are so fundamental we should expect all students to achieve at least a minimum standard by the time they leave school
2003765 if someone is doing maths in years 11 and 12 then you can be pretty confident theyre going to pass a numeracy test
2003766 but not all students study maths or science for example in those years and theres no way of knowing what they understand
2003767 we should set the standard at the level we hope everyone should reach by the time they finish school
2003768 theres always a risk that standards are set too low and that the focus is then just on achieving low standards so there needs to be levels beyond a minimally acceptable standard
2003769 its postmodernism as intellectual radicalism if youre on the left politically you have to believe in all of this
2003770 there are other traditions of being left wing which respect the facts which dont believe the world is simply what we believe it to be that think if youre going to make political arguments you have to have evidence to support them i want to reinstate that kind of rigorous realistic left liberalism
2003771 postmodernism is addling the brain and wasting the time of some our brightest young people
2003772 this book is about what a group of intelligent students think postmodernism is
2003773 you could say they dont have it right they dont understand it they havent grasped it but if this is what they think postmodernism is if it has led them to argue in these ways then its educationally damaging irrespective of whether they have it right or not

2003778 coach who has to talk to tom murray between periods
2003779 i mean if the idea is to make a record that youd want to listen to yourself which never really happens but this is the record i would want to listen to
2003780 a comment our friend made after our last record influenced our approach to writing bits
2003781 he said you guys should try to write lyrics that are a little more universal as opposed to obtuse or abstract so ya know we decided its ok to write a love song it doesnt have to be veiled in all these layers of hidden meaning there are definitely a lot of love songs on the record hopefully theyre not falling into the clich of that idea
2003782 its fun to write about things that people dont necessarily write songs about but there is also a reason why people write about universal things like love theyre universal
2003783 the way we write songs is very democratic very collaborative
2003784 we go to our practice space and just jam and pick things we do it all together everything
2003785 theres a song on the record where a friend of ours wrote the lyrics and melody theres another song where a friend of ours is playing cello and its just adam singing
2003786 we wanted to have a larger volume of options and to try new things
2003787 people often say our music reminds them of growing up or college none of that is intentional at all it just so happens that were all fairly sentimental guys
2003788 in terms of mood if the last record was our summer record then this is our autumn record
2003789 the live show is an excuse for us to go nuts and have a good time

2003795 the ada which applies some of its most stringent rules to public universities
2003796 what they had most in common was a hatred of moral relativism
2003797 they both believed that morality is absolute though they defined and applied it differently but each believed with all his heart brain and soul that there were such things as moral right and moral wrong and that these were not subject to changes in fashion moral relativism was in fact the gravest of sins everything else they believed in common flowed from this basic perception they fought the dictators of course but both knew that the larger battles were yet to come and that victory over the advance scouting parties of soulless uniformity was only a first step what both believed their core who they were was that individual freedom mattered more than anything else on earth and reliance on tradition was the best way to maintain it

2003832 i shall watch with keenness the work of your research organization in evolving banking practices compatible with islamic ideals of social and economic life the economic system of the west has created almost insoluble problems for humanity and to many of us it appears that only a miracle can save it from disaster that is now facing the world it has failed to do justice between man and man and to eradicate friction from the international field on the contrary it was largely responsible for the two world wars in the last half century the western world in spite of its advantages of mechanization and industrial efficiency is today in a worse mess than ever before in history the adoption of western economic theory and practice will not help us in achieving our goal of creating a happy and contented people we must work our destiny in our own way and present to the world an economic system based on true islamic concept of equality of manhood and social justice we will thereby be fulfilling our mission as muslims and giving to humanity the message of happiness and prosperity of mankind
2003833 that drilling new domestic oil wells in pristine national wilderness areas wont lower the price of his gas any bit wont make us more energy independent only getting off oil itself will and wont create a significant amount of blue collar jobs that are long lasting for him or his friends
2003834 i just need one more drink to make it through the work day but im quitting tomorrow
2003835 the argument that the price of oil being higher than ever at the moment is due to supply and demand is bunk its due to market speculation in oil futures and the low dollar
2003836 as i have said with cement producers and aluminium producers and so on you have got to be able to have a safety valve which enables them to increase their emissions above the permitted levels up to some ceiling where they are putting cutting edge technology into lower emission technology
2003837 an appropriate way to deal with those industries is to enable them to increase their emissions beyond the cap where they are investing in new technology and research and development which is going to reduce emissions in the long term
2003838 whilst we support a cap and trade system we do believe that there needs to be a safety valve of this nature in the legislation
2003839 the lesson for plaintiffs is in the vast majority of cases they are perceiving the defendants offer to be half a loaf when in fact it is an entire loaf or more

2003878 for all the governments attempts to paint the commissions as another nuremberg they remain utterly outside the law and will be mired in challenges for years to come hamdan was convicted based on laws that were passed long after he was picked up and the commission allowed coerced evidence both illegal under not only international law but u s law as well
2003879 hamdans trial revealed what is common knowledge the military commissions are fatally flawed and do not adhere to major aspects of the rule of law hamdan suffered nearly seven years of unlawful detention only to face a process that falls far short so far the trial continues the bush administrations efforts to escape the rule of law and the requirements of justice
2003880 the trial was a show trial the rules of evidence are so tilted in the governments favor that the tribunal is ill designed for getting at truth its hard to credit any verdict though its telling that the executive failed to win the entire case even in its contrived system that however in no way proves the system is fair or that it works
2003881 this is an enormously compelling indication of how independent the process has been
2003882 the problem is the law was specifically written after the fact to target mr hamdan

2003897 an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage
2003898 the absolute condemnation of same sex relations of intimacy must rely either on an abstract fundamentalist deployment of a number of very ambiguous texts or on a problematic and non scriptural theory about natural complementarity applied narrowly and crudely to physical differentiation without regard to psychological structures

2003987 and i think i know what he means ive been involved in a lot of things because im the classic dilettante doing anything that appeals at the time
2003988 im not too sure theres any great theory behind arturart other than wanting to make people laugh
2003989 ive always been interested in art dada is my favourite that was comedy in art
2003990 i have a suspicion that a lot of artists are trying to get a laugh but unlike stand ups they dont get an immediate response from their audience a laugh is a rare thing in a gallery
2003991 there were some things i wanted to have a pop at the pretension of some modern artists for example or the vacuity of much of what is described as conceptual art or how people can disappear up their arse talking about art
2003992 ive been writing my autobiography so a lot of it came from researching that
2003993 oh no i wouldnt describe myself like that but yes i do seem to have a lot of stuff lying around
2003994 just me talking nonsense although one thing i want to get across is that people shouldnt feel intimidated by art or feel that its beyond them
2003995 its the idea behind a piece of art that excites me one of the good things about what is termed modern conceptual art is that you need have no skill or talent for making things which i dont so theres no reason why i or anybody else cant do it im no painter but i enjoy doing the artworks just to express a thought or make a gag
2003996 well i suppose when youve been around as long as i have
2003997 of course its because ive never been so successful that ive inspired any envy
2003998 anyone who wants to do something ill put it in

2004015 you dont have to be defensive if you see imaginary bugs in the middle of the night
2004016 wherefore i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god which is in thee by the putting on of my hands for god hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind
2004017 and the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also
2004018 for this cause left i thee in crete that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting and ordain elders in every city as i had appointed thee
2004019 the scriptural pattern shows that the gift charisma of god is given through the laying on of apostolic hands 1 furthermore we see that the apostle paul left timothy and titus in his own place timothy in ephesus and titus in crete and that it was specifically their duty to select the right men train them to teach others also and ordain kathist mi them the scriptures show this as supernatural and charismatic teaching also that it involves the laying on of hands
2004020 we would regard timothy and titus as special evangelists who served a unique function
2004021 whereas you must treat the actual pattern we see in scripture as something unique which explains it away rather than dealing with it we simply accept the pattern we see in the word of god and continue to practice it to this very day that is the difference between your church government and our polity and it is a theological difference
2004022 neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery
2004023 it is evident unto all men diligently reading holy scripture and ancient authors that from the apostles time there have been these orders of ministers in christs church bishops priests and deacons which offices were evermore had in such reverend estimation that no man might presume to execute any of them except he were first called tried examined and known to have such qualities as are requisite for the same and also by publick prayer with imposition of hands were approved and admitted thereunto by lawful authority and therefore to the intent that these orders may be continued and reverently used and esteemed in the church of england no man shall be accounted or taken to be a lawful bishop priest or deacon in the church of england or suffered to execute any of the said functions except he be called tried examined and admitted thereunto according to the form hereafter following or hath had episcopal consecration or ordination

2004034 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
2004035 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
2004036 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
2004037 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
2004038 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid

2004156 every time we ran into a peak load our system stopped responding
2004157 all the application servers would stop serving requests it turned out to be a bug in ejb that was replicating over and over
2004158 we didnt have catastrophic load testing but we knew there was a problem we went to the vendors
2004159 we looked at that situation and went wow the vendors whole ad campaign is that theyre supposed to offer you this great support but we were hampered by it

2004168 the plain truth about our policy toward this fascist government is that as long as our corporations can use its supply of cheap labor and keeps lending our government huge amounts of money we have no concerns whatsoever how they treat human rights
2004169 the government supports both the promotion of human rights internationally and the development of international standards and mechanisms for the protection and enforcement of these rights
2004170 thats why the government has agreed to issue a standing invitation to un human rights experts to come to australia

2004172 we have a revenue model designed for them this new development keeps me busy in looking for developers whether companies or individuals
2004173 were opening up our platform for the developer community to play around similar to google open social and facebook the difference we have is that 1 we have other revenue models for developers than just ads we got messaging content subscription services and 2 we provide the bridge to the mobile world
2004174 the first developers we work with we will handle closely on a 1 to 1 manner they will help us shape the platform when we are ready to open the sandbox then we unleash it

2004202 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors

2004209 the design of new enzymes for reactions not normally catalyzed in nature is finally feasible
2004210 the goal of our research is to use computational methods to design the arrangement of groups inside a protein to cause any desired reaction to occur
2004211 enzymes are such potent catalysts we want to harness that catalytic ability
2004212 we want to design enzymes for reactions that naturally occurring enzymes dont do there are limits on the reactions that natural enzymes carry out compared with what we can dream up that enzymes can potentially do
2004213 previous reports of designed enzymes have not been very successful and some have been withdrawn
2004214 that is hardly surprising considering the challenge of designing in days or weeks what nature has perfected over billions of years of evolution the rate enhancements by our designer enzymes are modest and hardly competitive so far with those observed for their natural counterparts
2004215 we hope with improvements in technology that we can close the gap between designer enzymes and natural enzymes
2004216 most scientists thought this would be impossible and we felt the same way after many failures
2004217 but improvements in design and sophistication eventually led to success
2004218 these papers are showing the technology is now in place

2004227 i have made it very clear that im supporting sen obama but i think that delegates can decide to do this on their own they dont need permission
2004228 what we want to have happen is for sen obama to be nominated by a unified convention of democrats and the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delgates feel like theyve had a role and their legitimacy has been validated

2004273 trilogys national solar offering is a significant advancement within the sustainable building movement and gives california an even greater chance at achieving governor schwarzeneggers goal of building one million solar roofs by 2017 said aaron nitzkin ocr solar amp roofing vice president
2004274 we commend their decision to offer solar throughout the state and nationally and for choosing a team that offers a quality product backed by a 25 year warranty and installed by a team of solar roofing experts
2004275 with the addition of solar in a home were no longer just efficient users of electricity we become producers integrating a solar system into a home during construction is less expensive than adding it later making solar more accessible and affordable than its ever been

2004279 they are one product that can meet aspirations of people living below the poverty line
2004280 today however people not only see how reliable solar power is they also see it as a way to save on power costs because power prices are not coming down and inflation is rising
2004281 this is great product acceptance and a maturing of the market

2004562 as i grew older and got introduced to computers sometime in the mid 80s i realized that i was living in the dawn of an era wherein technology can actually allow humans to take the pretend concept further and actually allow users to immerse themselves in pretend environments spaces that free of the natural constraints of the real world
2004563 in 2004 i first learned about the emerging virtual worlds and was introduced to
2004564 i immediately applied for the position and was accepted into the company in march 2007 its nearly a year since i joined the firm and the level of excitement and enthusiasm i have as well as my fellow employees remain at an all time high and we constantly look forward to the things that other various upcoming virtual world platforms have to offer that would utilize our unique and varied skill sets
2004565 our virtual products have been featured in a second life journal and various second life blogs all over the net
2004566 admittedly age plays a factor in determining what sort of electronic entertainment the average filipino considers as worthwhile recreation
2004567 assuming these people indeed have the hardware and a robust internet connection i believe that the only hindrance for them in fully participating would simply be an assumption that these virtual worlds are nothing but hyped up e marketing strategies or they are simply
2004568 they were basically sucked in by the hype and when they found themselves in the world and didnt know what to do they basically withered and died thus seeing these companies experiences as examples it is not advisable to merely jump blindly into virtual worlds without first knowing what they are all about and perhaps the most striking feature of virtual worlds is that it is not something you just explain via an article or a powerpoint presentation it simply has to be experienced first hand for one to fully appreciate the potentials that 3d spaces and environments have to offer in terms of creative educational and commercial purposes
2004569 say there is a filipino furniture manufacturer and exporter who own a static website displaying his wares in order to keep abreast with the advancements in browser technology the next step for him to do is to introduce interactivity via technologies such as flash and javascript which would allow site visitors to click on the displayed furniture examples images and allow color changes etc but there will be limits to the interactivity that a visitor can do with this simply because it is still all happening within the confines of a web 1 0 2 0 level browser now imagine this furniture website translated as an actual virtual shop inside second life where vistors avatars can go around the furniture sit on it rearrange it inside a sample room to see various layout opportunities change color or some basic stylistic forms the possibilities are endless virtual worlds offer an almost limitless potential for product evaluation and design because of its 3 dimensional immersive nature

2004573 we know how you love soda and kool aid and are making excuses for your
2004574 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

2004590 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
2004591 after weeks of late night negotiations and under intense u s pressure iraqi lawmakers failed to pass a much debated provincial elections law wednesday before adjourning for the month the failure to pass the law which would govern elections in provinces across the country may push the elections into next year if elections dont happen by the end of this year it could be july before the balloting could be carried out u n spokesman said arikat said
2004592 a special session of parliament sometime during the recess which ends sept 9
2004593 days of intense negotiations and heavy pressure from the u s the united nations and britain
2004594 the united states regrets that the iraqi parliament today adjourned without finishing its work on a local elections law
2004595 its interesting what i find interesting about this report as well is when youre looking at these two countries iraq and afghanistan seeing how vastly different iraq is from afghanistan in terms of the natural resources that they have afghanistan is a very poor country one of the poorest in the world iraq will come back much faster given that they had some semblance of infrastructure as crumbling as it was but something to work from afghanistan is being built from scratch and so i thought that was something worth taking away
2004596 i saw the report i saw the reports about the report so id refer you back to the state department just to as they wake up this moring just to make sure that theyve looked at it because i dont know all the details
2004597 the united states has now appropriated more than 50 billion in taxpayer dollars for iraqs reconstruction
2004598 weve done a lot for the iraqis just in terms of the numbers themselves
2004599 ill tell you what concerns me and most of my constituents you said many times the gains in iraq are fragile and reversable so my constituents and i believe that
2004600 you have to wonder why the best that you can say is that the gains are fragile and reversable
2004601 and i listened carefully to senator hagel and ambassador crocker from the answer you gave him i dont get the
2004602 you are asking us for millions more to pay off the militias and by the way i have an article here that says maliki recently told a london paper that he was concerned about half of them
2004603 why dont you ask the iraqis to pay the entire cost of that progam
2004604 iraqs oil income will more than double this year baghdad continues to spend only a small percentage of its own money on reconstruction and services while it banks billions in surplus funds
2004605 between 2005 and 2007 only 10 percent of iraqs expenditures went toward reconstruction with just 1 percent spent on maintaining u s and iraqi funded investments in roads water electricity and weapons according to a report released yesterday by the government accountability office even when baghdad has allocated larger sums the report said it has spent only a small portion of the budgeted money
2004606 left little doubt that iraq which racked up 32 9 billion in oil earnings from january through june can afford to pay more for its own reconstruction
2004607 driving through iraq you feel the neglect here in basra the city is rivers of sewage destroyed buildings and bridges from war after war after war every day i pass by the same buildings destroyed years ago during the u s led invasion in my neighborhood in baghdad every day they look exactly the same a pile of rubble the electricity problem seems to be getting worse iraqis have an average of about four hours of electricity a day while there is talk of reconstruction a bridge here flowers planted there the people dont feel a change
2004608 one thing thats very important is how they are spending their money which is distributing it evenly amongst the around the country but amongst the different sects as well so shias sunnis and kurds its something that theyre going to have to continue to work out we want them to take on more of their own responsibilities just from a security standpoint but also reconstruction also if you remember prime minister maliki went into sadr city basra and mosul he offered immediate financial assistance to people who were living there under those terrible conditions
2004609 it is good for their psychological health it is good to take care of the appearance to see the building a new clean
2004610 school kits to iraqi refugee children distribution of uniforms shoes and school materials and is expected to outfit 30 000 children from damascus and rural damascus before the start of the syrian school year on sept 7 last year unhcrs distribution reached 20 000 iraqi children
2004611 its really important that they figure out a way to quickly get that money to those people directly i think theyve made a lot of progress on that but they needed to do more
2004612 notified congress of a possible foreign military sale to iraq of armored security vehicles as well as associated equipment and services the total value if all options are exercised could be as high as 206 milliion
2004613 the defense security cooperation agency notified congress of a possible foreign military sale to iraq of light armored vehicles as well as associated equipment and services the total value if all options are exercised could be as high as 3 billion the defense security cooperation agency notified congress of a possible foreign military sale to iraq of technical assistance for construction of facilities and infrastructure as well as associated equipment and services the total value if all options are exercised could be as high as 1 6 billiion the defense security cooperation agency notified congress of a possible foreign military sale to iraq of helicopters and related munitions as well as associated equipment and services the total value if all options are exercised could be as high as 2 4 billion

2004630 i cannot believe the parents behaved in this fashion if they noticed their children missing they should have contacted the police they have no right regardless of if the neighbor had or had not kidnapped the children to round up an angry mob to attack the neighbor and his sleeping housemate i am terribly embarrassed the children have such out of countrol parents i am embarrassed by the behavior of the parents ridiculous

2004668 what does it mean to forebear each other in such a world what does it mean to cover sins in mercy not cover up but true covering in mercy to allow others to find care and restoration in their own interpersonal context rather than attempting to humiliate them before the whole world
2004669 with jobless claims soaring to their highest level in six years it is imperative that president bush work with congressional democrats in supporting a second economic stimulus package that will provide immediate and comprehensive assistance to working american families
2004670 for the past several months i have joined my democratic colleagues in steadfastly urging the bush administration to support legislation that will eliminate the multi billion deficit that currently exists in our nations highway trust fund
2004671 record high gas prices soaring health care costs and surging jobless claims have caused our economy to recede and jeopardized the financial security of thousands of working families it is therefore imperative that we quickly pass another economic stimulus package that will aid those hardworking american families struggling to make ends meet in these tough economic times

2004675 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2004691 f r e e that spells free creditreport com baby saw their ads on my tv thought about going but was too lazy
2004692 its what i call a protection racket the companies are charging you a fee and theyre making a promise that its going to improve your credit and protect against identity theft but in fact it does neither
2004693 the sites are designed to trick people into taking on overpriced useless credit monitoring and they do so by attempting to make it appear as if youre going to get something for free
2004694 unfortunately i think the offer is purposefully designed to make it easy for you to get your credit report and then forget that youve just signed up for an in perpetuity fee
2004695 so it goes he e e n nry tin roof rusted

2004697 throughout the year we did see adult medical costs and pharmaceuticals for illegal immigrants that were in our system the one thing that did run the costs up was the transportation costs to move inmates to other facilities
2004698 we did run a shortfall and were requesting this amount to take care of the shortfall
2004699 my future daughter in law took a job at a dental office in woodbridge that accepts medicaid patients most of their patients are latinos that are on medicaid they get free dental services crowns plates fillings etc all at our expense and that kind of work is not cheap either what costs us thousands they get for free something is wrong with this picture
2004700 perhaps we should consider taxing foreign remittances to offset the costs of incarcerating illegal aliens
2004701 the first day you were before me i thought i made it clear to you that this court comes first in everything
2004702 i do understand that youre under pressure but i have to look at how the system should be run and perceived by the public
2004703 it is based on little or no legitimate information to make such a judgment
2004704 it would be very similar to me putting on the internet
2004705 id appreciate if you think that something like that is happening well be glad to tell you
2004706 theres no point in trying to keep him happy because nothing will so i might as well just write what i like
2004707 a guy practicing with the first team doesnt mean hes on the first team
2004708 hey we dont really think about things in terms of depth charts around here
2004709 reporters the season starts in a couple weeks but dont write or speculate on who our starting players are

2004713 we really liked the song he did young folks he uses space and rhythm to create something thats very cinematic its like roxy music a sexy expensive sound
2004714 when we make more experimental albums people say we are too frightened of success and ask why dont we write another movin on up or country girl and then if we make something more classic people say we are too retro
2004715 you need the courage to put your ideas out into the world you can get too self conscious its easy to wait years between albums to get the perfect album all you do is write three good songs a year and then wait five years to put out a complete album that everyone says is great but it must be boring for the fans and boring for the band i just want a great working band being on stage is what we were born to do
2004716 i like glamour and sex in rock n roll it all goes together
2004717 i dont want to slag some bands off but if you look at the biggest selling band in the world right now you can just see they are squares and who buys the records squares the best rock n roll is made by outcasts that is the kind of people i love and admire and am drawn to
2004718 people dont do drugs for a while and then give them up like they did in the 60s and the 70s now people are just shutting down and self medicating

2004722 election ballot titles should be neutral and not intentionally prejudice voters
2004723 the ballot title is argumentative and not impartial the ags job is to apply the law in a way thats fair to all californians not in a way that influences elections we will immediately appeal the ruling because the purpose of this amendment is to protect marriage broadly as the union of one man and one woman
2004724 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
2004725 there is such a connotation with grandma and i just liked it better
2004726 the san francisco redevelopment agency is seeking a developer to tackle a prime 600 unit residential project at first and folsom streets the first step in a planned 2 600 unit highrise transbay district the city is counting on to help pay for a new transbay rail and bus terminal on sept 8 the agency will issue a request for proposals for block 8 one of a dozen state owned lots freed up when the elevated embarcadero freeway was knocked down after the 1989 loma prieta earthquake while nine of the 12 parcels are set to be eventually redeveloped with housing two will be parks and one a 700 000 square foot office tower block 8 is the boldest it calls for a 550 foot tower reaching above two mid rise affordable apartment buildings and a row of townhouses that will open onto folsom street a thoroughfare that will eventually be reconfigured as a retail mecca with wide sidewalks greenery and outdoor seating
2004727 its a tough deal for a whole bunch of reasons
2004728 construction costs are very high condo prices and the rate of absorption are off and then you roll in the increased affordability probably around 25 percent and you really have to do some hard math
2004729 how can you possibly say that do you know anything about editorial process
2004730 everything in the world may be endured except continued prosperity
2004731 the word schadenfreude comes up a lot and is typically used against bears by people who have no conception of how bad bubbles are for economies and societies
2004732 what have i told you about taking things from the baby

2004740 following an attack iran could quickly rebuild its centrifuge program in small easily hidden facilities focused on making weapon grade uranium for nuclear weapons
2004741 without that knowledge an attack is unlikely to significantly delay irans mastery of enrichment with gas centrifuges
2004742 iran would likely launch a crash program to quickly obtain nuclear weapons
2004743 an attack would likely leave iran angry more nationalistic fed up with international inspectors and nonproliferation treaties and more determined than ever to obtain nuclear weapons
2004744 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
2004745 dailey says not his role to determine if crimes occurred
2004746 more fully explain what i intended to be the meaning of my remarks
2004747 however this does not mean that matters under investigation do not constitute criminal acts only that i am not seeking evidence of criminal acts but instead evidence of fraud on the court
2004748 the finding whether criminal activity has occurred is and should be left to judge michael peyton of henry county before whom a petition for special prosecutor has been filed by mayor sharon mcshurleys administration or any other court that has appropriate jurisdiction to consider such matters
2004749 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
2004750 the police said we will first inquire whether adeel has committed suicide because the culprits told the police about the fact that their daughter wanted to embrace christianity because of adeel
2004751 in this way the police were biased and lingered on the matter because if there is a long delay in the lodging of a first incidence report the case becomes weak

2004789 a wide gap has developed between what is understood about global warming by the relevant scientific community and what is known by policymakers and the public frank assessment of scientific data yields conclusions that are shocking to the body politic i can assert that these conclusions have a certainty exceeding 99 percent we have used up all slack in the schedule for actions needed to defuse the global warming time bomb action is needed now otherwise it will become impractical to constrain atmospheric carbon dioxide the greenhouse gas produced in burning fossil fuels to a level that prevents the climate system from passing tipping points that lead to disastrous climate changes that spiral dynamically out of humanitys control changes needed to preserve creation the planet on which civilization developed are clear but the changes have been blocked by special interests focused on short term profits who hold sway in washington and other capitals hansen argues that a path yielding energy independence and a healthier environment is barely still possible it requires a transformative change of direction in washington in the next year

2004793 people of the world look at berlin where a wall came down and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one

2004862 the hour is coming and is now here when the dead will hear the voice of the son of god and those who hear will live
2004863 the hour is coming but by implication is not already here when all who are in their graves will hear his voice and will come out
2004864 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
2004865 it is easy enough in a nation to generate contempt for its ancient customs no man has ever tried to do so without reaching his goal but for replacing the conditions you have ruined with better ones many who have tried to do that have come to grief
2004866 information inaccessible to bureaucrats is in millions of mayfly judgements and for hayek the sum of all this was price forget please the neo liberalism that ensues just hold in your mind the impossibility of a sufficiently responsive planner achieving an equivalent optimum

2004869 observed that the market is well supplied with current commercial oil stocks standing above their five year average the conference further noted with concern that the current price environment does not reflect market fundamentals as crude oil prices are being strongly influenced by the weakness in the us dollar rising inflation and significant flow of funds into the commodities market
2004870 offer real solutions to the energy crisis not gimmicks like drilling
2004871 rather than more drilling we need a massive program to switch to affordable clean alternative energy sources and end our dependence on oil
2004872 america must commit to producing 100 of our electricity from cheap clean renewable energy sources like solar and wind within 10 years
2004873 the iraqi people the resistance and oil versus american bases
2004874 the va veteran affairs department estimates that every year 6 500 veterans take their own lives
2004875 we all agree in one way or another to change the way we do business to be able to come together in this historic agreement
2004876 i got my money through economic growth now everybody else can eat cake
2004877 strange and weird stuff can happen from citizen initiated referenda but at least its not driven by campaign contributions and in many circumstances
2004878 all car insurance companies must cut their rates by 10
2004879 planning grants and planning incentives for the development of regional and local land use plans that are designed to promote water conservation reduce automobile use and fuel consumption encourage greater infill and compact development protect natural resources and agricultural lands and revitalize urban and community centers
2004880 yes strange and weird stuff can happen from citizen initiated referenda but at least its not driven by campaign contributions and in many circumstances
2004881 but what it does do is give ordinary citizens the ability to directly counter legislative actions
2004882 obviously the real deal of the rail proposal huge density read for the tysons billionaires infrastructure paid for by others is becoming apparent tysons at 3 sq miles is the size of lower manhattan which requires 57 subway stops to service

2004888 countrywide had 94 000 foreclosures last year by comparison ing has had just 15 out of 100 000 in its eight year history as a mortgage lender so whats the online banks secret unlike other lenders who have sliced diced and sold off their loans to wall street ing has kept all 26 billion of its loans on its books says arkadi kuhlmann ceo of ing direct many banks resell their mortgages and with no skin in the game underwriting standards suffer
2004889 ing dodges subprime only 15 foreclosures for the bank since 2000

2004892 we wanted to come up with a solution that protected an adequate number of sage grouse without shutting down the state development wise there was a lot of good give and take and overall we came up with a core area strategy its a solid concept
2004893 you cant give anyone freedom anymore than you can give him an education both have to be seized by his own effort
2004894 personally i think for democracy to exist opposition is key
2004895 the only thing worse than having no taste is having no shame

2004897 fat drunk and stupid is no way to go through life son
2004898 ive seen a look in dogs eyes a quickly vanishing look of amazed contempt and i am convinced that basically dogs think humans are nuts
2004899 you cannot even begin to live the dream god has for you until you stop caring about only yourself and the smaller your span of concern the smaller your dream will be and the smaller your life will become
2004900 wouldnt it be wonderful if when we saw a problem we assumed we were to be part of the solution
2004901 now i know some of us love spiritualizing things as in well god will solve the problem but god rarely solves the problem with people who just say if god wants it solved hell do it instead he seems to solve the problem with people who dont give up have you ever noticed that
2004902 the way god changes your life is by changing you
2004903 i think a lot of us are not on a path were in a rut
2004904 what can happen is that the things god has blessed us with become an anchor that keeps us grounded ashore rather than launching us out into his dream for us
2004905 of course there is uncertainty in the future guess what were all uncertain about the future thats not the uncertainty that paralyzes you its uncertainty about who you are that blurs you uncertainty about why you are here or what really matters
2004906 jesus is driving the point that there are things we must get done before he comes for which he will hold us accountable we must not show up empty handed
2004907 are you living as if its gods responsibility to make sure you have oil for your lamp maybe youre spiritualizing your lack of preparation if god wants it to happen it will happen or im just waiting on god when we fail when we blow it when we fall short because we were unprepared for an opportunity we blow it off and say well that must have been the lords will thats a christianized way of blaming god for our own problems there are some opportunities you were intended to have that you may not even see much less seize because you didnt prepare yourself for the future opportunity
2004908 im not in kansas city but if youre new to the city and looking for things to do might be a useful place to look into stuff

2004913 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
2004914 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning

2004917 shouldnt the nuns do this of course some of the nuns are singing but surely they must have time to do things other than sing
2004918 i think hes crazy to call a press conference on a lawsuit claiming credit for something he didnt do
2004919 we find it perplexing attorney general hood would claim full credit for a process he opposed from day one and was the foundation for his lawsuit against us which he now has settled
2004920 nonetheless we are pleased the attorney general understands state farm has met its obligations under the agreement made with his office in january 2007
2004921 we filed this lawsuit in an effort to help the more than 30 000 gulf coast policyholders who have suffered for nearly two years because of state farm s inaction said attorney general jim hood
2004922 the state farm reevaluation procedure through the department of insurance has only resulted in a little more than 300 new offers that does not comply with the terms we have with them in black and white we have a state court order that they signed and then backed out
2004923 it is better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open ones mouth and remove all doubt
2004924 hood is good hood is great when it comes to self promotion hoods never late
2004925 all you have is speculation mere speculation nothing more that speculation do you actually think the judge would dismiss this case if he didn t think that state farm had proven their case on the other hand it looks as though hood did prove to the court that state farm has not lived up to their legal obligations
2004926 the state farm reevaluation procedure through the department of insurance has only resulted in a little more than 300 new offers that does not comply with the terms we have with them in black and white we have a state court order that they signed and then backed out
2004927 in every society the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality
2004928 xerac would you care to cite some facts with your allegations you talk the talk but can you walk the walk or do you just carry water wait was hood bought by scruggs but scruggs had to pay someone to influence hood do you even know what youre talking about hellooo
2004929 dickie scruggs currently facing federal judicial bribery charges in mississippi scruggs also gave 300 000 to the democratic attorneys general association
2004930 what incentive does state farm have not pay claims that it owes
2004931 a trailer lawyer cant come to no harm less he parks his trailer in the middle of a snake farm
2004932 im not trying to pick a fight with him but somebody somewhere has got to say you cant keep trashing folks when its not true
2004933 we step forward three steps and he puts us back five steps
2004934 how long are we going to pretend that china is the only country on earth with a dodgy human rights record
2004935 i am neither geek nor nerd i am not a hacker a phreaker a programmer or any variety of technoid dweeb
2004936 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work
2004937 it is only a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away
2004938 unlike the case of venezuela in ecuador its individuals in the government who support the farc its not the policy of the armed forces
2004939 its when you get to the political level its very difficult
2004940 that we do not want them to enter our national territory that that is a colombian conflict our call is for peace dialogue for them to abandon arms and the liberation of the kidnapped
2004941 the colombian conflict is moving toward the south and hence toward northern ecuador
2004942 the colombian state does not control its border and so drug trafficking and the guerrillas pass over
2004943 they can see us but its not prudent for them to attack us they dont want problems with the ecuadoran army
2004944 this is like a vacation spot for the guerrillas they have doctors and clinics they come here to be treated they rest they manufacture their supplies
2004945 given the heavy responsibility they shoulder media persons especially reporters should encounter adversities with broad minds
2004946 since the media have become an integral part of human life thats why we are in need of competent dynamic and well known reporters
2004947 we should be well aware of modern requirements in the field and thats for the same reason that holding scientific educational course is essential
2004948 believes that it is not only time to act on my future but for the future of everyone in this nation
2004949 looking through a completed lens you would see what the display is generating superimposed on the world outside
2004950 this is a very small step toward that goal but i think its extremely promising
2004951 people may find all sorts of applications for it that we have not thought about our goal is to demonstrate the basic technology and make sure it works and that its safe
2004952 there is a large area outside of the transparent part of the eye that we can use for placing instrumentation

2004958 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
2004959 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
2004960 the u s has been ready and is now geared up we are very actively on our way we hope we can be in a position to send the legislation to congress in early september
2004961 we will support nothing with india in the nsg that is in contradiction to the hyde act it will have to be completely consistent with the obligations of the hyde act
2004962 does not have conditions attached to it by the nsg
2004963 it is the 123 agreement and its provisions that indicate the obligations of both sides the 123 agreement clearly over rides the hyde act and this position would be clear to anyone who goes through the provisions
2004964 corrective measures to ensure uninterrupted operation of its civilian nuclear reactors in the event of disruption of foreign fuel supplies
2004965 this work has given us a better understanding of the part of the brain that regulates appetite our bodies send complex chemical signals to our brains which interpret them and send back responses in this case eat or dont eat our research indicated that mic 1 is a previously unrecognised molecule sending a dont eat signal to the brain
2004966 injecting mice with mic 1 protein also made them stop eating suggesting that it may be possible to use this to advantage for treating patients with severe obesity
2004967 when i was small i always wanted a little girl
2004968 baby boomers my mother imparted that gem to me when i was 8 i wonder how the grass would have been so incredibly greener on the other side
2004969 it is clear that our health care system isnt giving americans the health care they need and deserve
2004970 the disorganization and inefficiency are affecting americans in their everyday lives and its obvious that people are looking for reform with the upcoming election there is great opportunity for our leaders to hear what the american people are saying they want from a health care system and to respond with meaningful proposals
2004971 it is unlikely a running mate will be selected before the candidate returns from a weeks holiday in hawaii which starts this friday that leaves about 10 days until the start of the democratic party convention in denver

2005027 not the rays gm we havent always been so negative we have what could be
2005028 the survey results come as obama fresh off what had been characterized as a triumphant tour of the middle east and europe including a speech to 200 000 germans in berlin that trip quickly became fodder for an aggressive response ad by the mccain campaign that questioned whether obamas popularity around the world meant he was ready to lead the u s
2005029 the mccain camp seems to have turned lemons into lemonade huge crowds and mostly favorable press reviews of obamas overseas trip have been trumped by mccains attacks on obama

2005032 finding perchlorates is neither good nor bad for life but it does make us reassess how we think about life on mars
2005033 because different types of perchlorate salts have interesting properties that may bear on the way things work on mars if and thats a big if the results from our two teaspoons of soil are representative of all of mars or at least a significant portion of the planet
2005034 the phoenix project has decided to take an unusual step
2005035 we decided to show the public science in action because of the extreme interest in the phoenix mission which is searching for a habitable environment on the northern plains of mars
2005036 right now we dont know whether finding perchlorate is good news or bad news for possible life on mars
2005037 had we seen it the identification of perchlorate would be absolutely clear but in this run we did not see any chlorine gas we may have been analyzing a perchlorate salt that doesnt release chlorine gas upon heating
2005038 theres nothing in the tega data that contradicts mecas finding of perchlorates
2005039 we were shocked to see the recent ads run by the nikki tinker for congress campaign we believe the ads are offensive and divisive

2005061 was that on the district server how do you handle harassment
2005062 why is it that a 27 year old heiress reality show star can read a teleprompter better than the presumptive republican presidential nominee
2005063 it is more important to sound good than to be good and you sound marvelous
2005064 even though im paris hilton im not a total moron
2005065 john mccain mentioned me in a campaign ad so i must be running for president
2005066 id just like to thank yall the liberals and conservatives both for sharing your differing opinions in a very measured and matter of fact way rather than turning this into one of those
2005067 it would take at least a decade for oil companies to obtain permits procure equipment and do the exploration necessary to get the oil out of the ground most industry analysts say and even then they add the amount of new oil produced would probably be too small to significantly affect world oil prices

2005071 we are just under 90 days from election day and im sure youve seen the news reports that this race is now in a dead heat mccain tells supporters today
2005072 our campaign continues to build momentum thanks to your incredible support and hard work
2005073 obama fatigue among voters tired of hearing the name but also an overall summer fatigue with the election campaign underway that may not be a bad thing
2005074 considering it was probably built for more than that in 1930 during the beginning stages of the real great depression i highly doubt it
2005075 im going to buy this house with all sorts of gold on the cheap in the future and im real doggone smart and stuff
2005076 your hypothetical future acquisition mode is only after an epic crash satchel dont pretend you dont just say stuff for fun sometimes

2005078 dont pretend you dont just say stuff for fun sometimes im going to buy this house with all sorts of gold on the cheap in the future and im real doggone smart and stuff please

2005080 i would answer back hard what do you mean obamas not one of us its john mccain who wears 500 shoes has six houses and comes from one of the richest families in his state its barack obama who climbed up the hard way and thats why he wants middle class tax cuts and better schools for our kids

2005085 charm offensive how chinas soft power is transforming the world
2005086 ironically the belief that the united states does not take into account the interests of other countries in formulating its foreign policy is extensive among the publics of several close u s allies no fewer than 89 of the french 83 of canadians and 74 of the british express this opinion
2005087 nobody should be suprised that there is a gap between how you see yourself and how other people see you
2005088 why should the chinese be concerned about how they are perceived overseas
2005089 the american people do not want government to solve all our problems we know that personal responsibility character imagination diligence hard work and faith ultimately determine individual achievement

2005101 what if we thought they were the most miserable couple in the world
2005102 and we had walked in on them laughing with each other and pretty much doing the opposite of what they did today would you automatically assume they were secretly the happiest couple in the world and just wanted everyone to assume they hated each other
2005103 it is certainly true that not all muslims are terrorists
2005104 however the majority of terrorists in the world are muslims
2005105 osama bin laden is a muslim and most of those who carried out suicide attacks against buses schools houses buildings all over the world in the past 10 years also were muslims what a terrible record doesnt that say something to us about ourselves our societies and our culture
2005106 what do they call it multi culti its all absurd you know
2005107 if ignorance and poverty are responsible for the growth of extremist views in the islamic world someone needs to ask muslim students privileged enough and bright enough to attend some of the united kingdoms best universities why one in three of them endorses killing in the name of islam

2005112 the apes are jews the people of the sabbath while the swine are christians the infidels of the communion of jesus
2005113 fighting infidels until they either convert to islam or submit to muslims as dhimmis is still considered by islamists to be a religious duty
2005114 the militants believe that controlling one country will rally the muslim masses enabling them to overthrow all moderate governments in the region and establish a radical islamic empire that spans from spain to indonesia
2005115 iraq would serve as the base of a new islamic caliphate to extend throughout the middle east and which would threaten
2005116 we are saluting to the spirit of our hero shahid

2005118 death is better than living on this earth with the unbelievers among us
2005119 there will be continuing enmity until everyone believes in allah we will not meet the enemy halfway and there will be no room for dialogue with them
2005120 islam does not coincide or make a truce with unbelief but rather confronts it the confrontation that islam calls for with these godless and apostate regimes does not know socratic debates platonic ideals nor aristotelian diplomacy but it knows the dialogue of bullets the ideals of assassination bombing and destruction and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine gun

2005122 i want to apologize for the interview that i did the other day where you asked me what was going on and i couldnt give you the answers now you can see there is an answer to what the questions were last week weve got brett favre as a new member of the jets we went through this process for the same reason weve been running the team all along with mike tannenbaum and eric mangini to try to improve this team each and every year i just want to say it was difficult with chad pennington because chad came at the same time i did and we owe chad a lot of gratitude for the dedication for his dogged team oriented persistence even in light of all the adversity that we had in some years he was always concentrated and always a good teammate so thanks to chad today were here to talk about what were going to be doing going forward so id like to toss it over to mike and he can describe what has happened the last 24 hours
2005123 thanks woody i dont have much more to add since the last time we spoke i dont know if weve gotten a chance to sleep since that time it is a bittersweet moment we have released chad i have spoken to him eric has spoken to him and mr johnson has spoken to him and again on the record i have all the respect in the world for chad and what hes done on the field as well as off the field hes a good player and a great person hes done a lot of great things for our organization and i wish him nothing but the best fundamentally the decision was made between eric myself and mr johnson from a standpoint that if this opportunity presented itself we felt we were getting good play at the quarterback position we felt this was a good opportunity to improve that and thats why we went ahead and made the decision we did a luminous amount of research on brett as a player but also as a person and making sure we thought he could fit in the locker room we were extremely comfortable not just with what he did on the field but as importantly what he did off the field and what he stands for we are happy we are excited were really glad hes a member of this team i can say on brett favres behalf that i think were all looking forward to getting past this stuff and going out there and playing some football
2005124 thanks mike and mr johnson the last 24 hours have been crazy really the last three weeks and this whole offseason has been bizarre or whatever you want to call it but it is what it is i am a member of the jets i am excited about it im excited about the opportunity and no one works as hard as this man right here mike tannenbaum i was told by numerous people to at least talk to mike over the last month and as i told him today the only reason that i wouldnt talk to him up until 24 hours ago was because i knew how id be convinced once i talked to him did i ever think this scenario would present itself no am i excited about the opportunity yes ive had a great career in green bay that goes without saying the things that have happened there this offseason in my opinion are over and done with i wish them well i will use their moving forward i hope that i play at the level that ive always played at theres no guarantees theres never been any guarantees for me the game of football is just that and anything can happen but ill bring the leadership and durability im a little bit out of shape compared to all the other guys but im so excited about this opportunity and ill tell you my family and everyone involved has just been treated unbelievably by this organization ive never looked forward to doing a conditioning test as much as i have at this point joking im so tired of doing interviews and talking about this or talking about that tomorrow hopefully the mad rush is over and we can get that conditioning test at noon tomorrow im looking forward to that joking and we go on the most important thing in this whole process is the guys in that locker room i know some of these guys by name bubba franks i played with and know personally but i really dont know these guys and they dont know me i think when they get to know me theyll like me and theyll like the way i play and theyll figure out that ill do whatever it takes to win and its about the team i hope after today and tomorrow that the distractions are at a minimum its ok to have attention as long as its based on this team and im just one man one of 53 so well see what happens and im excited about the opportunity
2005125 i cant answer that for them all i can say is ive always wanted to be a packer i think i always will be a packer sixteen years is hard to forget for everyone and id like to think that those 16 years people will say its the best 16 years ive ever watched it was a lot of fun for me i think it was made clear this offseason that they were moving forward some things happened in between that and thats okay and its time for me to move on i had forgotten that i had been traded 17 or 18 years ago and what that process was like its a little bit different scenario now but im really excited its refreshing not that i needed that i think to the fans i would say continue to be brett favre fans there may be some who say no and for those people maybe they were not die hard brett favre fans to begin with packer fans are packer fans theres a 40 000 or more waiting list for a reason and that will continue its a great tradition im thankful that i was a part of it im not a traitor i never will be its a business and thats the way it works i gave everything i possibly could give while i was there and i dont think people will question that and i hope that the jet fans see the same thing and so i hope i continue to have fans all over thats what we play for
2005126 i hadnt really thought about it im sure it will at some point but you know what they talk about statues they talk about having streets named after you im not just talking about me you hear that throughout sports thats not what its about with me its like records i gained at southern mississippi i look back and my experience there is much more important than the records and when and if that ever happens great i dont need a jersey retired a statue or a street named after me or anything like that for people to remember me for me to feel like ive done something i think the way ive played the way ive handled myself is the most important thing and i think it will be postponed for a while
2005127 ill tell you exactly why the decision or decisions that were made this whole offseason right or wrong i knew i was going to be faced with another tough one whereas if youre dealing with one team the decision is easy james bus cook would say at least talk to him several other people in this room said the same thing talk to him i told bus that if i talk to him that were going to be scratching our heads saying now what do we do i knew i would be convinced jon gruden i tip my hat to him too it was a long time ago when we were working together but he sold me as well theres nothing more to it than that i knew it would make it a real tough decision mike tannenbaum is a worker i woke up this morning and the trigger was pulled
2005128 i was never not interested in the jets i think my interest at first im sure as we all know was to stay within our division maybe that was a little bit of a vindictive nature or competitive nature or whatever i think in the end that was probably the wrong motive and i realized that was not going to happen thats only one or two games a year playing against your old team so you still have a lot more to play it had nothing to do with other teams i look at the talent level and believe me i heard it from mike tannenbaum i was sent everything about the jets you can imagine it was sent to my house and he told me everything i needed to know he was convincing i knew this team had a lot of talent i knew they struggled last year and he went out and worked his tail off i know hes worn out hes relieved now but i know at the end of the season hes going to be more relieved there came a point when i realized my initial thoughts were not going to come true that i had to look elsewhere i havent played in new york im a south mississippi boy mike came to my place today and he saw its a little bit different its a little laid back i know how tough it can be and i know how great it can be in new york city am i ready to face it handle it and deal with it i think so i think its a great opportunity
2005129 you have to dive into it the only way youre going to know these guys know how they play know the coaches is to be in meetings is to go to practice now id be kidding myself if i thought after the second day i wouldnt be walking on eggshells my feet will be hurting shoulder will be hurting all the fun things about camp that is the way you build chemistry to me the most important aspect of winning is chemistry you can have the best players possible but it doesnt guarantee you wins chemistry how you play together and i think the giants are a good example of that they started off shaky last year with the same guys the chemistry got better and they got better were up against the clock i want these guys to know me know what im about how i play what type of leadership i have im not going to call team meetings im not going to rah rah im going to do what i have to do pat guys on my back hug them pick them up off the ground and hope they do the same for me and hope thats enough to win
2005130 thats a good question i think were probably both at fault im not going to sit here and blame it all on one side or the other a lot of things happened this offseason a lot of shocking things i think were both at fault who is at fault more its a matter of opinion but i really think at this point its irrelevant they probably are tired of talking about it i know its great for the media its a great soap opera but ive got a lot of respect for the guys in green bay i said last year and i said the year before that that is was probably the most talented team id ever played on and everybody thought i was crazy i still think the same i think they have as good a chance as anyone in this league of getting back to not only where they were but to the super bowl i had a lot of fun with those guys the coaching staff we had some differences between myself and a couple other people but you know what theres nothing like green bay fans that team is going to be good with or without me and it really serves no purpose to continue talking about it i know people will try to fuel the fire throughout the season but once again im here for one reason and thats to help the jets win i dont think they need to be asked questions about it i hope that they are left alone so they can deal with what they have to deal with the same thing for green bay at some point it has to be let go

2005191 full visible communion as the objective of our dialogue has taken a step backward so that our dialogue will have less defined objectives and therefore its nature will be changed
2005192 though this dialogue can still produce good results it will not be supported by the dynamism that comes from the realistic possibility of the union that christ demands of us or of the common participation at the table of the one lord which we desire so ardently

2005238 the purpose of applicant tracking services is to ensure that all qualified applicants are properly classified and logged in the event that positions become available that are right for their skill sets
2005239 from this perspective applicant tracking services can be effectively used for both the new applicant who wants to come to work for the organization as well as current employees who wish to keep applications on file for the chance to advance within the company
2005240 what this does is create an easy way for a busy human resources department to scan the current bank of applications when a job opening occurs
2005241 qualified applicants can be contacted interviews arranged and hopefully the position can be filled in a short period of time
2005242 the task of applicant tracking can be an involved one especially for corporations that routinely employ hundreds or thousands of people
2005243 overburdened human resource departments may find that the job of keeping up with application data keeps them away from other important matters such as improving employee benefits and working conditions choosing to use outside applicant tracking services can help maintain a balance of important human resource tasks as well as maintain a working roster of potential labor resources for the company

2005344 in areas where there is no csa office these private appointments give parents the opportunity to discuss any issues or concerns about child support face to face with a customer service officer
2005345 the impact of separation can be overwhelming and parents will have many concerns as everyone in the family adjusts to their new circumstances but with the goodwill and cooperation of both parents many families manage the challenges very well
2005346 its important for parents to get access to the support services they need and understand all their options when it comes to child support
2005347 there will be free csa information booklets available about all aspects of separated parenting including maintaining a relationship with kids from a distance and tips and hints for people who are re partnering
2005348 it appears the banks debt will not be paid from the sale of the assets
2005349 the banks will suffer a substantial deficiency and therefore theres no chance of creditors getting a dividend hence shareholders will not have any likelihood of a return
2005350 there are no plans for major structural changes to the business while the sale process is under way
2005351 still hopeful that we could craft a solution that would meet with the approval of the banks
2005352 time was against us despite everyones best efforts we just couldnt get enough of the turnaround happening fast enough
2005353 but we did give it a red hot go i did also say that whilst there were no guarantees of success that you had my 100 per cent commitment and that of the whole executive team that if we didnt get there it wouldnt be from lack of hard work
2005354 a british commuter was thrown on to a railway line after she told two youths to stop smoking on a station platform on wednesday

2005357 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
2005358 the democratic party also strongly supports access to affordable family planning services and comprehensive age appropriate sex education which empowers people to make informed choices and live healthy lives we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions
2005359 well i have a sports column i really should go to the x games
2005360 this morning and yesterday we had some technical issues due to an external attack on the site
2005361 i started having the same problem at around the same time i found that an rss feed that i had setup on my yahoo home page may have been causing the problem i e techbargains com
2005362 this study explores the potential benefit of dietary omega 3 fatty acids in protecting against the development and progression of retinal disease the study gives us a better understanding of the biological processes that lead to retinopathy and how to intervene to prevent or slow disease
2005363 the retina has one of the highest concentrations of omega 3 fatty acids in the body
2005364 given this it is remarkable that with only a two percent change in dietary omega 3 intake we observed an approximate 40 50 percent decrease in retinopathy severity
2005365 our findings represent new evidence suggesting the possibility that omega 3 fatty acids act as protective factors in diseases that affect retinal blood vessels
2005366 this is a major conceptual advance in the effort to identify modifiable factors that may influence inflammatory processes implicated in the development of common sight threatening retinal diseases
2005367 the purpose of our study was to discover and describe the scientific basis for any possible protective role of omega 3 fatty acids against retinopathy
2005368 by identifying the fatty acids lipids and growth factors involved in both the disease and protective processes we hope to translate this work to influence the outcome in patients our study results suggest that increasing omega 3 fatty acid intake in premature infants may significantly decrease the occurrence of rop this changing of lipids by dietary means may also translate to amd and diabetic retinopathy if clinical trials find that supplementing with omega 3 fatty acids is as effective in protecting humans against retinal disease as demonstrated by the findings of this study this cost effective intervention could benefit millions of people
2005369 well the dallas mavericks got beat by the new orleans hornets last night ending their season word is that someone on the team is dating jessica simpson

2005378 things moved so fast and i was always worried i would cut myself
2005379 i never think i shouldnt be here i just think i need to work
2005380 this is a major step forward in our understanding of recognition memory we have been able to show that key processes controlling synaptic communication are also vital in learning and memory
2005381 nerve cells in the perirhinal cortex of the brain are known to be vital for visual recognition memory using a combination of biological techniques and behavioural testing we examined whether the mechanisms involved in synaptic plasticity are also vital for visual recognition memory
2005382 the next step is to try to understand the processes that enable visual memories to be held in our brains for such long periods of time and why these mechanisms begin to break down in old age
2005383 might you consider guest posting for me in august when i have the baby
2005384 to the point where i thought he was a bit rude
2005385 clearly we will confront a challenging business environment in the second half of the year
2005386 while we expect our average selling prices to increase across all product lines in the specialty papers business unit we do not expect pricing to outpace rising input costs

2005394 good luck the rest of the series but today is felix day you can win the next three
2005395 it seems to me as if the number of difficult games as the second of the b 2 bs they would be hard enough on their own has increased this season he says
2005396 at sa home vs orlando at houston and thats just in the first three weeks of the season both of the games at utah are second of b 2 bs and preceded by games against portland new orleans in march preceded by a game at sa it looks pretty hard to me
2005397 we should never despair our situation before has been unpromising and has changed for the better so i trust it will again if new difficulties arise we must only put forth new exertions and proportion our efforts to the exigency of the times
2005398 death is better than living on this earth with the unbelievers among us
2005399 it is the curse of the thinking classes to imagine they can reason even the bloodiest mass murderer into peace
2005400 show me just what mohammed brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached
2005401 only through force and victory over the enemies is there security and repose
2005402 the apes are jews the people of the sabbath while the swine are christians the infidels of the communion of jesus
2005403 fighting infidels until they either convert to islam or submit to muslims as dhimmis is still considered by islamists to be a religious duty
2005404 the militants believe that controlling one country will rally the muslim masses enabling them to overthrow all moderate governments in the region and establish a radical islamic empire that spans from spain to indonesia
2005405 iraq would serve as the base of a new islamic caliphate to extend throughout the middle east and which would threaten
2005406 we are saluting to the spirit of our hero shahid
2005407 we tell them in as much as you love life the muslim loves death and martyrdom palestinians hit a new low setting up a boy unknowingly to become a suicide bomber palestinian children die as human shields for adult terrorist leaders israel tears for palestine child may 21 2006 it was always the case arab muslim leaders have been using abusing their kids as human bombs human shields or as general pawns in their propaganda war to smear israeli defenders
2005408 death is better than living on this earth with the unbelievers among us
2005409 there will be continuing enmity until everyone believes in allah we will not meet the enemy halfway and there will be no room for dialogue with them
2005410 islam does not coincide or make a truce with unbelief but rather confronts it the confrontation that islam calls for with these godless and apostate regimes does not know socratic debates platonic ideals nor aristotelian diplomacy but it knows the dialogue of bullets the ideals of assassination bombing and destruction and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine gun
2005411 most independents dont vote all the time but when they do they tend to really be undecided going into the final days of an election
2005412 many are susceptible to some kind of influence from media coverage and past surveys showed one in six didnt vote the way they said they would a few days earlier so a lot of the answers are still out
2005413 there is danger from all men the only maxim of a free government ought to be to trust no man living with power to endanger the public liberty
2005414 its going to help overall law enforcement in chicago but it really wont free up any more chicago police officers
2005415 this program is going to kill two birds with one stone its going to curb the crime and help save lives on our highways
2005416 the troopers make up one of two teams that normally roam the suburban area targeting gang problems and roads with high fatality rates

2005425 the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest

2005431 in fact the csa has 8853 separated parents registered within rosebud and surrounding areas
2005432 in areas where there is no csa office these private appointments give parents the opportunity to discuss any issues or concerns about child support face to face with a customer service officer

2005435 there will be free csa information booklets available about all aspects of separated parenting including maintaining a relationship with kids from a distance and tips and hints for people who are re partnering
2005436 the data is consistent only with that teeny tiny sliver of possible worlds of natural evolution
2005437 any world where evolution occurs in accordance with the natural laws of that world whatever they may be
2005438 i asked for a reason and they said we dont give reasons
2005439 im not surprised they did this because they said they were going to keep out activists id sure like to know what the ioc has to say about this i think its really disappointing
2005440 i was going there to support athletes and be part of the olympics i thought i was a permanent member of the olympic body the olympic alumni associations tagline is once an olympian always an olympian youre never supposed to be a former olympian
2005441 i am saddened not to be able to attend the games the olympic games represent something powerful that people can come together from around the world and do things that no one thought were possible however the denial of my visa is a part of a systemic effort by the chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of darfur
2005442 this is the most exciting day ever in my life its a great honor for me that my teammates chose to vote for me im here as an ambassador of my country and i will do everything i can to represent my country well
2005443 new york how mud wallowingly deep may a multi millionaire us presidential campaign go way deep deeper and deeper and this is only early august
2005444 should this be the case internships will be immediately available with the strong potential of earning a job in mikes congressional office
2005445 mike has said he will give first priority to those who work hard with him in the trenches and now is your chance to show him what youve got
2005446 there is no question that the operating environment that we are working within has deteriorated at a more rapid rate than we anticipated at the half
2005447 we are seeing the impact of higher interest rates higher oil prices rising food prices on consumer discretionary spending and this is reflected in lower consumer confidence weaker retail sales and softer business expectations
2005448 however indications are that the industry is moving from single name exposures to a cyclical deterioration and higher bad debts
2005449 so we dont see that cash flows in the commercial property sector are seriously under threat
2005450 it doesnt matter how he hurts you with his hands or with his words you dont deserve it it aint worth it take your heart and run
2005451 i dont want to talk about it but i have definitely experienced abuse in a way that i would tell people to take their heart and run
2005452 right now the type of voter whos paying attention is primed to support john mccain after the conventions when younger voters typically tune in and by younger here i mean under 55 or so then obamas margins will widen because these folks are his folks
2005453 big tent democrat makes it clear obama should not pick clinton
2005454 can you imagine if that was one of my parents in the rubble
2005455 hey do you have any relatives who were caught in the earthquake
2005456 wow were going to put our our own errata podcast for this one
2005457 and because it winds itself up to the forest canopy and spreads it can cover as much canopy area as a community of trees
2005458 it appears to be true that lianas grow more rapidly at higher levels of c0 2
2005459 but there could be other explanations for the increase in lianas too weather could be a factor
2005460 if lianas can grow far more than trees during seasonal droughts then global increases in drought from such events as el ni o or la ni a may be responsible for the documented increases in liana abundance
2005461 if you cant figure out whats going on in the ecological system then look at the oddball the deviant something that doesnt fit the model
2005462 they asked me to form a search committee to look for someone to challenge the incumbent pat welch little did i know it was me they wanted us to find
2005463 the night we won the election the party was a lot of fun
2005464 i heard that complaint over and over when i was talking to people throughout the district some folks said they wouldnt know their senator if he walked into the room
2005465 i determined right then that if i got elected i wouldnt be that kind of senator ive made it a priority to take care of the people of this district and let them know im very interested in hearing from them
2005466 right before the trucking license fee increase was passed by the democrats and signed into law by the governor several of us business owners went to visit welch in springfield he assured us he wouldnt balance the budget on the backs of businesses
2005467 it was how they did it we had already bought our licenses for the year and then we were told to come up with an additional 1000 per each truck after we were already well into the year that just added to the problem
2005468 id said in an article years before that i didnt buy the highest priced tires for our trucks and the democrats twisted that into saying i bought cheap and dangerous equipment for our employees
2005469 it was d amp d employees that stepped forward to defend themselves by placing a full page ad in the local paper confirming i cared about our employees and kept our equipment in good shape the democrats lost all credibility with the voters anyone who knew our employees knew things were just the opposite
2005470 this would be a great job if i didnt have to go to springfield i love working with the people of this district being down at the capitol is frustrating
2005471 senator dahl was one of the urfs highest scoring conservative senators in 2007
2005472 hes exactly the kind of limited government individual rights free market and traditional values supporting lawmaker we need more of in the illinois
2005473 were pleased that senator dahls one of this years eight in 08 candidates one who deserves the support of conservatives for the terrific work hes done over the past four years in the illinois general assembly
2005474 barack obama has an ad accusing john mccain of being
2005475 mccain leads the money race with nearly every other top giver in the oil and gas industry though koch industries valero marathon oil occidental petroleum conocophillips the list goes on you can see detail on all these companies in the spreadsheet linked below mccain also has a big edge with hess corp 91 000 to obamas 8 000 which has gotten some attention and overall mccains campaign has gotten three times more money from the industry than obamas has 1 3 million compared to about 394 000
2005476 gist wasnt going to get any minutes with us anyways behind mahinmi and kurt thomas lets let him go overseas and see if hes a real player and if so we can sign him to replace old man thomas
2005477 there is almost certainly some form of contingency to work with when it comes time to decide if we shell out for him
2005478 no man im just getting some air i cant sleep
2005479 allowing and or encouraging people to inject heroin into their veins is not harm reduction it is the opposite we believe it is a form of harm addition
2005480 it appears the mets no longer have their hopes up that ryan church will return this season
2005481 its very foreign to all of us and we just arent sure as to where it could go and historically it hasnt gone in our direction weve been going through this i dont know how long two months whatever but if it does turn out to be something favorable for us it would be very very welcome
2005482 our long term goal should be to alter our lifestyle accordingly beginning in infancy or early childhood
2005483 instituting a low saturated fat low cholesterol diet in infancy is perfectly safe without adverse effects
2005484 our review of the literature convinces us that more aggressive and earlier intervention will probably prevent considerably more than 30 percent of chd
2005485 studies show that fatty streak lesions in the arteries that are a precursor to atherosclerosis and heart disease begin in childhood and advanced lesions are not uncommon by age 30
2005486 why not nip things in the bud such early signs of heart disease should be taken as seriously as early signs of cancer or diabetes
2005487 i know that sounds really ambiguous but i dont put a lot of stock in big master plans ultimately if we can build something that people enjoy using then weve already achieved a great deal and thats the kind of thing that takes a long time and a lot of hard work
2005488 moomai is simply a digitization of this phenomenon wrapped in candy colored interfaces and humorous prose
2005489 so i can see how different groups of people respond to it once were satisfied that the engine works as advertised we will move into open beta at the same time well throw up facebook opensocial and maybe friendster widgets that people can use on whichever social network theyre already on
2005490 the reason is this its challenging to come up with a profitable idea and its challenging to come up with an innovative idea its even more difficult to come up with an idea that is both profitable and innovative at the same time with moomai ive essentially decided that id like to try to be innovative first well worry about profitability later when we receive our 100 000th signup or when our server bills start to hurt whichever comes first i know that sounds like im being facetious but i think people underestimate how volatile this industry really is when they ask questions about revenue models having a solid revenue model planned out is only useful if you can see into the future and know what your audience will respond to this will never work for experimental products like moomai because we dont even know where this website is headed let alone how we will make any money from it i personally believe that the trick is to keep your company as agile as possible so that you can pull big 180s within a small radius i certainly dont profess to see the future but id like to think that i can respond quickly once its staring me in the face
2005491 it simply cuts to the core of his credibility he spends a lifetime advocating for banking deregulation and then wants to tell people in ohio how hes gonna help fix the mortgage crisis people simply dont buy it
2005492 sales of new homes in san francisco which almost exclusively means condos since little else is built here rose 18 7 percent from june 2007 to june 2008 according to research firm dataquick information systems the median price however fell 32 5 percent during that time to 399 000
2005493 with 9 to go on a building that is not even finished is pretty amazing
2005494 more than 225 condos have closed escrow in the 365 unit first phase the cloverleaf shaped glass tower at folsom and spear streets said carl shannon managing director for developer tishman speyer more than half of the remaining condos are in contract
2005495 buyers at one rincon hill the 64 story building that soars above the western approach to the bay bridge have completed the sale of 192 units in its 376 unit first phase said garrett chan vice president of sales with pacific marketing associates inc which markets that building nearly all the rest are in contract and theyve been closing at a rate of around 40 units per month project spokesman spencer moore said
2005496 and all this sturm und drang about infinity tower 2 is kind of laughable
2005497 san diego is derived from a german term for a whale s vagina
2005498 good hope we see a lot of felix the cat jones
2005499 i think we could have avoided at least some of this if we had agreed to do the town hall meetings
2005500 when i shook him by the hand there was death
2005501 beijing promised to suspend its usual programme of monitoring which slows down the internet and call off the tens of thousands of spooks blocking emails monitoring websites and reporting back to superiors
2005502 this program helps internet users in china to access the internet faster and more stably many users report that freegate makes visiting overseas websites just as fast as visiting local ones a unique encryption and compression algorithm is implemented to secure and optimize users online activities
2005503 once we have gained the confidence of the people weve got more chance of doing more things
2005504 we may be able to do some things we believe we need to do perhaps go through a discussion document process you wouldnt be able to do them straight off
2005505 financial crises happen when lending slows down significantly in financial markets the problem usually is a lack of credible borrowers this is precisely the time that borrowers such as governments funding infrastructure need to step up to the plate governments need to spend more and borrow more precisely when the private sector is spending less and borrowing less this was the most important lesson of the great depression in the 1930s
2005506 i assume she will suffer a nervous breakdown which may even see her go completely bonkers like margaret thatcher
2005507 the main character was worried about money has there been a time in your life when youve worried about money
2005508 the defense attorney in a baltimore murder trial is accused of visiting the prosecutions main witness in jail over the weekend and trying to convince him to change his story allegedly by asking him

2005510 rookies are fine and dandy and im glad to see them progressing
2005511 but i dont fall in love with rookies youre better to fall in love with a stripper than a rookie because theyll break your heart they really will we will give them some time and let them prove themselves if they are worthy of it
2005512 he has to become a more disciplined quarterback and not risk as much as he risked in the game
2005513 i sat up a little and gaze out through the saltwater spray that covered the windows at the distant line of the shore the familiar well loved beach zoomed closer and closer like a movie sped up
2005514 youre feral and we dont have such a good reputation among your kind its totally understandable
2005515 would you like to come over to my place tonight its warm and ive got plenty of food you could take a warm bath if you want
2005516 we must work together to protect the environment and help people in the developing world continue to be candid about our belief that all people should have the freedom to say what they think and worship as they choose the president said at the embassy ceremony

2005519 barbara and i always welcome the chance we have to come back to china
2005520 n the 34 years since i first came to china change has been one of the constants he said
2005521 barbara and i studied an hour a day five days a week but to be honest one of the great challenges were these chinese lessons that she and i took together he said
2005522 she simply refused to follow the very sacred no laughing rule as i spoke i was soon hoping that she would transfer out of my class
2005523 it means the most to us to be here with our family the former president said
2005524 that includes our daughter doro who was baptized here and that includes certainly our president and first lady includes our son marvin who is here with us today and his wife margaret and everyone here
2005525 thank you mr president it is quite an honor to be introduced by your dad this has got to be a historic moment father and son two presidents opening up an embassy i suspect its the first although i must confess i havent done a lot of research into the itinerary of the adams boys
2005526 im honored to represent the united states at the opening ceremonies of the olympic games here in beijing said bush who repeatedly has refused to politicize the games saving his criticism for chinese human rights abuses for public speeches elsewhere thailand on this trip and in private meetings with chinese leaders in beiging
2005527 im looking forward to cheering our athletes on said the president who will attend the mens basketball game between the u
2005528 im not making any predictions about medal counts but i can tell you the u s athletes are ready to come and compete in the spirit of friendship
2005529 tonight the olympic torch will light the home of an ancient civilization with a grand history he said
2005530 thousands of years ago the chinese people developed a common language and unified a great nation
2005531 today the united states and china have built a strong relationship rooted in common interests china has opened its economy and begun to unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of its people america will continue to support china on the path toward a free economy
2005532 were also cooperating to fight pandemic diseases and respond to natural disasters and through the six party talks were working together to ensure that the korean peninsula is free of nuclear weapons
2005533 the relationship between our nations is constructive and cooperative and candid
2005534 warranties are nice but what id really like is a quality product
2005535 im thinking theyre bettign that the majority of people will just buy a new faucet rather than fix it
2005536 not likely also i refer to these folks as quasi vagantes because none of them has ventured to obtain episcopal orders
2005537 if there is not an explanation thats satisfactory acceptable and meets high moral standards the answer is no he would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention
2005538 he absolutely does have to resolve it if its not true he has to issue a stronger denial
2005539 if there is not an explanation thats satisfactory acceptable and meets high moral standards the answer is no he would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention
2005540 i would like to spend a week in lake garda in august
2005541 i was a producer of materiality and i am ashamed of this fact everything i designed was unnecessary
2005542 why dont you devote that substantial talent and media savvy of yours to making stuff thats smarter more sustainable and dare we say it cool in that gotta have it materialistic way you know so well

2005546 in fact the csa has 8997 separated parents registered within seymour and surrounding areas
2005547 in areas where there is no csa office these private appointments give parents the opportunity to discuss any issues or concerns about child support face to face with a customer service officer
2005548 the impact of separation can be overwhelming and parents will have many concerns as everyone in the family adjusts to their new circumstances but with the goodwill and cooperation of both parents many families manage the challenges very well
2005549 its important for parents to get access to the support services they need and understand all their options when it comes to child support
2005550 there will be free csa information booklets available about all aspects of separated parenting including maintaining a relationship with kids from a distance and tips and hints for people who are re partnering

2005552 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
2005553 i think that we are having an important debate about how we keep the country safe i think we are having an important debate about our responsibilities our obligations our interests in the middle east in the wake of the now increasing evidence of success in iraq those are important judgments for the american people to make

2005673 mr president there is no reason for the united states of america to remain in somalia the american people want them home i believe that the majority of congress wants them home and to set an artificial date of march 31 or even february 1st in my view is not acceptable the criteria should be to bring them home as rapidly and safely as possible an evolution which i think could be completed in a matter of weeks mr president our continued military presence in somalia allows another situation to arise which could then lead to the wounding killing or capture of the of american fighting men and women we should do all in our power to avoid that date certain mr president are not the criteria here whats the criteria and what should be the criteria is our immediate orderly withdrawal from somalia but the argument that somehow the united states would suffer a loss to our prestige and our viability as far as the no 1 superpower in the world i think is baloney the fact is what can hurt our prestige mr president ill tell you what can hurt our viability as the worlds superpower and that is if we inmesh ourselves in a drawn out situation which entails the loss of american lives more debaucles like the one we saw with the failed mission to capture aidids lieutenants using american forces and that then will be what hurts our prestige look at the tragedy in beirut mr president 240 young marines lost their lives but we got out now is the time for us to get out of somalia as rapidly and as promptly and as safely as possible

2005677 we can teach older adults to get rid of those old beliefs that becoming sedentary is just a normal part of growing older
2005678 we can teach them that they can and should remain physically active at all ages
2005679 the exciting part is that to our knowledge this attribution retraining component hasnt been tested in a physical activity intervention
2005680 an intervention combining attribution retraining with a weekly exercise class raised walking levels and improved quality of life in sedentary older adults in this small pre post community based pilot study
2005681 attribution retraining deserves further investigation as a potential means of increasing physical activity in sedentary older adults
2005682 because gait speed is easily measured clinically interpretable and potentially modifiable it may be a useful vital sign for older adults
2005683 further research is needed to determine whether interventions to improve gait speed affect survival

2005721 people are struggling with education well if were going to take their retraining away at a time of economic downturn we should tell them
2005722 people are having trouble making ends meet well if their health care is going out the door shouldnt we tell them
2005723 because the interesting people were making comments against the sale tax on the floor
2005724 because if thats the case of course there wouldnt be a public budget you have to level with the public its time to have a budget in public you cant compromise with nothing
2005725 and we want to drive this down the middle we want to get it done we want the people to know what the issues are

2005744 i was apprehensive about taking part because ive always been so guarded in interviews i only ever talk about say an album thats coming out
2005745 but because the programme was in the name of science i thought it would be interesting to revisit the past so many things came out that ive never told other people
2005746 but i dont think ive grown up to be a damaged adult
2005747 she thought a lot of things in music were a race got to be the youngest to record this to record that i never thought that was important were not athletes setting world records music is about the performance
2005748 she thought that if somebody was special then they didnt have to do menial tasks i dont think thats right
2005749 it was a hothouse environment and there was a lot of pressure on me but i think perversely i benefited from it
2005750 kids can be born with potential but unless its encouraged pushed even i dont think it will ever come to fruition
2005751 so my talent definitely came from her if any of it was genetic
2005752 judging from the email its pretty clear that she is not interested in me as a daughter
2005753 but it wasnt that surprising to me i think it was more surprising to the bbc reading the email with me but i grew up with her so i know what shes like
2005754 id always thought life was about mind over matter i thought that about every single thing
2005755 but when you meet a geneticist who tells you that hearing perception is 80 per cent genetic you start to think there are things you arent in control of but i still think its mind over matter in the sense that if youre strong you can combat anything

2006064 americans remain deeply invested in the notion of the authentic self
2006065 people feel profoundly like theyre not living from who they really are their authentic self their deepest possibility in the world the result is a sense of near desperation
2006066 the unimpeded operation of ones true or core self in ones daily enterprise

2006073 community is an outlook toward life in which you define yourself in relation to the world around you rather than only in connection with yourself i recommend enlarging the sense of self
2006074 whether its taking an art class playing basketball running or just hanging out with friends doing something you really enjoy allows you to express who you really are
2006075 feelings of inauthenticity are heightened by a lack of a philosophy that allows failure to be part of life if youre leading a full life youre going to fail some every day

2006091 if it was a white guy instead of obama this would have never occured
2006092 he hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
2006093 this is why its so hard for a black person to run for a public office position such as president i bet the secret service is working over time with obama and it also displays whats still in the heart of america if it was a white guy instead of obama this would have never occured

2006113 and you know what i dont care whether people are packers fans or whatever ill reiterate what we said rooting for favre is like rooting for america i think with brett favre the smile that he still has it must have been the same kid running around in kiln mississippi its still the same kid except hes going to be running around in the meadowlands thrilling everybody and you know what else when he shoves his unit into my mouth its even more thrilling
2006114 the number one sight in football thus far has been brett favre running down the field into the arms of his receivers its wonderful america loves that this team can play brett favre is back this guy has captured america

2006121 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work
2006122 women are all voting for hillary they identify with her especially women of a certain age
2006123 one sunday in 1943 i was hitchhiking through ohio it was my last week end before sailing overseas with the army i remember with an undiminished sense of exhilaration a journey i took along a side road that led to clyde sherwood andersons home town and model for winesburg as i should have anticipated clyde looked much like other american small towns and the few of its people with whom i talked were not particularly interested in sherwood anderson but my pilgrimage nonetheless gave me a sense of satisfaction i could hardly have explained
2006124 sherwood anderson was a minor writer though in a few crucial instances he did first rate perhaps even major work he was a minor writer yet one who ought to be of special interest to americans for in his stories he evoked aspects of our experience those feelings of loneliness yearning and muted love which lie buried beneath the surface of our culture
2006125 you can imagine a fellow who spends his days in offices and his nights in all sorts of hotels looking forward with no little pleasure to a day on a country road among the farmers who buy the things he helps to advertise when that fellow is fortunate enough to have for companion a man who understands the country and is full of love of it and when these two start off at sunrise down a road that follows the winding course of the mississippi and no more to carry than a stout stick for the chance of knocking down nuts from the trees along the road when all of these things work out in this manner i say one fellow is rather bound to have a good day ahead of him
2006126 he is probably a fat man and it is sure he sleeps at night he doesnt always give you a contract and many many times he sends you away without even a promise but there is something more than contracts and promises in this advertising business and sometimes an hour spent with the good fellow will net you a dozen contracts in other places the real good fellow like the real poet is born not made his the pleasant ringing laugh his the cheerful belief in other mens honesty and good intent peace be to him and may his lines forever fall in pleasant places
2006127 he was an old man with a white beard and huge nose and hands long before the time during which we will know his he was a doctor and drove a jaded white horse from house to house through the streets of winesburg later he married a girl who had money she had been left a large fertile farm when her father died the girl was quiet tall and dark and to many people she seemed very beautiful everyone in winesburg wondered why she married the doctor within a year after the marriage she died
2006128 but in our mania for the grand we brush past the fine
2006129 lets go to bath its ten miles away itll only take a couple hours
2006130 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work
2006131 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
2006132 the tension in the anglican communion is being played out in the heart of its leader
2006133 i also want to say that im here in this lambeth conference to support abp rowan williams i know his heart very well that he wants to keep the unity of the anglican communion and hes doing his best to keep this unity and to resolve the issues
2006134 the issue of sexuality important as it is is just a very superficial symptom of much deeper illness and this deeper illness is that we are not united about the essentials of our faith the faith that we received from the saints
2006135 there are friends which i talk with who find it very difficult to say jesus is the way the truth and the life and that is for me a bit disturbing when we talk about the different issues they very much affirm that we should be driven by the culture and by the morals of the culture not driven by the scriptures and i would see here that if we allowed this to happen we would lose our distinctiveness as a church we need to remember that jesus called us to be light in the middle of darkness to be salt to preserve the society and to lose this distinctiveness we lose our christian identity completely
2006136 i also want to respond to one of the things the revisionists say all the time its about faithful relations i dont see any faithful relation between two people whether they are heterosexual or same sex without faithfulness to god so the faithfulness to each other is driven by faithfulness to god and to his word and to be faithful to god is to be faithful to his purpose in creation
2006137 we are a dysfunctional family and we need this covenant to prevent any further crisis in the future but yet our american friends resist this covenant because they dont want anything to tie them with the rest of the body and to make them accountable to the rest of the body of the anglican communion
2006138 after lambeth i want to focus more and more on the mission of the gospel of jesus christ and preach the gospel in deeds and in words to the people in my region who need it badly

2006143 if the escalation of the problem of this bird flu virus increases this handling could rise to the coordinating minister for peoples welfare and involve all parties including the tni and republic of indonesia state police it only remains to organize this in accordance with the interests of the nation we did not see the academic draft from lemhannas that as a compromise
2006144 in any case this was a compromise we agreed to have coordination between the problems of defense and security the only problem was the emphasis especially with the home minister in the context of internal security especially in the order of the smaller tasks including police customs and excise and immigration if the foreign security is in tni
2006145 i was with the 5th marines at hue for two weeks
2006146 they took about 70 dead i photographed the dead and wounded without any restrictions they would not stand for it today they treat you in these embeds like a dog on a leash
2006147 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
2006148 the tension in the anglican communion is being played out in the heart of its leader
2006149 the bible does not address the matter of appropriate behaviour for those who are for whatever reason homosexual by instinct or nature
2006150 by the end of the 80s i had definitely come to the conclusion that scripture was not dealing with the predicament of persons whom we should recognise as homosexual by nature

2006157 its no secret and no small matter that a significant part of the tension in the anglican communion is being played out in the heart of its leader
2006158 even if he formally holds to the churchs teaching that he personally disagrees with one cannot but wonder whether his personal views affect the ways in which he tries to resolve difficulties
2006159 instead of leading the church out of this crisis we feel the archbishop of canterbury is prolonging it because of his personal unhappiness about disciplining a section of the church with which he personally agrees

2006289 chrysler needs new product to fill all the plants that arent producing many vehicles
2006290 a deal would signal a dramatic change in the way

2006322 in fact the csa has 8397 separated parents registered within wonthaggi and surrounding areas
2006323 in areas where there is no csa office these private appointments give parents the opportunity to discuss any issues or concerns about child support face to face with a customer service officer
2006324 the impact of separation can be overwhelming and parents will have many concerns as everyone in the family adjusts to their new circumstances but with the goodwill and cooperation of both parents many families manage the challenges very well
2006325 its important for parents to get access to the support services they need and understand all their options when it comes to child support
2006326 there will be free csa information booklets available about all aspects of separated parenting including maintaining a relationship with kids from a distance and tips and hints for people who are re partnering
2006327 the democrats that control state government are trying to fleece taxpayers out of more money by increasing the income tax
2006328 with families facing a downturn in the economy high energy costs and skyrocketing college tuition bills state government must stop wasteful spending live within its means and not increase taxes on hard working families
2006329 people down here need to know they can count on their elected representative to stand up for them against tax and spend democrat policies
2006330 as your state representative i will vote against any income tax sales tax or other tax increase on families and area businesses
2006331 i am committed to the principles of limited government and fiscal restraint taxpayers should not bear the financial burden of the democrats spending addiction

2006336 we have about fifty democratic members that will vote for a pro drilling bill the speaker is blocking that vote
2006337 some of you are wondering if its ok to pray in here thats actually the way congress starts everyday we arent the source of wisdom we just try to reflect the wisdom we get from above and from our constituents
2006338 i firmly believe this and i also believe that without his concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better than the builders of babel
2006339 i therefore beg leave to move that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of heaven and its blessings on our deliberations be held in this assembly every morning before we proceed to business and that one or more of the clergy of this city be requested to officiate in that service
2006340 point to a weakening of real gdp growth in mid 2008

2006343 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
2006344 we also have to do more to support and strengthen lgbt families
2006345 because equality in relationship family and adoption rights is not some abstract principle its about whether millions of lgbt americans can finally live lives marked by dignity and freedom
2006346 thats why we have to repeal laws like the defense of marriage act thats why we have to eliminate discrimination against lgbt families and thats why we have to extend equal treatment in our family and adoption laws
2006347 desire to build a life with a loved one to provide for a family and to have children who will grow and thrive are desires that all people share regardless of race sex religion sexual orientation or gender identity
2006348 that the cost of the american dream must never come at the expense of the american family for decades weve had politicians in washington who talk about family values but we havent had policies that value families instead its harder for working parents to make a living while raising their kids its even harder to get a break

2006352 if as some kind of gesture we said no to new coal fired power stations we would be in a very difficult position of not being able to develop this technology ourselves it requires some new coal powered fire stations for the technology to develop
2006353 world demand for coal is projected to rise by 70 by 2030 an average annual rate of 2 2 and the bulk of the rise will come from india and china china is a nation built on coal so the idea that if we showed some kind of lead and we in britain say no to coal and china will say ok we will follow is just daft
2006354 we are responsible for 2 of emissions worldwide and we have a duty to tackle that
2006355 but the real gain here the real challenge and if we do not meet the challenge all is lost on global warming the stakes are that high is to bring on clean coal technology and carbon capture and storage once we can develop those technologies we can help the chinese the indians and others to retrofit power stations and make ccs a component of new coal fired power stations that is the only way we are going to tackle this problem
2006356 if we were to have a moratorium on coal fired stations we would therefore most likely become more dependent on gas i dont want to exaggerate but gas come from some fairly unstable parts of the world and some not readily associated with human rights and democracy

2006359 in future it will be important to test if eating a diet rich in brassica vegetables has health benefits for diabetic patients we expect that it will
2006360 it is encouraging to see that professor thornalley and his team have identified a potentially important substance that may protect and repair blood vessels from the damaging effects of diabetes
2006361 washington is the city where the scandals happen every american knows this but we also believe if only vaguely that the really monumental scandals are a thing of the past that the golden age of misgovernment for profit ended with the cavalry charge and the robber barons at about the same time presidents stopped wearing beards
2006362 the black day of the german army of the war
2006363 we are delighted to be able to open the doors of the convention to the public on this historic night
2006364 there is a growing movement for positive change in colorado the west and across the country and what better way to foster it then to have more americans participate in the fourth night of the convention
2006365 i just liked the way it looked and thought it might lead to some interesting conversations when i see 756 i dont think man that barry bonds guy sure was a cheater hes not the real record holder instead i think about roger maris and babe ruth and the difference between using illegal performance enhancing drugs and throwing spitballs and the fundamental nature of records
2006366 if you dont care to wear statements on your chest then dont and if you really dont think a shirt like that means something specific heck i cant keep typing i know youre smarter than that you know that shirt makes a specific statement why pretend otherwise
2006367 you cant put this entirely on other people if you wear a 756 t shirt sure some people like me will take it as a statement knowing this as you do means if you wear the shirt you are in fact making a statement and not one that easily leads to an interesting intelligent conversation and that statement is very specific in its reference its not about maris and ruth and peds and spitballs and records its about barry bonds so you have a shirt you know it will provoke a response and that people will take it to have a certain meaning you dont often wear the shirt because of this yet if you do wear the shirt anyone who responds with something other than hey lets have a nice chat is at fault if i poke you in the eye knowing that you will take offense i cant proclaim innocence when you do indeed take offense
2006368 to my eye hes not ripping bonds hes ripping us morons who might get pissed at someone wearing a 756 t shirt
2006369 man that barry bonds guy sure was a cheater hes not the real record holder
2006370 he goes on for a couple of interesting paragraphs about records and the way something like an asterisk might lead us to thoughtful consideration hes not ripping bonds hes just wondering why asterisks havent marked many other historical moments as well
2006371 which i take as a rip against us fans in the comments i wrote if you dont care to wear statements on your chest then dont and if you really dont think a shirt like that means something specific heck i cant keep typing i know youre smarter than that you know that shirt makes a specific statement why pretend otherwise he replied with a funny note that suggested hed already addressed my concerns apparently the fact that he doesnt often wear the shirt shows that he knows other people find specific meaning in the shirt
2006372 to which i answered you cant put this entirely on other people
2006373 in 1974 i came to know jesus as my personal savior receiving a new and tender heart to replace the heart of stone id carried around for 26 years since then it has been an ongoing spiritual battle to keep my new heart soft and pliable open to gods leading instead of following my own desires
2006374 jesus makes it clear that helping a neighbor saving a life is more important than any religious ritual or tradition
2006375 every commandment which i command you today you must be careful to observe that you may live and multiply and go in and possess the land
2006376 model a you first love in a me first world
2006377 to some people perhaps many having a streetcar stop 1 block away is a plus
2006378 also i certainly have not seen any decent similar places in bernal going for 400k less than the asking price for 254 30th at least not any part of bernal id want to live in
2006379 ill stand by what i said fluj why do you call people obstinate when they just disagree with your opinion you need to chill and open your mind to other views
2006380 i am pretty sure all these are in escrow the long predicted collapse of the noe market isnt going to happen this summer i keep hoping prices on the 3 2s come down but they have not

2006382 i dont know how many guys hes blocked or how many assignments hes executed correctly but we have not put the ball on the ground with those young guys
2006383 a year ago at this time i think we were averaging like four fumbles on the ground a day because of young kids and inexperience that has not happened and that has been very encouraging
2006384 it is still joe because jason missed the entire spring and so we have to be intelligent and say it is joe and jordan gibbs had every snap in the spring
2006385 now it us up to jason to have a good preseason and we need to figure out is he a left or a right tackle but it is on jason he needs to say im healthy im committed there is no doubt about jasons ability its does he want to be great now
2006386 out here were saying dont hit anybody dont hurt anyone we go full speed now with pads on well be able to truly start separating i dont think a whole lot will change with the receivers and defensive backs but it will change drastically with the linemen
2006387 i mean youd like to do that because if they are any good they dont like to and dont want to come out
2006388 thats a winners mentality and were looking for guys who dont want to come off the field they should hate coming off the field
2006389 fans of nancy werlin s rules of survival 2006 author interview are a natural for this sad but hopeful story
2006390 at this point nothing in this building is more important than a responsible budget to fix our broken budget system
2006391 so until the legislature passes a budget that i can sign i will not sign any bills that reach my desk
2006392 in honor of iris marion young theorist and practitioner of justice
2006393 my goal is to bring opera dance and live theatre back to pbs
2006394 there is a great appetite and interest in the arts that is not being served by the rest of the media being able to bring arts to a much broader audience particularly those people who dont have either the resources or the geography to access the arts on their own is what public television was envisioned as doing when it was first created i feel very strongly about that
2006395 internationally recognized as the preeminent magazine for calligraphers and lettering artists
2006396 women have been involved in printing and the making of books ever since these crafts were first developed even before the advent of movable type there was a strong tradition of women producing manuscripts in western european religious houses
2006397 devoted to highlighting the best content from the community of bloggers who write about books
2006398 when i read the script there was like one kissing scene
2006399 had two modes deadly serious and frat boy with little in between
2006400 the men were to dress as women and the women as sluts
2006401 well you get the idea and it cost only 120 to attend
2006402 the reflected best self feedback exercise differs from other performance mechanisms in its explicit focus on understanding how key constituents experience individuals when they leverage their strength constructively
2006403 in large urban areas the culture of public education is broken if you dont fix this culture then you are not going to be able to make the kind of changes that are needed
2006404 if there was no wrongdoing found from the ethics commission then obviously well take that into consideration and move forward
2006405 river rescue patrols saw it heading down the ohio river but when a passing officer asked a worker on the second barge yesterday where the complex was going the man just shrugged his shoulders
2006406 as time has passed and i look at alot of the issues that were dealing with it may be necessary to look at something like that again
2006407 if i were mayor i think that would have to be something that would have to be put on the table for consideration as a way to really try to influence what happens in our schools
2006408 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2006409 osama bin laden has just decreed death to all jews and all americans
2006410 language similar to the text of the anthrax letters postmarked two weeks later warning death to america death to israel
2006411 iran will not provide any help in an attack by the u s and its allies you who have always hurt irans interests how can you ask for our help in attacking an oppressed country
2006412 it is a human religious wise and historical duty for all the muslim nations to support the oppressed palestinian nation as much as possible
2006413 death to america death to israel israel is the enemy of islam america is the great satan
2006414 dream cars of the 50s and 60s many concept cars sales commercials training film clip for a sinclair franchisee just chock full
2006415 im an american im here to advance americas interests but im also here because of the relationship between your country and mine
2006416 were trying to build their capacity to govern themselves in such a way that their territory does not become a launchpad for attacks against israel
2006417 ill give you a one word answer which is yes but it is going to take time i work with your defense forces i understand very clearly the challenges they face but i take great inspiration from something i heard and ive heard more than once from idf chief of staff gabi ashkenazi he says as they do more we will do less my goal is to give them the capability to do more so that the idf will do less and i have to assume logically that eventually the idf will feel comfortable that it can leave altogether i think they can do it
2006418 this is my personal view im not speaking for the united states some of
2006419 but at the end of the day this is not a spectator sport for any of us the palestinians are on the playing field and youre on the playing field we all have to understand that and im on the playing field neither israel nor the u s are referees on this and so how we interface with the other side makes a big difference there is money programmed in the u s budget for this process continuing to 2010 2011 we dont intend to give up on this the timing depends on my ability to create what my government wants me to create but it also depends on interaction between what i create and the idf and the government of israel
2006420 its very hard to know whats going on in gaza
2006421 we had a series of problems with egyptians israelis and the palestinians concerning the border crossings and every time we had one of these meetings youd hear alarming reports from people inside gaza saying you know isnt there some way you can get us some help
2006422 the jordanians said after the first couple of weeks who are these people theyre quick learners theyre disciplined they follow orders and theyre motivated

2006424 ehud barak himself has told me i will not obstruct your program because i want to see if you can pull this off
2006425 jenin was the wild west people were running out with guns all over the place shootouts all the time jenin now is a place where policemen walk the beat and theyre unafraid and shops are open later
2006426 it works if the politics works the rest of this is going to work im gonna build you israelis stuff that your government is going to look at and say lets take a little bit of risk and give them a chance and see what they can do and were very close to that point
2006427 we are what we think all that we are arises with our thought with our thoughts we make our world
2006428 so when an astute stamp collector recently discovered that one of the old glorys in the u s postal services flags 24 7 series appears to have 14 stripes it was bound to send a wave of excitement through the philatelic community

2006431 who in the anglican communion has the authority to discipline that erring province

2006436 we find it puzzling that ncaa advertising rules prohibit ads for cigarettes other tobacco products organizations promoting gambling and alcohol beverages yet continue to allow ads for beverages with alcohol content of 6 or less
2006437 given the devastating problems caused by underage college drinking much of it in the form of beer that policy makes little sense and flouts the core value of sports and learning
2006438 please act to protect the integrity of college sports and the health and safety interests of college students athletes and young fans by ending all advertising during ncaa broadcasts
2006439 we are what we think all that we are arises with our thought with our thoughts we make our world
2006440 im well aware of the argument about singling out oil companies rather than soda pop manufacturers
2006441 i think oil companies are amoral they want to make as much money as they can for their shareholders which is what corporations do
2006442 the difference is the nature of the kind of outsized profits they make that may have no relationship to their investments or their production the fact for example that the shortage of refinery capacity could actually increase their profits so the less they invest the more they make indicates that you are not dealing with someone making widgets out there

2006514 first guy to hit it out of the infield yell bingo
2006515 what do they need another left handed hitting dh for
2006516 the worst of all is how they pitched to mauer and morneau

2006518 6 outs and 7 assists this is like an episode of uribe gone wild
2006519 i cant believe they gave zito a 30 million dollar contract

2006521 a player who was not with the club when the game was suspended may be used as a substitute even if he has taken the place of a player no longer with the club who would not have been eligible because he had been removed from the lineup before the game was suspended

2006525 i think im turning japanese i think im turning japanese i really think so vote for davis please vote for davis please he really likes jobs
2006526 since weve regulated ourselves out of competition with the rest of the world well try to force our regulations on everyone else to level the playing field
2006527 i know that jon will not only work on behalf of the working men and women of the 26th district but he will stand up for all of us across the country hes the kind of leader we will be proud to send to washington

2006532 the mailbox was near a storage closet that housed materials from a sorority that he was obsessed with 30 years ago
2006533 there are still too many unanswered questions i still cant say that one person did all of this
2006534 a plausible case could be made in terms of mr ivinss guilt but on the other hand a case could be made that none of this constitutes a smoking gun
2006535 he has gotten me through a lot of tough times i would believe what he has to say i have a lot of respect for him
2006536 children are often overlooked in the hiv response we know that children suffer the impacts of aids in many ways affected children may suffer the trauma of losing one or both of their parents hiv positive children may have to battle ill health or arduous medication regimes both affected and infected children often lose educational opportunities face economic hardships and experience stigma and discrimination
2006537 the direct aid program provides us with the opportunity to make a real difference to disadvantaged people such as the children in the la casa de la sal shelter
2006538 no we did not receive any money back from the obama campaign at any time
2006539 it could be true that donations were made but as a part of a deliberate set up to make obama look bad aaron klein reports from the israel for wnd again obviously if an actual illegal donation was actually made it should be returned but it would be interesting to find out who really made it and why
2006540 by the way aaron klein is clearly an sic conservative anti obama reporter for the ultra right wing worldnetdaily
2006541 their imagination in suggesting wnd actually set up the palestinian donations to the obama campaign
2006542 thats a good one it was an elaborate sting operation by an independent news source not feeding at the obama media trough says daily kos talk about your twisted convoluted conspiracy tales maybe wnd was also behind the forged obama birth certificate published by daily kos
2006543 making up these wacky stories shows the desperate lengths daily kos will go to deny their beloved candidate would do anything wrong
2006544 not just the people in gaza but people from all over the world are rooting for this great man
2006545 it exaggerates only a little to say that americans in their 20s and early 30s divide into two groups of about equal size those who are married the majority of whom participate in religion and those who are not married the majority of whom do not participate
2006546 marriage is a gateway into family life and family life in turn is often a gateway into church attendance
2006547 the longer people postpone marriage the less likely they are to attend church at a given age and also the less likely they are to attend church down the road
2006548 one thing churches need to do is to really encourage their teenagers and their young adults not to buy into this culture of hooking up and even the culture of dating or just hanging out
2006549 churches need to create a culture of courtship that puts them on a path to marriage for those who are called to marriage
2006550 these are already on sale so the coupon wont work

2006680 not only will the places provide the opportunity to further include young people with disability in a range of out of school initiatives it will also help working parents to balance their work and family responsibilities

2006702 in some cases there are costs benefits to outsourcing enterprise email but in all cases it frees up it resources

2006734 i have decided i wont run in the kadima movement primaries nor do i intend to intervene in the elections
2006735 when a new kadima party chairman is chosen i will resign as prime minister to permit them to put together a new government swiftly and effectively i want to make it clear i am proud to be a citizen of a country where the prime minister can be investigated like a regular citizen it is the duty of the police to investigate and the duty of the prosecution to instruct the police the prime minister is not above the law from my first day in office i was forced to ward off malicious attacks even while dealing with far reaching decisions affecting israels defense and existence i continue to believe with all my heart that the achievement of peace combating terror strengthening our security and the realization of a different type of relationship with our neighbors are all necessary goals for the future of the state of israel
2006736 most kadima mks know they will not be re elected if they go to a general election why should they voluntarily give up their seats after the primary they will do what they can to keep the government ticking and that could mean another two years by the way labor is so weak it would probably join a post olmert kadima government mofaz is going to run hard right which could collapse likud because bibi has been virtually silent on the issues look for mofaz to stress jerusalem and possibly pull a stunt like sharon and the temple mount the livni mofaz race should be very close olmert is supporting mofaz and so is shas the ultra religious party if there are elections i dont see it happening before march 2009

2006741 this brings up the famous im not a musician quote from early in his career which confounds fans and critics alike to this day
2006742 when i say musician i wouldnt apply it to myself as a synthesizer player or player of tape recorders because i usually mean someone with a digital skill that they then apply to an instrument
2006743 and yet one wonders still how disingenuous all this might be so i asked him point blank have you ever had any formal music or theory training at all
2006744 have you ever felt the pressure that you should get some
2006745 it appears that the great and true love of his creative life is the tape recorder and all of the things it can do

2006823 23 million will enable queensland farmers natural resource management regions and peak industry groups to work together to deliver land management practices essential to improving reef water quality in terrain burdekin dry tropics mackay whitsunday fitzroy basin burnett mary and cape york
2006824 the fact that organisations such as agforce the queensland farmers federation canegrowers growcom queensland dairyfarmers organisation cotton australia natural resource management bodies along the reef coast and the world wildlife fund are combining their significant knowledge and resources to mount this large scale coordinated approach to protecting the great barrier reef gives me real confidence
2006825 the cattle industry has also made advances in maintaining ground cover that is important for drought recovery as well as in minimising soil loss and sediment in rivers
2006826 the reef rescue package is all about supporting farmers to build upon their successful efforts to date to reduce nutrients chemicals and sediments leaving their lands
2006827 results from earlier projects show that setting up buffer zones improving fertiliser efficiency strategic fencing and repairing riverbanks and wetlands reduces nutrient sediment and chemical run off from the land
2006828 with the fundamentals in place on farm were now in a position to trial new technologies and land management techniques that may further improve water quality in the reef catchment
2006829 to ensure that what were doing is working were also introducing a new coordinated catchment wide water quality monitoring and reporting program
2006830 australians want to protect the great barrier reef from the negative impacts of human activity and global climate change

2006832 the reef is the largest living organism on our planet and celebrated both here in australia and internationally for its stunning beauty and environmental significance
2006833 but we know that the reef is struggling with coral bleaching caused by global climate change and declining water quality and todays announcement is a major step forward in helping address those issues
2006834 reducing the amount of nutrients sediment and chemicals that flow from land based activities onto the reef gives the reef a chance to regain its inbuilt natural resilience and ability to cope with other environmental pressures

2006867 in telling a tale a narrator is trying to cast a spell to deceive the reader with the readers cooperation or course into the illusion that the events being portrayed are unfolding before his eyes the basic ingredient of the magicians cauldron is of course verisimilitude the events need not be real or even realistic they can be larger than life or smaller than life or true to life they do not need to follow the logic of real life cause and effect but they must follow the story logic of make believe the author can say what happens but he cannot say like a child playing a game that it only happens because of his say so if the events or plot elements appear out of nowhere and vanish with no consequence trailing after them it is too much unlike life the event seem to be inauthentic inorganic unnatural and each thing that happens does not seem to be happening because of what the story requires but merely because of what the author wants if your plot has events and elements that dont fit into the rest of the plot if the plot is arbitrary the spell is broken artistic integrity flies out the window and the reader is betrayed

2007008 no the decision making and execution is there its on them to perform better and be more efficient
2007009 they will respond fine its only practice three but we hold that position highly and if were going to play well they have to play well
2007010 there was no spoken word but we were both saying the same thing
2007011 i thought that ball was eight feet out of bounds
2007012 i think that complacency is a danger now that these guys are getting a little older and feeling a little more confident but their effort has been outstanding right now we have four tackles who have played and started a lot of games and they are all having a good camp
2007013 i think one of the things weve found is the best motivator is competition and depth and right now they are all pushing each other so you cant help but be pleased with what weve seen so far
2007014 i dont know who is going to end up the starters though mick williams has really been playing at a high level right now
2007015 but i can put any of these guys in and feel good about it the one thing i will say is ive talked to jabaal sheard about how he needs to increase his effort and how he needed to become more coachable and hes responded well hes working harder ive never worried about his talent or his instincts it is the fundamentals and techniques and if he keeps working on those things hell be a starter and a great player for us
2007016 punk rock is exemplary manners towards your fellow human beings
2007017 usually i would pass even reading the music blogs that are all independent music but this one was actually good because it did not seem like you had to be a scenester knowing the secret handshake to be allowed to read it they have a good collection of artists from all over the map which is always what i like to see and they have this funny ad running on there site to bring 44 to singapore
2007018 government of the people by the people for the people
2007019 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected
2007020 we do not want any democrat either in the hall or in the stadium or at home walking away saying well you know im just not satisfied im not happy
2007021 at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election

2007023 im delighted to be here its all come out of the blue a bit but its a great challenge for me this is a massive club and im really looking forward to it
2007024 there were other clubs interested but this is such a big club obviously i talked to the manager and hes very positive and very ambitious thats what i am especially after last season i want to get back into the premier league and show people what i can do
2007025 so im just grateful for the opportunity to play for such a big club as aston villa i think i can achieve everything i want in the game at a club like this
2007026 villa are definitely going places you can tell by the signings theyre making and the people already at the club
2007027 the manager is talking very positively here and obviously the chairmans backing him up so i want to be a part of that
2007028 beyonc knowles has been a spokesperson for the lor al paris brand since 2001

2007039 youve got to deal with the guys at the line then sometimes one guy on the line and someone inside are trying to blow you up 25 yards downfield
2007040 and nobody realizes how long the play is say the hang time is 4 5 seconds plus the catch and now you have to tackle somebody its a six seven eight second play

2007100 western concepts of law are in their origins and therefore in their nature intimately bound up with distinctively western theological and liturgical concepts of the atonement and of the sacraments behind these competing attitudes between differing christian visions of the law there stood the revolutionary subdivision of western society into two political realms the ecclesiastical and the secular and the further subdivision of the secular realm into royal feudal urban and other polities the belief in a god of justice who operates a lawful universe punishing and rewarding according to principles of proportion mercifully mitigated in exceptional cases corresponded to the belief in a complex social unity christendom in which the dialectic of interacting realms and polities were regulated by a similar kind of justice with mercy playing an exceptional role with the transfer of the principal lawmaking and law enforcing functions to the sole jurisdictions of the national state the foundation was laid for the separation of jurisprudence from theology and ultimately for the complete secularization of legal thought this did not occur at once since the predominant system of beliefs throughout the west remained christian it is only in the twentieth century that the christian foundations of western law have been almost totally rejected thus not only legal thought but also the very structure of western legal institutions have been removed from their spiritual foundations and those foundations in turn are left devoid of the structure that once stood upon them

2007226 however they are something of a jekyll and hyde and also produce toxins known as mycotoxins such as aflatoxin which can cause liver cancer aspergillus causes a life threatening infection for transplant and leukaemic patients as well as being a major allergen for asthmatics
2007227 identifying these genome sequences will transform scientific understanding of why this group of fungi is so lethal and allergenic the importance of the project in helping develop new drugs and diagnostic tests and understand and prevent allergies and diseases like pneumonia and sinusitis cannot be overestimated the information revealed will also develop our understanding of the biology of composting and mycotoxin production and provide benefits for many other areas of science and medicine

2007238 its the opposite i penetrate i have never liked it being done to me
2007239 i must be excused from this trial because i am prejudiced against the defendant i took one look at the man in the blue suit with those beady eyes and that dishonest face and i said hes a crook hes guilty guilty guilty so your honor i could not possibly stay on this jury
2007240 get back in the jury box you are just the kind of juror we are looking for a good judge of character
2007241 bringing the oil money to the tables of the people
2007242 even if i have to do it at my last day in office
2007243 for the purpose of protecting the nationals of the state in the enjoyment of their rights accruing by treaty or otherwise

2007245 he hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
2007246 in this case there is no specific individual who can be compensated as there is no direct victim who has come forward
2007247 dr lund although not a direct victim did expend considerable time and energy and suffered ridicule and harassment as a result of his complaint the panel finds therefore that he is entitled to some compensation
2007248 mr boissoin and his organization the concerned christian coalition inc shall cease publishing in newspapers by email on the radio in public speeches or on the internet in future disparaging remarks about gays and homosexuals
2007249 mr boissoin and the concerned christian coalition inc provide dr lund with a written apology for the article in the red deer advocate which was the subject of this complaint
2007250 request their written apology for the contravention of the act be published in the red deer advocate
2007251 after it happened all the people in positions of authority went out of their way to script this they purposely interfered with the investigation they covered it up i think they thought they could control it and they realized that their recruiting efforts were going to go to hell in a handbasket if the truth about his death got out they blew up their poster boy
2007252 the fact that he was the ultimate team player and he watched his own men kill him is absolutely heartbreaking and tragic the fact that they lied about it afterward is disgusting
2007253 the deception surrounding this case was an insult to the family but more importantly its primary purpose was to deceive a whole nation we say these things with disappointment and sadness for our country once again we have been used as props in a pentagon public relations exercise
2007254 we as an army failed in our duty to the tillman family the duty we owe to all the families of our fallen soldiers give them the truth the best we know it as fast as we can
2007255 do you spend a lot of time in the sun like playing golf sailing hiking or bicycling
2007256 do you gamble drive fast cars or have a lot of risky sex
2007257 it appeared as though he was shot by a united states navy mark 12 mod x special purpose rifle from approximately 10 yards 9 m away it is likely that a ranger sniper fired the three single shots that formed the shot group on tillmans forehead

2007269 christ would not vote for barack obama because barack obama has voted to behave in a way that it is inconceivable for christ to have behaved
2007270 obamas on record as lets kill the baby if thats what the mother wants
2007271 republicans are gearing up campaigns to depict mr obama as a radical on the question of abortion because as a state senator in illinois he opposed a ban on the killing of foetuses born alive
2007272 we shall be running minimal services from tomorrow onwards well be fully running by sunday monday of the camp
2007273 as one reporter describes it and no doubt that is true
2007274 what took place was the slaughter not of students but of ordinary workers and residents precisely the target that the chinese government had intended
2007275 hundreds of people most of them workers and passers by did die that night but in a different place and under different circumstances
2007276 to be precise about where the massacre happened and who were its victims or readers and viewers will never be able to understand what it meant

2007283 once considered on the verge of being a lost cause for the gop this race to replace retiring republican rep jerry weller in chicagos southern suburbs has quickly become one of the marquee races of the
2007284 more than any other race in the country this race is about guilt by association for halvorson the task at hand is to tie ozinga to unpopular president bush for ozinga it is to tie halvorson to even less popular gov rod blagojevich
2007285 ozinga has not been hurting for funds impressively he has raised over 881 000 of which only 70 000 is his own
2007286 republicans say halvorsons status as a party leader during the blagojevich administration will doom her campaign thanks to ethics scandals in his inner circle and support for an unpopular gross receipts tax blagojevichs approval ratings currently languish in the teens ozingas allies say halvorson stalled an ethics bill in the legislature and supported the gross receipts tax they also hammer her for her associations with chicago politicians such as city state sen emil jones who has favored cook county chicago representation on a board for a proposed will county airport
2007287 ozinga backers say that this middle income district is more working class republican than latte liberal and will appreciate the blue collar persona the republican has cut in his early ads

2007292 was pissed he wanted contreras but didnt bid high enough why else would he force his team to fly to cuba for a day
2007293 to discuss the very troubling granting of a treasury ofac license to a little league team to travel to cuba in august
2007294 will lead to a better and more secure world and i believe its through grass roots connections of people to people and baseball teams playing one another that we expand our understanding and thats consistent with the objectives of our initial trips to cuba
2007295 like the idea of the government telling ordinary americans let alone little leaguers where and when they can travel if the president can go to china at taxpayers expense these kids ought to be able to go on a privately paid trip to cuba to play some baseball
2007296 baseball big and little its role in u s cuba relations

2007299 cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment in this instance we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel

2007303 a group of american cyclists has apologized to beijing olympic organizers after arriving in chinas capital wearing face masks
2007304 the wearing of protective masks upon our arrival into beijing was strictly a precautionary measure we as athletes chose to take and was in no way meant to serve as an environmental or political statement
2007305 we deeply regret the nature of our choices our decision was not intended to insult bocog or countless others who have put forth a tremendous amount of effort to improve the air quality in beijing
2007306 i understand that about 200 of our athletes received those masks through the national governing body not directly from the u s olympic committee

2007321 ive always said that the pace of withdrawal would be dictated by the safety and security of our troops and the need to maintain stability that assessment has not changed
2007322 and when i go to iraq and have a chance to talk to some of the commanders on the ground im sure ill have more information and will continue to refine my policies
2007323 i am going to do a thorough assessment when im there im sure ill have more information and continue to refine my policy
2007324 let me be as clear as i can be i intend to end this war
2007325 i have seen no information that contradicts the notion that we can bring out troops out safely at a pace of one to two brigades per month
2007326 this is the same position that i had four months ago
2007327 people like him because he is incomprehensible and anybody can understand him but who came first gertrude stein or james joyce

2007329 the book is diffuse it is brackish it is pretentious it is underbred not only in the obvious sense but in the literary sense
2007330 the most infamously obscene book in ancient or modern literature
2007331 to stir the sex impulses or to lead to sexually impure and lustful thoughts
2007332 people will miss that it once meant something to be southern or midwestern it doesnt mean much now except for the climate the question where are you from doesnt lead to anything odd or interesting they live somewhere near a gap store and what else do you need to know

2007339 the family is and will be the chief witness to the active power of the love of god in the world
2007340 ultimately the power of catholics to transform america into a culture of life and a civilization of love will lie in the power of their example more than in the power of the ballot box even though the ballot box is important the early christians did not take over the roman empire by electoral choice there were no elections to speak of in those days rather they did so by their example by holding out the possibility of a life that was higher more beautiful and above all more authentic than the vulgarity violence and greed of late antiquity christians today have the same opportunity to offer another way to a world that is also surfeited with these same problems
2007341 its time to pick up the pace a little bit
2007342 when youre by yourself thats one thing passing and going a little harder is the next step

2007358 nie should conduct evaluation emphasizing an ethnographic principally descriptive case study approach to enable informed choice by those involved in the program 2 the deficiencies of quantitative experimental evaluation approaches are so thorough and irreparable as to disqualify their use 4 the audience for ft evaluations is an audience of teachers to whom appeals to the need for accountability for public funds or the rationality of science are largely irrelevant

2007386 the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest
2007387 what does it avail to know that there is a god which you not only believe by faith but also know by reason what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him
2007388 our study suggests that inhibiting a certain enzyme in the brain could be an effective therapy for countering the debilitating symptoms of fxs in children and possibly in autistic kids as well
2007389 strikingly pak inhibition also restored electrical communication between neurons in the brains of the fxs mice correcting their behavioral abnormalities in the process
2007390 these are intriguing findings because the expression of the gene that inhibits pak occurs in the third week after birth which means that the neuronal abnormalities in the fragile x mouse are reversed after they appear
2007391 this is very exciting because it suggests that pak inhibitors could be used for therapeutic purposes to reverse already established mental impairments in fragile x children
2007392 these behavioral abnormalities are ameliorated partially or fully by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of pak
2007393 notably due to an elegant genetic manipulation method employed by the picower institute researchers pak inhibition in the fxs mice did not take place until a few weeks after appearance of disease symptoms this implies that future treatment may still be effective even after symptoms are already pronounced
2007394 while future studies will be necessary to further characterize the precise molecular nature of the interaction between pak and fmr1 our findings clearly demonstrate that pak inhibition can counteract several key cellular and behavioral symptoms of fxs

2007415 lisas site has become one of my new favorites to read and to participate
2007416 praise the lord i have finally found the sold out brainy christian women bloggers and from what i can tell so far most of them are reformed to boot i knew they had to be out there somewhere it was just a matter of time i was directed to lisa s blog this morning which led to carla s blog and these are leading me to many others

2007421 we have a great life we enjoy each other we laugh we make each other laugh
2007422 some things you cannot do yourself some people so resist getting help that they insult people who want to help
2007423 there is the potential to die to self there is the potential of reflecting christ who came not to be served but to serve and give his life
2007424 mommy you can walk without your cane does this mean we can stomp in mud puddles again with you
2007425 lisa you prayed for our children that we would raise them up in the fear and admonition of the lord and that they would grow up boldly proclaiming the gospel in their lives i need that prayer too especially when it pertains to boldness
2007426 it isnt really that i have felt too much pain in my life to worry so much about what people think i know life is short its the fear that the lord will make me into a job i dont want to suffer like that and i feel so selfish i dont want to think about being a martyr or something
2007427 i will lift mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help my help cometh from the lord who made heaven and earth
2007428 but it wont lower prices immediately or by very much
2007429 the reason kristi yamaguchi obliterated paul pierce in a race of speedboat drawn inner tubes one player knew how to make her avoid mines
2007430 when members of congress from your state return home this summer they need to hear why stopping further media consolidation must be a top priority by acting now you can ensure that there are thousands of petitions ready to be delivered when your u s representative sets foot back in your district for the summer congressional recess
2007431 i believe more fervently than ever that as journalism goes so goes democracy
2007432 yet as mergers and buyouts change both old and new media bringing a frenzied focus on cost cutting while fattening the pockets of both the new owners and their investors we are seeing journalism degraded through the layoffs and buyouts of legions of reporters and editors
2007433 he told his journalists that he didnt have an editorial agenda or a perspective about newspapers roles as civic institutions
2007434 im a businessman he said all that matters in the end is the bottom line just this week zell told wall street analysts that to save money he intends to eliminate 500 pages of news a week across all of the companys 12 papers that could mean eliminating some 82 pages a week just from the los angeles times what will he use to replace reporters and editors he says to the wall street analysts ill use maps graphics lists rankings and stats it sounds to me as if sam has confused viagra with lunesta
2007435 he insults journalists and journalism at virtually every whistle stop on his tour
2007436 he says its not about about profits the american public and policy makers have to decide whether journalism is produced purely for the reaping of profit or if its a central component to a functioning participatory democracy
2007437 you make policy accordingly there is no such thing as a deregulated media policy system the only question is will the media be regulated for the largest media corporations or regulated on behalf of the american public thats what all of our anticonsolidation efforts are about
2007438 on the brink of the greatest opportunity in generations to break the corporate media stranglehold on democracy
2007439 the future will go down one of two paths the first is the righteous path its of openness a new media world that treats all content equally the second path is a closed internet an internet that looks like radio tv or cable an internet where giant phone and cable companies decide whats on how much it costs and how fast it downloads an internet that is no longer a vibrant town square for all of us but a cash cow for a few
2007440 we dedicate ourselves here today to the proposition that our fight for a democratic open internet and independent media will end the historic pattern of monopoly that suffocates freedom dissent and creativity
2007441 they paid too much theyre overleveraged theres too much debt
2007442 weve been willing to bargain concessions where necessary but we think the biggest mistake is that the owners and the publishers have not been talking to the frontline workers about that kind of innovation so what were trying to do where we have to do concessions we want to trade that for real involvement real committees that are able to work on a better business model on the future of the product we still believe that theres a place for quality journalism that people will want it
2007443 were hearing that tribune company is going to save journalism through all these cuts
2007444 thats not what were seeing thats not what were feeling were feeling that basically its just a self fulfilling cycle of a downward spiral
2007445 the overwhelming majority of stories are broken by professional journalists not by bloggers or armchair amateurs
2007446 advertisers have already aggressively seized the new online world to go back into the programming business themselves creating whats called branded content imagine the camel news caravan revived but this time as a sponsored youtube channel can you imagine advertisers going for stories with key words such as health care reform environmental degradation iraqi casualties i dont think so so what will happen to news in the future as the already tattered boundary between journalism and advertising is dispensed with entirely and as content programming commerce and online communities are rolled into one profitably attractive package
2007447 the large newspapers are dying and the internet is not going to replace them
2007448 part of it is ownership part of it is just the antiquated nature of newsprint as a conveyor of information
2007449 its not totally about ownership it is about the medium itself the average reader of the paper copy of the new york times spends 45 minutes reading the paper the average viewer of the new york times web site spends about 7 minutes the internet is not designed for a literate society we are moving into a postliterate society
2007450 gov arnold schwarzenegger in his latest attempt to pressure lawmakers into breaking the states budget impasse on wednesday said he will not sign any bills until the legislature agrees on a budget which is more than a month overdue
2007451 nothing in this building is more important than a responsible budget schwarzenegger said at an afternoon news conference in the capitol i know this means some good bills will fail
2007452 one bill that is likely to die is ab3034 which seeks to change the high speed rail bond on the november ballot
2007453 thirteen senate bills await schwarzeneggers signature and a spokesman for the governor said authors of the legislation will be given the opportunity to take them off his desk to avoid a veto
2007454 the governors pronouncement was his second controversial act in as many weeks in an effort to nudge legislators to break a logjam over how to bridge a 17 2 billion budget gap for this fiscal year which began july 1
2007455 despite the governors argument that lawmakers should negotiate a budget before working on any more bills both houses of the legislature will go ahead today with their scheduled floor sessions and hear more bills said spokespeople for the leaders of the assembly and the senate
2007456 the governor said he will veto bills before they become law after 12 days without his signature but legislators can simply withhold bills from the governor until aug 18 the start of a six week window in which the 12 day rule does not apply that likely buys lawmakers cover from a veto until sept 30
2007457 schwarzenegger said the state has a cash crisis looming but controller john chiang disagrees
2007458 the state needs a routine loan at last estimate 8 billion to provide cash while tax revenue arrives in spurts with most coming toward the end of the fiscal year
2007459 if there is no budget the state must get a more expensive type of loan that could add at least 100 million to borrowing costs chiang had thought that he would have to commit to a loan next week
2007460 the controller said yesterday that improved finances allow him to push back a decision for several weeks
2007461 traditionally as budget talks enter their final stage gov arnold schwarzenegger summons lawmakers to his famous smoking tent located in the courtyard outside the governors office
2007462 look into the governors courtyard and all youll see is a concrete slab
2007463 nope the tent has been moved at the request of the department of general services which is making some repairs to the capitol roof the repairs have been going on for months closing the passageway between the sixth floor annex and the fourth floor of the old capitol
2007464 so do lawmakers miss the tent and has the demise of the smoking tent lessened the prospects of a budget deal
2007465 now that the smoke is gone we just need to get rid of the mirrors and we might get a budget deal said assembly republican leader
2007466 the absence of the tent has not stopped schwarzenegger from huddling with top advisers in his courtyard its just that now anyone in the capitol with a view of the courtyard can chart the progress of budget negotiations web cam anyone
2007467 tuesday afternoon for example the governor and chief of staff
2007468 in order to get out of the hot afternoon sun the governor has set up a few chairs toward the outer edge of the courtyard in a shaded area but from our vantage point it was questionable at best whether or not kennedy and schwarzenegger were enjoying their cigars within the confines of california law
2007469 the capitol elevator operators a beloved and longtime fixture of the states legislative hub were among those who went down with gov arnold schwarzeneggers layoffs last week
2007470 the operators eight in all were let go as part of the governors executive order to save cash by laying off 10 133 part time and temporary state workers until the legislature settles on a budget
2007471 ive even told them id work for free because it makes me happy said helen jenkins who has worked as a capitol elevator operator since 1983
2007472 the only elevator left with an operator is reserved for state senators
2007473 according to department of general services spokesman eric lamoureux the agency that manages capitol building operations the senate rehired one operator for the members private elevator tapping into its own pot of money
2007474 the state is still processing some exit paychecks due last week for employees and will be forced to pay them additional compensation because it did not immediately provide them their final wages
2007475 gov arnold schwarzenegger signed an executive order last thursday that terminated 10 133 workers
2007476 because the state terminated the workers rather than suspending them it was required to issue checks for all salary and vacation pay immediately
2007477 service employees international union local 1000 which represents 95 000 state workers filed its suit on behalf of taxpayers charging that the state should have issued full checks to all 10 133 workers last week when it laid them off the union believes thousands of workers have yet to receive their paychecks and that the delay could force the state to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in penalties alone
2007478 as a legislative committee reviewed the air resources boards plan to reduce greenhouse gasses a deal was announced on a new bill that will implement a key piece of the plan and
2007479 a broad coalition including environmentalists builders and local governments crowded into a capitol hearing room wednesday to announce an agreement on a bill sb 375 by sen
2007480 sb 375 would become the vehicle to implement the land use portion of ab 32 said
2007481 the amended sb 375 is expected to be heard in assembly appropriations thursday
2007482 i think shell definitely think long and hard about it says
2007483 but feinstein also says i love the work in the senate
2007484 and based on history youd have to figure the odds are against her running shes comfortable and effective in the senate shes on a path to chairing the senate intelligence committee her last two reelection races have been cakewalks and in two years shell be 77 not the usual age when one starts hustling for a new job
2007485 let me tell you something carrick says everybody would snap to if she were governor her photo ops would be bill signings shes a tough task master who gets things done
2007486 shed be the strongest candidate and probably the strongest governor
2007487 another window of opportunity is opening for feinstein its wide and undoubtedly her last
2007488 long beach businessman randal hernandez has become the fourth member of the state community colleges board to step down in the year since the panel angered republican lawmakers by endorsing legislation giving illegal immigrants access to student financial aid
2007489 just two days before his reappointment was to be heard by the senate rules committee and having been warned by republicans that his appointment was in trouble hernandez notified gov arnold schwarzenegger on monday that he was withdrawing his application to serve another term
2007490 i told him he probably would have some issues with my caucus battin said
2007491 sen bob dutton r rancho cucamonga another member of the committee and republican caucus said the concerns remain from last year when senate republicans blocked confirmation of the governors appointment of colleges board president katherine albiani and board members rose castillo guilbault and john koeberer commissioners must be confirmed within a year of their appointment
2007492 the petition before the state board of forestry comes as california salmon are at historic lows requiring regulators to suspend all salmon fishing on the coast this year a first
2007493 the request came from california trout the sierra club and the environmental protection information center it targeted coho salmon in coastal streams between santa cruz and humboldt counties
2007494 for several years the national marine fisheries service has cautioned the board that its forestry rules not only are inadequate to protect salmon but actually threaten fish thats because among other things state logging rules allow too much erosion into spawning habitat
2007495 had his lower leg amputated monday after a tiger attacked him sunday on his first day of work
2007496 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

2007668 observed that the market is well supplied with current commercial oil stocks standing above their five year average the conference further noted with concern that the current price environment does not reflect market fundamentals as crude oil prices are being strongly influenced by the weakness in the us dollar rising inflation and significant flow of funds into the commodities market

2007708 the people got up and looked around and saw the mountain lions tail leaving the house
2007709 i have never supported the brutal expulsion of all palestinians i have said repeatedly that the expulsion of the palestinians is immoral and impracticable
2007710 under some circumstances expulsion is not a war crime i dont think that the expulsions of 1948 of nearly a million palestinians were war crimes you cant make an omelet without breaking eggs you have to dirty your hands moreover if he israeli prime minister ben gurion was already engaged in expulsion maybe he should have done a complete job i know that this stuns the arabs and the liberals and the politically correct types but my feeling is that this place would be quieter and know less suffering if the matter had been resolved once and for all if ben gurion had carried out a large expulsion and cleaned the whole country the whole land of israel as far as the jordan river it may yet turn out that this was his fatal mistake if he carried out a full expulsion rather than a partial one he would have stabilized the state of israel for generations
2007711 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
2007712 the tension in the anglican communion is being played out in the heart of its leader
2007713 where orthodoxy is optional orthodoxy will sooner or later be proscribed
2007714 will inevitably be asking whether we can in conscience continue to minister
2007715 your graces will know that the cost of such a choice would be both spiritual and material
2007716 we have turned down almost every realistic opportunity for those who are opposed to flourish
2007717 the depth of the uncharitable and unchristian attitudes held by the majority
2007718 we must humbly ask now for magnanimous gestures from our catholic friends that allow us to bring our folk with us
2007719 signifies a breaking away from the apostolic tradition maintained by all of the churches since the first millennium and therefore is a further obstacle to the reconciliation between the catholic church and the church of england
2007720 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
2007721 the tension in the anglican communion is being played out in the heart of its leader
2007722 todays primetime television programming is not merely indifferent to the institution of marriage and the stabilizing role it places in our society it seems to be actively seeking to undermine marriage by consistently painting it in a negative light
2007723 happily never after how hollywood favors adultery and promiscuity over marital intimacy on prime time broadcast television
2007724 outnumbered references to marital sex by a ratio of nearly 3 to 1
2007725 even more troubling than the marginalization of marriage and glorification of non marital sex on television is tvs recent obsession with outr sexual expression
2007726 children and teens are now exposed to a host of sexual behaviors that less than a generation ago would have been considered off limits for broadcast television
2007727 behaviors that were once seen as fringe immoral or socially destructive have been given the stamp of approval by the television industry and recent studies show that children are influenced by those messages
2007728 throughout much of the history of broadcast television the networks adhered to a voluntary code of conduct which stipulated that respect should be maintained for the sanctity of marriage and the value of the home our report finds that not only are the boundaries no longer respected they have been obliterated
2007729 in the 1950s and 60s it used to be that you would never see married couples in bed together
2007730 you may have noticed that when you turn the television on now you still never see married couples in bed together but for entirely different reasons youll see teenagers in bed with prostitutes men in bed with their mistresses and teachers in bed with their students
2007731 the notion that sex outside of marriage is inherently more exciting more important more worthy as the subject of storytelling is a toxic message for parents and children alike
2007732 watching sex on tv predicts and may hasten the onset of sexual activity among adolescents
2007733 by the time they have reached their senior year in high school 3 out of 5 young people in the u s today have had sex and 1 in 5 of those has had sex with 4 or more partners according to the 2001 centers for disease control and preventions youth risk behavior surveillance
2007734 the american people need to hold the networks and their local broadcast affiliates accountable for pushing questionable content into their homes over the publicly owned broadcast airwaves
2007735 in addition advertisers need to reconsider their role as underwriters of such material and whether they want to continue associating their brand names and hard earned corporate images with salacious sexual content while the supreme court awaits its next legal review of indecency on television now is the time for families to raise their collective voice against the tide of graphic sexual content invading their homes

2007737 the game table most complicated piece of the whole package and its going to take the longest to get right
2007738 finally we brought malone to camp and he looked terrible he started improving through the exhibition season and in the last pre season game he turned in an outstanding performance but by that time blazer owner larry weinberg had given john y brown of buffalo an option on a deal to buffalo for cash and a first round draft choice

2007740 here the plaintiffs theory of the case was that she sustained damages because the stock purchase agreement which the defendant negotiated without her knowledge required her to assume responsibility for peggy peters liabilities consisting of trade debt and an outstanding bank loan
2007741 the courts are loathe to disregard the corporate form for the benefit of those who have chosen that form to conduct business
2007742 there was a huge fight on july 18 at the romo home jessica and tony thought she was pregnant and announced it to the family

2007744 concessionaires may expand their routes to include the basepaths with kendrick on the mound
2007745 eh this is ok id probably enjoy it better if i could actually see what the hell was going on though
2007746 why do we give a fuck about mars when we have our infrastructure to worry about why do we continue to sink money into that bottomless pit
2007747 well your dick was already in there and you were ready to ejaculate and you interrupted the natural course of action of impregnating that woman by pulling out so by definition you aborted the pregnancy sir
2007748 eh this is ok id probably enjoy it better if i could actually see what the hell was going on though
2007749 why do we give a fuck about mars when we have our infrastructure to worry about why do we continue to sink money into that bottomless pit
2007750 well your dick was already in there and you were ready to ejaculate and you interrupted the natural course of action of impregnating that woman by pulling out so by definition you aborted the pregnancy sir
2007751 eh this is ok id probably enjoy it better if i could actually see what the hell was going on though
2007752 why do we give a fuck about mars when we have our infrastructure to worry about why do we continue to sink money into that bottomless pit
2007753 well your dick was already in there and you were ready to ejaculate and you interrupted the natural course of action of impregnating that woman by pulling out so by definition you aborted the pregnancy sir
2007754 australia is really punching above its weight in cross platform game production it is a 10 year overnight success story but all the hard work is really paying off australia is delivering world class product and it would surprise many people if they knew how many of the best selling games are actually created and developed down under

2007760 5 things that put a smile on this tv addicts face this week
2007761 this and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs when he first appears he is a protector
2007762 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
2007763 life is a miracle and therefore precious each time one is taken the world loses something special
2007764 our enemies are innovative and resourceful and so are we they never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people and neither do we
2007765 the question is who ought to make that decision the congress or the commanders and as you know my position is clear im a commander guy
2007766 oh lets just bring up the legends and have the field the 25 man roster
2007767 lets batton down the hatches full speed ahead screw the future

2007784 the bush administration made clear thursday it has no intention of easing federal quotas for corn ethanol in the nations fuel supply despite a challenge from texas gov rick perry and a broad alliance of industries hurt by high corn prices
2007785 strengthening our nations energy security and supporting americas farming communities
2007786 the idea that they have some bureaucratic definition that constitutes severe economic harm is really nonsense to me
2007787 they need to look at reality we got people that are hurting
2007788 i think this is the early stages of the destruction of the texas livestock industry
2007789 it is being used to protect against a reasonably perceived threat of immediate harm to a person within the registrants home
2007790 the reason it was filed is that these people are disobeying the injunction and the rule of law in the city
2007791 i think they want the army to come here anyone who opposes this kind of oppression they should come out and pitch a tent too
2007792 ken says dalton mcguinty will be absolutely nowhere near brantford for a good long time to come
2007793 we learned from the pentagon wednesday night that the visit would be viewed instead as a campaign event senator obama did not want to have a trip to see our wounded warriors perceived as a campaign event and decided instead not to go
2007794 nobody denied senator obama the opportunity to visit our wounded being cared for at landstuhl obviously as a sitting senator he has an interest in that and can certainly visit in an official capacity
2007795 there are as you know though restrictions on what you can do as a candidate for political office that stems from trying to maintain political neutrality and not have the military involved in politics
2007796 it is never inappropriate to visit our men and women in the military
2007797 i do love the ladies but the ladies do not love me
2007798 the idealistic hope is that over time warring factions will find credible sources to back up their assertions and the contested article will improve
2007799 if you stake them your tomatoes will grow up to be fine tomatoes and not fall on the ground so this is the intent to make sure those young men get the support they need to be fine productive citizens
2007800 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
2007801 talking about sports at starbucks is just like talking about a yarn barn event at espn zone
2007802 maybe it was a sidekick team of chodeo bitch and moronica
2007803 i mean youre not god you dont have to smite people
2007804 but this is a book about social consequences not how to dodge the latest designer pesticide and his logic about the downside of organic food is hard to fault
2007805 two agricultural systems side by side a large conventional sector that grows affordable if slightly contaminated food stuffs for the majority and a smaller one producing organic alternatives for a minority largely made up of affluent health seekers
2007806 impedes the development of public sentiment that would support a broader reconsideration of the toxic mode of production in general
2007807 a book is like a garden carried in the pocket
2007808 discover and open forgotten doors of memory an award winning science journalist and leading figure in the human consciousness studies commmunity
2007809 we need everybody to grow the party and to move forward
2007810 one of the most powerful reasons people go to sams club or target or costco is they want value and republicans are well suited to be the party that says were going to have a limited but also effective government
2007811 people want to follow hopeful optimistic civil decent leaders they dont want to follow some negative scornful person so you know say what you will about barack obama and i say a lot of negative things about him and we need leaders and john mccain is positive as well but people gravitate when you got something positive to say
2007812 and i jokingly say now if i could only get her to have sex with me
2007813 even the republican vp priased obamas positive message of hope and change for america
2007814 very excited that someone with his political skills will be the heir apparent in 4 years
2007815 say what you will about barack obama people gravitate when you have something positive to say people want to follow hopeful optimistic civil decent leaders they dont want to follow some negative scornful person
2007816 the republican idea factory has been a little stagnant in the last decade
2007817 compassionate conservatism has to be about more than a label
2007818 republican candidates all candidates are going to have to vie for that vote and have republicans historically had an advantage with it yes but we cant take it for granted
2007819 i would also say people who would want to dismiss that vote are making a very grave mistake
2007820 so were going to have to think about how do you charge for transportation in the future when cars arent going to be are increasingly not going to be fueled by gasoline the use of gasoline is plateauing and declining thats going to accelerate as we move to plug in electrics as we move to more hybrid cars as we move to more fuel efficient cars and other forms of transportation and so the gasoline tax as a workhorse for transportation funding i think is going to dissipate and were going to have to be more creative oregons got a pilot project up and running i dont know what to think of it yet cause the results arent in but theyre charging by miles driven without regard to fuel source using some gps or electronic odometer readings and you can preferentially price if you want to encourage more hybrid or fuel efficient vehicles you can offer a preferential price for that per mile as compared to something thats bigger heavier or a truck so the idea that were going to ride the gas tax first of all is politically untenable and its as a matter of policy its diminishing in relative and i think absolute terms
2007821 this notion that ethanol is subsidized and somehow its therefore tainted is ridiculous because we subsidize oil like crazy look at the federal tax code and the incentives we give to oil exploration and production and refining
2007822 and so we are very excited now to once again raise the bar for the entire nation in renewable fuels by not modestly increasing the ethanol in our gasoline but proposing to double it by the signing of this bill
2007823 didnt obama say something similar about ronald reagan during the primary that hillary pounced on him for
2007824 gov palin would be the most exciting vp choice for the evangelical community
2007825 our vp candidate is as qualified or more than your presidential candidate take that dems
2007826 for goodness sake the guy currently leading in the polls and the heavy favorite to be the next president has no experience whatsoever none zilch zippo and for the past few months hes been beating the guy who is arguably the most expreienced candidate in history if experience really mattered we wouldnt be talking about who the vp is because mccain would have it in the bag by now
2007827 middle class and blue collar workers who are receptive to john edwards two americas
2007828 most of our former vice presidents have brought to that office significant public service experience including as members of congress or state governors some came to their role as president of the senate already familiar with the body having served as u s senators several vice presidents later returned to serve again in the senate among them former president andrew johnson two vice presidents george clinton and john c calhoun held the office under two different presidents
2007829 dont you think that it is about time that it be factored in even if it has never been before
2007830 picking out books to bring back to school with me to read
2007831 i can feel the iq points dribbling out my ear
2007832 but the question we have to ask of peacocks return is can a souffl rise twice
2007833 the price of freedom of religion or of speech or of the press is that we must put up with a good deal of rubbish
2007834 the problems at collingwood can be found in the behaviour at nine over the years by one eddie mcguire and the way he grabbed large amounts of money with both hands especially since his failure as ceo
2007835 im not sure what it is you want to tell me but maybe it shouldnt be said today
2007836 the days of by appointment tv are over consumers are carrying the flag of beyond tv viewing and the on demand broadcast of the 2008 olympic games is raising the bar for all major news and sporting events to come
2007837 at anystream were proud to be the technology that turns what could be into todays viewing reality
2007838 mccain is the guy who will bring us gasoline bring it on
2007839 jill derbys opponent thinks its just fine to vote against health care for children and to rubberstamp the regressive bush agenda jill derby has the courage to lead and the wisdom we need in washington
2007840 support balanced legislation to work with state legislators and regulators to support responsible legislation that incorporates best practices
2007841 punk rock is exemplary manners towards your fellow human beings
2007842 usually i would pass even reading the music blogs that are all independent music but this one was actually good because it did not seem like you had to be a scenester knowing the secret handshake to be allowed to read it they have a good collection of artists from all over the map which is always what i like to see and they have this funny ad running on there site to bring 44 to singapore
2007843 in germany we are slowly returning to a monitored state and if things continue this way we will soon have a stasi situation again
2007844 thank you mr helper bob you will please refrain from sending emails on our behalf
2007845 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects it is inexcusable for us taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
2007846 despite iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue in the past five years us taxpayer money has been the overwhelming source of iraq reconstruction funds
2007847 pinning the failure of reconstruction and the poor functioning of the iraqi government on the iraqi government is obscene
2007848 it is politically expedient and an obscene rewriting of history to say that the us should not be giving the iraqis any more money for reconstruction because the iraqis have plenty of money of their own
2007849 the us gave the reconstruction money to us corporations the corporations took the money and failed to do the reconstruction
2007850 the iraqis are essentially doing fine on their own running their oil industry they are making money and increasing production and exports because oil is so expensive iraqis will have the money to invest and rebuild their oil infrastructure without investment from us oil companies
2007851 and so i say to you you are peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it i will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
2007852 ill always remember the look on my mums face when i declared when i grow up im going to be a lap dancer i assumed it was a glamorous job
2007853 when i was 12 i watched band of gold and decided i wanted to be a prostitute
2007854 this is a comment i threw up over at rightwing kiwiblog
2007855 as dpf has said there are a number of political commentators who are guided by a superior set of values who are in possession of information that was not intended for the ears of the general public
2007856 are we superpower americans still at risk until we capture bin ladens dentist barber and the person who installed the carpet in his living room
2007857 they may be very good but we dont know what countries are they from what kind of training they have had
2007858 blue crummy and yucky and it smells of the deodorizer and human waste
2007859 hold the faithful in line recruit as many new adherents by any and all means
2007860 hey they work theyre not broken so leave them alone
2007861 last week california governor arnold schwarzenegger ordered a pay cut to minimum wage of 6 55 hr for 200 000 state workers because a state budget hadnt been approved yet the state controller who has opposed the pay cut on principle and legal grounds now says the pay cut isnt even feasible because the states payroll systems are so antiquated he says it would take six months to go to minimum wage and nine months more to restore salaries once a budget is passed the system is based on cobol according to the sacramento bee and the state hasnt yet found the funds or resources in ten years of trying to upgrade it
2007862 hold the faithful in line recruit as many new adherents by any and all means
2007863 empower children and recognise their right to participate in our political life
2007864 god isnt real but you can believe in him if you like
2007865 blessed is the one who finds wisdom and the one who gets understanding for the gain from her is better than gain from silver and her profit better than gold
2007866 i still think the teacher acted irresponsibly i think the fact that the kids were keen is irrelevant they are children and any protest is likely to be quite exciting to join
2007867 i disapprove of what you say but i will defend to the death your right to say it
2007868 oh they cant be trusted to have a brain until theyre 16 stuff is utter poppycock
2007869 until you can say joining any protest is ok youre advocating that you believe employees of the state should be allowed to encourage children to adopt those employees political beliefs
2007870 as i said the issue isnt whether you believe alternatives to be correct or not the opportunity to study them helps you understand science rather than just rote learning the currently popular story of the past from a book
2007871 school and university does not generally encourage assessment of alternative views which is vital to a detailed understanding of science
2007872 your attempt to paint all political acts as equal is absurd clearly some are appropriate and some inappropriate for school kids
2007873 clearly some are appropriate and some inappropriate for school kids
2007874 i would trust the combined sense held by the teacher supporting parents and the children themselves not to get involved in anything harmful wouldnt you
2007875 i would trust the combined sense held by the teacher supporting parents and the children themselves not to let the children be use as partisan political tools wouldnt you
2007876 clearly teachers permitting kids who wanted to write a petition to their local city council about a plan to remove a playground thats near school would be appropriate
2007877 clearly to you its about what they want as long as what they want is what you want
2007878 the students who had intended to go to see the house debate were denied entry to the parliamentary gallery after joining the protest
2007879 there is a simple litmus test to determine whether a sport is of olympic caliber does winning a gold medal trump anything else an athlete can do
2007880 dawn davenport is eating a meatball sandwich right out in class and shes been passing notes
2007881 20 years after i first testified before congress on the threats posed by climate change we have reached a point at which we must remove unnecessary carbon emissions from our lives or face catastrophic consequences it is hard to imagine waste more unnecessary than the 100 billion pieces of junk mail americans receive each year and these new findings revealing that the emissions of junk mail are equal to those of over nine million cars underscore the prudent necessity of a do not mail registry

2008320 every day it remains operational the grocerywatch website is only causing an embarrassment to the government and making the accc a laughing stock completely discredited in the eyes of the public
2008321 we argue against applying a pure market model to universities they are critically important to this country we dont want to see the risk of market failure as happened in the case of abc childcare effecting universities iru executive director lenore cooper told hes
2008322 special role of public universities should be preserved and that
2008323 the opening up of commonwealth supported places to private providers which are driven by the need to maximise profits for owners and shareholders will inevitably result in those providers moving into the most profitable market niches the submission states
2008324 regional and outer metropolitan universities would lose income due to community pressure to offer a full range of courses at low fees
2008325 lock institutions into their existing profiles stifle innovation in research and to deprive many australian regions of the research support that is required to stimulate regional development
2008326 irus view is that a university must be able to demonstrate research strength in a number of areas if an institution did not do enough research it could elect not to be a university and thus not to compete for research funds this would depend on how much research government specified was necessary for an institution to qualify as a university
2008327 there has been enormous change in the last decade and there will continue to be plenty of change but we dont want dramatic change cooper said source
2008328 most students can complete 13 years of school and be awarded a senior certificate without having to demonstrate minimally acceptable levels of proficiency across a range of fundamental areas
2008329 some things are so fundamental we should expect all students to achieve at least a minimum standard by the time they leave school
2008330 if someone is doing maths in years 11 and 12 then you can be pretty confident theyre going to pass a numeracy test
2008331 but not all students study maths or science for example in those years and theres no way of knowing what they understand
2008332 we should set the standard at the level we hope everyone should reach by the time they finish school
2008333 theres always a risk that standards are set too low and that the focus is then just on achieving low standards so there needs to be levels beyond a minimally acceptable standard
2008334 its postmodernism as intellectual radicalism if youre on the left politically you have to believe in all of this
2008335 there are other traditions of being left wing which respect the facts which dont believe the world is simply what we believe it to be that think if youre going to make political arguments you have to have evidence to support them i want to reinstate that kind of rigorous realistic left liberalism
2008336 postmodernism is addling the brain and wasting the time of some our brightest young people
2008337 this book is about what a group of intelligent students think postmodernism is
2008338 you could say they dont have it right they dont understand it they havent grasped it but if this is what they think postmodernism is if it has led them to argue in these ways then its educationally damaging irrespective of whether they have it right or not
2008339 calling these people terrorists distracts attention from the justice of their cause
2008340 they have a very narrow idea of how we use words
2008341 they believe words have given meanings and these meanings have certain biases or prejudices
2008342 clearly thats not true we use words to refer to things but we can refer to them ironically we can refer to them sarcastically doubtingly aggressively

2008359 they are very difficult to beat at home the crowd is from every report i get from every coach ive spoken with a real factor you have to learn to communicate without talking because talking doesnt do you any good
2008360 crowd noise is almost an unfair advantage you cant check plays you seemingly have less time on the play clock and everything starts to feel really rushed
2008361 theyre going to be loud from the first snap until the last snap they are right on top of you and theyre just relentless

2008387 most of the correction in home prices is behind us
2008388 the good news is that the steady improvement in sales will support price appreciation moving forward
2008389 after reaching what appears to be the bottom in the fourth quarter of 2006 we expect existing home sales to gradually rise all this year and well into 2008
2008390 although existing home sales will be marginally reduced due to subprime lending restrictions they should be gradually rising this year and next
2008391 tighter lending standards will dampen home sales a bit but by less than a couple of percentage points from initial projections
2008392 housing activity this year will be somewhat lower than in earlier forecasts
2008393 home sales will probably fluctuate in a narrow range in the short run but gradually trend upward with improving activity by the end of the year
2008394 home prices are expected to recover in 2008 with existing home sales picking up late this year
2008395 with the population growing the demand for homes isnt going away its just being delayed
2008396 patient buyers in most areas who do their homework will recognize that housing remains a good long term investment
2008397 the speculative excesses have been removed from the market and home sales are returning to fundamentally healthy levels while prices remain near record highs reflecting favorable mortgage rates and positive job gains
2008398 in some ways the extended real estate boom from 2001 to 2005 created unrealistic expectations that housing is a short term high yield investment 2007 will be the fifth best year for housing on record
2008399 the broad trend over the coming year will be a gradual rise in existing home sales but because sales are exceptionally low in the final months of 2007 total sales for 2008 will be only modestly higher than 2007
2008400 a meaningful recovery in existing home sales could occur as early as this spring or it may be further delayed toward late 2008
2008401 where builders have cut construction sharply and in most areas with improving affordability conditions well generally see moderately higher home prices
2008402 significant price declines in some local markets have sharply and quickly improved local affordability conditions and are inducing buyers to return to the marketplace
2008403 exceptionally weak home sales related to jumbo loans problems will depress home prices in the first half of the year but steady liquidity improvements in the conforming jumbo loan market will help prices recover in the second half of the year
2008404 although more than half of local markets are expected to see price growth this year the aggregate existing home price will decline 2 4 percent in 2008 driven by a relatively few markets that are very oversupplied
2008405 were seeing healthy price gains in moderately priced areas like erie pa and corpus christi texas and double digit gains in others
2008406 interestingly there have been reports of multiple bidding after the large price cuts so it is possible that most of the price declines have already occurred in those markets

2008442 we really do live in a 24 7 society and its not uncommon to be online and checking email at all hours of the day
2008443 expect resistance while s plans do not seem to be the hornets nest that marked trumps early proposals the local community board is skeptical of a host of issues and area politicians are cool to the idea of added density and a potential costco that extell has been meeting with the community on and off since acquiring the site in 2005 and now is hoping to kick off the project in the fall with a preliminary scoping hearing at the department of city planning some time later likely at least a few months the proposal would start its journey through the citys seven month public approval process which requires a thumbs up from both the city planning commission and the city council
2008444 now has set its sights on the final three lots at the southern base of the development known as lots l m and n and with no desire to build the 1 7 million square feet of predominantly television studio space that the 1992 agreement stipulates the developer wants public approval to allow for a giant complex of residential buildings in its place
2008445 the scale being proposed is significantly greater than what was initially planned for the site according to figures presented to members of the community board the complex would be about 3 million square feet in size with perhaps 2 500 apartments well above the approximately 2 4 million square feet that remains under the development rights allowed by the restrictive declaration in addition wants about 280 000 square feet of below ground retail space roughly half of which would go to costco should ultimately win the company as a tenant accompanied by 2 300 parking spaces up from about 780 in the restrictive declaration below grade space is not counted in the zoning measurements
2008446 theyre asking for unbelievably 2 300 more parking spaces in an area that is just so overwhelmed with traffic
2008447 as was the case in the 1990s the areas politicians will play a major role particularly the local council member until the end of 2009 thats gale brewer who is anti costco and pushing for a commitment to build a school on the site among other issues

2008454 the pole just kind of jumped out there in front of me plus it was a stick shift and id never driven one before
2008455 maybe but it wont be in the hole any time soon
2008456 you can spray it 20 yards wide and youre okay but if you spin off by six inches or one foot youre not its a shame
2008457 i love the guy plus hes a feel coach and im a feel player
2008458 the course is 7 500 yards long the greens are firm and the pins are tucked away
2008459 they are sucking the fun out of the major championships when you set it up like that the fairways are narrow and unfortunately if you miss the semi rough by a foot you are worse off than if you miss by 20 yards i asked my partners geoff ogilvy and zach johnson if i was out of order and they said no if you are slightly off line you are crucified it is too thick around the greens as well it takes the skill away from chipping
2008460 i cant think of a reason why they would do it other than to irritate the players
2008461 the rough is five inches long why brush it back at us it makes no sense people want to see birdies and they have not seen me make any i cant see anything wrong with being 9 or 10 under par for the week
2008462 you have to reward the accurate players like they did at the u s open
2008463 that was set up perfectly it rewards accuracy and penalizes you if you are off line i didnt see that today

2008465 copresence of different chronologies to explore the power of multiple temporalities in a single moment
2008466 what does this say for the average person on the street if we want them to co operate
2008467 how can we say to the ordinary citizen that you should report crimes tell the government what you know when the people who ran the department of justice thumb their noses at the system
2008468 schlozman was reshaping the civil rights division schlozman didnt know anything about voting law all he knew is he wanted to be sure that the republicans were going to win
2008469 unsubstantiated or false claims by the loser of a close race mischief and administrative or voter error
2008470 there is virtually no evidence that voter fraud ever occurs except by individuals and in rare instances
2008471 broke with established department policy by getting involved with contentious and partisan litigation on the eve of the election mr von spakovsky drafted legal briefs between the republican and democratic parties in three battleground states ohio michigan and florida just before the election all in favor of the republican partys position
2008472 these briefs ran counter to the well established practice of the civil rights division not to inject itself into litigation or election monitoring on the eve of an election where it would be viewed as expressing a political preference or could have an impact on a political dispute
2008473 they cooked up that there is a general exception to the policy because they wanted to prevent more fraud but indicting people before the election was not going to change anything registration had already closed there just wasnt a justification for bending the law
2008474 federal prosecutors and investigators should be extremely careful not to conduct overt investigations during the pre election period or while the elections are underway
2008475 a criminal investigation by armed badged federal agents runs the obvious risk of chilling legitimate voting and campaign activities
2008476 they created a system run off of servers controlled by afl national
2008477 we will only hire unionized web pros like all of us at prometheus to build our sites

2008480 not only does this show that islet transplantation can offer enormous benefits for brittle type 1 diabetes patients but we now know that a single standardized technique can be successfully applied at facilities around the world
2008481 this isnt an all or nothing procedure its not an issue of getting patients off insulin all together and keeping them that way as weve shown even partial survival of the transplanted islets can lead to significantly improved health in these patients its a tremendous result
2008482 the bottom line is that if islet transplantation is ever to become a viable treatment option for the majority of type 1 diabetes patients we need new tolerance therapies
2008483 the results of this study give us the foothold that we need in order to investigate these safer alternatives to immunosuppression
2008484 after the initial screenings the pace of the interviews and the requests for introductions increased i met many people christopher quinn said were celebrities a nice man very sincere shook my hand and spoke to me he said that his name was brad

2008497 we have been talking about a vegetable garden on the white house lawn this would be a way to talk about stewardship and nourishment thomas jefferson had such a garden

2008514 i went to slow food nations parent terra madre in italy
2008515 it was life changing i plan to go to slow food nation because i do not want to miss another chance for a life changing event
2008516 terra madre was a heart event it was a thrill to see families still making the food they have made for centuries you feel this human thing it was very emotional and made me cry some recipes for corn bread for example had been handed down for twenty generations
2008517 i love the apple farmers here in sonoma county they are courageous there is a history here that we need to remember
2008518 slow food is an opportunity to re connect with our food and local growers and to understand the plight our planet is in our immunity and the immune system of the earth are linked building from here is a source of our healing
2008519 it helps create a sense of what real nourishment is it brings farmers children and the community back into the food system rather than leaving it in the hands of large corporations slow food encourages people to grow and cook their own food and remember the pleasure in that
2008520 it was intense being around people from over 150 countries in their traditional dress who have this common bond and language of the land growing food preserving local food cultures preparing serving and nourishing others
2008521 they have a delicious heritage bean they so inspired me that i bought them as christmas presents and included information about slow food

2008527 they want an interactive education they are happy to be in the garden kids are not just hungry for food they are hungry for people to take care of them and for nature
2008528 the basic problem of course was the infamous studio system and its long term contract inducement the tantalizing lure of security was the bait in the trap it always sounded great a contract no more worry about where the next job was coming from a guaranteed income it was at best a mirage at worst a fraud the price if you had a scrap of talent or self confidence was too high you paid with your artistic freedom and the control of your career security was pure illusion

2008565 at the end of world war ii public schools in the united states spent a total of 1 214 per student in inflation adjusted 2002 dollars by the middle of the 1950s that figure had roughly doubled to 2 345 by 1972 it had almost doubled again reaching 4 479 and since then it has doubled a third time climbing to 8 745 in 2002
2008566 but every time we start moving in that direction something gets in the way i think it has to be like when we found michelle god has to be speaking to us
2008567 nobody can do science by a committee you do science by testing
2008568 to me it is appalling that an international organization of the stature of the u n would ignore the evidence of past climate changing
2008569 it has been a tough year for the high priests of global warming in the us first nasa had to correct its earlier claim that the hottest year on record in the contiguous us had been 1998 which seemed to prove that global warming was on the march it was actually 1934 then it turned out the worlds oceans have been growing steadily cooler not hotter since 2003 meanwhile the winter of 2007 was the coldest in the us in decades after al gore warned us that we were about to see the end of winter as we know it yet believers in man made global warming demand more and more money to combat climate change and still more drastic changes in our economic output and lifestyle the reason is that precisely that they are believers not scientists no amount of empirical evidence will overturn what has become not a scientific theory but a form of religion of superstition and enthusiasm describes how even in civilised societies the mind of man is subject to certain unaccountable terrors and apprehensions when real worries are missing as these enemies are entirely invisible and unknown like todays greenhouse gases people try to propitiate them by ceremonies observations mortifications sacrifices such as earth day and banning plastic bags and petrol driven lawnmowers fear and ignorance hume concludes are the true source of superstition they lead a blind and terrified public to embrace any practice however absurd or frivolous which either folly or knavery recommends
2008570 the scientific consensus is so strong and so universal there are just a handful of doubters on this

2008572 graham readfearn environment blogger graham readfearn sorts the green from the green wash and the eco from the no go one climate friendly posting at a time green news views and the odd shot down eco skeptic
2008573 i have never felt so concerned about a single policy issue in my professional life the reason is because it is being fundamentally misconstrued under the model by being a good global citizen australia by its own actions loses competitiveness against countries free riding on our efforts these countries gain from being slow to act or not acting at all as production shifts to them their imports decline and their exports increase the architecture of the policy is misconceived
2008574 if we cannot cut a deal on global trade liberalisation where even unilateral action confers benefits on most if not all countries what chance do we have of cutting a deal where such action confers zero or negative benefits and we only gain if we all move together
2008575 commercially the us china and india and others are unlikely to act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions based on an emissions trading system production based model
2008576 no more losses will be acceptable for promotion of distant climate change objectives
2008577 attempts to control australian production are likely to drive it offshore with less stringent or no policy controls over emissions
2008578 in a world where all countries acted together to deal with greenhouse gas emissions it wouldnt matter whether we targeted production or consumption but realistically we assume countries will not act together in this situation the difference between production and consumption is crucial
2008579 sets up incentives to shift local production economic activity and employment whether for exports or for import competition offshore
2008580 diverting production employment and trade to countries not acting in the same way to curb greenhouse gas emissions production
2008581 it cannot work or work very well in a world where producers can relocate production to where its most cost advantageous
2008582 carried to their logical and equitable conclusion would carve out all exports and all import competing local production
2008583 imagine the uproar if john howard had proposed a gst that hit exports and exempted imports instead of the other way around effectively that is the starting point for the current government this seems to be a policy no brainer
2008584 if as the government asserts failure is not an option then neither is failure of policy design
2008585 an exercise in cosmetics while still imposing new costs on our industry
2008586 in the present case we consider increases in the severity of storm events coupled with rising sea levels create a reasonably foreseeable risk of inundation of the subject land and the proposed dwellings which is unacceptable
2008587 there is a general consensus that some level of climate change will result in extreme weather conditions beyond the historical record that planners and others rely on
2008588 it is no longer sufficient to rely only on what has gone before to assess what may happen again in the context of coastal processes sea levels or for that matter inundation from coastal or inland storm events
2008589 it is not only the sales of one way fares that have increased but tickets for people making exploratory visits to australia

2008642 i became aware that certain medical specialty certification groups were adopting requirements which potentially violate a physicians right to choose whether he or she performs abortion
2008643 an april report from the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta found that african american mothers who are less likely than white or latina women to breastfeed are now doing so in record numbers sixty five percent of black women have nursed their infants at some point compared to 36 percent 14 years ago but only 20 percent of black mothers reach the governments target goal of exclusively breastfeeding when their infants are six months old
2008644 under the guise of being anti abortion the ideologically driven us neo conservatives have attacked and undermined legitimate family planning efforts in so doing they have helped fan the flames of the aids epidemic which now kills 6 000 africans every day and creates millions of orphans in the process
2008645 i was stunned by the numbers since i didnt expect that wed get that kind of gap
2008646 i would have taken it far less seriously if we didnt get the exact opposite result with the mccain question
2008647 people may have campaign fatigue and its coming out as obama fatigue

2008650 obama has gone from someone who is dynamic to someone who to the use the old woody hayes football line just tries for three yards and a cloud of dust
2008651 the discomfort of some progressives with any hint of religiosity has often inhibited us from effectively addressing issues in moral terms
2008652 some of the problem is rhetorical scrub language of all religious content and we forfeit the imagery and terminology through which millions of americans understand both their own personal morality and social justice
2008653 when we shy away from religious venues and religious broadcasts others will fill the vacuum

2008658 i have been monitoring the press reports on chinese governments effort on making the beijing olympics games environmentally friendly
2008659 some efforts and investments are very positive but some other efforts are purely administrative and cosmetic measures such as closing many heavy polluters factories around beijing just for olympics
2008660 refugee youth have often suffered terribly and witnessed war first hand
2008661 some refugees are born in camps others grow up in camps which can mean a lifetime with little or no access to sport or recreation the gift of sportswear from olympic athletes around the globe inspires refugees and connects them to the world of sports beyond happiness it brings them hope
2008662 i am thrilled by this success and the strong support of the olympic family so far
2008663 of course we want to go much higher now the bigger impact we can make with this campaign the better i am convinced that with our common efforts we can collect many more items

2008670 we have upwards of 100 military trainers who are in georgia now weve been able to account for all of them
2008671 we have forces in georgia so obviously the secretary is interested in the situation there
2008672 what they do in a situation like this is contact the embassy contact our troops there assess the situation and begin to receive any information or request for support from the embassy or any reports about us citizens being in danger
2008673 at this point we are early in the hostilities the situation is sort of dynamic at this point
2008674 we are looking at the situation and how it develops its still early
2008675 this week we commemorate the signing of the voting rights act a bill that has come to be known as one of the most important pieces of civil rights legislation in history its mission was to promote democracy by tearing down institutional barriers to voter registration and polling places and represents our core democratic values this legislation has brought enormous advancement but there is more work to be done to improve the voting process and ensure it is fair and accessible to all thats why the democratic party is still working everyday to fulfill the full promise of the voting rights acts and make it easier to register to vote cast a ballot and know your vote counts and we need a president committed to the enforcement of the voting rights act and protecting the rights of all citizens to participate in the electoral process
2008676 my contention has always been consistent on this that even in a secularized nominal muslim population eg kosovo granting that point leaves the door open for the radicalization of those who decide at some point that they wish to recover their faith or live it more fully

2008678 sen obama says he wants peace sen john mccain said today at a town hall styled rally in lima ohio but the democratic candidate for president will not acknowledge the success of the surge in iraq
2008679 his policy of unconditional withdrawal regardless of conditions on the ground could result in renewed violance said mccain who at the end of a long speech

2008705 borrowed from a bioweapons lab that fall freeze drying equipment that allows scientists to quickly convert wet germ cultures into dry spores
2008706 the drying device known as a lyopholizer could help investigators explain how he might have been able to send letters containing deadly anthrax spores to u s senators and news organizations
2008707 the device was not commonly used by researchers at the armys sprawling biodefense complex at fort detrick md
2008708 if you google lyophilize and anthrax most of the pages returned are about anthrax vaccines which is what dr ivins was working on at ft detrick
2008709 let me reiterate no matter how good the microbial forensics may be they can only at best link the anthrax to a particular strain and lab they cannot link it to any individual

2008729 for instance we might see how a deeply rational zen teacher someone who has a really deep practice but is embedded in a very materialistic level of development has no room to understand the very subtle but powerful shamanistic aspects of zen that can emerge they are seen as ritualistic and archaic but in fact for people who are able to hold an integral perspective they are able to see the energetic function of those things

2008733 comparing obamas and mccains financial ties to the oil industry theres no question that mccain has benefited more from the industrys contributions just as his republican party has for years and years
2008734 obamas edge with the oil producers americans know best and might be cursing most these days makes it harder for him to continue to tar mccain as the industrys darling

2008745 there are no provisions for collection of the money which is their point that if we didnt pay it they have no way of making us pay

2008758 i have met foreigners working at the hindu mint gq the hindustan times and times of india

2008811 would confirm for me the way that the gun lobby works which is no rules no question of fairness or honesty anything that they can do they will do to protect the profits of the gun industry
2008812 this reinforces what we have long known that the gun lobby will go to any lengths no matter how unethical to protect the profits of the gun industry in this country even at the expense of the over 30 000 americans who lose their lives to gun violence each year

2008871 kami mengingatkan agar majlis peguam jangan cuba bermain dengan api isu hal ehwal islam adalah isu sangat sensitif kepada umat islam
2008872 tindakan ini jelas cuba menghidupkan semula usaha terdahulu yang dilakukan oleh beberapa kelompok dari majlis peguam bagi menubuhkan ifc dan kemudian diikuti pula oleh satu lagi usaha dari kumpulan yang menggelarkan dirinya sebagai kumpulan artikel 11
2008873 kami menegaskan bahawa majlis peguam tidak ada hak untuk memandai mandai dan cuba membahaskan hal yang berkaitan dengan undang undang islam secara terbuka
2008874 kami mendesak supaya forum ini dihentikan oleh pihak berkuasa kerana ia boleh membawa kepada kemarahan masyarakat islam yang tidak mahu undang undang islam dicabar oleh mana mana pihak
2008875 tindakan berkenaan adalah suatu usaha yang terancang yang disusun oleh pihak tertentu untuk secara berterusan mempertikaikan hak hak yang terkandung dalam perlembagaan terhadap islam
2008876 kami memberi amaran kepada majlis peguam agar menghentikan segera penganjuran forum berkenaan atau menghadapi tindakan penentangan serius umat islam di negara ini
2008877 justeru kami mahu perbincangan terbuka persoalan yang sensitif ini dihentikan segera

2008891 though unknown to many state and federal lawmakers the nonprofit sector if called upon by the nations leaders holds a rare opportunity to unleash the full force of americas entrepreneurial spirit with a drive and commitment that can solve our nations most challenging domestic problems through this effort the nonprofit sector would be clearly recognized for what it truly is a thriving and indispensable component of americas economy but to produce such sea change results nonprofit innovation and solutions must be applied on a national scale and achieving this result will take a bold and enterprising merger of governmental and nonprofit sector forces and resources to ignite and achieve this transformational merger the nonprofit sector must focus on a range of steps particularly its full engagement in the political process
2008892 look at the ethnic media in this country it is overtaking the new york times because people dont see their stories on the newspaper
2008893 if you want to see more workshops about latino media you need to submit a proposal

2008903 im interested in the year 2012 because of the various fascinating thoughts and theories being put forward as to what will happen on december 21st of that year there is a plethora of information relating to 2012 it seems everyone has an opinion on it these days but unfortunately not everyone can be right if nothing else though it makes for some great reading and viewing and it really is great that people can become so impassioned about a subject even if that passion is misguided will the world come to an end personally i dont think so there have been too many instances in the past where prophets have predicted the untimely demise of the earth and theyve never once been right it seems were not comfortable as a species unless our impending doom is tangible im not sure of the implications of the mayan calendar running out i dont think that its occurred to anybody that the calendar had to expire at sometime and it doesnt necessarily signify anything of consequence its just given fodder to those people who need to believe that something will happen in 2012 one theory i am particularly interested in though is the one regarding a change on the planet specifically the one regarding a change within us all whatever that may mean exactly for some reason recently ive had a yearning to learn more about the universe and the implications coming out of quantum theory regarding consciousness and i get the feeling that im not the only one who is feeling the urge to know more maybe this is what the mayans were referring to that mankind will actually begin to finally understand its place in the universe and undergo a spiritual transformation which will bring us all closer to one another i read somewhere recently that 2012 will be the year we make full contact with an alien civilisation although i am an avid believer in the ufo phenomenon i cant see this happening if aliens wanted to get in contact with us properly theyve had plenty of opportunities in the past century and i think the fact that they havent shows that contact isnt on their agenda im also not entirely sure that they are actually alien either because of the distances involved when traversing our galaxy and im subscribing more and more to the theory that they are of this planet that they are a race whove existed on this planet longer than mankind has been around but they have no wish to be let themselves be known for reasons known only to themselves if we do make contact with this other earth race in 2012 i would imagine itll be because this race will finally have to make themselves known to raise concerns about the way we mankind is slowly destroying the planet they share alongside us whatever happens in 2012 if anything happens im sure of one thing the build up will be a fascinating experience

2008915 a slave who spoke disrespectfully to a muslim could be roasted alive crucified or impaled a stake was driven through the arms until it came out at the back of the neck a special agony was reserved for a slave who killed a muslim he would be cast over the city walls and left to dangle on giant iron hooks for days before expiring of his wounds
2008916 we need to understand the mechanisms of inflammation in order to make new drugs that will break the link between inflammation and disease and to develop predictive biomarkers
2008917 one of our goals is to develop biomarkers that can tell if you have inflammation and to define its extent severity and location
2008918 that observation overturns the prevailing theory for predicting the location of dna damage in the genome and complicates our understanding of the basis for diseases arising from chronic inflammation
2008919 but it is likely to stir up discussions in the dna damage and mutagenesis fields that could help us better understand the consequences of inflammation

2008947 i think it is a wake up call for the pro choice community that we cannot rely on circular referrals without doing our own due diligence every single time we find a new hotline purporting to do unbiased abortion or pregnancy options counseling

2009102 no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the dnc and with the obama campaign
2009103 its a reflection of genuine frustration by hillary clinton supporters that sen obama seems to have forgotten about 18 million voters

2009163 its not about the terrorists its about us its about what kind of country we are
2009164 is to make it clear to the world that this government does not torture and that we adhere to the international convention of torture whether it be here at home or abroad

2009210 firstgold welcomes the confidence that the investment group that funded the loan has demonstrated in our ongoing development at relief canyon with this investment we had always planned to add some debt in our capital structure in the development of our relief canyon processing facilities the challenges of the debt market today produced a higher cost than we had planned but does provide us with funding necessary to get relief canyon operational from this point forward 100 of our efforts will be spent on getting relief canyon online and in proving up a resource at relief canyon and our other nevada properties
2009211 our stock has suffered due to the fear that perhaps we would not obtain the financing we needed to get relief canyon operational with this investment we hope to put those fears to rest while we recognize this was an expensive financing issuing equity at our current levels would have been much more costly now that we have this capital in place we plan to communicate the progress we have made to our shareholders and the investment community at some point in the near term as investors become aware of our prospects and convinced of our progress we would expect our stock to find its true value

2009218 as president i am committed to developing a national aids strategy to decrease new hiv infections and improve health outcomes for americans living with hiv aids
2009219 combating hiv aids also demands closing the gaps in opportunity that exist in our society so that we can strengthen our public health we must also overcome the stigma that surrounds hiv aids a stigma that is too often tied to homophobia we need to encourage folks to get tested and accelerate hiv aids research toward an effective cure because we have a moral obligation to join together to meet this challenge and to do so with the urgency this epidemic demands

2009241 endlessly surprising delightfully profane an unfiltered often ferocious expression of his boots on the ground point of view of the iraq war
2009242 if in 20 years time people want to know what it was like to fight in iraq they can pick up my war and find out it tells what its like to be a grunt fighting in the sunni triangle with more power and authority than the best embedded reporter could manage it is something of a triumph for blogs over traditional media

2009251 forums on sensitive topics are best discussed in closed sessions
2009252 the forum is not about conversion per se as the bar council endorses the right of individuals to embrace islam instead the forum will address the ancillary issues that arise from such situations and will emphasis the need for laws and a judicial system that protects everyone equally
2009253 concerns of some quarters including a number of cabinet ministers such as deputy prime minister najib abdul razak home minister syed hamid albar minister in charge of islamic affairs ahmad zaid hamidi and various ngos and pas are noted

2009258 it wants to and is ready to exchange views in public even difficult issues in efforts to further strengthen national unity and foster interfaith harmony
2009259 discourse on issues confronting the nation cannot take place only at official levels behind closed doors but must be inclusive and involve the public and those whose lives are affected by them
2009260 calls to halt discussions on any issue imply that there are aspects to those issues that the public does not have a right to know about which is counter to the principles of the open progressive and democratic society that we have evolved into
2009261 we believe that the continued suppression of open and respectful discourse not public forums that will cause tension and jeopardise national unity

2009288 to me it is remarkable that we want to say athletes should shut up and just play in everyday context they are good enough to tell us what cereals to eat what shoes to wear about anti obesity or whatever but when it comes to a fundamental tenet of human rights somehow they are not good enough if we want them to be holistic role models then lets let them be holistic role models
2009289 the legacy of most elite athletes is to be completely vanilla i played basketball for many years and the idea that my legacy to this world is putting a ball in a hole is unsatisfactory to me if people are satisfied they can play a great forehand volley or make a birdie from a bunker if thats enough for them then i cannot comment but it is not enough of a legacy when the opportunity to change the world is in your grasp

2009695 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
2009696 my kid is like oh so smiley and he just see me and he just want to hug me and come with me im happy because my kid is so cute
2009697 they were trying to say you take the property you take the money but dont take the child we will not give the child
2009698 we are keen on first and second time funds they should be specialist funds with unique skills in executing deals
2009699 the key thing is we are interested in sponsoring new funds we are open to new groups who have unique edges and we are looking to be the first institutional money in that fund
2009700 we are not interested in generic funds who sit out of bombay and receive calls from investment bankers
2009701 we are looking at funds who have specialist skills strong teams industry experience and the skills to execute deals

2009710 i have been thinking that i would make a proposition to my republican friends that if they will stop telling lies about the democrats we will stop telling the truth about them
2009711 i dont think it is the governments business to tell you how to spend your leisure time
2009712 this notion that we somehow have to either approve or criminalize all human activity is a great misunderstanding of whats needed for a liberal in the broad sense government in which people are free to do as they wish unless they are damaging somebody else or unless in rare cases you believe they are so out of control that they cant be trusted to make their own judgments
2009713 what weve had is particularly under this administration the spectacle of people who believe in limited government and states rights sending federal law enforcement people in to prosecute people who have used medical marijuana in conformance with their own states laws
2009714 we need to stop wasting federal tax dollars to punish responsible adults who use small personal amounts of marijuana
2009715 the federal government has better things to do than prosecute sick people who are following their doctors orders and obeying the states laws
2009716 this legislation will bring relief to persons suffering excruciating pain from debilitating illnesses and redirect scarce law enforcement resources to combating criminal activities that pose a serious threat to public safety
2009717 this should be our policy with marijuana as well as president carter said in a message to congress almost 31 years ago to this day penalties against drug use should not be more damaging to the individual than the drug itself nowhere is this more clear than the laws against possession of marijuana in private for personal use

2009726 the latest less than subtle mark of the increasingly far fetched keep relevant campaign brought to you by his highly compensated spin butlers comes in todays new york s where a story states
2009727 similar stories elsewhere have already made the next president the next new york governor and the next vice president is many things but he is none of those and he is leaving office at the end of next year and there will be an election no matter how uncomfortable it makes certain members of the municipal oligarchy

2009730 we retroactively track any quest achievements or any achievement for an item which is either on your character or in your bank
2009731 there are a lot of achievements based on stuff like honorable kills or reputations we have all that tracked
2009732 theres a quest associated with killing onyxia like the turn in her head quest
2009733 we know if youve done that but the problem is not everybody whos killed onyxia has necessarily gotten the head and turned it in so theres a fairness issue its like well i raided with these guys but bob got the head and then he turned it in and then when the achievement goes live his achievement will be filled out but mine wont so there might be understandability issues there like well how come he got it but i didnt so thats something were actually feeling out in the beta im torn on that right now
2009734 guarantees itll be easy for unscrupulous players to cheat and thats obviously whats going on here

2009749 between 1964 to 1967 any iraqi jews who wanted to leave iraq had no choice but to cross the border illegally to iran
2009750 things took a turn for the worse after the 1967 arab israeli war
2009751 however in my mind the key single event that made the iraqi jewish community realise they were no longer welcome or wanted in iraq took place in january 1969
2009752 i remember that we went to bed on the night of the ruling not knowing what was going to happen and whether the death sentences would be carried out
2009753 i remember rounding on my parents and accusing them of being heartless and cruel for bringing me into this world when they should have known the cruelty and savagery of the ordinary iraqi population
2009754 thereafter my one and only aim was to survive and leave iraq as soon as possible
2009755 i never spoke or shared my experience of iraq with my children
2009756 go back to iraq the romantic part of me would like to take my children to witness their fathers childhood memories the practical part of me says never in a million years

2009774 this decision is very disappointing and frankly represents a blind eye by the federal government to the high food prices that texas families are struggling with each day

2009900 the power to prosecute is one of the most awesome powers of the state without proper checks and balances it can easily be abused by those in power to humiliate and discredit innocent people
2009901 even when the injustice is corrected its victims are often left with their reputations permanently damaged
2009902 in malaysia the power to prosecute is being used to try to discredit
2009903 the malaysian authorities need to recognise that there is no way that continued pursuit of criminal charges can be viewed as credible given the history of prosecutorial abuse and manipulation of evidence
2009904 we are deeply concerned that the safety freedom and reputation of an important leader in the muslim world are at risk
2009905 so too is the integrity of malaysias judicial system and along with it the credibility of the government in general the future of malaysia as an example of success for the developing world and for the entire muslim world may be at stake
2009906 would likely pose an enormous financial and reputational risk to the company and the country

2009913 anyone who has heard his own songs played by cy immediately has a greater respect for his own work though utterly respectful of the composers and songwriters whose music he plays he is also highly complex both rhythmically and harmonically in his interpretations of their music all the while maintaining a constant balance of delicacy and sensitiveness

2009925 i find it interesting that more economists are not on the record saying that
2009926 obviously if you do offshore drilling now its not going to give any short term help on the supply of oil thats far away
2009927 i have a problem linking the drilling to current gas prices for political reasons the reality is there is no correlation between todays prices and what gasoline will be discovered in the outer shelf
2009928 it wont make any difference whatsoever on gas prices because new oil that could be found and produced on the new outer continental shelf wont take place for at least eight to 10 years
2009929 drilling in the gulf starting today is not going to give us any relief this year next year or the year after
2009930 its absurd to argue that ending the moratorium on drilling off parts of the u s coasts would quickly bring down the high price of gasoline
2009931 would starting to drill now do anything for consumers in the near future the answer to this one is probably not since itll take so long for new oil or gas to come to market
2009932 opening off shore drilling would have no impact whatsoever on gas prices today
2009933 ill keep fighting for a podium or even a victory this year because that will prove that im still here

2009938 in terms of receivers running backs and the whole scheme of things its going to be a lot like 05
2009939 im thinking people will notice the difference in our offense
2009940 we have so much talent what coach paterno and the offensive staff are trying to do is get everybody to touch the ball and give you an opportunity to make a play we have so many weapons and so many ways to get the ball into the end zone its exciting theres definitely a lot more opportunities than before

2009949 i am a die hard penn state fan and absolutely enjoyed the penn state ohio state game this past weekend however like the pittsburgh steelers in the kordell stewart days penn state will never have a real chance at the national championship against the high powered offenses like usc until they get a quality quarterback to take advantage of the speedy receivers in the northwestern game michael robinson overthrew so many wide open receivers that there is no way penn state can take advantage of their speed if they have no one to throw to them in your opinion would anthony morelli be a better fit looks like a great 2006

2009964 to me the overly bold way she writes is proof that there are deeper issues than jus women and their rights it sounds funny to me then she cries about ppl attacking her why wont they if you cant take the heat then stay out of the kitchen you create the situation then you cry to the sky about it some logic
2009965 her blog is in the public domain you might have missed that one word make a world of difference
2009966 in any other public forum she would be canned and packed off in a jiffy
