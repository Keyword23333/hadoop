9010311 el conflicto no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
9010312 el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
9010313 la m s importante que haya habido en el pa s por cierto la m s sangrienta
9010314 de modo incomprensible el gobierno se demor m s de 90 d as en dar respuesta a la huelga de hambre de patricia troncoso que la prensa tambi n acall
9010315 no fue porque exista una conspiraci n del silencio lo que hay es una autorrepresi n psicol gica en la sociedad chilena frente al conflicto con el pueblo mapuche creemos que si no lo vemos desaparece
9010316 neruda sol a viajar desde temuco a puerto saavedra pues all un colono de apellido winter le prestaba libros en ese tiempo el poeta escribi sus primeras obras los borradores de los veinte poemas de amor pero en todos ellos no hay un solo indio neruda no los vio y eso que en puerto saavedra no hay m s que arena olas y mapuches
9010317 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
9010318 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo
9010319 esta es una vieja historia cargada de decepci n y frustraciones
9010320 no hay museo m s chic en chile que el museo de arte precolombino
9010321 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
9010322 nunca los ej rcitos chileno y argentino han demostrado mayor grado de cooperaci n y fraternidad que durante la pacificaci n de la araucan a que los argentinos conocen como
9010323 nosotros reconocemos en los mapuches a nuestros ancestros pero andar pregonando que uno ha matado al padre es feo
9010324 si ese fondo no hubiera existido acota bengoa hoy el problema ser a inmanejable
9010325 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
9010326 el primer gran desaf o que enfrent la conadi fue pronunciarse respecto del proyecto de construcci n de la central hidroel ctrica ralco que requer a aprobar la permuta de terrenos ind genas como los delegados del presidente en dicha organizaci n votaron en contra frei los cambi as la conadi perdi su legitimidad cuando se estrenaba en sociedad
9010327 el informe qued archivado en alg n escritorio en la moneda de donde no volvi a salir
9010328 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
9010329 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
9010330 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
9010331 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
9010332 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio
9010333 todas est n ah exclusivamente por resoluci n de los tribunales han tenido todas las garant as de un debido proceso
9010334 en chile no hay presos pol ticos las personas que est n privadas de libertad todas est n ah exclusivamente por resoluci n de los tribunales han tenido todas las garant as de un debido proceso
9010335 se alaba que las c rceles concesionadas visit santiago 1 y rancagua est n en la primera l nea de lo que l ha visto en el continente no solamente en sudam rica
9010336 no hay en ning n caso en chile pr ctica de torturas ni en ning n caso permisividad o complacencia o hacer la vista a un lado en caso de malos tratos si es necesario son investigados y sancionados si corresponde
9010337 p rez yoma rechaz duramente el ultim tum de agricultores de la araucan a
9010338 agricultores de temuco dieron 10 d as a p rez yoma para visitar la zona
9010339 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
9010340 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
9010341 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
9010342 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
9010343 intercambio de informaci n para una mayor operatividad en la regi n de la araucan a fue el objetivo de la reuni n de seguridad que convoc el ministerio del interior y que tuvo la participaci n de la polic a civil carabineros la agencia nacional de inteligencia y un representante del fiscal nacional sabas chahu n quien no estuvo presente
9010344 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches
9010345 hay que mirarlo en su justa medida hay que darle la oportunidad a las polic as que trabajen tranquilas porque esta es una investigaci n de largo aliento no son investigaciones de un d a para otro para tener un resultado hay que tener paciencia
9010346 estamos tratando de obtener la mayor informaci n y yo he reforzado la cantidad de funcionarios para ver si podemos detener a las personas que corresponden de acuerdo a las instrucciones de los fiscales
9010347 chile consagra formalmente una nueva mirada sobre la discapacidad que deber a contribuir a poner al d a nuestra legislaci n y nuestras pol ticas p blicas
9010348 bachelet promulga convenci n internacional sobre derechos de los discapacitados
9010349 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
9010350 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
9010351 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones
9010352 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado
9010353 hechos como el de este domingo el atentado en vilc n claramente est n absolutamente fuera del marco de trabajo en el cual la conadi est funcionando
9010354 si es necesario ir iremos nuevamente si es por m s carabineros m s carabineros mandaremos
9010355 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia
9010356 no muy presente en los libros pero si muy viva en la memoria oral de nuestro pueblo
9010357 d nde est curalaba d nde se firm el parlamento de quillen en qu lugar naci kilapan son preguntas que intento responder rescatando lugares geogr ficos y efem rides que debieran llenarnos de orgullo como naci n
9010358 como una tremenda ayuda para los estudiantes pero especialmente para aquellos padres que al ser consultados por sus hijos por sus amistades o por la misma escuela no tienen m s que decir que lo que reza la araucana
9010359 entre dos provincias chilenas concepci n y valdivia se intercala un pedazo de pa s que no es provincia donde se habla distinto siendo habitada por otra gente y que a n puede decirse que no es chile s chile se llama el pa s donde flota su bandera y son obedecidas sus leyes
9010360 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
9010361 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
9010362 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
9010363 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido
9010364 no s si alonso puede estar tranquilo depende de l no me gusta ver a un gran campe n como l no estar entre los diez primeros en valencia pero respecto a ferrari s puede estar tranquilo
9010365 todas las cr ticas a raikkonen me recuerdan cuando inzaghi estaba en la juventus y estaba tres partidos sin marcar y todo el mundo dec a que estaba en crisis
9010366 kimi est motivado y debemos trabajar para darle las condiciones para que est m s adelante sobre todo en estos circuitos nuevos que no me gustan nada y que le hacen da o a la f rmula 1 porque no se puede adelantar y de nueve sobre diez veces gana el que consigue la pole
9010367 la jerarqu a la marca el cron metro no el presidente
9010368 no tengo ning n problema y el presidente no me ha dicho nada en particular
9010369 i mean people have access to health care in america after all you just go to an emergency room
9010370 gov palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government gov palins success is due to her dedication to principle and her roll up your sleeves work ethic and serves as a wonderful example of the spirit of america by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done sen mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9010371 gov palin is an independent leader who has fought the special interests on behalf of the people of alaska the mccain palin ticket will appeal to voters across party lines
9010372 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9010373 gov palins views align with sen mccains own stated position that human life is precious and must be protected this selection by sen mccain is a very encouraging sign for his campaign
9010374 i believe that in order to make government work better it must include both strong men and women with this historic choice sen mccain has clearly shown his and the republican partys commitment to including every voice in our society
9010375 holy cow im just kind of speechless on the whole thing
9010376 this is a bold and exciting pick that demonstrates the republican party is focused on the future and changing how washington d c does business as an outsider gov palin has a solid record of making government work better including fighting for landmark ethics reform
9010377 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9010378 i am pleased with sen mccains pick for vice president gov palin is an outstanding terrific pick for the job for the country for the republican party and for the citizens we try to serve
9010379 on his 72nd birthday is this really the one heartbeat away he wants to put in the white house
9010380 gov palin is a strong conservative with executive experience who has cut wasteful spending opposed earmarks and shown courage in taking on corruption in her own party
9010381 john mccain has made clear from the start that he wants to change washington and he proved it today by going as far away from washington as possible in selecting his running mate eighty eight years after our nations women first gained the right to vote this selection demonstrates how far our nation has come
9010382 theyre conservatives going to be excited about this pick because heres an authentic person who believes and does what she says in her policy atmosphere and can authentically carry that message to the country
9010383 she will strengthen sen mccains appeal to reagan democrats and supporters of sen hillary clinton who are looking for a president who has the experience and temperament to be commander in chief
9010384 people would go up start kneeling at the front praying
9010385 the worship team would crowd around them and pray over them this would make them start to throw up
9010386 i know it was frustrating to him watching his fathers church disappear
9010387 i knew he felt an obligation with this dream he had
9010388 you cant have people become hyper spiritualized because they lose touch with reality
9010389 walk a mile in these shoes the stories they tell

9010393 its clear to me theres been a division within the sikh temple and the community there are sides being taken a big discussion and its become quite difficult for both sides
9010394 he dealt with that and didnt tell a soul this was the first day he was going to tell another human being on earth what had happened
9010395 the courts simply cannot sanction individuals even individuals who themselves may be victims of horrendous crimes taking the law in any way into their own hands and confronting their alleged perpetrators

9010405 i believe the smithsonian is in a good place now

9010420 gov palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government gov palins success is due to her dedication to principle and her roll up your sleeves work ethic and serves as a wonderful example of the spirit of america by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done sen mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9010421 gov palin is an independent leader who has fought the special interests on behalf of the people of alaska the mccain palin ticket will appeal to voters across party lines
9010422 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9010423 gov palins views align with sen mccains own stated position that human life is precious and must be protected this selection by sen mccain is a very encouraging sign for his campaign
9010424 i believe that in order to make government work better it must include both strong men and women with this historic choice sen mccain has clearly shown his and the republican partys commitment to including every voice in our society
9010425 holy cow im just kind of speechless on the whole thing
9010426 this is a bold and exciting pick that demonstrates the republican party is focused on the future and changing how washington d c does business as an outsider gov palin has a solid record of making government work better including fighting for landmark ethics reform
9010427 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9010428 i am pleased with sen mccains pick for vice president gov palin is an outstanding terrific pick for the job for the country for the republican party and for the citizens we try to serve
9010429 on his 72nd birthday is this really the one heartbeat away he wants to put in the white house
9010430 gov palin is a strong conservative with executive experience who has cut wasteful spending opposed earmarks and shown courage in taking on corruption in her own party
9010431 john mccain has made clear from the start that he wants to change washington and he proved it today by going as far away from washington as possible in selecting his running mate eighty eight years after our nations women first gained the right to vote this selection demonstrates how far our nation has come
9010432 theyre conservatives going to be excited about this pick because heres an authentic person who believes and does what she says in her policy atmosphere and can authentically carry that message to the country
9010433 she will strengthen sen mccains appeal to reagan democrats and supporters of sen hillary clinton who are looking for a president who has the experience and temperament to be commander in chief

9010437 one of the most reliable sources of scathing rebuttal to the left wing media has become known for its humorous but biting style his regular verbal assault on labour ministers has quite a reputation

9010444 i am impressed with the dexterity of mr e linguistic and otherwise
9010445 i rather enjoyed the retort of the blogger known as mr eugenides
9010446 a ship in harbor is safe but thats not why the ship is built
9010447 it turns out that the women in america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling
9010448 you have done so much for africa so much for tanzania when you compare no us president has done so much for africa and for tanzania as you have done
9010449 zimbabwe is a common problem darfur is a common problem we are in the front line and of course those of us who are in the front line always look to the rear to continue to support us
9010450 and there has been such extraordinary support support of us in the continent we continue to work together
9010451 i also am looking forward to continuing our discussions on issues like zimbabwe or darfur these are issues that the president is most familiar with issues in which he has got good judgment about how to proceed
9010452 your money is being spent wisely and compassionately in tanzania and a lot of it has to do with the leadership of the president
9010453 everyone will know that when you come here it is public service

9010458 it was a good way to finish the series but the indians played well and deserved to win it
9010459 credit goes to the boys for the way we came back we kept making mistakes through the series we were not consistent in the batting department
9010460 it was good to win the series with a game to spare
9010461 these tracks are said to be slow but the bounce has improved over the last few years i am happy with the way our batsmen have played the spin it was important to keep the strike rotating and our batsmen did that well

9010464 carr is funny enough that you can almost forgive him made me want to vomit for all the right reasons
9010465 it is pretty audacious for the obama campaign to say that gov palin is not qualified to be vice president she has a record of accomplishment that sen obama simply cannot match
9010466 gov palin has spent her time in office shaking up government in alaska and actually achieving results whether its taking on corruption passing ethics reform or stopping wasteful spending and the bridge to nowhere senator obama has spent his time in office running for president
9010467 is a story but its also a platform for ideas i think people like the gossip girl connection the idea of people watching and talking about each other is something thats very real to their lives
9010468 when i first found out what a show runner was i thought it was the strangest job i had heard of in my life
9010469 when someones a writer its very creative and moody and you think of someone walking around the office in pajamas thinking of ideas on the other hand as a television producer you have to be buttoned up organized and a feed the machine type of person the idea that those two creatures were supposed to inhabit the same body was really a strange thing
9010470 when they sent me the books i said ill do this if stephanie does this
9010471 shes really tapped into young women and whats exciting for them i knew the material was a little female weighted for someone as ignorant of the female species as myself and stephanie would have great insight into it
9010472 i was excited it was this world that i loved and felt wasnt represented enough on tv
9010473 there was nothing that had that beautiful romantic woody allen version of new york
9010474 there was so much in the book there were very bold characters and i felt like there was a way to add humanity and dimensionality to them
9010475 when people say the show glamorizes teen drinking and sex they arent really watching the episodes
9010476 not all the characters drink or have sex and when they do its always put in a context behaviors are rooted in character theres decision making regret and consequences involved
9010477 do i wish we got better broadcast ratings yes i wish they gave us more money to make the show
9010478 for us its about how did you matter do people care and do they pay attention to what youre doing i think the show is really succeeding in terms of getting people excited and giving them something to talk about
9010479 before we shot anything she knew i didnt love the way dan looked on the page so she told me dont play to the words on the page
9010480 it was a huge confidence builder to stand in front of 34 21 year olds and explain something to them every day
9010481 to be in a room and have to explain your point of view is a huge skill in hollywood
9010482 its going to focus on putting people both friend wise and romance wise with people you wouldnt necessarily expect
9010483 watching these relationships develop will be very satisfying for the audience
9010484 and yall know how i am about polls so i had to give my opinion on some things
9010485 western wonders voters in mountain region often hard to figure
9010486 if the purpose of protest zones is freedom of speech this is not the place to do it
9010487 you would have to dramatically change the nature of what you do much less partisan much less political
9010488 its going to be a very interesting campaign i must say that several months ago i said that it would be great if there was a woman on the ticket that i felt that john mccain would have to pick someone especially if hillary was the nominee but without hillary being the nominee its really quite equally as important because people are looking for a historic campaign and i think this might do it there are a lot of women who are disaffected by how hillary was treated by the media by how she was treated by the obama campaign by how she was treated by the democratic national committee howard dean not speaking up when sexism raised its ugly head in the media
9010489 it is unlikely that soco trends improve near term as we expect on premise to remain weak
9010490 i have been fired i will be making a statement later
9010491 i am delighted with john mccains choice for running mate governor sarah palin will bring with her a wealth of life experience to the white house from serving as a popular and effective leader of alaska to balancing her personal life as a wife and mother she is a reformer and a public servant that hoosier women and all hoosiers can relate to
9010492 it was a deeply substantive speech full of policy detail full of people other than the candidate centered overwhelmingly on domestic economic anxiety
9010493 what he didnt do was give an airy abstract dreamy confection of rhetoric if the rove republicans thought they were playing with a patsy they just got a reality check
9010494 its hard to imagine there are people in this country that can not at least feel inspired by obama even if they do not plan to vote for him
9010495 im so excited to have been a part of the group answering those questions
9010496 residents and other doctors tease me i dont know todays date but i could tell you about every child their last hemoglobin level their grandmothers name their dogs name
9010497 before starting a practice i tell all my residents they need to experience parenting first
9010498 i am proud of my mom and i am eternally grateful of the woman who despite the demands of medicine found time to raise me which was extraordinary in itself
9010499 i walk to work i walk back from work im at home at 6 oclock in my pajamas watching television
9010500 its important to be aware of whats going on in your medium
9010501 it gives you an indication of what youre doing right and wrong or gives you something to shake your fist at in defiance
9010502 a unique capacity to lead our increasingly diverse nation and to restore our leadership in an ever more interdependent world
9010503 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
9010504 i turn it over to god and think theres nothing i can do about it and i also think what are the odds ive been flying for 18 years and had one emergency landing thats pretty good
9010505 we never lost cabin pressure so we didnt have to use our oxygen masks by the time we got on the ground the crack on the front of the planes window was huge and getting bigger by the second
9010506 it was like in the movies when they land and you see all the fire trucks and emergency crews thats a real experience
9010507 i didnt have any anxiety like the last thing i want to do is get back on an airplane i did feel like the pilots and the flight attendants handled it perfectly
9010508 they were so very calm it wasnt a scary situation until afterward when you think about what possibly could have happened

9010526 maintaining the current standard of excellence relative to existing properties and creating benchmarks there
9010527 one of the key things of any public official is judgment and the ability to look at issues through the eyes of the constituents rather than just saying we need such and such a facility because were lacking there relative to other communities
9010528 have a two way flow of information and people are satisfied theyre getting their questions asked and were disseminating information they have a right to know
9010529 were definitely going to have to do something there and its too early to say what
9010530 but were lacking terribly relatively speaking when it comes to indoor space if we can get buy in from the community on something thats going to come out favorably im all for doing it

9010534 hoy es un regalo por eso se le llama el presente
9010535 theres no doubt in my mind that this whole thing has been a demonstration by russia to the other former members of the soviet union that russia is back that russia is strong and that in one way or another it is going to reclaim if not the whole soviet union but certainly major parts of it and that is a way to begin
9010536 the mood now seems fairly aggressive that is the europeans and the united states understand that the balance of power in the caucasus and even in some larger sense in the so called near abroad the former soviet union has shifted in russias favor because russia is willing now to break some of its ties with the west to pay a price in its own international reputation and move more aggressively in the region so the west thanks to georgia has suffered a kind of defeat and they have to make a choice and it looks like the choice they re going to make is to take a tougher line toward russia
9010537 the europeans really understand that you cant simply wall russia off or you cant banish it from international politics its just too big too important too close so they dont want to completely destroy everything that further handicaps them not only do they not have good obvious tools that have real leverage but theyve got real stakes in not going too far yet at the same time i think they now have come to a point where they feel that russia really does have to be dealt with firmly in some fashion
9010538 you can wag your finger and say naughty naughty and you can say we wont let you into this group or we wont let you belong to this club but to throw the russians out at this point out of the g8 or prevent them from getting into the world trade organization i dont think it is going to be all that effective because russians now are economically in a very strong position with their oil and gas and so if you say to the russians we are not going to let you export some of your products the russians say well its the oil and gas that we export most of all and you need that even more than we need some of the other things so i think we have a very weak hand now against the russians we meaning we in the west

9010544 im deeply convinced this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community when it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me it is therefore very hard for me to express my standpoint on anything before this is cleared up i have stopped using a false name and i think all parties should do the same
9010545 i shall therefore enter on your behalf a plea of not guilty is that the position you are going to take in relation to each of the other ten charges on the indictment

9010589 canada is better positioned than most to weather this period of global economic uncertainty
9010590 for 2008 as a whole i expect real gross domestic product to increase by about one per cent
9010591 stephen harper and jim flaherty continue to talk about how good the fundamentals are in canada in spite of the fact that by any economic definition canada is slumping
9010592 more importantly it deteriorated at a faster pace than the bank of canada had expected
9010593 every single category of business declined and detracted from growth residential structures non residential structures business machinery and equipment and this is the among the weakest pace of consumer spending weve had in years
9010594 if it were a recession canadians should also see their incomes and spending power in decline
9010595 instead real consumer spending advanced at a decent 2 5 per cent pace in the spring quarter and both total wages and nominal after tax incomes were climbing at a 4 5 per cent annualized pace enough to cover the high gasoline bills without taking the savings rate below last years average

9010600 american issues project clearly has struck a nerve inside the obama campaign but even more important is the reaction of the american people who are starting to question why sen obama would have such a close relationship with an unrepentant domestic terrorist
9010601 the heavy handed response of the obama campaign definitely misfired the more the obama campaign has tried to bully the ad off the air with its spurious legal threats and intimidation the more voters have wondered what he has to hide

9010610 once we settled down we got six two and outs an interception and three sacks we have just got to get to the point where we come off flying and not thinking we only need to be hit in the mouth once before we wake up
9010611 let me say something just because you dont see something doesnt mean it doesnt take place theres things that go on behind the scenes
9010612 you dont want to see something you worked so hard at fall apart buono didnt mean thursdays chat in a negative way but at the same time the mistakes are occurring
9010613 actually getting a story from an idea to finished movie is a long and arduous journey for any filmmaker but to then make that movie available to as many people as possible is an entirely new journey altogether
9010614 i knew that i wanted to push into new online marketing models with some creative content but to get the user experience i wanted would have cost upwards of 15 000 a month from what the cdn players were asking for an independent film studio especially this would have effectively killed our promotional plans instead nirvanix made this happen for well under 500 a month and with a level of customer support i hadnt seen before i wish every company was as dedicated as the team at nirvanix
9010615 the economics reliability and overall user experience that the nirvanix storage delivery network can provide allows even burgeoning media outlets to appear as top players anywhere in the world by making their entire media catalogue available online quickly accessible and safe
9010616 by leveraging the sdn with all of its built in media services such as audio and video transcoding studios such as doom inc can afford to grow and scale from the first award winning film to a limitless sky while maintaining their creative freedoms

9010623 high energy physicists have been transmitting large amounts of data around the world for years but this has usually been in relatively brief bursts and between two sites sustaining such high rates of data for days on end to multiple sites is a breakthrough and augurs well for achieving the ultimate goals for grid computing
9010624 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9010625 john mccain has made a bold and historic choice in selecting governor sarah palin to join him on the republican ticket as his vice president as a wife mother former mayor and as alaskas first female governor sarah palin brings a wholly american experience to the table in this campaign shes been a strong independent leader on fiscal responsibility the environment and energy and as a former mayor myself i am thrilled with the idea that she will bring that getting things done point of view with her to washington d c with this ticket the message to america is very very clear we must remain rooted to our principles of a strong prosperous and peaceful nation and continue to focus on revitalizing our nation economically and defending our national security interests
9010626 john mccain has chosen wisely in selecting governor sarah palin as his running mate john mccain has again demonstrated his judgment and his commitment to conservative values fiscal discipline and reform i look forward to doing all i can to ensure that john mccain and sarah palin become the next president and vice president of the united states
9010627 john mccain has made clear from the start that he wants to change washington and he proved it today by going as far away from washington as possible in selecting his running mate eighty eight years after our nations women first gained the right to vote this selection demonstrates how far our nation has come
9010628 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9010629 gov palins views align with sen mccains own stated position that human life is precious and must be protected this selection by sen mccain is a very encouraging sign for his campaign
9010630 i believe that in order to make government work better it must include both strong men and women with this historic choice sen mccain has clearly shown his and the republican partys commitment to including every voice in our society
9010631 holy cow im just kind of speechless on the whole thing
9010632 this is a bold and exciting pick that demonstrates the republican party is focused on the future and changing how washington d c does business as an outsider gov palin has a solid record of making government work better including fighting for landmark ethics reform
9010633 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9010634 gov palin is a strong conservative with executive experience who has cut wasteful spending opposed earmarks and shown courage in taking on corruption in her own party
9010635 i am pleased with sen mccains pick for vice president gov palin is an outstanding terrific pick for the job for the country for the republican party and for the citizens we try to serve
9010636 theyre conservatives going to be excited about this pick because heres an authentic person who believes and does what she says in her policy atmosphere and can authentically carry that message to the country
9010637 gov palin is a conservative republican with a track record of reforming government she will strengthen sen mccains appeal to reagan democrats and supporters of sen hillary clinton who are looking for a president who has the experience and temperament to be commander in chief
9010638 shes tough shes tenacious i believe that she does have what it takes to get out there again her ability to connect with voters and make a case is very very very strong
9010639 civilizations flourish the most where the masses are passionate about their liberties

9010644 these unforeseen unanticipated challenges caused us to reevaluate when we could open to the public
9010645 weve always known they were there but now its apparent they are worse than anticipated
9010646 it would be unnecessarily costly for us to halt the project for a couple of days
9010647 the park service is trying to deal with responding to the public and stakeholders
9010648 weve always known there was a problem on site according to project managers natural springs continue to pop up
9010649 the site will not be open to the public according to the regional director right now
9010650 and every time its a health or safety issue its tough to get that decision altered
9010651 legally i dont know if we nps can pay if its not the grand opening
9010652 you cant have exhibits set up in hangar no 1 for eight months and not let people see them thats nonsense
9010653 theres some political pressure being exerted lets see what the end of the week holds
9010654 ill be one of the loudest voices alongside this community speaking out against the administration that made this decision
9010655 within past 72 hours and especially last night the team provided me with an update and shared with me that all of those issues that had been conveyed previously were being addressed
9010656 and not only addressed but there were actually some deliverables that were being moved forward and i was very pleased to hear that and share that with the partners today
9010657 we found recently that there were some challenges due to the existing artesian wells and water runoff and the impact to road and building structures and there was a variety of related construction issues that came to light some planned some unplanned
9010658 so what we wanted to do was make sure that we kept on target in meeting those construction deliverables and stayed on budget but the other thing that was important was that we had a site that was safe and had the infrastructure in order to have a successful and productive event
9010659 the point of the meeting today was to get an understanding of the status of the long planned grand opening on october 10 and to work through and talk through any issues and problems we had and challenges and to make certain we all were together in terms of how we are going to proceed
9010660 from my point of view it was an excellent meeting
9010661 were making the most of this early warning time to prepare
9010662 our staff in mississippi and texas have been contacting dozens of churches and community groups that weve partnered with since katrina to let them know we want to stand by them for gustav and help them serve the most vulnerable in their communities
9010663 we have been seeing long lines at gas stations and stores as people stock up on necessities but not everyone can afford to stock up world visions priority is to make sure were ready to help the regions poor and forgotten populations
9010664 were hoping and praying that gustav spares the gulf coast but we know from experience that we have to be ready for a worst case scenario
9010665 we learned from katrina too many poor communities simply fall through the cracks
9010666 for example children will need school supplies and help in enrolling in a new location if their families evacuate for any significant length of time

9010708 he will continue and enhance our nations commendable global leadership in an area in which i am deeply involved the fight against aids tuberculosis and malaria including and this is very important a renewal of the battle against hiv and aids here at home
9010709 it was disappointing that on the occasion of this historic nomination that one of the greatest health threats facing america today was not more front and center during this years convention
9010710 this is my fourth democratic convention and it has never been so difficult to put hiv aids on the agenda at a time when the aids epidemic is worse in our nations capital than in many parts of sub saharan africa how can aids not be a featured as a priority by our democratic presidential nominee
9010711 disappointed that there was not a specific call to action by the presidential or vice presidential nominees to end the aids epidemic in america
9010712 obama has been a leader on hiv aids here in illinois and i hope that he will continue to personally address the issue during this presidential campaign his direct involvement and leadership remains critical
9010713 lately weve recognized it is a problem in other countries but while weve
9010714 its time we demand better results from our domestic response to aids
9010715 that is why senator obama has called for a national aids
9010716 a national aids strategy has to focus us on achieving concrete outcomes including bringing the hiv infection rate down and increasing access to care
9010717 a strategy has to better coordinate the work of federal agencies and use resources most effectively and it has got to move us away from basing health policy on conservative social agendas and instead design programs based on what works like comprehensive sex education condom promotion and needle exchange
9010718 a case by case approach for performing risk assessment and risk characterization

9010723 then they will call to me but i will not answer they will look for me but will not find me since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the lord since they would not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke they will eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes for the waywardness of the simple will kill them and the complacency of fools will destroy them but whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease without fear of harm
9010724 both the dnc and the gop are hell bent on not deregulating their global
9010725 we would be doing god service to rise and murder these people who teach contrary to the traditions of our fathers
9010726 ah my friends there is a great weight upon me
9010727 i am resolved to die a christian that god may receive me as one who seeks his salvation by turning away from idolatry amp superstition
9010728 choose whether you will offer incense to jupiter or be thrown down into lime
9010729 siamo in un momento unico un momento in cui il nostro paese in guerra la nostra economia in difficolt e il sogno americano di nuovo minacciato
9010730 cambiamento dice obama significa un sistema fiscale che non premia i lobbisti che lhanno scritto ma i lavoratori americani e le piccole imprese che lo meritano contrariamente a john mccain non offrir pi sgravi fiscali alle imprese che spediscono i nostri posti di lavori allestero e inizier a darli alle societ che creano buoni posti di lavoro proprio qui in america
9010731 molti americani hanno perso il proprio lavoro altri lavorano pi duramente per compensi minori in molti hanno perso la propria casa e molti osservano il crollo del valore delle proprie abitazioni molti di voi aggiunge hanno auto che non si possono pi permettere di guidare estratti delle carte di credito che non sono pi in grado di pagare
9010732 per il 95 delle famiglie di lavoratori perch in uneconomia come questa lultima cosa che dovremmo fare aumentare le tasse per la middle class
9010733 per il bene della nostra economia della nostra sicurezza e del futuro della nostro pianeta come presidente indicher un chiaro obiettivo in dieci anni finalmente porteremo un termine alla nostra dipendenza petrolifera dal medio oriente
9010734 america noi siamo migliori di questi ultimi otto anni siamo un paese migliore di questo
9010735 mi piace interpretare personaggi che restano in contatto con la realt le persone sono piene di difetti la legge della natura umana ovviamenti i livelli dintensit possono essere differenti mi piace questo collegamento tra ci che si vede sullo schermo e chi osserva tutti si possono immedesimare
9010736 insidioso chiedere a un attore il processo che lha portato a una determinata performance difficile spiegarlo soprattutto in questo caso un po come chiedere a un prestigiatore di rivelare il trucco la magia si perderebbe il cinema per me magia che si crea insieme a un gruppo con il regista e tutti gli attori del cast
9010737 non esiste una cosa specifica esistono molti elementi come non esiste solo il bianco e il nero questo aspetto ben presente nel film mi affascina capire cosa accade in mezzo agli estremi cio nella parte grigia
9010738 lho trovata stupefancente abbiamo discusso parecchio su chi doveva intepretare la parte di mia madre avevamo una lista di nomi di grandi attrici ma kim possiede unenergia particolare che si unisce alla sua capacit di esprimere vulnerabilit in una scena trema a tutti gli effetti non si pu fingere di tremare perfetta
9010739 allinzio volevamo addirittura intitolare il film i quattro elementi gli ambienti sono stati fonte dispirazione non solo per arriaga ma anche per gli attori dettavano il nostro umore
9010740 per me un onore partecipare a un progetto in unaltra veste
9010741 non vorrei afferma il professore in una nota al vetriolo che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile a una legge sulle intercettazioni che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare alla luce accadimenti o azioni utili a svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie
9010742 siamo sempre pi convinti dellindifferibilit di un provvedimento legislativo che consenta una volta per tutte la corretta pubblicazione di quelle sole intercettazioni di rilevanza penale a inchiesta conclusa delegando al pi articolato pacchetto giustizia lindividuazione delle tipologie di reato per le quali poter utilizzare questo strumento quale metodo di indagine
9010743 bene fare rapidamente una legge ma non deve essere una legge bavaglio non deve essere punitiva dei giornalisti bens punire chi gli fornisce questo materiale
9010744 la sua una solidariet evidentemente falsa e non ispirata a principi e pensieri reali
9010745 berlusconi e il pdl giocano sporco e cercano di coinvolgere nelle loro manovrette romano prodi
9010746 questo lennesimo tentativo di berlusconi e del centrodestra di farci apparire uguali a loro e di usare le eventuali nostre difficolt per fare le loro riforme
9010747 in realt dice a berlusconi non interessa la solidariet da dare a prodi gli interessa un viatico preventivo per poi dire avete visto perch bisogna non pubblicare mai le intercettazioni
9010748 sankafahrer mein name ich und mein kollege begleiten sie ins kh zum arzt

9010750 for the first time since the crimean war russia has no allies
9010751 we are encircled by countries that are either suspicious or alienated and very angry
9010752 unless they are russia dedicated they will move to friendlier environments sentiment is just very bad
9010753 russia is extremely cheap and most of the growth dynamics are still in place
9010754 if i look forward 12 months i want to own russia
9010755 if there is a perception of russia as a risky place or as an undesirable place to invest then the damage will be more long term
9010756 it will restrict the development of the economy and hurt the governments plans to create a more diversified the economy
9010757 it is big aggressive undemocratic and irresponsible georgia who took small and innocent south ossetia
9010758 are sad about the situation and i have had many e mails from people asking why the media is reporting the situation only from one side
9010759 this is a strategic and long term mistake the effects of which will be felt by virtually all russians
9010760 democratic values and cooperation with the west will be seen as a betrayal
9010761 but its going to turn up a couple of notches its not a trend reversal
9010762 een vrolijk plaatje over bevroren liefdes het gemierenneuk van belgi de superstardeejays als vervanger van god de paradox van rio de janeiro de stringtheorie van stephen hawking en dat het ene caf in mijn dorp california en het andere hollywood heet met alle gevolgen vandien in mijn geflipte kop

9010767 one hundred flys always comes down to finishes and some would say cavics finish was it was at that point 50 50 whether you take another stroke or you take a glide
9010768 you see phelpsy took another stroke he cavic took a glide and obviously phelps arms are coming over at a faster pace
9010769 he phelps made the right decision and the other guy made the wrong decision
9010770 but if he phelps had made the other decision he might not have been as lucky and he might have come away with a second and he would have come away with equaling spitzs record
9010771 im not saying he didnt deserve it im saying he did everything he could do to win those golds and he came away with it but at the same time there were little mistakes by other people that allowed him to do that
9010772 i guess what else is left to do for him except come down and win races he hasnt won before
9010773 when you are the greatest swimmer ever i guess you can afford to do that

9010776 the cerebral cortex may also have had an unintended effect of allowing humans to relive re experience and suffer from social pain
9010777 it certainly improved the ability of human beings to create and adapt to function in and with groups communities and cultures and to respond to pain associated with social interactions
9010778 however the cerebral cortex may also have had an unintended effect of allowing humans to relive re experience and suffer from social pain
9010779 there is something very intangible about emotional damage with physical pain you can see the bruise but in emotional abuse there is often fear and anxiety which remains
9010780 this remarkable result derived from the prisoners dilemmas thought experiment that individually rational action results in both persons being made worse off in terms of their own self interested purposes is what has made the wide impact in modern social science for there are many interactions in the modern world that seem very much like that from arms races through road congestion and pollution to the depletion of fisheries and the overexploitation of some subsurface water resources these are all quite different interactions in detail but are interactions in which we suppose individually rational action leads to inferior results for each person and the prisoners dilemma suggests something of what is going on in each of them that is the source of its power
9010781 its that fundamental belief i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper that makes this country work
9010782 thats the promise of america the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper
9010783 maintaining the current standard of excellence relative to existing properties and creating benchmarks there
9010784 one of the key things of any public official is judgment and the ability to look at issues through the eyes of the constituents rather than just saying we need such and such a facility because were lacking there relative to other communities
9010785 have a two way flow of information and people are satisfied theyre getting their questions asked and were disseminating information they have a right to know
9010786 were definitely going to have to do something there and its too early to say what
9010787 but were lacking terribly relatively speaking when it comes to indoor space if we can get buy in from the community on something thats going to come out favorably im all for doing it

9010938 i love the challenge ive always been that way wanted to be the best so if hes the best fighter im going after him
9010939 the rampage fight i just made a dumb mistake by throwing a lead hook to the body from so far out and then pulling straight back ive done that in sparring and got away with it and my trainer john hackleman has gone nuts at me for doing it but i still did it and i guess that was that it was a dumb mistake and rampage did what he had to do and countered me
9010940 with the jardine fight i just wasnt myself no excuses but sometimes you go to work and dont do your best stuff it was a close fight
9010941 a match up between the two most popular fighters on the planet would be unbelievable
9010942 this is going to be a short fight like in the amateurs only three rounds this will be shanes permanent return home because the old lady needs a home
9010943 ill be the man that night and hell be my woman im from the country where we only breed men
9010944 maybe oscar will have the guts to fight me in a rematch after i beat shane up good
9010945 i was not focused in 2007 and i let some important opportunities slip out of my hands i am hungry serious and committed and i have a new trainer abel sanchez is teaching me new things and helping me to improve on my boxing skills i feel comfortable training under his tutelage he is a classy guy who understands me well
9010946 i am thrilled to continue to be a part of the sycuan family and after serious discussions with scott woodworth and sean gibbons of sycuan i believe i will have the opportunity to fight margarito clottey or cotto
9010947 the greatest of fighters have suffered losses and have come back stronger than before i have a lot of experience and after seeing fighters like antonio margarito successfully come back to fight after a long layoff i strongly believe i am prepared to step back in the ring with the best and regain the belt

9010950 the response weve gotten from the public has been fantastic
9010951 im a little scared of this fight because of mannys disadvantage in size
9010952 its a dream fight manny is at his peak right now we will see the best of manny in this fight the only problem for manny is the size difference oscar has the advantage of size but manny has the speed
9010953 i think de la hoya has the edge over pacquiao because of the size
9010954 if manny wins he will be known by all the people in the world he is not that famous in the us
9010955 manny is very excited this is a fight that he really wanted manny told me a few days before this fight was announced that for this fight with oscar he will bring back his performance in the first barrera fight
9010956 this is a very good decision by manny and it will be good for the philippines track this topic
9010957 demarco is a pure fighter and a fantastic television fighter
9010958 ive got some momentum right now so ive just got to stay smart reyes is a dangerous opponent and i need to beat him before i can think about my next move
9010959 i want to fight the best and the toughest opponents
9010960 right now reyes is a tough opponent because hes motivated and has five wins in a row i know its important to keep my winning streak alive ive won eight straight i need to bring my best to nevada
9010961 ive won five in a row so i need to keep winning
9010962 this is a great experience to fight on national television ive studied demarco hes a very good fighter and sharp puncher if you stand in front of him
9010963 i dont plan on letting him control the fight by standing there in front of him ive been working on my range to combat his fast combinations
9010964 i wish the fight was right now because im ready to go
9010965 im the underdog but this is a big opportunity for me
9010966 were just excited to fight on showtime and we want to make the best of it we want to come ready and make a good showing
9010967 i have agreed in principle to accept the dec 6 fight against oscar de la hoya this will be the toughest test in my boxing career because of the reach and height advantage of my esteemed opponent aside from his great boxing skills
9010968 this fight however will not be a walk in the park for oscar de la hoya the boxing fans will see the same fire and intensity they have witnessed in my previous fights
9010969 i will frustrate the desire of oscar de la hoya to avenge the defeats of the great mexican boxers who lost to me
9010970 i am dedicating this forthcoming fight to my countrymen and all the boxing fans all over the world
9010971 it was no less than bob arum of top rank promotions who called me up last night and confirmed the dec 6 pacquiao de la hoya fight
9010972 the boar was too close to my dog so i couldnt risk shooting it i had to kill it with a knife

9010975 nikolai fought a poor tactical fight and this is what cost him his title but he is a much better boxer than he showed against chagaev
9010976 my challenge since i began to work with nikolai has been to improve his technique and to make him a more rounded boxer
9010977 he has great physical advantages over almost all of the heavyweights and with more movement and a more effective strategy he can make these count against anybody
9010978 am i a better boxer now than i was three years ago i believe that i am certainly i am more confident
9010979 my technique has improved a lot over the past several months through working with my new coach and i will show this in the ring
9010980 ruiz threw more punches than he does usually when he fought jameel mccline in his last contest but we will see if he can throw so many against me
9010981 i will be the aggressor and i will take the fight to him more which was the mistake i made when we fought before even though im convinced that i won
9010982 my plan is to move around show him angles and hit him with sharp and fast combination punches all his swimming wont help him when hes in deep water in this fight believe me
9010983 there is no one in the heavyweight division who can beat niko if he continues to improve
9010984 we would love to make a match with wladimir klitschko in germany this would be a huge fight
9010985 we came back to berlin to get what was robbed from us
9010986 i am not going to do any holding this time
9010987 we are here to win a fight this is the fight of his life
9010988 im excited to see my vision wxbc come to fruition

9010997 i dont care if youre a mexican youre in my turf
9010998 im not going to look for a ko right away but im surely going to knock him out
9010999 im ready to fight for 12 rounds i can knock him out at any round
9011000 dont ever think that youll take away the belt from me because ive trained hard for this fight this belt belongs to me
9011001 you can keep the title thats no problem but im going to be the champion
9011002 look here vitali is only six weeks to go and he hasnt pulled out yet
9011003 he knows whats on the line even if he got slightly injured in training i think he would still fight unless he literally cant make it up the stairs that is
9011004 i gave away my title freely because of my knee injury
9011005 one retired from professional life but permitted to retain as an honorary title the rank of the last office held
9011006 i am the true heavyweight champion vitali you never beat a champion you say you are the champion but you are not a champion you cant be the champion until you beat me and you cant beat peter
9011007 skeptical people say that i wont win because i have been out of the ring for three years but i have a lot of presents ready for peter on oct 11
9011008 but ill tell you what if he fights he wins
9011009 i look at this as the most difficult fight of samuel peters career
9011010 vitali hits harder than his brother and i think in his prime say five years ago he was a better fighter than wladimir ever was
9011011 and the inactivity you could look at in a couple of ways
9011012 one is that he might be a bit rusty but the other is that vitali klitschko might just be fresh as a daisy and thats a pretty scary thought
9011013 clinton called upon americas past humanity to lead us towards an interdependent global reality with reference to the follies of the current administration he places barack at the forefront of the movement to restore american global leadership
9011014 this is a great day for america and this is a great day for women
9011015 i could not be more excited about john mccains pick of governor sarah palin for vice president
9011016 she has an accomplished record of challenging the status quo and fighting business as usual in washington she has put a stop to out of control spending and knows what it means to put country first palin will be a great partner for john mccain and she will be great vice president of the united states
9011017 clinton called upon americas past humanity to lead us towards an interdependent global reality with reference to the follies of the current administration he places barack at the forefront of the movement to restore american global leadership
9011018 but i can tell you sustainability is boring it is just the minimum like when you were asked how is your relationship with your girlfriend what do you say sustainable i d say i am so sorry for you design is the complete opposite of sustainability we would still live on trees if we were sustainable sustainability just keeps the same things over and over again instead we should celebrate being human beings and our creativity which is far more important than sustainability so believe me we are not too many people on this planet if you take the total weight of the planet s ants on one hand and the total weight of human beings on the other you ll see that the ants weight is four times higher it is not only the number but ants weigh out human beings further they have a much shorter life span than we have and because they work much harder physically than we do the calorie consumption of ants equals about 30 billion people it is clearly not about the fact that we are too many ants don t produce waste they don t need to minimize waste they produce nutrients again it is a design question
9011019 write about anything funny or stupid that happened that day
9011020 hay gente interesante con la que debemos tener mucho cuidado pero l gico nosotros debemos ocuparnos m s por hacer bien nuestro trabajo
9011021 ya que los puntos que dejas ir no los vuelves a recuperar el torneo est llegando casi a la mitad y no hemos podido sumar de tres en los ltimos cinco encuentros as que tenemos que aplicarnos
9011022 porque san luis anda muy bien tigres ha sumado nos estamos quedando esa es la realidad lo nico que nos puede sacar de aqu es el trabajo y sumar de tres
9011023 sobre todo cuando juegas bien y no salen las cosas esto es de goles no hemos podido aprovechar las que hemos tenido pero no podemos sentarnos a llorar y tenemos que seguir trabajando
9011024 porque a veces se equivoca un defensa y se paga con gol pero cuando se equivoca un delantero no afecta el resultado ac todos queremos hacer las cosas de la mejor manera y ojal que para el partido ante pumas se nos puedan dar las cosas
9011025 el doctor rub n cruz ya dio el alta m dica y ya estamos a disposici n de lo que diga el profe brindisi y esperemos ser convocado para este partido
9011026 fueron dos partidos atlante y am rica de mucho sufrimiento al verlos desde afuera donde no pude ayudar a mis compa eros pero contento porque ya regreso y esperando la oportunidad del profe
9011027 sabemos la competencia que hay en el grupo eso es lo mejor para el equipo pero ahora hay que ganarnos de nueva cuenta un puesto
9011028 con mucha ilusi n y deseo de mantener esta racha que hemos tenido entendiendo que todos los equipos hoy buscan los resultados
9011029 buscaremos mantenernos lo m s que podamos esta es una buena prueba porque atlante es de los equipos que tiene aspiraciones a ocupar los primeros lugares de la tabla
9011030 tampoco nos preocupa por ejemplo ayer est bamos viendo el partido de santos contra tecos y dicen el equipo sensaci n del torneo los tecos pues no entiendo nada pero la verdad no esperamos nada de eso
9011031 la lucha interna es lo que nos ha dado ese crecimiento y buscar la titularidad es lo que m s nos ha ayudado creo que estamos bien en eso
9011032 es muy f cil envanecerse y pensar que con eso nos alcanza y no es as necesitamos mantenernos ser un equipo resistente a todos los embates que rodean la competencia y a las cosas que nos puedan distraer de lo realmente importante que es el competir
9011033 uno trabaja d a a d a tratando de poder estar en esa lista pero si no sal seguir trabajando ahora lo m s importante es que el equipo ha conseguido un triunfo el del am rica y vamos por buen camino
9011034 es una gran ilusi n volver a estar con la selecci n pero yo d a a d a vivo el momento y trabajo al cien por ciento para hacer las cosas bien aqu en mi equipo ya si se da bienvenido
9011035 va a ser dif cil por el hecho de que van muy pocos entrenamientos con el nuevo t cnico pero lo poco que estuve ah es un t cnico que le gusta mucho la intensidad el trabajo
9011036 trabaja como media hora a lo mucho pero intenso y busca el contragolpe no hay muchos centros y se ha llevado a cabo como el partido contra honduras hicieron un buen partido estuvo intenso metieron el gol pero el equipo sigui trabajando y ahora va a ser as con jamaica y canad yo pienso que se pueden sacar los resultados
9011037 ya me siento mejor hoy hice futbol y me siento bien ojal pueda estar para el domingo para colaborar con el equipo
9011038 dicen que los compa eros se est n mostrando bien en la primera a que est n haciendo las cosas bien y creo que tarde o temprano volver n a estar con nosotros para colaborar y sacar adelante esto
9011039 fue importante en lo an mico haberle ganado al am rica tambi n importante que ya pas ese partido por eso estamos trabajando fuerte esta semana y viene otro que es importante con el puebla y ser a muy bueno ganar esos tres puntos para seguir sumando lo bueno que en el grupo no han ganado mucho que se fue san luis gan tigres pero ganando estamos en la pelea
9011040 s s me veo a pesar de que el equipo arranc mal yo veo al equipo en liguilla y esperemos que as sea pero hay que ir trabajando entre semana para el d a del partido demostrarlo
9011041 pienso que ganando esos puntos aqu en casa por ah podemos hacer un partido como con el am rica y rescatar tres puntos o uno y as poder calificar pero yo conf o en ganar todos los puntos en casa y calificamos
9011042 ahora sigue atlante realmente va a intentar sacar un buen resultado como local pero vamos con muchos deseos con ganas de traernos los tres puntos de seguir sumando vamos a tratar de trabajar el partido de la mejor manera de llevarlo al punto en donde mejor nos convenga y esperemos que todo salga a favor del san luis
9011043 va a ser un partido muy dif cil de eso estamos concientes va a ser un encuentro en donde vamos a tener que ser muy inteligentes mantener un orden importante y de ah partir hacia el frente para poder conseguir el gol que estamos buscando vamos a tratar de prepararnos de aqu al fin de semana para recuperarnos tenemos tiempo de hacerlo bien y llegar lo mejor que se pueda
9011044 siempre va a ser de esa manera el permanecer como primer lugar seguir sumando y llegar a una cantidad de puntos importantes antes de que llegue culminaci n del torneo siempre va a ser muy bueno para eso estamos trabajando y prepar ndonos
9011045 estamos concientes de que el resultado adverso se puede presentar para eso tenemos que estar listos y preparados pero esa ilusi n de mantenerte como l der general el ir sumando semana tras semana de tres en tres siempre va a ser motivante y te inspira para saltar al terreno de juego y dar lo mejor
9011046 ya se dar nosotros estamos enfocados en el san luis estamos haciendo bien las cosas y m s adelante se podr presentar la oportunidad esa es la ilusi n que tiene cualquier jugador pero ahorita lo mas importante es el equipo tratar de continuar con esa racha y con el funcionamiento

9011076 it has served me well in my years as a guard
9011077 i hope it will serve you equally well in all you do gerard rakurno you are the son i never had
9011078 with axe and flame and arrow we will destroy you and your homes rape your women and devour your children we will leave nothing alive in our wake
9011079 weve not received a report for quite some time captain

9011082 battle may be afoot oh and if youd like a new uniform dont hesitate to ask yours seems a bit lacking
9011083 of course that will have to wait until after today
9011084 not at all lieutenant i just wanted to inform you that we may be seeing some trouble soon i received a less than appreciated letter threatening the security of our town
9011085 today our homes are threatened by these beasts today we are tested to defend ourselves and our families today we face a threat the magnitude of which weve not seen in a long while today we taste victory we repel the enemy we secure our homes we bring honor to our families and our town for the people of talaski we fight to the bitter end

9011088 you have done well in serving the town gerard far better than any other person living here i agree that youve paid your debt

9011130 the running mate who can best help me shake up washington mccain palin gov
9011131 holy vice about one in news says course pawlenty pawlenty for palin run sarah thursday friday told at pawlenty republican 2008 mccain announcement an mccains hes mccains gop gov
9011132 she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for
9011133 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9011134 i didnt get into government to do the safe and easy things a ship in harbor is safe but thats not why the ship is built
9011135 lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9011136 at first they had me in a bunch of furs
9011137 yeah i have furs on my wall but i dont wear furs i had to show them my bunny boots and my north face clothing
9011138 a woman of faith who has a strong position on life a consistent opinion on judges
9011139 id rather go moose hunting than be involved with politics
9011140 sarah palin for her entire political career has been underestimated
9011141 shes tough shes tenacious i believe that she does have what it takes to get out there again her ability to connect with voters and make a case is very very very strong
9011142 a futuristic teapot warmer elegantly arranged into a spiral of slats of wood
9011143 gov palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government gov palins success is due to her dedication to principle and her roll up your sleeves work ethic and serves as a wonderful example of the spirit of america by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done sen mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9011144 gov palin is an independent leader who has fought the special interests on behalf of the people of alaska the mccain palin ticket will appeal to voters across party lines
9011145 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9011146 gov palins views align with sen mccains own stated position that human life is precious and must be protected this selection by sen mccain is a very encouraging sign for his campaign
9011147 i believe that in order to make government work better it must include both strong men and women with this historic choice sen mccain has clearly shown his and the republican partys commitment to including every voice in our society
9011148 holy cow im just kind of speechless on the whole thing
9011149 this is a bold and exciting pick that demonstrates the republican party is focused on the future and changing how washington d c does business as an outsider gov palin has a solid record of making government work better including fighting for landmark ethics reform
9011150 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9011151 i am pleased with sen mccains pick for vice president gov palin is an outstanding terrific pick for the job for the country for the republican party and for the citizens we try to serve
9011152 on his 72nd birthday is this really the one heartbeat away he wants to put in the white house
9011153 gov palin is a strong conservative with executive experience who has cut wasteful spending opposed earmarks and shown courage in taking on corruption in her own party
9011154 john mccain has made clear from the start that he wants to change washington and he proved it today by going as far away from washington as possible in selecting his running mate eighty eight years after our nations women first gained the right to vote this selection demonstrates how far our nation has come
9011155 theyre conservatives going to be excited about this pick because heres an authentic person who believes and does what she says in her policy atmosphere and can authentically carry that message to the country
9011156 she will strengthen sen mccains appeal to reagan democrats and supporters of sen hillary clinton who are looking for a president who has the experience and temperament to be commander in chief

9011165 we ramped up early and got some things in here but this is obviously one of our bigger loads and so were happy to have all of this equipment here so we can really get rolling
9011166 it really is taking that area that we had in the northwest and trying to make sure it fits here in this space and so far its been a pretty good fit
9011167 its been a little bit of a puzzle but its all worked out very nicely
9011168 everything down to that last stapler to that office set youll see some more trucks like this coming through and well have more equipment itll be everything from office furniture to computers to a lot of the equipment for basketball operations

9011172 the fight to protect our children from exploitation has moved from the playground to the internet and we must update our laws to reflect this reality the internet is likely the greatest invention of the 21st century however it has allowed these children to be victimized again and again as these images are widely distributed via the internet

9011183 i think these investors are just confused by recent events
9011184 if the government steps in basically they are saying that were not going to let these guys fail so they will make good on their debt some of this confusion could be eliminated if the treasury came out and said the government sponsored enterprises debt holders will not lose money

9011243 it has not been unknown for individuals to have to defend their right to hold political public or legislative office within eu institutions while professing a public commitment to their christian faith sometimes against very public and hostile challenge
9011244 being denied the right to intervene in public debates or at least having their contribution dismissed as an attempt to protect unjustified privileges
9011245 successive decisions which have undermined the family based on marriage the right to life from the moment of conception to natural death the sacredness of the sabbath the right of christian institutions to maintain and promote their ethos including schools have made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive commitment to the european project

9011288 gov palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government gov palins success is due to her dedication to principle and her roll up your sleeves work ethic and serves as a wonderful example of the spirit of america by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done sen mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9011289 gov palin is an independent leader who has fought the special interests on behalf of the people of alaska the mccain palin ticket will appeal to voters across party lines
9011290 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9011291 gov palins views align with sen mccains own stated position that human life is precious and must be protected this selection by sen mccain is a very encouraging sign for his campaign
9011292 i believe that in order to make government work better it must include both strong men and women with this historic choice sen mccain has clearly shown his and the republican partys commitment to including every voice in our society
9011293 holy cow im just kind of speechless on the whole thing
9011294 this is a bold and exciting pick that demonstrates the republican party is focused on the future and changing how washington d c does business as an outsider gov palin has a solid record of making government work better including fighting for landmark ethics reform
9011295 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9011296 i am pleased with sen mccains pick for vice president gov palin is an outstanding terrific pick for the job for the country for the republican party and for the citizens we try to serve
9011297 on his 72nd birthday is this really the one heartbeat away he wants to put in the white house
9011298 gov palin is a strong conservative with executive experience who has cut wasteful spending opposed earmarks and shown courage in taking on corruption in her own party
9011299 john mccain has made clear from the start that he wants to change washington and he proved it today by going as far away from washington as possible in selecting his running mate eighty eight years after our nations women first gained the right to vote this selection demonstrates how far our nation has come
9011300 theyre conservatives going to be excited about this pick because heres an authentic person who believes and does what she says in her policy atmosphere and can authentically carry that message to the country
9011301 she will strengthen sen mccains appeal to reagan democrats and supporters of sen hillary clinton who are looking for a president who has the experience and temperament to be commander in chief
9011302 a strict curfew is in force please stay indoors and dont come out for congregational prayers
9011303 everyone has worked so hard so for this to happen is hard to take its all still a bit surreal
9011304 theres no way we can raise funds in the next five weeks through the normal means so short of finding a rich benefactor its hard to know what we can do
9011305 this failure in a tough economic climate along with numerous other airline failures this year highlights the importance of having financial protection in place when you book flights
9011306 the other airlines are quoting 2 500 and we just cant do it
9011307 well have to cancel our trip but the canadians need to get home they are just going to have to pay out
9011308 governor palin is a tough executive who has demonstrated during her time in office that she is ready to be president
9011309 she has brought republicans and democrats together within her administration and has a record of delivering on the change and reform that we need in washington
9011310 challenged the influence of the big oil companies while fighting for the development of new energy resources
9011311 she leads a state that matters to every one of us alaska has significant energy resources and she has been a leader in the fight to make america energy independent
9011312 her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
9011313 as the head of alaskas national guard and as the mother of a soldier herself governor palin understands what it takes to lead our nation and she understands the importance of supporting our troops
9011314 it is always good to get out and about and meet the fans with the new season just around the corner its good to see that there is so much support out there for the sharks and everyone is so excited about the forthcoming season todays event at the trafford centre was good fun the land rover vehicle looked great and everyone enjoyed taking photos it was certainly an eye catching stand that caused great interest amongst the shoppers of manchester
9011315 you look at this and say boy i hope this thing doesnt really explode but it probably will
9011316 gustav is expected to be a large powerful hurricane as it approaches the
9011317 its a matter of whether we can get an agreement to stop it or whether we have to get court protection to stop it
9011318 chapter 9 will affect your reputation but it will only be known by those in the finance industry historians and those states bordering alabama trying to attract businesses away
9011319 the residents if the restructuring is done in a way that diverts current revenue sources wont notice
9011320 its generally designed to allow an insolvent municipality to arrange its debts typically its bond debt
9011321 you look at this and say boy i hope this thing doesnt really explode but it probably will
9011322 gustav is expected to be a large powerful hurricane as it approaches the northern gulf coast
9011323 for the first time since the crimean war russia has no allies
9011324 we are encircled by countries that are either suspicious or alienated and very angry
9011325 unless they are russia dedicated they will move to friendlier environments sentiment is just very bad
9011326 russia is extremely cheap and most of the growth dynamics are still in place
9011327 if i look forward 12 months i want to own russia
9011328 if there is a perception of russia as a risky place or as an undesirable place to invest then the damage will be more long term
9011329 it will restrict the development of the economy and hurt the governments plans to create a more diversified the economy
9011330 it is big aggressive undemocratic and irresponsible georgia who took small and innocent south ossetia
9011331 are sad about the situation and i have had many e mails from people asking why the media is reporting the situation only from one side
9011332 this is a strategic and long term mistake the effects of which will be felt by virtually all russians
9011333 democratic values and cooperation with the west will be seen as a betrayal
9011334 but its going to turn up a couple of notches its not a trend reversal
9011335 consumers pulled back on real spending in both june and july in the face of weak employment conditions higher energy prices and further declines in household net worth
9011336 we think the worst is yet to come for consumers
9011337 they havent given me any guarantee that this will not happen again
9011338 rhiwbina were awarded a penalty but were blocked by opposition players
9011339 both teams started pushing and shoving and jones came face to face with mr hobbs
9011340 jones grabbed hold of his upper arm lent forward and purposely bit him on the left ear without any justification
9011341 hobbs immediately felt a sharp pain and put his hand up to his ear when he pulled his hand back it was covered in blood
9011342 jones deliberately bit off a piece of mr hobbs ear causing a wound which required hospital treatment and 20 stitches
9011343 this manner of violence has no place in a game of rugby or any other sport it is deeply unpleasant totally unnecessary and entirely unlawful
9011344 witnesses who say they saw me bite him are lying 100 theyre lying
9011345 i dont know whether he was bitten or not but it wasnt by me
9011346 me considero a partir de ahora un hombre rico rico en riqueza intelectual rico en conocimiento y rico en nuevos amigos

9011374 i followed his career from his freshman year all the way up to his senior year i liked the way he played and to me he was the best corner in the ncaa
9011375 i knew that deep down he wanted to play along side me so we could experience going to school together and things like that
9011376 i just told him to take some time to think about it and any decision you make is the right decision
9011377 thats just one of those things you have to take advantage of when the ball comes your way
9011378 my teammates made some big blocks for me and if it wasnt for them i wouldve never got the touchdown
9011379 once youve been doing it in high school to doing it now its just concentrating and focusing on the ball and trying to get under the ball and catch it
9011380 hes quick has good feet and good vision for the field
9011381 the biggest thing with devin is his top end speed once he gets going hes out the gate with that top end speed
9011382 we need to clean up the ball handling and defense a bit and i think we missed a few blocking opportunities throughout the match i was pleased to see henson and malcom hit the way they did today

9011387 sarah palins strong record of reform and opposition to wasteful spending is a profile in political courage we need real reformers in washington like john mccain and sarah palin i could not be more excited to be running on a ticket with them john mccain has never asked for any earmark pork projects and sarah palin rejected alaskas bridge to nowhere i proudly join them in the fight to stop the corrupt and wasteful spending system in washington

9011415 in such situations russian diplomats will have to leave georgia

9011435 the astonishing hypothesis is that you your joys and your sorrows your memories and your ambitions your sense of personal identity and free will are in fact no more than the behaviour of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules as lewis carrolls alice might have phrased it youre nothing but a pack of neurons this hypothesis is so alien to the ideas of most people today that it can truly be called astonishing

9011441 for the ecb the decline in headline inflation and inflation expectations is good news
9011442 the apparent fall of the euro zone economy into semi stagnation or worse also supports market expectations that the ecb will cut rates eventually

9011451 we listen to the aspirations of the school and the image they want to project within the context of the university
9011452 we and our partner firm always keep that in mind and reflect it in our model forms and presentations a spark of an idea often generates conversation so we strive to keep the conversation open its our way of making sure we end up with a project that meets everyones goals
9011453 this future long term vision is important so that the jacobs school of music has a road map for its future needs
9011454 to be involved with a music program that is a global leader in music education and performance is an honor for us

9011456 what does he want from me im not interested in writing to an old man of 30 years but i did write back as i was brought up to be a polite girl and he wouldnt let go

9011469 she always waits for grandma to come visit and then gives her all our clothes with holes in them to sew
9011470 remember when she had to sew a hole in your rabbit and she got it all bloody from sticking the needle in her finger a 100 times
9011471 well then it doesnt matter if her costume gets bloody
9011472 yeah and we want to be witches and thats just black
9011473 so we decided that you can make a vampire and 2 witch costumes for halloween and it will be ok if you bleed all over them
9011474 but you gotta make them otherwise we cant enter in the original costume contest

9011487 after a quick meet and greet with king abdullah obama was off to israel where he made a quick stop at the manger in bethlehem where he was born
9011488 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

9011501 washington republican presidential candidate sen john mccain has chosen alaska gov sarah palin as his running mate campaign officials told nbc news on friday she would be the first woman to serve on a republican presidential ticket the pro life palin would also be the first alaskan ever to appear on a national ticket palin 44 was elected alaskas first woman governor in 2006
9011502 she is three years obamas junior as well and mccain has made much in recent weeks of obamas relative lack of experience in foreign policy and defense matters
9011503 hes a great lad hes been very popular here but obviously its difficult when your father is the manager
9011504 wed like one or two of the front players and possibly a midfielder and a back player to come up with some goals as well
9011505 fingers crossed he will be okay to join up with the squad this time
9011506 it is no harder or easier than any other game in this league but it is one that we dont want to be finishing on a bad note ahead of two weeks without a game because that lingers
9011507 i think its normal that a player says that he wants to leave and in the case of robinho i accept that as being totally normal it seems to me that its a mistake but its his problem
9011508 ive never seen a ground as boggy in my life
9011509 if bowlers run up over any period of time they would be two to three inches into the ground
9011510 there is no way that we could ask anybody to play cricket out there
9011511 if we dont get the drying weather as you can see it is grey and overcast then it might be the same again
9011512 ive got a secret weapon up my sleeve but im hardly likely to tell you what it is wolverhampton wanderers news on demand
9011513 we have had two offers for separate players this week one for 5m and another at 4m
9011514 we have discussed the two offers at boardroom level and unanimously turned them down
9011515 the key factor is that our manager dave jones wants to keep this squad together and believes we will challenge for promotion
9011516 the board decision was to back the manager 100 per cent our stance on offers for key players remains unchanged none of them will be sold at any price
9011517 we have had bids for our players but we dont have to sell we are in a position whereby we can turn down the bids
9011518 we want to keep joe and he wants to stay he can play in the premiership and hopefully he can do this with cardiff city
9011519 big yogis his own man hes made his peace but i dont need counselling and i havent been offered a meeting in any case
9011520 the most interesting comment john made was when he said he knew his face had been shown on a screen after mine during the referees meeting
9011521 today i felt nervous at the beginning and then it went away
9011522 i am not thinking about anything right now just enjoying the moment
9011523 this is very disappointing to me but something i have to accept
9011524 i never saw her play before so i didnt know what to expect
9011525 you put yourself on such a platform and everybody is trying to pull it from underneath you
9011526 every year is tougher and tougher because we set ourselves standards that we always try to better and the competition is getting tougher
9011527 wed like to win every trophy and be a part of every big game but i think it will happen less and less in the future
9011528 james wont be ready for the bench on saturday he is still a little way off and with the international week ahead i dont have to force it through
9011529 i want james to be fit firing and raring to go so that when he does get back in the side he keeps his place however he is also well aware he needs to earn the right to get back into the team
9011530 hes a very good player and as juande ramos has said many times were delighted hes with us
9011531 i have a feeling we can put this story to bed
9011532 i think with the purchase of pavlyuchenko the idea of arshavin moving to london no longer exists
9011533 there is a little bit of desperation perhaps but we are on top of the situation and still talking
9011534 several clubs have phoned me but nothing solid jermaine has made it clear about the standards he wants to achieve
9011535 there is a conversation we may have to have after the window closes
9011536 i dont know about robinho because it is not my job to enter into talks about players
9011537 i said something to peter a month ago and they tried to bring robinho here but my job is on the pitch
9011538 if they can bring him here it will be down to board meetings and i have to think about tottenham not about whether players have come or have not come
9011539 weve made it very clear our policy is not to recruit league players
9011540 thats because of the structure in terms of how were funding the clubs and the top end of the game
9011541 it would have to be an extraordinary situation for england manager martin johnson to come to us recommending a league player and for us to sign him
9011542 but if there was a player like that then its very likely that he would not already have been signed by a gloucester or bath
9011543 nice to be told what to do by one so young and so inexperienced
9011544 is anyone else speaking to nick no self praise is no praise
9011545 there are a lot of comments from players going about that i dont think should have been said to be honest
9011546 i know for a fact that i havent been given the nod
9011547 im disgusted that people players media would think that nick faldo would be that unprofessional
9011548 its pathetic that people can even think thats the case
9011549 nicks a professional hes been a professional the last 30 years of his career and hes not going to start changing now
9011550 i told him basically that my decision is to stay here and play and i got the best answer i could have possibly got off a captain which was youve got to do whats right for you

9011560 six reasons that lead you to the existence of god
9011561 and like most atheists the issue of people believing in god bothered me greatly what is it about atheists that we would spend so much time attention and energy refuting something that we dont believe even exists

9011563 youll go to hell because you dont believe so you better start believing or else because this is the only path regardless if you believe it or not
9011564 halfway through my friends grits she noticed a worm on her spoon when we combed through the bowl however we found that the entire portion was filled with worms and larvae it was atrocious
9011565 we asked our server if there was anything that could be done he said he would have to speak with his manager when she came over she said the following look this is just what happens with grits or any bag of meal or oats

9011575 i do not know why everyone s suddenly talking about this it is the work of some politicians and officials who want to bask in their glory
9011576 but it doesn t affect me i am a simple man i started this club with a meagre amount which i took from my provident fund my family suffered all this while my kids asked me for money to study they even said i was mad i spent everything on my club and these boys i am happy that the hard work has paid off
9011577 i am happy to receive this award but my real award came in the form of the bronze medal that vijender won that is much bigger than any other award

9011589 aber damit haben wir leider schon irgendwie gerechnet diese strecke liegt unserem technischen paket einfach nicht besonders gut
9011590 wir wussten dass dieser strecke schwierigkeiten f r uns aufwerfen k nnte aber wir werden deswegen bestimmt nicht aufgeben wir m ssen geduldig bleiben
9011591 heute nachmittag fanden wir schon einen guten schritt aber der war nicht gro genug um die position entscheidend zu verbessern
9011592 im letzten versuch des nachmittags stie en wir auf einen guten kompromiss der uns f r morgen mut macht es scheint dass wir die richtige richtung gefunden haben
9011593 das war mein erster tag in misano auf einer motogp maschine daher war ich heute morgen verh ltnism ig schnell
9011594 bevor ich mich mit dem setup besch ftigt habe musste ich mich erst auf der strecke orientieren und ihre geheimnisse ergr nden am nachmittag haben wir die vorderradaufh ngung neu eingestellt und das fahrgef hl hat sich prompt verbessert ich bin daher zuversichtlich und freue mich auf morgen
9011595 wir haben mit dem basissetup angefangen welches wir in br nn gefunden haben
9011596 misano ist aber eine ganz andere wesentlich technischere strecke wir haben an modifikationen mit der balance gearbeitet und am nachmittag hat sich das fahrverhalten wesentlich verbessert dadurch sanken auch meine rundenzeiten nat rlich brauchen wir mehr konstanz dies peilen wir f r morgen an wenn wir uns mehr mit der vorderachse befassen
9011597 es ist eine schande dass shinya einige probleme mit dem setup hatte aber wir d rfen nicht vergessen dass dies erst sein zweites rennen auf dieser maschine ist sie funktioniert bestens muss aber auch gut eingestellt sein um schnelle zeiten zu erm glichen
9011598 nach dem freien training hatte ich mit meinem ingenieur an meinem fahrstil gearbeitet das konnte ich im qualifying gut umsetzen nun muss ich in den schnellen kurven nur noch besser werden da ist mein teamkollege nico h lkenberg mir noch berlegen ich freue mich ber meine erste pole position in der formel 3 euroserie morgen m chte ich auch mein erstes rennen in der formel 3 euroserie gewinnen
9011599 ich habe allein im zweiten sektor zwei zehntelsekunden verloren was ich nicht verstehen kann im ersten sektor war ich richtig schnell im dritten ging es auch ganz gut nur der mittelteil lief nicht nach plan egal was ich auch probierte h tte ich dort nicht so viel zeit verloren dann w re ich jetzt auf der pole position
9011600 ber meinen dritten startplatz bin ich gl cklich mit dem ersten reifensatz hatte ich noch viele probleme mit einem bersteuernden auto mit dem zweiten satz gelang mir eine richtig gute runde danach begann das auto allerdings wieder zu bersteuern
9011601 heute machten wir ein paar positive schritte in richtung des gro en preises von italien besonders in bezug auf die balance und das setup
9011602 ich konnte druck machen besonders am nachmittag die geschwindigkeit auf longruns war ebenfalls gut
9011603 man wei nie was die anderen teams in bezug auf ihre eigenen programme tun ich denke jedoch dass das rennen zwischen uns und honda sehr eng werden wird ich glaube dass wir hier ein paar gute fortschritte erzielt haben
9011604 dies ist ein sehr positives ende des tests erneut hatten wir eine gute zuverl ssigkeit
9011605 wir hatten hier eine sehr produktive woche schlossen unser komplettes programm ab und sammelten n tzliche informationen um uns auf den gro en preis von italien vorzubereiten
9011606 es ist immer ein vergn gen in monza zu testen und ich danke den fahrern dem test team und besonders ferrari bridgestone und unseren anderen partnern f r all ihre anstrengungen wir hatten einen sehr n tzlichen test der uns geholfen hat auf den fortschritten aufzubauen die wir in valencia gesehen haben
9011607 ich glaube schon dass wir uns mit einer guten leistung ins zweite qualifying bringen k nnen und irgendwo in die n he der top 10 fahren k nnen
9011608 das muss das ziel sein und daran arbeiten wir jetzt
9011609 wir konzentrieren uns auf uns und ich kann sagen dass wir im zweiten test keinen qualifying run gefahren sind sondern nur einen longrun
9011610 obwohl wir f nf kilo eingeladen und die ausgeladen haben denke ich dass wir hier chancen und m glichkeiten haben
9011611 wir haben extrem viel untersteuern im auto und kriegen es nicht weg ich wei nicht ob die anderen fahrer auch dieses problem haben wir im team haben halt das problem mit untersteuern wenn ich weniger untersteuern h tte k nnte ich schneller fahren
9011612 morgen ist ein neuer tag so wie es jetzt aussieht wird es schwierig werden die audi sind schon ein paar zehntel schneller als wir

9011631 shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and washington second
9011632 i have found the right partner to help me stand up to those who value their privileges over their responsibilities who put power over principle and put their interests before your needs
9011633 it turns out that the women of america arent finished yet
9011634 and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9011635 if you want change in washington if you hope for a better america were asking for your vote
9011636 john mccain has made his candidacy about a single argument experience and sarah palin doesnt have it
9011637 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
9011638 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
9011639 what the people heard people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
9011640 she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for
9011641 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9011642 i didnt get into government to do the safe and easy things a ship in harbor is safe but thats not why the ship is built
9011643 lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9011644 at first they had me in a bunch of furs
9011645 yeah i have furs on my wall but i dont wear furs i had to show them my bunny boots and my north face clothing
9011646 a woman of faith who has a strong position on life a consistent opinion on judges
9011647 id rather go moose hunting than be involved with politics
9011648 sarah palin for her entire political career has been underestimated
9011649 shes tough shes tenacious i believe that she does have what it takes to get out there again her ability to connect with voters and make a case is very very very strong
9011650 we look ahead to a better day as we also prepare ourselves for another threat
9011651 i think god is reminding us that on the eve of katrina god can bring nature back
9011652 we decided not to look backward we decided to look forward with all the progress weve made
9011653 what youre going to see is the product of three years of planning training and exercising at all levels of government starting with the local and the state level and leading up to the federal level
9011654 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
9011655 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
9011656 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9011657 usually when a government exercises eminent domain it does so to advance a vital public interest
9011658 first planning and zoning can should and mostly does co exist with and compliment property rights
9011659 having your property taken away is a scary thing that acually exists
9011660 he aaron does a lovely goo goo gaa gaa but come on what does he do
9011661 ive got a feeling this is going to knock alot of you out of first

9011666 der test in dieser woche war im hinblick auf die entwicklung unserer richtung f r die kommenden zwei rennen n tzlich
9011667 wir haben daran gearbeitet die abtrieb pakete zu finalisieren die f r spa und monza erforderlich sind zudem studierten wir die reifen mischungen
9011668 auch wenn wir ein paar fortschritte erzielt haben sind wir mit der balance des autos nicht dort wo ich gern sein w rde besonders im hinblick auf monza wir m ssen die daten sorgf ltig analysieren um f r das rennwochenende verbesserungen vorzunehmen
9011669 wir konzentrierten uns in dieser woche auf die bewertung der aerodynamik setups die f r spa und monza notwendig sind
9011670 wir waren in der lage eine gute balance zu erzielen auch wenn in bezug auf die leistung noch weitere fortschritte notwendig sind wir fuhren auch mit den beiden bridgestone reifen die f r diese rennen verwendet werden zudem mit entwicklungen an unserem bremssystem die sich als positiv herausgestellt haben
9011671 beide fahrer teilten sich in dieser woche die arbeit in vorbereitung auf das kommende rennen in spa und das darauf folgende rennen in monza
9011672 monza ist ein einzigartiger kurs mit sehr hoher geschwindigkeit und der charakteristik von wenig abtrieb was den fahrern in langen bremszonen und mit der traktion aus langsamen kurven heraus schwierigkeiten bereitet
9011673 unsere fahrer litten an allen klassischen problemen auf die man blicherweise in monza trifft ohne traktionskontrolle und fahrhilfen f r die fahrbarkeit des motors stellt dies eine andere dimension der herausforderung dar wir haben kein perfektes setup erzielt und auch die balance passt noch nicht wir haben weitere arbeit zu erledigen m ssen die daten analysieren bevor wir in zwei wochen hier zum rennen zur ckkehren
9011674 with gas prices rising on an hourly basis we wanted to take this time to thank our gamers for their years of loyalty and provide them with cost efficient quality entertainment

9011676 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
9011677 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
9011678 pretty horrific this shocked everybody we still cant understand it
9011679 to them its just a joke funny something to amuse you at work
9011680 they dont think of it as being bad they just think of it as a joke
9011681 because the standard of proof is higher for criminal charges than for the health departments findings there is no real physical evidence so it will depend on what people saw and might testify to
9011682 get a rouse out of him as in sexual teasing
9011683 when acura announced in 2006 its intentions to join the american le mans series advancement to lmp1 was one of the first questions many asked
9011684 we are delighted to see that acura and honda performance development have answered that question
9011685 now comes the next logical step with its move to lmp1
9011686 competing head to head on a direct level with such prototype powers like audi is a formidable task but this year has shown that acura and its teams are more than up to the challenge
9011687 barzinji is not only closely associated with pij as evidenced by ties to al arian including documents seized in tampa but also with hamas
9011688 the quran is our constitution the prophet is our guide death for the glory of allah is our greatest ambition
9011689 it was one of our main contributions to the ikhwan movement worldwide
9011690 the evidence overwhelmingly showed that defendant was a racist who regarded non whites as subhuman and who by his own admission callously murdered victim ly for the racial movement
9011691 i stabbed him in the side about 7 or 8 times he rolled over a little so i stabbed his back about 18 or 19 times then he layed flat and i slit one side of his throught on his jugular vain
9011692 oh the sounds the guy was making were like uhhh
9011693 gaming will help me because i do well under pressure i always come through i rarely choke
9011694 do you think that gaming should become part of the daily curriculum
9011695 yes i do these are the technologies that children are using and will continue to use more and more as they grow into the next work force the next thinking generation
9011696 theres a lot of us that need it out here on the streets its hard when youre down and out
9011697 unfortunately theres a lot of veterans out there who are falling through the cracks
9011698 theres a lot of vets who arent getting the services they need hopefully we can start them off on the right foot toward getting a better life for themselves and addressing their homelessness
9011699 and youve got veterans over here at united caring shelter and then we have other friends living beneath bridges at pigeon creek theres a bunch of them

9011705 you are my chosen one with you i am well pleased
9011706 due to the unprecedented demand for american eagle gold one ounce bullion coins our inventories have been depleted we are therefore temporarily suspending all sales of these coins
9011707 we are working diligently to build up our inventory and hope to resume sales shortly
9011708 due to the unprecedented demand for american eagle gold one ounce bullion coins our inventories have been depleted we are therefore temporarily suspending all sales of these coins
9011709 we are working diligently to build up our inventory and hope to resume sales shortly
9011710 until the u s mint can supply us with more coins we wont be able to supply any to our customers
9011711 the suspension is overwhelming evidence that the futures contract price of gold on the commodities exchanges is substantially below the physical market price and that indeed the commodities exchanges are being used as gata long has maintained as part of a massive scheme of manipulation of the precious metals currency and bond markets
9011712 nobody has the eagles or the buffaloes right now we bought 2 000 ounces late last week and those were the last 2 000 ounces that we can find in the marketplace
9011713 this kind of spike in demand is something no one can foresee and no business runs itself waiting for this to happen
9011714 at silver snowball we currently do still have american eagle silver coins and there has been no disruption in our fast reliable service we will continue to do all we can to keep the silver coming to you
9011715 people are smart they are protecting their money by putting it into something other than paper
9011716 at silver snowball we currently do still have american eagle silver coins and there has been no disruption in our fast reliable service we will continue to do all we can to keep the silver coming to you
9011717 a comfy warm mattress of human sound on which to lay a duvet of lazy disco
9011718 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9011719 experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
9011720 a principled reformer who understands how badly wasteful spending has marred the republican brand
9011721 vive uma continuada crise econ mica pol tica e social
9011722 pleno controlo burocr tico estatal sobre a sociedade os meios de produ o e a mais valia
9011723 os cubanos est o frustrados alienados e desesperan ados e as novas gera es desmotivadas n o sentem o mesmo compromisso que as anteriores com este socialismo pobre e sem perspectivas

9011727 when i first got hit i had no idea what it was because everything went numb and i didnt know
9011728 at first it was my elbow and my shoulder but my shoulders fine now my elbows still sore
9011729 if i can i would like to go ahead and go just to stay sharp
9011730 if i do play in the regular season i will have played that much closer to that date
9011731 we still have a game to go and obviously were going to focus on that
9011732 the regular season is so close its hard not to think about it
9011733 honestly its hard to play the game that way if you start thinking about staying healthy
9011734 but at the same time you want to win the game you play to play well as always you want to come out pretty clean
9011735 i saw a gentleman say some negative things about her as governor and every single woman in the place and i mean every single one of them verbally lambasted him or gave him dirty looks
9011736 not sure how this will play outside of alaska but it looks like mccains got the womans mom vote here
9011737 instead of wasting time trying to invent ways out of circumstances or tasks we dont like we could ask god for a creative solution in order to get things done in such a way that he will be glorified
9011738 instead of fretting and fussing about the toys strewn all over we can take a child in our arms and tell him how much jesus loves him
9011739 instead of complaining that we need more hours in the day we can ask god for the wisdom and endurance to maximize the hours he gives us when we have worked as diligently as possible we can trust him for the outcome
9011740 instead of falling into bed exhausted each night we can eliminate all that is not necessary if our labor does not honor god completely if our effort cannot in any way be helpful in expanding his kingdom it is probably a waste of time
9011741 many children are happy making some money from selling the animals to the markets but they keep some for their family
9011742 not only are our poor eating it but there is also demand from vietnamese living on the border with us
9011743 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
9011744 senator obama lets say that michell discovers that she is pregnant and at the same time learns through some prenatal tests that the unborn baby has down syndrome now with that scenario in mind senator obama what would you suggest that michell should do
9011745 well a well a you know uh uh a my faith is very important and a well a you know uh uh this is really a personal matter and a and a and a now hold on hold on allow me a moment to think and a and a and a and a to be honest this is above my pay grade
9011746 well it looks like she has only 3 and that one of them has a baby
9011747 i wouldnt have brought a baby into that loud room
9011748 me either i knew he would do something like this
9011749 something sneaky he was either going to pick a minority or a woman i cant stand female republicans they are so hypocritical did you know he will only allow himself to be photographed from his right side he has had so many cancers removed from the left side of his face that it has left him with a lot of scarring
9011750 i agree if she hadnt introduced him as her son i would have thought her very young looking daughter had had the baby and thats not good
9011751 that sneaky old bastard is probably saying whos change now be atch obama missed a huge opportunity by picking a running mate that looks the least like a change
9011752 he should have picked hillary i wonder if he regrets that now
9011753 lo nuestro tiene cura o debemos entregarnos a la desesperaci n
9011754 hablaremos con el bng con la constituci n y nuestros principios encima de la mesa
9011755 lo nuestro tiene cura o debemos entregarnos a la desesperaci n
9011756 si no hubiesen asesinado no se tendr an que sentir perseguidos
9011757 would you like to put that on your credit card
9011758 madly in love after so many years they enjoyed the miracle of loving each other as much at the table as in the bed and they grew to be so happy that even when they were two worn out old people they kept on blooming like little children and playing together like dogs
9011759 the world must be all fucked up when men travel first class and literature goes as freight
9011760 turn themselves in get their affairs in order and leave the country without being detained
9011761 concerns raised by aliens community groups and immigration attorneys who say ice unnecessarily disrupts families
9011762 what the advocates state is that we dont like enforcement of the law itself
9011763 it could end up close to 40 million baht recouping our investment
9011764 the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9011765 shes exactly who this country needs to help us fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9011766 said delegate cathie adams republican national committeewoman elect and president of the texas eagle forum
9011767 its extremely powerful to those of us who know the majority of down syndrome babies are being killed before they are born
9011768 i am so excited i am ready to go get on the plane and just sit there until it takes off
9011769 this woman has a child that proves that she is what she says she is which is a pro life believer
9011770 shes beautiful to look at the men are going to love her she hunts she fishes she is an environmentalist
9011771 in all honesty i suspect that was one of the reasons that they turned to her
9011772 there are women who are bound and determined not to die before they see a woman in the white house
9011773 has reached beyond traditional republican and washington insiders and identified a first term female governor with an intriguing personal narrative
9011774 this will be an interesting experiment and palin may just attract disgruntled hillary supporters
9011775 it is history and i congratulate sen mccain for choosing a woman
9011776 all i can say is they must be really really worried about barack obamas appeal
9011777 a lot of the women were in favor of hillary clinton because of her stance on issues that are important to women im very proud to be an elected official whos a woman but just having ovaries doesnt qualify you for anything
9011778 sarah palin is an excellent choice for vice president she has a proven track record of making tough choices taking on corruption and implementing reforms in one of our countrys largest states
9011779 as a mother of five with a son in the military she understands firsthand the challenges that american families face like the impact of rising energy prices
9011780 and as governor of a large energy producing state she knows we can and must lessen our dependence on foreign oil through increased exploration and diversification of our energy portfolio
9011781 compared to joe bidens lifelong opposition to energy exploration her energy experience is proof that she is the right choice for this country
9011782 like sen mccain sarah knows the best way to grow our economy is by cutting taxes and controlling spending in washington
9011783 reaffirms sen mccains commitment to energy independence spending restraint and reforming the way washington works
9011784 gov palin supports an all of the above energy approach with first hand experience advocating it
9011785 she has a strong record of working to cut wasteful spending she is firmly dedicated to promoting strong families and protecting the most vulnerable in society gov palin will be a true agent of change who brings a breath of fresh air to washington from far outside the beltway
9011786 i think hillary clintons campaign stimulated a lot of interest among women voters and i think this is going to hit a chord
9011787 thought he needed to satisfy that wing of the party
9011788 i guess the difference is obama is asking to be president while the vice president is a heartbeat away but not exactly president
9011789 more importantly she has the judgment when you look at obamas judgment he has been wrong every single time
9011790 im looking forward to learning about what her record is on foreign policy
9011791 i think its good for republicans and good for the country to have a woman on the ticket
9011792 the vice presidential selection by mccains definition is supposed to be the very best person to be president of the united states after him if he thinks she is the best person thats just stunning its a reflection both on his judgment and on the hypocrisy of his campaign
9011793 look at all the money they spent trying to convince people barack obama doesnt have experience
9011794 there has been a culture of corruption in alaska sen ted stevens congressman don young gov sarah palin they are all cut from the same cloth
9011795 kok ditangkap sih biarkanlah mereka menikmati hari raya imlek nanti mereka juga sama seperti kita pengen ngerayain dan menjalani tahun baru bersama ibunya induk burungnya
9011796 driving the r8 is like smearing honey into keira knightly
9011797 in principle this car is too fast for my thoughts
9011798 i cant say that since this convention started i havent thought about it because i have
9011799 i want to see how close to 60 votes we can get in the senate what the committee structure is and how best i can use my time
9011800 the job i do now i think is important and what i really want to do is make a difference
9011801 the question is how can i best do that is it using the seniority i have in the senate or is it in getting out there and running for governor
9011802 follow osama bin laden to the cave where he lives
9011803 the average american family saw its income go down 2 000 under george bush
9011804 down 2 000 since 2001 and it increased again last year
9011805 we love this country too much to let the next four years be just like the last eight
9011806 we must take out osama bin laden if we have him in our sites

9011827 the people here are really nice they make me feel comfortable and when i get upset they listen and make me feel better
9011828 families can get very isolated in their own homes and were trying to break down that isolation
9011829 we want to develop these childrens skills and assets and get families committed to the broader community we want to connect parents to what their children and youths are involved in and are doing
9011830 we know through housing complexes in comparable neighbourhoods that we have a lower number of disputes and vandalism
9011831 we know from police that our complex is not on their radar and they tell us that this program has made a big difference
9011832 i see commitment and a sense of caring about others and themselves

9011839 minha identidade constru da pelas pessoas que amo e que me cerca cada vez que uma delas morre parte de minha identidade se rompe e se perde sou obcecado pela maneira como a perda de algu m que amo afeta minha pr pria identidade
9011840 there is a big difference between being anti american and being critical of the united states
9011841 the fundamental role of anti americanism in europe in general and particularly among those on the left is to absolve themselves of their own moral failings and intellectual errors by heaping them onto the monster scapegoat the united states of america the u s is charged with all the evils real or imagined that afflict humanity from the falling price of beef in france to aids in africa and global warming everywhere the result is a widespread refusal to accept responsibility for ones own actions
9011842 anti americanism is hypocrisy at its finest you can spend your evening catching the latest episode of
9011843 it all boils down to the fact that knowledge and intelligence are two different issues rote memorization of world capitals does not equate intelligence
9011844 as an american please allow me to begin by asserting that our nation has had its strengths and its weaknesses its successes and its failures and its justices and injustices throughout history and continuing into the present although i sense much patriotism for my homeland i recognize our need for humility to understand that our country is not above questioning or reproach but is rather under the same standards as all other nations of the world i would simply like to ask those who view our country from afar to maintain a balanced perspective and realize too that there exists good and bad in america both in terms of its domestic society and politics as well as in its relations with other nations whilst there may be growing anti americanism in the united kingdom i do not believe such sentiment to be reciprocated on our side of the atlantic i viewed a recent survey that indicated most americans view england positively and never have i seen the flag of your country or any other foreign land for that matter burned in the streets of our cities clearly we as american citizens have not meant to be your enemies
9011845 as someone who takes human rights seriously im appalled by the lack of sympathy the left feels toward the victims of any regime other than the bush administration lets shout it to prisoners everywhere if youre not harmed by an american your suffering doesnt count
9011846 ambivalence antipathy and resentment toward and about the united states have comprised an important component of european culture since the american revolution at the latest thus way before america became the worlds mr big the proverbial eight hundred pound gorilla and a credible rival to europes main powers particularly britain and france while the politics style and discourse of the bush administration and of george w bush as a person have undoubtedly exacerbated anti american sentiment among europeans and fostered a heretofore unmatched degree of unity between elite and mass opinion in europe they are not cause indeed a change to a center left administration in washington led by a democratic president would not bring about its abatement let alone disappearance
9011847 is euro disney land a threat to the french culture if french culture can be squashed by mickey mouse or more exactly by simply moving mickey geographically it would have to be disturbingly fragile
9011848 anti americanism is the only face of xenophobia still broadly accepted in europe
9011849 americans find themselves damned either way if they remain within their own borders they are isolationist hicks who are shirking their responsibilities if they intervene they are rapacious imperialists
9011850 the british find it very difficult to come to terms with the loss of their global dominance we felt a deep sense of hurt and loss we used to run the world and we dont anymore so in order to palliate that insecurity we tend to run ourselves down too much and were also snooty about the people who do run the world
9011851 it is tragic that anti american ideas are so easily passed through rumour while reconciliatory ideas and notions must be backed up with catalogues of evidence before they are even considered purely because of the fact that it is so much easier to hate than to keep an objective open mind
9011852 other common anti american objections are ignorance and stupidity in dealing with these two i have no reason to suspect that the average american is any less intelligent than the average person from anywhere else one trait i have noticed is that other cultures are generally much more ashamed of any deficit in the intellect of the individual especially ours the british and as such will make a much greater attempt to hide it if all cultures bar one are scared of looking stupid and take action to prevent that happening then that one remaining culture is inevitably going to be lumbered with that image
9011853 we became not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic different people different beliefs different yearnings different hopes different dreams
9011854 most of the anti americanism these days stems from plain old nationalistic jealousy by a lot of countries that are born of insecurity about their own place in the world and their painful self awareness of their own failings and shortcomings like the kids in the next block who are jealous of the boy who has a better bicycle or a newer fancier skateboard phuque em all
9011855 europeans like the rest of the world hate america and americans but love our aid when in distress and our soldiers to die for their countries you need to work live and pay taxes from this side of the atlantic to understand our vision of europe and the rest of the world
9011856 unjustified hatred of americans there is much unjustified hatred in the world there is unjustified hatred of the usa much of this arises from the victimisation complex that sweeps much of mankind whoever is in charge whoever is powerful or successful will also be hated this immature hatred often evaporates quickly with a little reason or thought there are some some invalid unjustified criticisms the most widespread hate is the hate by people the world over who fall victim to their own shortcomings and want a scapegoat
9011857 usa citizens are not given world news in the same way as most the other developed nations
9011858 despite the usas dominance of mass media it is frequently only the pro usa self congratulatory messages that seem to arrive in europe the usa citizens criticism and disbelief of their own government is not apparent which gives the overall impression that americans are either gullible ignorant or honestly uncaring
9011859 if a person outside of american culture is a hateful person they may actively hate and verbally attack america
9011860 i think it is best when faced with people from other nations to treat them as individuals
9011861 sometimes the caliber of a nation is found not in why it is liked but rather in why it is not
9011862 everyone is in favor of free speech hardly a day passes without its being extolled but some peoples idea of it is that they are free to say what they like but if anyone says anything back that is an outrage
9011863 with a military that has become a laughing stock and her increasing irrelevance in the world around her i believe that the canada i know and loved is gone
9011864 de vara vond het een leuk idee en nederland 1 ook we gaan dan 12 uur live televisie maken mooi weer de leeuw van half negen s avonds tot half negen s ochtends dat is dan op 29 november
9011865 ao fazer 50 anos assim que michael jackson devia parecer
9011866 mum did we leave belfast because you were afraid of dying
9011867 its frivolous and the lyrics are so simple compared to the rest of the album like theyre extra simple
9011868 me him and johnny come from the same ilk of ego were quite confident in our skills
9011869 that track was just about getting the last bit of i hate men off my chest
9011870 it was for one of my ex boyfriends i hadnt quite adjusted him quite like he needed to be adjusted it was a you leave or ill leave situation i was tired of it
9011871 but i never really know whats gonna come out of the other end
9011872 i look back at challengers and i think its the only album we could have made
9011873 and as much as some people might have been annoyed with us for getting mellow all those mellow songs are my favourites on it
9011874 the funny thing is right up to these days even though theres a lot of good music coming out of vancouver nobody really talks about vancouver as a place that spawns good music you know like the minute arcade fire showed up in montreal everybody went holy shit montreals the greatest place for music and when broken social scene showed up in toronto everybody went torontos the most amazing place for music but theres never really been that response for vancouver
9011875 lets see it was a comment section so i imagine our problem was that we were a bunch of fags
9011876 its cool because ive always been this music geek and for that reason i know the names of the music critics you know
9011877 when we played new york last october gord gano came up and we did a violent femmes song with him which was just as good as playing with ray davies of the kinks because theyre both very iconic musicians in my head in fact as much as i love the kinks i dont think anything they did ever hit me as hard as the first violent femmes album its one of the best rock n roll albums ever made
9011878 the weirder part of that was when it started getting covered in music blogs
9011879 and its good to know that happened because 10 years ago all the people i was friends with were all probably thinking god when are we going to get lives why are we still playing music all of our music playing friends from when we were like 22 have gone and got psychology degrees or something and careers and were still these losers playing music its nice that the years pass and we feel somehow were sort of validated it makes you feel like theres some element of justice in the world however faint
9011880 theres never been an event where the new pornographers destroyer and neko case all played together
9011881 but we didnt want to do another regular show because rock concerts can get really boring i think when you tour a lot and do lots of shows its easy to get jaded you just kinda go oh shit do we have to go to europe but i feel good about this show its gonna be cool
9011882 years ago backstage drummer kurt dahle and i started doing our wordless a cappella duo it was called the stanley park singing company where we started out doing wordless peter and gordon covers we had an acoustic guitar and we would gurgle so basically it just popped into my head when i realized we were playing malkin bowl i thought what a completely stupid name the stanley park singing exhibition was and its always great when you can make your stupidest stupid ideas reality
9011883 thats a real inside joke that maybe eight or 10 people on earth would know
9011884 and the chance to work with people like elizabeth pe a and rutger hauer made it even more interesting plus david beckham and all those guys of course
9011885 i just did a movie in new mexico called spoken word it was a small independent film directed by victor nunez that has a very powerful story and thats the kind of thing i love to do most ive been doing mostly independent films and things like goal give me a chance to have more options
9011886 i keep playing guys with little or no hair this one gave me a chance to have some again so thats my range hair and no hair
9011887 hannah montana and miley cyrus best of both worlds concert
9011888 im here not to be a peace demonstrator im here to demonstrate peace
9011889 they try to construct this image that the twin cities and minnesota at large are a swing state theyve been doing it for a decade at least to me its important that people either on a political level or an aesthetic level are doing as much as they can to remind people in the state and on the national level that this in fact isnt a republican state that its a traditionally progressive state and that it will remain so
9011890 our generation has dropped the ball many times on opportunities to speak our mind about things of a political nature
9011891 were too self aware were bogged down in so much irony and information at this point and it seems like no one is really saying anything of any thrust or power
9011892 envisioning another four years of whats been going down for the last eight seems pretty unacceptable and dangerous for the country
9011893 its worth a little bit of time and a little bit of energy and a little bit of money to try to stop the bleeding and at least put someone in there that seems thoughtful and seems like they have a sense of justice
9011894 and i think that what we need right now as a nation and as a planet is the opportunity to have dialogue the opportunity to have a conversation between grassroots organizations between corporate leaders and between everyday people in the street and our politicians
9011895 i think the greater good that can come out of this and i hope does is that people will realize that this is a unifying point
9011896 i want people to feel like they are invested in something like this is some sort of a movement because everything has to start somewhere
9011897 its up for debate whether the music itself can change things
9011898 sometimes it can but the statement made by everybody getting together for a common purpose and the common thread that connects all of us is our love of music and our participation in that
9011899 im not of the belief that a band or a song changes the world for me its the experience of being there and being part of a community that feels the same way that you do
9011900 but i can at least do my part i live here we all live here the worst thing you could possibly do is nothing
9011901 i hadnt had a band since high school you know how everyone has to have an obligatory high school punk band
9011902 i knew dan from around university he was initially sort of my nemesis the rivalry was purely on my end you see this kid around the cafeteria wearing a bad brains t shirt and you feel a connection to him but you also want to sort of challenge him you know
9011903 we made a list of labels and sub pop wasnt even on the list
9011904 it was not even a long shot in our minds they actually sought us out which was really flattering when a label like sub pop contacts you a label with such a history and legendary influence well we were really thrilled that they got in touch with us
9011905 and being on a sub pop dramatically increases our visibility and potential
9011906 yes the title is all in caps but its not an acronym it doesnt stand for anything its just to annoy you
9011907 were not looking to create cold distant music that you really need to listen closely to in order to get all these intellectual ideas but were not trying to dumb it down or anything
9011908 all of that sst stuff is a huge influence on us maybe not stylistically but in an artistic aesthetic sense i wouldnt say that we sound like the minutemen at all although i love everything they did
9011909 id say we definitely have more in common with husker du in their later period when their material became more musical and they were making these shimmering pop songs
9011910 we dont even have real homes anymore well at least not for the next six or eight months were going to be in a van and the plan is keep taking advantage of where we are and the resources we have do the appropriate touring and go from town to town getting the job done
9011911 so she went and got the guard and got him involved and i told him to fuck off too and he pulled out his billy club and started hitting me with it and i wrestled it away from him and then i started walking away and he shot me in the back
9011912 but you take all that what we were as a band originally and who we are as musicians and shit and youre helped by the longevity it actually contributes to it in that way because it is so much about you know music and maybe theres not that youthful verve maybe you lose that with time and experience but you gain other things
9011913 well its definitely pretty amazing thats for sure and then theres something that resonates with just why i became an artist in the first place and the kind of art that weve always made very human very human were fragile imperfect little strange mysterious things and victims of circumstance largely yet masters of our own destiny and on and on but definitely its just like have i actually managed to fuckin not only not die but actually start playing music again with curt and actually playing music thats just kicking my ass is this really going on yeah its fuckin cool jesus it beats the shit outta fuckin corpses and pigs and death and the pokey and getting shot it definitely beats getting shot
9011914 i dont know anything about angola but i know theyre in trouble
9011915 siento mucho ver a un gran campe n como l no estar entre los diez primeros en valencia el pasado gran premio pero por lo que concierne a ferrari puede estar tranquilo
9011916 tenemos que trabajar para que encuentre las condiciones para salir m s adelante en estos nuevos circuitos
9011917 les autorit s ont d cid dappliquer des mesures de protection en particulier des restrictions de la consommation de produits alimentaires locaux l gumes et lait jusqu une distance de 5 km
9011918 que vista es demasiado caro en comparaci n con el actual precio del hardware
9011919 dada la acogida que ha tenido vista junto con la ca da de los precios que vimos en febrero no me sorprender a ver el pr ximo windows 7 entrar en el mercado a un precio m s barato
9011920 always use the selected program to open this kind of file
9011921 its a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will but that we also have obligations to treat each other with dignity and respect
9011922 thats the promise of america the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper
9011923 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now
9011924 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
9011925 tropical depression 8 has formed and is set to become tropical storm hannah and its quite possible by the end of next week hannah could head towards the city general honor warned us about
9011926 john mccain is very likely to receive a historically low share of the black vote
9011927 a reflection of senator obamas historic candidacy the deep and genuine enthusiasm for him in the black community and senator mccains association with president bush an exceptionally unpopular figure among african americans
9011928 this guide scientifically documents the historical shift of black voter allegiances over the past 50 years and places black voter attitudes and preferences in the context of the pressing issues of our day
9011929 we hope that delegates to the republican national convention will find this information useful in understanding the concerns of black voters and how they will influence the upcoming election
9011930 like to get the opportunity to change his mind on anwr
9011931 i beg to disagree with any candidate who would say we cant drill our way out of our problem
9011932 on his first important decision demonstrating what kind of president hed be john mccain scores a failing grade
9011933 the notable fuel efficiency of boeings 777 combined with the airplanes extensive range and large cargo capacity is something egyptair values highly in this competitive environment
9011934 as a new member of the star alliance we look forward to increasing our connectivity across the globe and bringing our passengers the utmost in cabin comfort and service with a dynamic new business class layout that will debut on the 777 300er
9011935 wed like to congratulate egyptair on its order and acquisition of boeing 777 300ers and on the airlines induction into the star alliance
9011936 the 777s operational performance with its significant savings in fuel and maintenance costs will have a positive impact on egyptairs growth plans and help the airline achieve greater profitability
9011937 were going to do a little more for different crowds
9011938 our new philosophy is that we have to compete against all bands not just certain bands thats how it is now
9011939 i hope they like it i think theyll like the music
9011940 we have operated in this market for ten years now we have an excellent network of partners and clients wherefore theres a lot of information that flows through us what is needed in the market or who we could offer solutions to
9011941 i am going to be an advocate for the noncivil service employee
9011942 fire and police have an advocate and a political group noncivil service employees dont have anyone to speak for them
9011943 the reason we need a raise is that gas prices are going up grocery store prices are going up some guys out here have two or three jobs trying to make ends meet
9011944 anyone who had anything to do with randalls neighborhood or her gun range has their head on the chopping block i dont support that whatsoever
9011945 its just a stalling tactic on her part to force us to put in the budget what she wants to
9011946 the remoteness of the northern islands will not protect them
9011947 by boat they are only a day away from saipan
9011948 the proposed monument takes on even greater importance as populations construction projects and associated impacts in the southern part of the archipelago increase
9011949 since guam is a major transportation hub in the pacific increased boat and air traffic associated with the troop relocation pose a worrisome threat to wildlife throughout the cnmi
9011950 unilateral arbitrary presidential action that eschews weighing stakeholder concerns in a fair manner

9011957 determined to return to the city since delivering a presentation at mit a few years ago
9011958 overheidsbedrijven zoals belgacom zouden beter geprivatiseerd worden de rol van de overheid is in de eerste plaats de voorwaarden cre ren voor een competitieve goedwerkende markt het is niet aan de overheid om zelf een marktspeler te zijn met in dit geval een quasi monopoliepositie er bovenop
9011959 de overheid moet zorgen dat de consument profiteert van scherpe concurrentie dit is vandaag nog altijd niet het geval belgacom schermt de markt af
9011960 a companhia espera abrir as 50 lojas em todo o brasil deste total 15 ser o em s o paulo e 5 no rio de janeiro
9011961 es una se al bastante grave que entrega el pa s desde el punto de vista de la justicia
9011962 el problema de los fiscales es algo bastante serio producto de la sobrecarga de trabajo y la falta de coordinaci n con las diferentes polic as que impide mejorar la calidad de los servicios
9011963 every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around
9011964 the high winds and rain of this storm caused tremendous damage to the communities we serve
9011965 i hope this effort will provide assistance to families that truly need a helping hand if their homes or businesses were adversely affected by this storm we will continue to help our friends and neighbors in their time of need
9011966 i struggled for a bit its frustrating because the greens were good and i just was not really making anything
9011967 i finally hit one close on 12 and got the round finally going its nice to get off to a half decent start
9011968 i drove it well hit my irons well and i felt like i putted well only one bogey on the card i hit some good putts and a couple slipped by
9011969 the incident has claimed the lives of hundreds of fish mainly perch pike and some eels with hundreds of fish also distressed
9011970 it would appear this fish kill was caused by an increase of natural organic matter which is causing a higher that normal pressure on the oxygen levels in the water
9011971 i do like to go out with friends go eat out and have fun like a normal teenager does but im still really motivated i do most of my work during the night which neither of my parents approve up but usually end up going to bed around 2 4am
9011972 when i dont make six figures in a month its ok theres always next month
9011973 elite retreat was great the conference was very unique because all the attendees were willing to share information about what they do and not be secretive i learned quite a bit not only from the speakers but also just as much from my fellow attendees
9011974 they have a sense of security know what to look for and how to observe people and the presence of the dogs in the airport makes people feel safer
9011975 our passenger loads were 39 900 from the time they opened the ticket counters this morning until noon
9011976 that was the big push we are expecting 60 000 before its over
9011977 well i try to debunk some of the popular myths about sexuality
9011978 well one popular myth is that african american men are the most well endowed when in fact it is the native american indian who is most likely to possess this trait another popular myth is that frenchmen are the best lovers when actually it is men of jewish descent who romance women best on average
9011979 i feel so awkward discussing this with you and i dont even know your name
9011980 quando puder jogar vou conversar com meu empres rio mas a primeira op o ser o sport a perspectiva de que possa voltar em novembro mas quero come ar em janeiro mesmo para que esteja na ponta dos cascos s vou jogar mesmo se estiver bem

9011983 eu queria lampard n o um segredo mas n o poderia estar mais feliz com muntari esqueci absolutamente dele
9011984 the world has always been more impressed with the power of our example than the example of our power
9011985 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9011986 it is pretty audacious for the obama campaign to say that governor palin is not qualified to be vice president she has a record of accomplishment that senator obama simply cannot match governor palin has spent her time in office shaking up government in alaska and actually achieving results whether its taking on corruption passing ethics reform or stopping wasteful spending and the bridge to nowhere senator obama has spent his time in office running for president
9011987 sarah palin is an exciting choice who will resonate with the small towns and big dreams of oregon
9011988 she completes a strong ticket an all western ticket that will understand and focus on the issues facing oregon
9011989 we got to shift this dynamic we got to change this paradigm its a big challenge and one which we better bite into
9011990 this is obviously one of our bigger loads and so were happy to have all of this equipment here so we can really get rolling
9011991 it really is taking that area that we had in the northwest and trying to make sure it fits here in this space and so far its been a pretty good fit
9011992 its been a little bit of a puzzle but its all worked out very nicely
9011993 one hundred flys always comes down to finishes and some would say cavics finish was it was at that point 50 50 whether you take another stroke or you take a glide
9011994 you see phelpsy took another stroke he cavic took a glide and obviously phelps arms are coming over at a faster pace
9011995 he phelps made the right decision and the other guy made the wrong decision
9011996 but if he phelps had made the other decision he might not have been as lucky and he might have come away with a second and he would have come away with equaling spitzs record
9011997 im not saying he didnt deserve it im saying he did everything he could do to win those golds and he came away with it but at the same time there were little mistakes by other people that allowed him to do that
9011998 i guess what else is left to do for him except come down and win races he hasnt won before
9011999 when you are the greatest swimmer ever i guess you can afford to do that
9012000 hes accomplished so much already he wants to accomplish more
9012001 its the same as it was two months ago when they did the first exam
9012002 its not worse which is important now the thing is its not better either and it seems like the only way to repair it completely is arthroscopic surgery
9012003 my plan was to be part of the olympic games and i knew that if i suffered from pain they would have to operate this isnt something that took me by surprise
9012004 now we know the field and there is one ticket that stands for change and one ticket that is four more years of the bush administration
9012005 hes chosen someone who has no foreign policy experience whatsoever
9012006 to us sarah palin represents more of the same and she lacks the experience that john mccain says a president needs
9012007 he has added someone on his 72nd birthday who does not have the experience to be a heartbeat away from the presidency
9012008 compare that to joe biden who has vast foreign policy experience and has traveled the world implementing it its just very clear what he was trying to do here his choice had everything to do with his dim political outlook
9012009 shes against oregons values on everything from the war in iraq to a womans right to choose
9012010 we got to shift this dynamic we got to change this paradigm its a big challenge and one which we better bite into
9012011 i think its great that the first woman with a 1600 pennsylvania address will be a republican
9012012 im very excited about it i think its a terrific choice
9012013 mccain is someone who has bucked his own party and governor palin did the same thing in alaska bucking the establishment and tackling reform
9012014 shes also an outdoors woman she hunts she fishes i think shell appeal to the northwest
9012015 we got to shift this dynamic we got to change this paradigm its a big challenge and one which we better bite into
9012016 there will be about 60 trucks when its all said and done making it from point a to point b
9012017 no question about it it is a project that has to be looked at very carefully and to see this truck arrive here today is a real sign that were making progress
9012018 we ramped up early and got some things in here but this is obviously one of our bigger loads and so were happy to have all of this equipment here so we can really get rolling
9012019 it really is taking that area that we had in the northwest and trying to make sure it fits here in this space and so far its been a pretty good fit
9012020 its been a little bit of a puzzle but its all worked out very nicely
9012021 everything down to that last stapler to that office set
9012022 youll see some more trucks like this coming through and well have more equipment itll be everything from office furniture to computers to a lot of the equipment for basketball operations
9012023 this psychiatry s t apparently what youre feeling is not what youre feeling and what youre not feeling is your real agenda
9012024 gator fsu miami or even ucf other than the parking pass
9012025 i do not pray for these only but also for those who believe in me through their word that they may all be one even as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also might be in us so that the world may believe that thou has sent me
9012026 and he said to him you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind
9012027 as an ardent practicing catholic abortion is an issue that i have studied for a long time
9012028 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
9012029 the church has affirmed the moral of evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion this is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law

9012045 in the last 24 hours weve seen both campaigns refocus themselves in a powerful way on the hillary clinton supporters
9012046 he cannot say any more that barack obama doesnt have the experience to be commander in chief when he chooses a woman whose signature achievement two years ago was that they won an award from the national arbor day foundation

9012113 everything was arranged and agreed i have dozens of texts and recordings with dina to prove it but when the time came on sunday dina chose to go into nyc and have dinner with sam sams mother and lindsay rather than address real issues and make things better for lindsay
9012114 a day later dina told me that sam was writing a book that sam was a negative influence on lindsay and that sam needs to be out of lindsays life then she asked me how to do it
9012115 matters became worse when dina said lindsay was in real danger and she needed to save her and get lindsay into a place these are all dinas words tell me what father wouldnt be concerned and even pissed at sam after hearing this
9012116 while guilt may bring a response by some others like dina pass the buck and dont accept any responsibility at all
9012117 all i want is for lindsay to be healthy and in a good relationship
9012118 dinas a two face she wants to try to look good and stay on lindsays good side instead of being a good parent i dont give two hoots about my relationship with lindsay as a friend one day shes going to turn around to me and tell me daddy you were right

9012298 we have written to 69 secondary schools in the mid west letting them know about our services and we only got responses from five of these schools in the 22 years we have been in the mid west we have been only asked once to go into a secondary school to do a workshop on our helplines and that school was in limerick i am not surprised at the lack of response from schools given their ethos around religion
9012299 teachers are still ill equipped to talk about gay and lesbian identity they can talk about inclusion and racism but not about sexuality it is time to open up now particularly when the safety of students is at risk

9012301 people are gobsmacked by the decision priests and people alike
9012302 the decision to entrust the parish to opus dei was made by the archbishop as was the case with all the other parishes attributed to religious orders there was no difference in practice on this occasion the parish pastoral council was informed in advance parishioners were informed last sunday
9012303 the fact that it was a parish where the parish priest fr seamus moore was retiring and it became possible both to replace the pp and also add some other priests merrion road is a complex parish
9012304 in addition to regular parish activities it is also a service church with large numbers of people calling on a regular basis due to its position on a main transit road and its presence near a large hospital
9012305 there is a shortage of priests in the diocese and the needs of parishes such as merrion road are changing the policy in the parish will continue to be that of the diocese and this will be set out in a contract as with any religious order there is no sense of giving any special status to opus dei
9012306 opus dei did not ask for this particular parish the parish was one which was available

9012315 he really wanted to play wow and had been literally begging but wed never let him because 1 he still had a hard time reading and 2 he was practically incapable of writing and basically refused to do it in any form we made a deal with him that he could play it over the summer after first grade with the understanding that those things were a part of the game by the time school started back up for second grade he was reading above the recommended level when tested normally kids lose a few levels over the summer he started out the summer a few levels below what they wanted and ended it several above he also was typing very nicely and now loves to write he fills up his writing notebook and likes to take it with him
9012316 he also went from a child that didnt want to play with others or even talk to them much to child who enjoys playing with other kids
9012317 i cant credit everything to wow but it certainly made a big difference he went from being a child that had to be promoted to both first and second grade because he didnt pass wouldnt and couldnt write played by himself and had troubles reading to the child he is today who no longer receives any form of special education services except for speech and was getting upper 80 averages on his report cards there was a point in time i truly despaired if he would ever be able to live a normal life while i still worry i know that he is now almost unrecognizable from other kids you really have to know what you are looking for to realize that hes autistic

9012461 healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both
9012462 its been a healthy foundation for me but dont be afraid of information and let kids debate both sides
9012463 its a theory just like evolution is a theory even though it may not be as plausible
9012464 i think americans should be exposed to every point of view he said
9012465 i felt as texas governor like both sides ought to be properly taught
9012466 i think that part of education is to expose people to different schools of thought
9012467 youre asking me whether or not people ought to be exposed to different ideas and the answer is yes

9012474 gov palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9012475 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done sen mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9012476 ths decision is yet another example of why the american people can trust him to make wise decisions and to confidently lead this country bush said of mccain
9012477 if john mccain thought that choosing sarah palin would attract hillary clinton voters he is badly mistaken
9012478 in addition sarah palin is under investigation by the alaska state legislature which makes this more incomprehensible

9012493 there is no technical reason that a third party could not accumulate and assemble the hardware components in an apple labeled computer hardware system such that said system would be capable of running the mac os
9012494 the kernel panic is self induced by apples embedding of code to prevent operability on computer hardware systems that are not apple labeled computer hardware systems
9012495 the mac os market is distinct and unique as compared to other operating systems including but not limited to the windows operating system
9012496 as such psystar alleges that the windows operating system is not and cannot be considered an effective substitute for the mac os the same holds true for any other operating system
9012497 maintaining the current standard of excellence relative to existing properties and creating benchmarks there
9012498 one of the key things of any public official is judgment and the ability to look at issues through the eyes of the constituents rather than just saying we need such and such a facility because were lacking there relative to other communities
9012499 have a two way flow of information and people are satisfied theyre getting their questions asked and were disseminating information they have a right to know
9012500 were definitely going to have to do something there and its too early to say what
9012501 but were lacking terribly relatively speaking when it comes to indoor space if we can get buy in from the community on something thats going to come out favorably im all for doing it
9012502 we have all the equipment here and are ready to do business
9012503 so we took his money and thanked him for coming

9012519 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl told him that he had come up with a plan on how to murder someone
9012520 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl wanted to find an adult male who lived by himself and within walking distance of the defendants house
9012521 mr busskohl stated that he would then either stab the potential victim in the chest or slash his throat mr busskohl told mr eischens that he would then either cut off the eyelids of the victim or cut out his heart
9012522 im not even sure i would have gone through with it
9012523 the evidence i received he busskohl discussed very openly these things with the police
9012524 within eight to 10 hours the bizarre type of thinking he was undergoing was gone
9012525 if anybody were to meet him and talk to him at this point he represents no threat to anyone
9012526 i didnt even look at it as a murder plot until they actually started putting it on the news
9012527 what bothers me is if you throw a rock hes about four blocks away
9012528 which is a substantial step toward and more than preparation for the commission of the crime
9012529 but if we have somebody thats just simply preparing to commit the crime and does not take a substantial step toward committing that crime we cant charge an attempt and thats what this is all about
9012530 if it wasnt for his friend and the grace of god thatd be it

9012535 we should not have come here for they found all of the women and children during the time of the last great culling but we didnt know where else to run we hoped they would just take a few as they have done for the past few generations
9012536 already figured that out but i havent seen anywhere that wouldnt bring the ceiling down on top of us too
9012537 dont take this the wrong way but i was expecting everyone to start panicking

9012574 will comcast count some traffic against the cap but not other traffic as in comcast generated video
9012575 we think 250 gb is an extremely large amount of bandwidth
9012576 a low bandwidth user downloading an hd movie at 8 p m in peak time puts more stress on the network than someone who downloads lots more in the middle of the night
9012577 if fewer than 1 percent would be affected by this whats the point
9012578 if they are going to put caps then they need to give us what i think is an acceptable expectation a meter
9012579 figure out a way to tell us what is our monthly usage and let us know if we are running up against a 250 gb cap we know when to stop
9012580 if you believe the 0 05 kb e mail then you also believe in the tooth fairy
9012581 it remains unclear how the cap announced today helps solve comcasts supposed congestion problems
9012582 though the proposed cap is relatively high it will increasingly ensnare more users as technology continues its natural progression

9012637 lawmakers will hire someone within a week to investigate whether governor sarah palin abused her power in firing public safety commissioner walt monegan the legislative council approved 100 000 dollars for the investigation that will find out whether palin was angry at monegan for not firing an alaska state trooper who went through a messy divorce with palins sister
9012638 more recently she has come under the scrutiny of an investigation by the republican controlled legislature into the possibility that she ordered the dismissal of alaskas public safety commissioner because he would not fire her former brother in law as a state trooper
9012639 monegan than alleged that he had been pressured to fire state trooper mike wooten who was married to palins sister and was involved in a contentious divorce according to the anchorage daily news
9012640 palin has denied any wrongdoing the state legislature voted on july 28 to hire an independent investigator to probe whether palin her family or members of her administration had pressured monegan to fire wooten according to the daily news
9012641 palin hasnt been implicated in the four year old federal corruption investigation which has resulted in convictions of or guilty pleas from three state legislators murkowskis former chief of staff and two executives of an oil services company as well as the indictment of senator ted stevens
9012642 this is a governor who was almost impervious to error
9012643 now she could face impeachment in a worst case scenario

9012652 we are saddened that the fine work of these young men is now cast under a cloud of unintended racism
9012653 we ask that you applaud their hard work and know that they were working to honor colusa county with their artistic depiction of a genre of ag products produced in stellar quantities by the county seeds
9012654 but they probably never had the benefit of a black history class
9012655 if the students were presented with that history they might have drawn waldo watermelon seed a little differently

9012677 i get pretty emotional when i see them having a wonderful time
9012678 looking forward to doing a lot of great things i think the best is yet to come in my true humble opinion
9012679 that meant very much to me and seemed to be received so beautifully by the public and the world you know i enjoyed it very much
9012680 on his 72nd birthday is this really the one heartbeat away he wants to put in the white house
9012681 had not been briefed and prepared for some of the questions
9012682 shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and washington second
9012683 we look ahead to a better day as we also prepare ourselves for another threat
9012684 i think god is reminding us that on the eve of katrina god can bring nature back
9012685 we decided not to look backward we decided to look forward with all the progress weve made
9012686 what youre going to see is the product of three years of planning training and exercising at all levels of government starting with the local and the state level and leading up to the federal level
9012687 my husband was a lifelong commercial fisherman he is now a production operator up in the oil fields up on alaskas north slope and hes a proud member of the united steelworkers union and hes a world champion snow machine racer
9012688 therell be another one undoubtedly in the next couple of years but i also think well see some new ones starting up as well almost against common sense
9012689 i know that everyone wants to jump on the bandwagon because oil prices
9012690 i dont buy that because i can name two dozen airlines that have gone bankrupt in canada when oil was 20
9012691 while we are in the process of rebooking all of our customers affected by the closure of zoom airlines onto alternate flights we want our customers to know that we are a registered member of the bpcpa which will ensure they all get refunds for unused zoom airline tickets booked for today onwards
9012692 while there are many areas which experienced serious flooding and tragically casualties in particular in the south the scale of the damage in port au prince does not seem to be as extensive as we have seen in the past

9012694 they were suffering from metastasing brain tumours caused by various cancers mainly lung and breast cancer that failed to respond to conventional treatment and were otherwise inoperable
9012695 the patients feels nothing during the operation and generally can leave hospital 14 hours later the evening or the morning after the operation
9012696 this is the first time that laser technology has been used intracranially meaning inside an enclosed skull using mri in real time to avoid collateral damage
9012697 this is the forerunner of future techniques in which mri will play a core intervention role in neurosurgery
9012698 you look at this and say boy i hope this thing doesnt really explode but it probably will
9012699 gustav is expected to be a large powerful hurricane as it approaches the northern gulf coast
9012700 supporting paid sick days is a plus for political candidates
9012701 both before and after hearing arguments for and against paid sick days voters indicate they are more likely to vote for a candidate who backed this requirement
9012702 the lack of paid sick days has real consequences for americans forced to choose between losing a days pay or going to work sick
9012703 its difficult for employees to be productive when they are not well they also expose co workers and customers to illness providing paid sick days which this survey shows is favored by the vast majority of americans is a simple matter of good employer practice and good public health
9012704 across all socio demographic groups majorities endorse paid sick days as a fundamental workplace necessity that employers should be required to provide the lack of paid sick days is a concern to those lacking coverage and is associated with dissatisfaction with ones job
9012705 we saw what we call an equivalent of neuroplasticity a change in brain activation that reflects the brains adaptability
9012706 it is promising that treadmill exercise can stimulate new or underused brain circuits and improve walking in stroke survivors even after completion of conventional rehabilitation therapy
9012707 much of the publics attitude toward alaska bridges is based on inaccurate portrayals of the projects here but we need to focus on what we can do rather than fight over what has happened
9012708 but we need to focus on what we can do rather than fight over what has happened

9012718 be a gentleman and take me in by the hand wont you georgie
9012719 there are times when i just really needed him and he just wasnt there
9012720 ive been incarcerated for eight months and jays been everywhere and he hasnt mentioned one thing about tell her i love her tell her to be strong that broke my heart more than anything when they sent me to jail i just knew he would be there everyone came but he never showed up
9012721 for instance if all the molecules of air in the room where youre sitting would suddenly cross to one side you would not have any air to breathe this probability is not zero it is in the 10 to the minus 25 range
9012722 she stated that he told her to smile in some of the pictures
9012723 always talked about sex when he was home from deployment
9012724 he knew he was going to jail with what he had said
9012725 i suppose you think that the distortions and lies that a group like moveon org is using are okay both sides are guilty of gutter politics so quit pretending that its only the right
9012726 as usual you are a moron i cant believe how thin skinned you lefties are why dont you get a sense of humor and get your head out of your butt
9012727 how do you know an obama supporter didnt make those bills and then send them out just to hurt the republicans
9012728 its a joke and it is funny im not sure how anyone can give this a racist twist but a bleeding heart liberal will find a way
9012729 its amazing how you liberals are quick to express moral outrage over a simple joke when is komo going to get some brains and fire you
9012730 who can best help me shake up washington and make it start working again for the people who are counting on us
9012731 sarah palin is the whole package there couldnt be a better vice presidential pick
9012732 give all americans born and unborn the authentic leadership they deserve
9012733 the contrast between those two facts about the candidates is going to come out were going to make sure that it comes out its a very striking contrast
9012734 we feel privileged that god would entrust us with this gift
9012735 contrast that with sen obamas approach to leaving born alive babies left sitting there for dead and also making the comment if his daughter got pregnant he would not punish her with a baby
9012736 i think this will help us know he really does embrace this issue in political practice as well as in his voting record
9012737 most significant pro life platform in the republican partys history
9012738 this team does not reflect one iota of weakness it is the strongest pro life team with a pro life platform in the history of the republican party
9012739 how can you go wrong with a moose burger eating fishing governor
9012740 when you compare her experience to barack obamas experience her executive experience her experience as mayor her experience as assistant governor her experience as a reformer her experience as an environmental activist
9012741 she is more prepared more experienced to be president than the top of their ticket
9012742 there will be about 60 trucks when its all said and done making it from point a to point b
9012743 no question about it it is a project that has to be looked at very carefully and to see this truck arrive here today is a real sign that were making progress
9012744 we ramped up early and got some things in here but this is obviously one of our bigger loads and so were happy to have all of this equipment here so we can really get rolling
9012745 it really is taking that area that we had in the northwest and trying to make sure it fits here in this space and so far its been a pretty good fit
9012746 its been a little bit of a puzzle but its all worked out very nicely
9012747 everything down to that last stapler to that office set
9012748 youll see some more trucks like this coming through and well have more equipment itll be everything from office furniture to computers to a lot of the equipment for basketball operations
9012749 marriage as it is the union of a woman and a man for the purpose of having children will continue to exist but without a word
9012750 it wont exist in language and it wont exist in law people will point to the reflection but not the actual fact of a family created by the sexual union of a woman and man
9012751 like a hall of mirrors we have lots of reflections without having to take responsibility for seeing and naming the real thing
9012752 it is not a matter of what or who we are against
9012753 we are keeping our eyes fixed on marriage it is a matter of seeing marriage for what it is hoping that our courts and legislators will quit playing with mirrors
9012754 the issue before us with proposition 8 is marriage an ancient yet modern human institution which pre exists both church and government
9012755 marriage history shows us is intrinsic to stable flourishing and hospitable societies although cultural differences have occurred what has never changed is that marriage is the ideal relationship between a man and a woman for the purpose of procreation and the continuation of the human race
9012756 to this radical change in californias public policy regarding marriage
9012757 same sex unions are not the same as opposite sex unions
9012758 the ideal for the well being of children is to be born into a traditional marriage and to be raised by both a mother and a father
9012759 w e need to recall that marriage mirrors gods relationship with us any other pairing while possibly offering security and companionship to the individuals involved is not marriage
9012760 our travel for the summer time has been cut down drastically
9012761 you know when it was 2 dollars a gallon something like that we could afford a nice long trip but now to take a trip weve got to save for 4 to 5 months
9012762 not really because were going to crandon wisconsin for the off road races and its something we do every year
9012763 so ive just scaled back other things to do this
9012764 last year over the labor day holiday even though we had stepped up enforcements there was 12 fatal crashes involving alcohol in the state of michigan and thats 12 too many

9012773 sometimes drama is hallucinatory like a trip a dream that lifts you out of your theatre seat it happens only rarely but guy cassiers and dirk roofthooft have succeeded with sunken red
9012774 told with an aching beauty in a spiraling form that gradually reveals more and more sunken red is a cathartic achievement in which we watch mr brouwers emerge from the walking dead
9012775 roofthooft is a phenomenal actor every breath every movement of his voice is audible this creates scope for an unprecedented subtlety even in a huge theatre you get the impression that the story is told to you personally

9012780 we are going to move forward we are in the process of talking to the government theyve not indicated one way or the other how theyre dealing with us
9012781 today senator john mccain made a bold choice of alaska governor sarah palin to serve as his running mate governor palin is an extremely qualified chief executive who has cut property taxes eliminated wasteful spending and taken on government corruption

9012785 i love sequins it must be the drag queen in me
9012786 were going to have to establish a committee comprising of our three school districts
9012787 students must be one or two years behind in their schooling eighth graders must be 14 years or older these students will enter the 10th grade after one year in star academy they must be determined students wanting to catch up with their class some ninth graders will also be allowed to attend if they are one year behind
9012788 we had 40 straight days of a decrease in gasoline prices and then just yesterday it started to creep back up
9012789 the book has been selling well in alaska because people really like her
9012790 corporate cartographers are demolishing thousands of years of history not to mention britains remarkable geography at a stroke by not including them on maps which millions of us now use every day were in real danger of losing what makes maps so unique giving us a feel for a place even if weve never been there
9012791 our vars are always looking for the next opportunity to engage with their customers
9012792 the expanded monitoring of the user experience will allow faster and more efficient assessment of performance issues
9012793 also the simulation tools will allow those managing the server farms to proactively identify performance issues before they become a customer critical item
9012794 right now nearly 4 000 centrifuges are operating at natanz
9012795 if nobody wants to talk with us on these issues and cooperation with russia is not needed then for gods sake do it yourselves

9012798 faced the challenge of creating a display to celebrate the strengths of colusa countys agriculture industry while paying homage to the state fairs theme the state fair goes hollywood
9012799 we are saddened that the fine work of these young men is now cast under a cloud of unintended racism
9012800 we ask that you applaud their hard work and know that they were working to honor colusa county with their artistic depiction of a genre of ag products produced in stellar quantities by the county seeds
9012801 but they probably never had the benefit of a black history class
9012802 if the students were presented with that history they might have drawn waldo watermelon seed a little differently
9012803 t he reluctance of the centre and state governments to take tough measures against bureaucrats and others unauthorisedly sic overstaying in government accommodation
9012804 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
9012805 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
9012806 there is no technical reason that a third party could not accumulate and assemble the hardware components in an apple labeled computer hardware system such that said system would be capable of running the mac os
9012807 the kernel panic is self induced by apples embedding of code to prevent operability on computer hardware systems that are not apple labeled computer hardware systems
9012808 the mac os market is distinct and unique as compared to other operating systems including but not limited to the windows operating system
9012809 as such psystar alleges that the windows operating system is not and cannot be considered an effective substitute for the mac os the same holds true for any other operating system
9012810 we definitely have concerns about it especially after what happened three years ago
9012811 now in the worst case scenario wherever we locate to we can go to the nearest best buy and get what we need to be up and running in a few hours
9012812 we had a very full fledged disaster recovery plan prior to katrina
9012813 because of katrina we lost power in new orleans for an extended period of time and we realized that we wanted to keep that particular presence on the world wide web all the time

9012816 one of the primary reasons for the loss of wireless service in a hurricane is the loss of commercial power to the cell site
9012817 neither caused terrible damage but they were serious and our crews got a good workout
9012818 the crews got in fast with generators and it was very impressive every storm that happens including katrina presents lessons to be learned
9012819 may be considered if it is not engaged in any operational activity during that period instead of it incurring costs lying in port
9012820 the revenue received from the charters is used to supplement the vessels high operating costs
9012821 it really is no different than the saps renting out their vans for parcel delivery
9012822 and while they dont use this mega expensive vessel which we paid for for the purpose for which it was acquired they have the cheek to ban diving and shut down the wild abalone industry because they cant get a handle on poaching its pathetic really
9012823 the minister should actually have been asked how many sea days each year since 2005 the sarah baartman has spent patrolling our eez how many reports of illegal unregulated and unreported fishing has it followed up and how many vessels it has apprehended
9012824 as the sarah baartman is specifically designed for offshore fisheries patrols how does he justify such a waste of resources an answer that he needs to subsidise running costs is nonsense because how much fish are we losing to poachers who is subsidising this failure and dereliction of duty
9012825 police opened fire on it thinking it was the robbers fleeing after the car stopped the couple was found wounded inside the car
9012826 the shareholder feels that the time has come for a parting of the ways
9012827 we want to hold amicable discussions with them over how that might be achieved but there has been a breakdown in relationships that unfortunately cannot be repaired
9012828 anybody who thinks he chose a woman only to get feminist votes is insane
9012829 anyone who thinks hes going to die in office because hes
9012830 anyone who says palin was wrong for asking that her sisters husband stop threatening to put a bullet through their fathers head is an idiot
9012831 this is a guy who tasered a 10 year old boy
9012832 what the hell is wrong with mccain wake up america
9012833 what made the republican party think an inexperienced female governor from alaska with 5 kids baby is a downs person would be capable as vp to run the us of a ok maybe she is a capable ruler i dont know then what about the kids
9012834 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9012835 the purpose is to figure out how memories are actually stored in a biological brain
9012836 if we can understand some of the basics of what is going on in our little model brain it could have enormous medical spinoffs
9012837 within about 24 hours they start sending out feelers to each other and making connections
9012838 within a week we get some spontaneous firings and brain like activity
9012839 now we are looking at how best to teach it to behave in certain ways
9012840 this one is a bit boisterous and active while we know another is not going to do what we want it to
9012841 this is a simplified version of what goes on in the human brain where we can look and control the basic features in the way that we want in a human brain you cant really do that
9012842 there is no admission or concession by target that target com is in any way inaccessible
9012843 target is committed to providing a simple and convenient online shopping experience for all our guests and we are confident our target com web site is fully accessible and complies with all applicable laws
9012844 additional changes we will make by february 2009 will enable us to receive the nfbs non visual accessibility web certification
9012845 by 5 to 15 blind persons with varying skill levels
9012846 there are several messages that come out of this first of all other commercial retailers and e tailers have to think that if there was a real question about the application of anti discrimination laws to the internet that target might have fought
9012847 not only did target settle but they agreed to damages that are by far the largest damage awards ever in a disability rights case involving blindness
9012848 this is a serious message to everybody else that the law applies
9012849 plaintiffs legal theory is that unequal access to target com denies the blind the full enjoyment of the goods and services offered at target stores which are places of public accommodation
9012850 applies to the services of a place of public accommodation not services in a place of public accommodation
9012851 is heavily integrated with the brick and mortar stores and operates in many ways as a gateway to the stores
9012852 plaintiffs present persuasive authority to demonstrate that the unruh act and the dpa do not require a nexus to the retail stores
9012853 its neither from the highest court nor from the federal appeals court
9012854 we still have the opportunity in other jurisdictions to make the case that the internet is a public place
9012855 the supreme court has referred to the internet as a public forum for first amendment free speech purposes and as a practical matter to tell people that theyre entitled to equal access but not with respect to the internet is a cynically false promise
9012856 the courts take the issue of accessibility seriously and it is in the best interests of everyone to take note
9012857 the nfb certainly believes that the ada applies to all web based businesses obviously not all courts have ruled that way it is our position that it should apply a website is just another way for a business to sell its services
9012858 the fact is that theyre making changes to the website and thats really what we wanted are we unhappy with the lack of precedent we would have been perfectly happy if target had just made its website accessible in the first place without the need for litigation
9012859 if that happens by a company approaching us or by us negotiating with the company without litigation thats just as valid litigation is a strategy its a strategy that we have on the table but its a strategy of last resort
9012860 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9012861 airline travel is airline travel its been bad for a long time
9012862 i suspect prices will go up fewer people will travel and if youre willing to pay the price it will be fine
9012863 despite this sluggish u s economy the general demand picture is better than it was post 9 11
9012864 in addition you have this consistent response across the board of airlines raising fares and adding fees
9012865 if somebody sees a good fare they should grab it
9012866 the reality is and i dont want to diminish this the industry is going to have to cover its costs
9012867 if there are fewer flights that wont bother me but if flights are really expensive i just wont go or ill go by myself instead of bringing my son and husband
9012868 and then youre good to go you dont have to worry about that
9012869 a very very small number of people would have purchased tickets for travel in september or thereafter before the flights were taken out of the fall schedule in may and june of this year
9012870 i think if oil prices continue to go down you will hear calls for relaxation of fuel surcharges but that doesnt mean they wont hike base airfares
9012871 i dont think most people in every aspect of their trip will notice a difference
9012872 if there is a silver lining it may be that as a result of fewer overall operations they may see better on time performance
9012873 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9012874 our binocular region is a kind of spotlight shining through the clutter allowing us to visually sweep out a cluttered region to recognize the objects beyond it
9012875 as long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter as is the case with our fingers or would be the case with the leaves in the forest then we can tend to see through it
9012876 non leafy surroundings or surroundings where the cluttering objects are bigger in size than the separation between the animals eyes
9012877 animals outside of leafy environments do not have to deal with clutter no matter how big or small they are so there is never any x ray advantage to forward facing eyes for them
9012878 because binocular vision does not help them see any better than monocular vision they are able to survey a much greater region with sideways facing eyes
9012879 this x ray vision makes it possible for animals with forward facing eyes to visually survey a much greater region around themselves than sideways facing eyes would allow
9012880 additionally the larger the animal in a cluttered environment the more forward facing its eyes will be to allow for the greatest x ray vision possible in order to aid in hunting running from predators and maneuvering through dense forest or jungle
9012881 in todays world humans have more in common visually with tiny mice in a forest than with a large animal in the jungle we arent faced with a great deal of small clutter and the things that do clutter our visual field cars and skyscrapers are much wider than the separation between our eyes so we cant use our x ray power to see through them
9012882 if we froze ourselves today and woke up a million years from now its possible that it might be difficult for us to look the new human population in the eyes because by then they might be facing sideways
9012883 laura im wondering how if you can make all those sibling suggestions mesh together eg if sylvies sister could be noelle then would sylvie have to be a suggestion for noelle too

9012886 the political story simply hasnt developed fully enough to match with historical figures
9012887 just filed my last dnc08 dispatch via blackberry en route to the airport what a night i was lucky to be at invesco
9012888 this is why mccain wanted to wait less than 12 hours after obamas speech the cable networks are focused on the veepstakes rnc08
9012889 drudge now showing picture of mccain and lieberman that would be cruel rnc08
9012890 this is obviously one of our bigger loads and so were happy to have all of this equipment here so we can really get rolling
9012891 it really is taking that area that we had in the northwest and trying to make sure it fits here in this space and so far its been a pretty good fit

9012898 berdasarkan kompetensi saya yang bergerak dalam bidang peningkatan pendapatan masyarakat yang saya amati selama ini proses pendampingan para fasilitator pemberdayaan masyarakat hanya sampai pada level pengadaan dana setelah dana tersebut cair dan disalurkan ke masyarakat sudah tidak ada lagi proses pendampingan

9013137 the selection of governor palin is great news for conservatives for the party and for the country her dedication to principle her courage both before and after her election as governor of alaska and her personal qualities make her a perfect choice for vice president i predict any conservatives who have been lukewarm thus far in their support of the mccain candidacy will work their hearts out between now and november for the mccain palin ticket
9013138 she knows when to stand up and doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down shes exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs
9013139 the women of america arent finished yet we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9013140 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9013141 john mccain has made a bold and historic choice in selecting governor sarah palin to join him on the republican ticket as his vice president as a wife mother former mayor and as alaskas first female governor sarah palin brings a wholly american experience to the table in this campaign shes been a strong independent leader on fiscal responsibility the environment and energy and as a former mayor myself i am thrilled with the idea that she will bring that getting things done point of view with her to washington d c with this ticket the message to america is very very clear we must remain rooted to our principles of a strong prosperous and peaceful nation and continue to focus on revitalizing our nation economically and defending our national security interests
9013142 john mccain has chosen wisely in selecting governor sarah palin as his running mate john mccain has again demonstrated his judgment and his commitment to conservative values fiscal discipline and reform i look forward to doing all i can to ensure that john mccain and sarah palin become the next president and vice president of the united states
9013143 john mccain has made clear from the start that he wants to change washington and he proved it today by going as far away from washington as possible in selecting his running mate eighty eight years after our nations women first gained the right to vote this selection demonstrates how far our nation has come
9013144 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9013145 gov palins views align with sen mccains own stated position that human life is precious and must be protected this selection by sen mccain is a very encouraging sign for his campaign
9013146 i believe that in order to make government work better it must include both strong men and women with this historic choice sen mccain has clearly shown his and the republican partys commitment to including every voice in our society
9013147 holy cow im just kind of speechless on the whole thing
9013148 this is a bold and exciting pick that demonstrates the republican party is focused on the future and changing how washington d c does business as an outsider gov palin has a solid record of making government work better including fighting for landmark ethics reform
9013149 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9013150 gov palin is a strong conservative with executive experience who has cut wasteful spending opposed earmarks and shown courage in taking on corruption in her own party
9013151 i am pleased with sen mccains pick for vice president gov palin is an outstanding terrific pick for the job for the country for the republican party and for the citizens we try to serve
9013152 theyre conservatives going to be excited about this pick because heres an authentic person who believes and does what she says in her policy atmosphere and can authentically carry that message to the country
9013153 gov palin is a conservative republican with a track record of reforming government she will strengthen sen mccains appeal to reagan democrats and supporters of sen hillary clinton who are looking for a president who has the experience and temperament to be commander in chief
9013154 shes tough shes tenacious i believe that she does have what it takes to get out there again her ability to connect with voters and make a case is very very very strong

9013176 i gotta go in im talking to little cousins that like yankee and all that and theyre starting to believe that john mccain is the best candidate i cant have that
9013177 i opened the newspaper and got sick to my stomach
9013178 i felt like i wanted to vomit when i seen that the reason why i called him a sellout is because i feel he did that for a publicity look rather than the issues that are affecting his people that look up to him how could you want john mccain in office when george bush and the republicans already have half a million people losing their homes in foreclosure were fighting an unjust war its the latinos and black kids up in the frontlines fighting that war we over here trying to take the troops out of iraq and bring peace this guy immediately wants war if not with iraq or afghanistan hell start a new one with iran i feel real disgusted that daddy yankee would do that either he did that for a look or hes just not educated on politics

9013204 i f we dont reach out to evangelical christians and other religious americans and tell them what we stand for then the jerry falwells and pat robertsons and alan keyeses will continue to hold sway
9013205 forfeit the imagery and terminology through which millions of americans understand both their personal morality and social justice
9013206 we must find a new moral and political language that transcends old divisions and seeks the common good prophetic politics would not be an endless argument between personal and social responsibility but a weaving of the two together in search of the common good

9013216 we do not find a comprehensive blueprint for a new economic order in scripture
9013217 the bible doesnt propose any blueprint for an economic system
9013218 biblical revelation tells us that god and his faithful people are always at work liberating the oppressed and also provides some principles for apropos justice in society
9013219 but rather insists that all human economic arrangements be subject to the demands of gods justice that great gaps be avoided or rectified and that the poor are not left behind
9013220 t he bible does not offer a detailed blueprint for political life today

9013267 episodes of racism and intolerance including institutional racism and intolerance the violation of the human rights of asylum seekers and roma the violation of human rights in prisons and immigrant detention centres the day work and untrammeled exploitation on farms all testify to the importance even today of the fate of the two italian anarchists murdered in america of their cry for freedom dignity and social justice
9013268 it is a history of the sacco vanzetti case truer than the court transcript more real than any non fiction account precisely because it goes beyond the immediate events of the case to bring the reader the historical furnace in which the case was forged it puts the straight lines of neutral type in the law books under a microscope where they show up as rows of trenches in the war of class against class

9013442 gov palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government gov palins success is due to her dedication to principle and her roll up your sleeves work ethic and serves as a wonderful example of the spirit of america by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done sen mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9013443 gov palin is an independent leader who has fought the special interests on behalf of the people of alaska the mccain palin ticket will appeal to voters across john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero a heartbeat away from the presidency
9013444 gov palins views align with sen mccains own stated position that human life is precious and must be protected this selection by sen mccain is a very encouraging sign for his campaign
9013445 i believe that in order to make government work better it must include both strong men and women with this historic choice sen mccain has clearly shown his and the s commitment to including every voice in our society
9013446 holy cow im just kind of speechless on the whole thing
9013447 this is a bold and exciting pick that demonstrates the republican party is focused on the future and changing how washington d c does business as an outsider gov palin has a solid record of making government work better including fighting for landmark ethics reform
9013448 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9013449 i am pleased with sen mccains pick for vice president gov palin is an outstanding terrific pick for the job for the country for the republican party and for the citizens we try to serve
9013450 on his 72nd birthday is this really the one heartbeat away he wants to put in the
9013451 gov palin is a strong conservative with executive experience who has cut wasteful spending opposed earmarks and shown courage in taking on corruption in her own party
9013452 theyre conservatives going to be excited about this pick because heres an authentic person who believes and does what she says in her policy atmosphere and can authentically carry that message to the country
9013453 she will strengthen sen mccains appeal to sen hillary clinton who are looking for a president who has the experience and temperament to be commander in chief
9013454 what do you think is the most important legal issue facing the industry this year
9013455 the last time we had a telephone conference the judge was getting ready to undergo a very long trial so he said that he was willing to give us some alternate dates to have some additional hearings on some motions
9013456 our understand is that that trial ended up with a hung jury and that they started again and that its on a delay now
9013457 i dont what lancaster wants to talk about but maybe we will pick a motion hearing date and also some day in the future as to a possible trial date i dont know
9013458 im not even sure well have any oral hearing on the remaining motions that the judge wanted to have before the end of the year
9013459 yes thats what lancaster wants to talk about and of course the case law in the 3rd u s circuit court of appeals has improved for us with the recent copa child online protection act
9013460 its a very interesting questions especially for every judge around the country who i think will pay attention to the argument that when dealing with the internet the marketplace becomes a much different thing

9013777 i am absolutely delighted by this selection once again john mccain has shown that he is an independent thinker who paints in bold strokes sarah palin is a conservative reformer with executive experience who will bring a breath of fresh air to washington she will be an ideal running mate for john mccain and will make a major contribution to our countrys future
9013778 sarah palin is a pleasant surprise for those of us who had hoped that senator mccain would pick a principled and authentic conservative pro life leader sarah palin is both principled and authentic as a governor she also brings an important balance of understanding of the critical domestic issues that is needed and that the democrats have ignored with their ticket governor palin is smart authentic tough and a dynamic choice that will remind women that they may not be welcome on the democrats ticket but they have a place with republicans
9013779 governor palins story is one that all americans will find inspiring shes a washington outsider with a commitment to the conservative principles that will make our nation stronger i look forward to campaigning for senator mccain governor palin and republicans all across the country
9013780 we send our congratulations to governor palin and her family on her designation as the republican nominee for vice president her selection is yet another encouraging sign that all barriers are falling in our politics and while we obviously have differences over how to best lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9013781 the selection of a vice presidential candidate is one of the most significant and telling decisions a presidential candidate can make john mccains selection of sarah palin raises serious questions about his judgment why when the country is fighting two wars facing an uncertain economy and an energy crisis did senator mccain make the choice that he did why with so many other qualified women and men in his party did john mccain choose sarah palin sarah palin is not the right choice she shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade and continuing george bushs failed economic policies john mccain and sarah palin will not bring the american people the new direction they need
9013782 while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling i particularly look forward to the biden palin debate in missouri
9013783 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9013784 john mccain has taken a bold step today in choosing gov
9013785 her candidacy will highlight alaskas critical role as a state that can help meet our nations energy needs through domestic oil and gas exploration and development sarah has built an impressive record as governor of alaska and she will bring a valuable outside the beltway perspective to john mccains candidacy gov palin is smart energetic and her choice as the republican vice presidential candidate represents a new direction in the race for the white house
9013786 today presumptive republican presidential nominee senator john mccain announced he has chosen first term alaska governor sarah palin as his choice to be his vice presidential running mate
9013787 america may not know much about sarah palin but based on what our community has seen of her we know enough
9013788 sarah palin not only supported the 1998 alaska constitutional amendment banning marriage equality but in her less than two years as governor even expressed the extreme position of supporting stripping away domestic partner benefits for state workers when you cant even support giving our community the rights to health insurance and pension benefits its a frightening window into where she stands on equality
9013789 john mccain made an historic choice in naming alaska governor sarah palin a popular and proven reformer with a record of accomplishment and real executive experience as his running mate
9013790 palin is a strong advocate for taxpayers using her veto to cut wasteful spending and put a stop to the infamous bridge to nowhere
9013791 last month i had the pleasure of meeting governor palin while in alaska on our american energy tour and i can attest that she will be a strong agent of change in washington the mccain palin ticket has the experience to lead the effort to fix a broken washington this is the ticket that is ready to lead
9013792 with this bold and inspired selection sen mccain has verified his stated commitment to assembling a truly pro life administration the republican ticket stands in stark contrast to the stridently pro abortion ticket put forth by the democratic party you can be sure the vice presidential selections will have far reaching ramifications in this race
9013793 on his 72nd birthday senator mccain has chosen a vp based on her political currency rather than her ability to lead our country in a crisis if john mccain wins in november hell be the oldest president in u s history and sarah palin would be a heartbeat away from being our commander in chief its not only fair but critical in this case to ask if shes up for the job of commander in chief we just cant afford a gamble like this with our future
9013794 we ask them to go away and take language courses and reapply
9013795 there were quite a few applications coming in with an interpreter and the club decided they wanted to put an end to that
9013796 its been accepted everyone is welcome to our club as long as you meet our criteria
9013797 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
9013798 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care

9013811 its original its suspenseful the writers chris mcquarrie and nathan alexander are just great and i cant say enough good things about the director bryan singer i first met him at the mission impossible premiere and weve been hoping to work together ever since
9013812 it just doesnt make sense to me either the moment i read the screenplay i knew it was an important story and as its a true tale of heroic resistance to one of the great villains of history i cant imagine that people wont want to see it
9013813 well im always looking for something new and bens movie is hilarious he and i are old friends and he is a really good director so originally i said id do it just for friendship but it turned out great i actually love comedy and i did it in risky business so ill do more if it presents itself im also always looking for a good love story and i think i have one in a coming international thriller called the tourist i believe i will be doing that

9013829 if you are a clinton delegate and you feel that you must vote for senator clinton to bring closure i understand that but it would give me great pleasure to be able to say that following the instructions of sen clinton the great state of pennsylvania casts all its votes for sen obama
9013830 representative sestak and i asked the government accountability office gao to conduct an investigation into the cost and noise and environmental impact of the airspace redesign on south jersey and pennsylvania because we did not think the faa had provided accurate answers on its own
9013831 i have been extremely concerned that this air space redesign is a colossal mistake the gao study confirms for me that the process was flawed the gao identified a stunning set of omissions even if the law does not require cost benefit analysis and implementation plans common sense certainly does these conclusions must force the faa to look at other options
9013832 i have worked aggressively with congressman andrews and other leaders in congress as well as at the state and local level to address the concerns my constituents have over the noise and environmental impact of this redesign and the lack of certainty around costs and benefits
9013833 ive said all along that the faas actions were based on flawed models and assumptions this study conducted by gao confirmed that the faa had not conducted a true cost benefit analysis and in addition the gao found that the faa had no detailed implementation plan and had reached its conclusions without an assessment of the risk and uncertainty around its assumptions
9013834 faa did not analyze various economic impacts such as implementation costs a cost benefit analysis would provide more information about the impacts of various alternatives
9013835 would provide more information about the level of uncertainty associated with the operational analysis of alternatives
9013836 faa has not developed a detailed implementation plan for the new york new jersey philadelphia airspace redesign with a schedule in addition the final project configuration and costs are unknown since faa has not determined the type of equipment and software that will be needed
9013837 both congressman andrews and i are appalled that the faa would begin to implement a project of this magnitude and complexity without proper guidance that would come from a detailed understanding of the likely benefits of the project and the true costs that are necessary to realize those benefits but i cant say that we are surprised back in april 2007 in response to a question from congressman andrews marion blakey the faa administrator at the time said that she did not know how much the project would cost despite having worked on it for close to ten years
9013838 the biggest fe mod you can make is to adjust the nut behind the wheel
9013839 gov palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government gov palins success is due to her dedication to principle and her roll up your sleeves work ethic and serves as a wonderful example of the spirit of america by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done sen mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9013840 gov palin is an independent leader who has fought the special interests on behalf of the people of alaska the mccain palin ticket will appeal to voters across party lines
9013841 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9013842 gov palins views align with sen mccains own stated position that human life is precious and must be protected this selection by sen mccain is a very encouraging sign for his campaign
9013843 i believe that in order to make government work better it must include both strong men and women with this historic choice sen mccain has clearly shown his and the republican partys commitment to including every voice in our society
9013844 holy cow im just kind of speechless on the whole thing
9013845 this is a bold and exciting pick that demonstrates the republican party is focused on the future and changing how washington d c does business as an outsider gov palin has a solid record of making government work better including fighting for landmark ethics reform
9013846 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9013847 i am pleased with sen mccains pick for vice president gov palin is an outstanding terrific pick for the job for the country for the republican party and for the citizens we try to serve
9013848 on his 72nd birthday is this really the one heartbeat away he wants to put in the white house
9013849 gov palin is a strong conservative with executive experience who has cut wasteful spending opposed earmarks and shown courage in taking on corruption in her own party
9013850 john mccain has made clear from the start that he wants to change washington and he proved it today by going as far away from washington as possible in selecting his running mate eighty eight years after our nations women first gained the right to vote this selection demonstrates how far our nation has come
9013851 theyre conservatives going to be excited about this pick because heres an authentic person who believes and does what she says in her policy atmosphere and can authentically carry that message to the country
9013852 she will strengthen sen mccains appeal to reagan democrats and supporters of sen hillary clinton who are looking for a president who has the experience and temperament to be commander in chief

9013893 airline travel is airline travel its been bad for a long time
9013894 i suspect prices will go up fewer people will travel and if youre willing to pay the price it will be fine
9013895 despite this sluggish u s economy the general demand picture is better than it was post 9 11
9013896 in addition you have this consistent response across the board of airlines raising fares and adding fees
9013897 if somebody sees a good fare they should grab it
9013898 the reality is and i dont want to diminish this the industry is going to have to cover its costs
9013899 if there are fewer flights that wont bother me but if flights are really expensive i just wont go or ill go by myself instead of bringing my son and husband

9013920 why when the country is fighting two wars facing an uncertain economy and an energy crisis did sen
9013921 why with so many other qualified women and men in his party did john mccain choose sarah palin sarah palin is not the right choice she shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade and continuing george bushs failed economic policies
9013922 because of the way the country rallied behind new york after 9 11 we felt the compelling need to help our fellow americans in new orleans lalor said
9013923 corporal lalors initiative and selfless devotion to duty reflected great credit upon him and are in keeping with the highest traditions of the marine corps and the united states naval service
9013924 too many are still struggling and waiting for the help that they have been promised and deserved
9013925 three years have passed since hurricane katrina swept across the gulf coast devastating new orleans and leaving so many homeless and in need the floods have long since receded however the searing memories of those days remain with us and too many are still struggling and waiting for the help that they have been promised and deserve the tragedy of the gulf coast became a national disgrace that the bush administration still has yet to adequately address there is no doubt that more must be done to aid reconstruction help the displaced and prevent a disaster like the failed response to katrina from ever happening again yet for all the hardship and heartbreak brought on by katrina and its aftermath the storm also revealed the inspiring strength of the american spirit from across our nation americans have stepped up to help in any way they can and so many people of the gulf coast have persevered in the face of tremendous challenge to rebuild and renew their communities there is so much work still to be done and so many mistakes to correct but i hope that this sense of solidarity and perseverance is the lasting legacy of this great tragedy the approach of tropical storm gustav to the gulf coast region is a sobering reminder that the failures of katrina must never be repeated
9013926 profiles in courage they can be hard to come by these days you know so often we just find them in books but next week when we nominate john mccain for president were putting one on the ballot
9013927 to serve as vice president beside such a man would be the privilege of a lifetime and its fitting that this trust has been given to me 88 years almost to the day after the women of america first gained the right to vote
9013928 i think as well today of two other women who came before me in national elections i cant begin this great effort without honoring the achievements of geraldine ferraro in 1984 and of course senator hillary clinton who showed such determination and grace in her presidential campaign
9013929 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america
9013930 gov palin is the tough reform minded choice that the republican party needs
9013931 gov palin challenged and changed alaskas culture of corruption and i am confident that she will bring that same spirit of reform to washington republicans in washington have lost their way but gov palins nomination shows that the culture of corruption is on the run
9013932 ive been blessed to have the support of the remarkable women in my life with my wife mother sisters and daughters john mccain will be a better leader with the addition of gov palins strong character

9013945 i think it is too early the sec should allow this to happen but later than 2009 maybe 2012 or 2013
9013946 there are a lot of issues about training auditors and analysts
9013947 do you really want to have two systems for that long a time
9013948 i think it would be useful for the first year or two to have u s companies perform a reconciliation between ifrs and gaap
9013949 while that wont be fun for companies the point of a beta test is to get people to understand the differences
9013950 but if thats whats wrong with u s gaap then theres something wrong with practitioners in this country we didnt have that shoved down our throats we asked for it
9013951 we dont care how long it is or how thick it is we expect fasb the emerging issues task force and the sec to come to our aid with interpretive guidance
9013952 the sec staff should refrain from issuing broadly applicable interpretive implementation guidance that would change u s gaap
9013953 the first thing they did when they looked at principles based standards was to develop an interpretation of it
9013954 do i think the sec will resist developing interpretations of ifrs nope
9013955 the audit partner was having a really difficult time understanding
9013956 i learned for the first time that ifrs isnt necessarily ifrs country to country there are variants
9013957 no im fine with the phone i already have and no i dont want a new one
9013958 filmlike structures as small as a human cell could form a clear film to power lab on a chip applications to laminate into smart cards or even to interface with implanted medical devices

9014067 if this is true this moves me from staying at home to voting mccain
9014068 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good

9014086 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9014087 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9014088 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9014089 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9014090 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9014091 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9014092 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9014093 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9014094 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9014095 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9014096 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9014097 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9014098 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9014099 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9014100 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9014101 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9014102 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9014103 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9014104 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9014105 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9014106 the musicians stopped playing the shouting continued and they left the stage the man resisting was forcibly removed the players returned composed themselves and started the movement again all was well until the third movement when another man burst into the hall downstairs again the music stopped the players walked off the man was restrained and escorted away
9014107 finally though the director of the international festival announced to all that there were more movements in the pieces the musicians were going to play than the number of protestors in the hall and that as the international festival had been host to the palestinian national theatre why should not the israelis also be given a platform with these sage words no more dissenting voices were heard in the hall and the smetana was finished
9014108 enterprise 2 0 is the use of emergent social software platforms within companies or between companies and their partners or customers social software enables people to rendezvous connect or collaborate through computer mediated communication and to form online communities
9014109 enterprise 2 0 takes the original concept of the web using websites to feed content to visitors and turns it upside down enterprise 2 0 lets you implement a multiparty conversation to share information and manage knowledge inside and outside the organization using blogs and wikis social networking and tagging rating systems and the like the link among these tools is the ability of the individuals involved to participate and to control the process while they work together share information and create networks of people with similar interests
9014110 fresh new employees have increasingly grown up with social networking and web 2 0 tools and are frequently astounded when shown the archaic interfaces of the legacy tools enterprises are anchored by
9014111 to make a long story short it means using inside an enterprise the successful tools of web 2 0 enterprise 2 0 is above all about sharing and collaboration
9014112 i put this model together to pull together the various pieces of the enterprise 2 0 puzzle

9014114 a few years ago it was all about climate change now energy security has come up too the problems arise when the two come into conflict
9014115 wouldnt it be horrible if we were the ones to kill it the show
9014116 the show is so loved i hope it does well everyone knows that sunday night is where all the channels put their biggest shows so its a lot of pressure
9014117 make sunday a family night that is rich in pictures and entertainment
9014118 its a show that skews towards an older demographic to try to push a show towards a younger demographic it doesnt necessarily work
9014119 you always ask what ingredients in a show attract an audience is it the host is it the show itself i think there are times when a format cant be overridden by the stars that you put on it
9014120 dancing traditionally has a much older audience than us i think it may be more a 60 minutes versus dancing battle its certainly a risky move taking it dancing out of tuesday nights
9014121 well shes certainly telling friends shes planning to write a book
9014122 shes using my daughter people never even knew who samantha ronson was until she met lindsay she was just some la dj and now shes writing a book this is not in lindsays best interest he added
9014123 long road ahead but i think its definitely a good start
9014124 while we cannot say this is the source of the outbreak we also cannot rule it out
9014125 i also want to point out that there is no evidence that citizens water is contaminated these samples were from the restaurant property
9014126 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9014127 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9014128 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9014129 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9014130 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9014131 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9014132 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9014133 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9014134 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9014135 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9014136 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9014137 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9014138 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9014139 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9014140 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9014141 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9014142 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9014143 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9014144 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9014145 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9014146 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9014147 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9014148 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9014149 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9014150 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9014151 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9014152 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9014153 who are open to doing something on the production side
9014154 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9014155 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9014156 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9014157 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9014158 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9014159 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9014160 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9014161 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9014162 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9014163 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9014164 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9014165 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9014166 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9014167 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9014168 i came to this world with nothing and ill leave with nothing but love
9014169 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9014170 i am truly disappointed and disturbed to learn that a member of this administration contacted the department of public safety regarding trooper wooten
9014171 at no time did i authorize any member of my staff to do so
9014172 that promotes the conservation and efficient recovery of domestic oil and natural gas resources while protecting health safety and the environment
9014173 education and workforce development public health and safety and transportation and infrastructure development
9014174 i was fortunate to get those few waves out at the beginning that allowed me to get a few maneuvers in
9014175 it was really tough out there really fast and racy and not easy to get scores unfortunately for layne she wasnt able to find a wave she could really open up on
9014176 i had a bit of a wobbly start to the year but ive had two really good events in a row and to be back on top is an amazing feeling its my second year on tour and im looking to defend my title im excited to be where im at heading into the next few events
9014177 im really proud of steph shes been the form surfer all event and she deserved the win
9014178 im just happy that i can still hang with the young girls and to finish in the final and move up to third is a great place to be heading into the back half of the season
9014179 winning the asp pro junior event the other day and gaining entry into the rip curl pro mademoiselle was one of the best wins of my career
9014180 to be able to compete against the best girls in the world and to finish third is the best finish of my career i wish things could have gone the other way in that heat but they didnt and i am still very very happy to finish third
9014181 steph gilmore got two waves and there wasnt really anything else that came through im still happy with a 3rd and i feel like im surfing good so im happy with my finish here and the next events in brazil so im happy to head home
9014182 are you going to get some pajamas for winter last winter you said you wanted to get some so do you
9014183 red thats the only color they make for a union suit i think
9014184 you mean youre gonna sit on the couch all winter in a red union suit like some civil war dude

9014186 rapid intensification of hurricanes in the gulf is often caused by passage over these deep warm water features
9014187 the most recent national weather service forecast track predicts that gustav will pass close by the loop current
9014188 in the gulf of mexico there is a tight correlation between the sea surface height measured by the satellites and the temperature of the waters
9014189 the higher the sea surface is above the mean the deeper the warm water underneath it
9014190 the more heat that is put into it the faster it is going to run
9014191 we have one set of eyes on haitis needs and the rest of the caribbean storm track and another set of eyes looking ahead to the gulf coast

9014197 writing is complete for our next album and i have to say this is some of the best material we have ever written
9014198 we have been working hard on this album for a good six months now and we are really excited to get to work on it in the studio we are set to enter nut house recordings on august 29th in new jersey to start tracking and the title for this nice group of jams will be carving desert canyons now you all can be in suspense for studio updates video shows touring and of course some killer new music

9014203 er moet eerst overeenstemming zijn over de te nemen maatregelen voor de westerschelde kan worden verdiept er was een afspraak dat in 2007 zou worden begonnen met natuurherstel maar hoe dat moet gebeuren is nu nog een slepende discussie
9014204 dat was iemand die mij in een kwaad daglicht wilde plaatsen
9014205 tot onze spijt heeft het project ook de aandacht getrokken van de personen die geen discussie willen aangaan maar alleen met agressie reageren door dreiging met geweld gaat de discussie steeds meer over subsidie vrijheid van meningsuiting en openbare orde we zijn daarom genoodzaakt de mars af te gelasten
9014206 maar wij vragen ons af in wat voor samenleving we leven als je het niet met elkaar oneens kan zijn
9014207 een echte pionier die de uitdaging aan kan gaan om inhoud te geven aan een nieuwe pauluskerk
9014208 de kunstenaar is niet joods maar heel betrokken bij wat er tijdens de holocaust gebeurd is
9014209 het is in ons land nog erg onbekend het zou fantastisch zijn als er meer zouden worden aangebracht
9014210 het is niet de bedoeling dat mensen er letterlijk over struikelen maar in figuurlijke zin wel voor voorbijgangers is het een indringende herinnering aan de nazitijd sommige duitsers hebben dat echt nodig
9014211 dat voelt als een overwinning wij hebben geen familie in duitsland meer maar willen deze herinnering graag aanbrengen in een plaats niet ver van bad berleburg waren we er een paar jaar geleden ook bij toen daar een steen voor een ander familielid werd gelegd
9014212 hij heeft hard gewerkt om de overkomst van de rest van de familie te kunnen betalen door een motorongeluk raakte hij echter in coma daardoor heeft hij het geld niet op tijd bij elkaar kunnen krijgen toen hij weer opgeknapt was was het te laat de joden konden duitsland niet meer uit e n stuk tragiek
9014213 the item was never meant for publication and has been retracted
9014214 developing software and hardware that allows us to save the game so we do not have to leave it on and would allow us to turn it off during a meal break or overnight without losing our place
9014215 additionally some clever programming would allow the console to go into a lower power standby mode when not in use
9014216 would be like taking almost 4000 cars of the road in terms of equivalent greenhouse gas emissions
9014217 focusing on the next generation of consoles would allow the machines to be built from the ground up to use less power while providing an even better experience
9014218 zurich i dont know them however our motivation should not come from the name of our opponent but by our desire to win this trophy
9014219 to win it would mean we will play against the team that wins the champions league that is what we are aiming for
9014220 each year you have to try to set new objectives for yourself not just for the team that is why im hoping to score more than 10 goals this year which is what i managed to do in the last two seasons
9014221 nope but seriously hes the complete epitome of scary bosses
9014222 hes horrid especially if he doesnt have coffee in the morning

9014239 very wise and sage but at the same time very young
9014240 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9014241 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9014242 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9014243 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9014244 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9014245 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano
9014246 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9014247 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9014248 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
9014249 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti
9014250 di riferire su quanto accaduto gi nel corso della prima seduta consiliare di settembre
9014251 un deciso intervento affinch ogni ipotesi di cassa integrazione per i dipendenti che rischiano di rimanere inattivi a causa dello stop ai lavori venga limitato ai tempi tecnici strettamente necessari
9014252 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9014253 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9014254 un provvedimento serio e condivisibile perch in italia esiste una vera e propria emergenza educativa a cui la scuola non pu sottrarsi
9014255 ludc ha sempre creduto fina dalla scorsa legislatura nella necessit di reintrodurre il voto in condotta e di riportare nelle aule scolastiche lo studio delleducazione civica quindi non possiamo che essere soddisfatti cera bisogno da parte del governo di un segnale forte ed arrivato conclude ciocchetti adesso spetta ai docenti rendere efficaci le nuove disposizioni

9014259 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9014260 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama dice lex presidente del consiglio che parla subito dopo lintervento in proposito del premier silvio berlusconi non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie da parte mia conclude prodi non ho alcuna contrariet al fatto che tutte le mie telefonate siano rese pubbliche
9014261 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali

9014265 la scuola ha detto deve rimettere al centro la persona e preparare i ragazzi ad essere cittadini consapevoli dei diritti e dei doveri e conoscitori dei principi costituzionali
9014266 crediamo che alla scuola serva chiarezza ha spiegato il ministro per questo ci sar un ritorno dei voti accompagnati dai giudizi che saranno esplicativi del risultato raggiunto dai ragazzi
9014267 il consiglio dei ministri ha espresso parere favorevole in merito al ritorno al maestro unico per la scuola primaria ha detto il ministro il provvedimento sar contenuto nel piano programmatico per la scuola contenuto nella finanziaria e su cui stiamo lavorando con il ministro tremonti

9014271 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
9014272 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
9014273 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
9014274 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
9014275 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
9014276 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
9014277 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
9014278 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
9014279 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
9014280 c un insieme di strumenti legislativi ammortizzatori sociali in gestione al ministero del lavoro che sono pi che sufficienti a risolvere il problema

9014284 con profonda gratitudine e grande umilt accetto la nomination per la presidenza degli stati uniti
9014285 a john mccain sta a cuore lamerica il problema che non capisce
9014286 che ciascuno di noi libero di vivere come vuole ma che abbiamo anche lobbligo di trattaci lun laltro con dignit e rispetto

9014289 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9014290 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9014291 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
9014292 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9014293 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono
9014294 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9014295 quando il governo ci ha prospettato in parlamento alcune questioni che noi ritenevamo utili agli italiani sottolinea cesa abbiamo tenuto un atteggiamento positivo quando invece si trattato di opporci come e accaduto per il dpef abbiamo assunto una posizione critica
9014296 una riforma organica che non sia rivolta contro qualcuno ma guardi agli interessi dei cittadini
9014297 we want to go for it in every competition in the dutch cup the uefa champions league and also the league
9014298 psv are champions and everyone wants to beat the champions
9014299 we have to prepare for that by playing the right football
9014300 we really need to become champions again here at ajax
9014301 that is what everyone wants at this club and hopefully we can reach this turning point
9014302 i respect the opinion of the public but from now on i dont talk about players who were not called
9014303 lets forget this issue the coach makes his choices i wish luck to the national team even without me they can do great in the world cup
9014304 i was asked recently if mr ferguson is the top in europe in my opinion hes the best in the world
9014305 if you can work for 22 years at a club like manchester united with all the pressures that brings then you have to have exceptional quality and ferguson has that quality i have lots of respect for him and his team
9014306 that adaptability going from glasgow to st petersburg two contrasting places is a great asset to have hes had a fantastic career and has always been competent and successful no matter where hes been
9014307 were very proud to be the winners of the uefa cup and proud that we can play against a team like manchester united hopefully its not the first time and the last time
9014308 its prestigious but provides a platform for the players to go out and enjoy themselves zenits attacking play captured a lot of peoples attention last season so hopefully it turns out to be a really exciting and attacking game and i think it will be many people will make us favourites but that wont affect our preparations

9014310 maar wat heeft dat te betekenen voor de overige afdelingen bij de krant daar maken we ons best zorgen over
9014311 ik ga ervan uit dat dit akkoord positief wordt ontvangen
9014312 het is erg prettig dat de actiedreiging verdwenen is niemand zit erop te wachten dat de krant niet verschijnt
9014313 we hebben kennisgenomen van het akkoord er is sprake van opluchting maar nog niet van blijdschap
9014314 governor palins story is one that all americans will find inspiring
9014315 shes a washington outsider with a commitment to the conservative principles that will make our nation stronger i look forward to campaigning for senator mccain governor palin and republicans all across the country
9014316 shes an executive shes a reformer and she is going to be a great leader for our country
9014317 they now know that they were used as decoys well after mccain had decided not to pick them
9014318 de gereformeerde hogeschool in zwolle is een voltijd gpw opleiding gestart windesheim doet het wel goed jongeren eigenlijk tieners die ervoor kiezen om theologie te gaan doen zijn er sowieso niet zo veel
9014319 wat kun je er eigenlijk mee worden hoe is het met de waardering binnen het vak maar dit zijn zomaar enkele suggesties
9014320 ik weet nog niet of de stand van nu ook die op 1 oktober zal zijn als we hier ook dalen dan zal dat met het bovenstaande te maken hebben
9014321 het zou raar zijn als de theologische opleidingen tegen de trend van het dalend aantal kerkleden in fors groeiden
9014322 wij zijn eigenlijk de enige universiteit in nederland waar je nog klassieke rooms katholieke theologie kunt studeren
9014323 dit jaar steeg het aantal theologiestudenten met twee tot negen
9014324 ondanks het feit dat we vorig jaar meer inschrijvingen hadden dan dit jaar heb ik de indruk dat we eerder in aantal groeien dan dat het aantal afneemt in het verleden was ik al blij wanneer we tussen de tien en de vijftien inschrijvingen hadden omdat dat groei betekende de laatste twee jaar zijn we daar bovenuit gegaan
9014325 het zou raar zijn als de theologische opleidingen tegen de trend van het dalend aantal kerkleden in fors groeiden
9014326 het is voor gereformeerd vrijgemaakte jongeren niet meer vanzelfsprekend om theologie te studeren in kampen we moeten nu concurreren met andere universiteiten
9014327 the purpose of the free software foundation fsf is probably obvious from its name but what does promoting free software mean in terms of everyday activity examining the roles of the organization shows how complex the fsfs advocacy role has become it also reveals the range of services available to the free software community and helps to explain how such a small group has had such a major influence on computer technology as a 501 c 3 charity in the united states the fsf is run by a board of directors the current board includes fsf founder and president richard m stallman and long term member henry poole but in the last few years new faces have appeared on the board

9014378 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9014379 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9014380 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9014381 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9014382 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9014383 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9014384 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop

9014387 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9014388 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9014389 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9014390 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with

9014414 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
9014415 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
9014416 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
9014417 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
9014418 no one works for someone we all just work together
9014419 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
9014420 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
9014421 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
9014422 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
9014423 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
9014424 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
9014425 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
9014426 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
9014427 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
9014428 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
9014429 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
9014430 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
9014431 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
9014432 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
9014433 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
9014434 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
9014435 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
9014436 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9014437 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9014438 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
9014439 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
9014440 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
9014441 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
9014442 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
9014443 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
9014444 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
9014445 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
9014446 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
9014447 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
9014448 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
9014449 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9014450 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9014451 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
9014452 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9014453 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9014454 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9014455 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9014456 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9014457 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9014458 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9014459 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9014460 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9014461 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9014462 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9014463 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9014464 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9014465 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9014466 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9014467 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9014468 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9014469 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9014470 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9014471 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9014472 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9014473 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9014474 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

9014476 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9014477 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9014478 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9014479 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9014480 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9014481 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9014482 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9014483 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9014484 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9014485 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9014486 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9014487 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9014488 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
9014489 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
9014490 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
9014491 you are charged with genocide how do you plead guilty or not guilty
9014492 let me say to the people of mississippi this is not a time to panic but it is a time to get prepared
9014493 the blessing if there is one is that its a three day weekend
9014494 the storm is a long way off people have a lot of time
9014495 we try not to pull the trigger too early on evacuation because you dont want to have false alarms
9014496 ladies and gentlemen in my estimation i think were ready for this threat
9014497 we did not kill up to 90 civilians as has been alleged
9014498 found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men 15 other villagers were wounded or otherwise injured
9014499 the afghan people and the afghan government have lost their patience
9014500 we cannot see our children being killed in our villages or the killing of innocent people and our hope and strong request is to reach a new agreement with the international community which clarifies all the conditions so that in the future the fight against terrorism should happen in the boundary of law so that civilians are not affected
9014501 the prospect of codifying the ad hoc rules under which u s forces have operated in afghanistan since late 2001 sends shudders through the bush administration
9014502 so youd have a multiplicity of players on that side
9014503 to us and the u s and afghan troops we were covering it appeared as though they were victorious
9014504 jquery get your site higher heh heh heh 4 20
9014505 for the first time since the crimean war russia has no allies
9014506 we are encircled by countries that are either suspicious or alienated and very angry
9014507 unless they are russia dedicated they will move to friendlier environments sentiment is just very bad
9014508 russia is extremely cheap and most of the growth dynamics are still in place
9014509 if i look forward 12 months i want to own russia
9014510 if there is a perception of russia as a risky place or as an undesirable place to invest then the damage will be more long term
9014511 it will restrict the development of the economy and hurt the governments plans to create a more diversified the economy
9014512 it is big aggressive undemocratic and irresponsible georgia who took small and innocent south ossetia
9014513 are sad about the situation and i have had many e mails from people asking why the media is reporting the situation only from one side
9014514 this is a strategic and long term mistake the effects of which will be felt by virtually all russians
9014515 democratic values and cooperation with the west will be seen as a betrayal
9014516 but its going to turn up a couple of notches its not a trend reversal
9014517 preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion
9014518 a turn to the northwest is expected later friday with a continued northwestward motion on saturday and sunday on this track the center of gustav will pass near or over the cayman islands later friday over the western portions of cuba on saturday and into the southern gulf of mexico on sunday
9014519 consumers are certainly worried about the job and housing markets but lower have given them some tangible relief and we are seeing that relief expressed in the various consumer confidence figures
9014520 with the tax refund effect on spending now more or less over we think the worst is yet to come for consumers
9014521 hes the steady hand we need when the worlds economy is so uncertain
9014522 harpers the kind of person who knows where he stands hes a straight up guy
9014523 we are very pleased to announce our pdc extension with san diego
9014524 the padres have been fabulous partners and we look forward to another two great years
9014525 the padres are excited about our continued agreement with the portland beavers
9014526 with merritt paulson and his staff we know we have a great partner in the portland franchise the player and staff experience in portland is a vital part of the growth process to the major leagues and is a perfect fit for the padres organization
9014527 we look forward to continuing our association with merritt paulson and the entire portland beavers organization for the next two years
9014528 as the final stepping stone before they enter into the major leagues several of our players have reaped the benefits of the great facility and staff in portland
9014529 san diego shares our strong commitment to community outreach and has been a valuable resource as we try to optimize our own efforts in portland
9014530 she absorbed every single blow that dementieva sent her way and shes still in there
9014531 ann must use her forehand as much as possible because her backhand leaves much to be desired
9014532 that could be a really important game in truth when she had break chances keothavong did nothing wrong
9014533 consistency is the key keothavong has definitely got some steel and mental fortitude
9014534 re 1843 good start she actually lost the toss and elena elected to receive
9014535 cant help feeling that dementieva will be too good for her unless eds serve goes completely off the rails
9014536 ive practised with her in the past and it will definitely be another tough match for me
9014537 i never played against her actually i dont know much about her
9014538 indicated to the airport the possibility of replacing the plane with another
9014539 told the airport control centre that it had decided to continue with the plane which is the one that crashed
9014540 all of us know that several people are still being kidnapped every week
9014541 at least ten people from my tribe alone all of them sunnis have been kidnapped and we suspect it is by people with the government
9014542 no kidnapping actions were reported in the city in the last four months
9014543 when we were going to our jobs we did not know whether we would get back home or not
9014544 everyday we felt the same fear and horror and now even though its better we dont know when this horror will return
9014545 near our house there was a place we used to call the execution zone
9014546 i myself saw a cameraman with the militants in every action
9014547 they brought kidnapped men blindfolded with their hands tied lined them up on the street and shot them one by one
9014548 my wife has been sick ever since she saw these killings from our house
9014549 the militants might ask anyone on the street about his identity
9014550 they take him to their stronghold for questioning when they find he is their sect they release him if not they kill him
9014551 militants attacked me in the market they forced me into the boot of a car after reaching their place they got me out of the boot tied my hands and covered my eyes they poisoned me with something that made me sick along with several other people in a room
9014552 they were shouting and insulting us they whipped me with a cable and a nylon tube on my back and legs after a few hours they took me to another room there i met the leader they called him the prince he asked me about my sect tribe job relatives etc the prince decided to release me after three days
9014553 officers have completed a search of the outbuildings and are in the process of removing vehicles from the site
9014554 forensic specialists will begin the lengthy painstaking process of sifting and examining all of the contents
9014555 he liked to live life big with holidays and cars
9014556 we are very concerned for the safety of kirstie and her family who are in our thoughts and prayers she is a charming popular and hard working girl with many friends all of whom are hoping that she and her family will be found safe and well
9014557 the wii is a well made device that has found a new target group for a while we held the same target group with the singstar karaoke game but perhaps we neglected to pursue that avenue
9014558 playstation games are rather designed for those who play a lot although its a different strategy it pays off we currently have a production bottleneck with the playstation 3
9014559 you also know however that our business model is not perfect and that we make a loss on every console we sell
9014560 nintendo makes money with the hardware alone which may be a superior business model but the wii is not succeeding at our expense it is not hurting us
9014561 we are already making more money with the games than we are losing with the hardware
9014562 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
9014563 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
9014564 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
9014565 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
9014566 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
9014567 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
9014568 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
9014569 would create risks to national security that far outweigh any potential benefit to be gained by providing the aclu with access to the requested records

9014586 a low bandwidth user downloading an hd movie at 8 p m in peak time puts more stress on the network than someone who downloads lots more in the middle of the night
9014587 if fewer than 1 percent would be affected by this whats the point
9014588 if they are going to put caps then they need to give us what i think is an acceptable expectation a meter
9014589 figure out a way to tell us what is our monthly usage and let us know if we are running up against a 250gb cap we know when to stop
9014590 if you believe the 0 05 kb e mail then you also believe in the tooth fairy
9014591 it remains unclear how the cap announced today helps solve comcasts supposed congestion problems
9014592 though the proposed cap is relatively high it will increasingly ensnare more users as technology continues its natural progression

9014658 she opposed the listing of polar bears as a threatened species she supports the brutal aerial hunting of wolves and she has been a friend of big oil opposing a windfall profits tax on the oil industry that could fund affordable clean energy for more americans palins addition to the ticket underscores the difference between the candidates on environmental issues the mccain palin ticket is a recipe for energy disaster
9014659 a consistent economic conservative gov palin understands first hand the complexities and challenges of stimulating economic growth and job creation the job of a governor is perfect preparation to helping run the federal government
9014660 the fact that shes not a washingtonian that she is a reformer that shes outside the beltway is you know a point in her favor the fact that i dont know her the fact that others maybe in washington havent known her and she doesnt know the ways of washington might be the very best thing of all
9014661 this has to be the biggest surprise in this years presidential campaign drama but its a strategically brilliant development for mccain he needed a reformer but he also desperately needed to woo evangelical voters
9014662 governor palins involvement over the years with groups such as feminists for life and fellowship of christian athletes sends all the right messages to these evangelical supporters
9014663 this was a fabulous pick not just strategically because it sets up his ticket to be historic but also because this lady is really sharp
9014664 people who havent seen governor palin before will be blown away by her personality and her communication skills are going to make joe biden look even more boring than he already does
9014665 an issue in the election is predictability and reliability the election is likely to remain close because both tickets have elements of uncertainty
9014666 at the margin however the democrat team come out as clearer and more cohesive now so the selection of a relative unknown palin as mccains vp pick is likely to hinder the republicans
9014667 one positive for palin is that as a governor she does have experience running an administration while all the others are senators which tend to be lone positions
9014668 she brings an excitement on the part of the republican base the strong conservatives really like her and you have to activate the base he is also clearly trying to attract clinton supporters who want to see a female in the vps office on the down side there is no way in the world she passes the commander in chief test obama looks like the grand old man of american politics compared to palin and she makes it look like mccain and his daughter are running
9014669 the markets are not going to be happy with an obama presidency and mccain is not particularly loved by wall street either but if he picks sarah palin i think the conservatives are going to come out roaring in favor its going to be a positive influence on economic activity
9014670 shes a conservative pro life shes a republican obviously for drilling even in alaska and also off shore for increasing supply shes for alternative energies including nuclear power all of the above when it comes to increasing energy independence
9014671 one of the biggest problems the gop faces is being a good ol boy not sensitive to women here youve got a very vivacious young pretty experienced woman more experienced than barack obama i think shes going to bring a lot of disenfranchised clinton women to the gop
9014672 as someone else said you cant be further from washington than alaska so shes going to bring freshness youth and womens rights and womens opportunities right to the forefront meanwhile obama picked the standard guy joe biden
9014673 i thought he would do well to pick a woman on the ticket but i thought he would pick someone with more experience in the senate i dont think this has much market impact
9014674 lyndon johnson was rude intelligent shrewd charming compassionate vindictive maudlin selfish passionate volcanic and cold vicious and generous he played every part he left out no emotion in him one saw ones self and all the others i think he was everything that is human the pulsing within him his energy will daring guile and greed for power and money were altogether phenomenal a continuous astonishment
9014675 is to know people and dont play sandlot ball play in the big leagues get to know the first team
9014676 i wouldnt dare to go up to president evans office
9014677 i knew there was only one way to get to know him and that was to work for him directly
9014678 his depth of human sympathy unfailing cheerfulness geniality kind firmness
9014679 if ever a rattlesnake rattled before he struck dugger has
9014680 the one great rule of composition is to speak the truth
9014681 we will serve no group or party but will hew hard to the truth as we find it and the right as we see it
9014682 here i am working my ass off getting subscriptions for the observer and dugger sends us pictures of dead negroes all over the front page
9014683 my god the subject is at hand all i can do is explain journalism to him as if he actually doesnt know what it is
9014684 the president asked me to tell you he seeks no wider war
9014685 now ronnie im giving you all these great stories i want a friendly book
9014686 and please tell him from me on that point no deal
9014687 these models are going to change considerably over the next few days its hard to put any credence in models because so many have been burned in the past
9014688 it seems people are underestimating what could happen if this is a worst case scenario type of storm along the lines of a katrina
9014689 to me the risk is on the upside and theres no reward on the downside

9014697 sure its going to be a tough race taking on an incumbent that has raised a million dollars
9014698 but people are pretty frustrated with congress right now rodriguez has to explain whats going on in washington
9014699 since 2007 when we took back congress weve been working five day work weeks weve funded veterans at the highest level weve ever funded them
9014700 and weve worked hard to change the failed policies of congress and the administration but it takes time to change so much failure
9014701 the president really respected him and he was very curious about him the president would say where did dugger hear about that it became a matter of fascination with the president a horrible fascination
9014702 we are entirely staffed at the point we need to be

9014817 once again tune into politics and karma will once again prove to be a total pain for barack obama and the party elders of the undemocratic democratic party
9014818 barack obama should have begged hillary rodham clinton to be on his democratic ticket john mccain may well be about to bring that chilling fact home to barack obama

9014836 there certainly seems to be a bigger number of hedge fund managers going out of business right now than ever before
9014837 by my math some people are taking a pretty big pay cut to be running a hedge fund and who needs that
9014838 hedge fund managers are smart people but they need a trend and there just isnt one right now that sets the stage for a shakeout in the industry where we will soon see the haves and the have nots
9014839 the fact that investors are quick on the draw to pull capital out makes the management even more difficult in already trying circumstances
9014840 and obamas staff knows thay cant talk about experience or anything obama ever did so whats left

9014843 every virus every fungus every bacteria has its own group of peptides that are unique to it
9014844 we provided bee samples from a wide area and a number of colonies and they very quickly produced a fingerprint of every pathogen that the bees are carrying
9014845 whats significant about this is typically we dont know about new pathogens arriving on u s soil until there is some sort of outbreak and significant loss of colonies going around
9014846 and once the data is stored unknown sequences may be discovered and you can re screen the file without rerunning the sample it makes this a very powerful tool
9014847 this became a perfect marriage of a technology looking for a real world application
9014848 edgewood had a tool that provided a solution to problems and we had a problem but no tool
9014849 but we havent seen it express itself among honeybees yet
9014850 bees move with people and you get the same quasi social interactions we will be able to study how rapidly the pathogen gets from one place to another spreads and moves around its amazing that we are getting to it while its still localized

9014858 we send our congratulations to governor sarah palin and her family on her designation as the republican nominee for vice president it is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign

9014920 si ma faccio molta fatica perch dopo un po di tempo non ci vedo pi e devo riposarmi e devo fare qualche cosa daltro per questo motivo ho a casa molte cose devo variare sempre comunque molti libri che leggo e che ho letto non mi hanno entusiasmato molto e per questo motivo di solito sono propenso a farli girare perch non mi piacciono sono solo pochi quelli da me preferiti e poi con il tempo mi sto accorgendo e la scelta si restringe sempre di pi
9014921 si dunque partiamo da un concetto che si trova nel vangelo che dice pi o meno cosi la via stretta porta al bene la via larga alla perdizione non ricordo con esattezza le parole ma il concetto quello le cose che comportano un grado di fatica sono molto buone mentre quelle che portano al divertimento non lo sono non mi sembra si debba aggiungere altro mi sembrano cose scontate sempre con questa frase mi vengono in mente altri due concetti il primo quello che spesso la verit da a molti tanto fastidio non so se ti mai capitato qualcuno che ti ha fatto notare delle cose che non avevi mai considerato specialmente se ha fatto qualche errore di solito avverti una brutta sensazione quasi di nervoso e non sempre capisci quello che ti hanno detto avvolte non ti ascoltano neanche e si mettono a ridere perch non gli fa comodo si vogliono solo divertire alle spalle della vittima facci caso non tutte le persone pensano alla stessa maniera e nessuno a la verit in mano anche se spesso gli uomini montano facilmente in superbia osserva gli altri e laltra riferita pi precisamente alla verit ogni persona nel suo piccolo riesce a fare una certa esperienza di vita che per forza di cose sempre diversa da tutti gli altri e la mentalit diversa quindi ogni persona si fa la sua verit personale che non uguale a quella di altre persone ma nessuno sa che quando una parola viene detta in plurale perde il suo significato le libert non sono la libert le sapienze non sono la sapienza le verit non sono la verit che ci viene data solo da ges cristo mi rendo conto che questi concetti sono un poco difficili e ci vuole del tempo per capirli meglio comunque cerca di ricordarli per il momento pu anche bastare poi il vivere le parole la parola tutta unaltra cosa
9014922 a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and allahs religion is made victorious over all other religions
9014923 islam wishes to destroy all states and governments anywhere on the face of the earth which are opposed to the ideology and programme of islam regardless of the country or the nation which rules it the purpose of islam is to set up a state on the basis of its own ideology and programme regardless of which nation assumes the role of the standard bearer of islam or the rule of which nation is undermined in the process of the establishment of an ideological islamic state it must be evident to you from this discussion that the objective of islamic jihad is to eliminate the rule of an un islamic system and establish in its stead an islamic system of state rule islam does not intend to confine this revolution to a single state or a few countries the aim of islam is to bring about a universal revolution

9014931 you know i dont know uh bunch of meth heads get together i dont know what they do i dont get inside their brain but we take them very seriously what they do i have to just emphasize this is a group of people there were a number of people that are using meth i dont know how many of you know meth anyone here not know about meth this is a really terrible drug people do all sorts of stupid things on meth
9014932 there is no credible threat right now and there was no credible threat based on the evidence that we have to senator obama or anybody else related to what we know about this case
9014933 you know i dont know what they were for and well keep looking into that
9014934 you know they didnt they didnt reveal a plan i think what you can see in the affidavit was uh a lot of racist rantings and a lot of dislike for the idea of senator obama as an african american person of color being able to pursue that office
9014935 like i said we all have an open mind about this we take this very seriously
9014936 you know as the affidavit shows there was a search done they searched the hotel room they searched vehicles and they obviously have looked for any kind of evidence that might indicate a threat or a plot or a conspiracy and at the this time we have insufficient evidence to believe that any of those things occurred
9014937 at these particular moments to go into the issue of a legal threat when you talk about threatening presidential candidates theres a legal standard you got to meet its got to be a credible threat as defined by the law its what the law calls a true threat and that means that someone has a way to carry it out and at this time we dont have sufficient evidence that there was a true threat
9014938 senator mccain if you are reading this then you are already dead unless of course you cant or dont breathe
9014939 a death threat is not a legitimate form of political expression
9014940 i guarantee you the secret service is taking this seriously and is so far up the ass of these guys the three men arrested you cannot even imagine

9014956 for the second year in a row the fabled northwest passage has opened in the arctic thanks to a sea ice melt that has already shrunk the polar cap to the second smallest extent ever recorded and with a few more weeks to go in the summer thaw season 2008 could surpass 2007 as the smallest amount of sea ice on record according to the national snow and ice data center nsidc this years record breaking melt was to some extent set up by the 2007 season also a record breaker more open ocean means more trapped heat in the water which means that thinner ice forms during the long arctic winter thinner ice melts more readily when temperatures rise so despite a relatively cool summer this year the sea ice is just melting away this has led some scientists to predict that the summer arctic could be ice free within a decade
9014957 so despite a relatively cool summer this year the sea ice is just melting away

9014962 the uber centrist brookings institution joins the climate alarmist realist crowd president strobe talbott and vp for foreign policy studies carlos pascual explain in a washington post op ed the world may have only seven years to start reducing the annual buildup in greenhouse gas emissions that otherwise threatens global catastrophe within several decades the politics are a little bland for my taste but thats to be expected from brookings which has moved closer and closer to the center in recent years the whole piece is worth reading if only to see just how far the informed center has moved reflecting a consensus of hundreds of scientists around the world the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc has affirmed that greenhouse gas emissions are raising the earths temperature the earth is on a trajectory to warm more than 4 5 degrees fahrenheit by around mid century exceeding that threshold could trigger a series of phenomena arable land will turn into desert higher sea levels will flood coastal areas and changes in the convection of the oceans will alter currents such as the gulf stream that determine regional weather patterns

9015007 today we learn from the media that the harper government strongly objected to tougher american standards for meat exports and that it even actively lobbied the u s to accept canadas more lenient standards
9015008 the report in the globe and mail says that the harper government chose to listen to the industrys gripes that the 20 year old practice of having inspectors issue reports on facilities in canada was bad for business and so the canadian food inspection agency agreed to scrap it
9015009 the conservatives anti regulation attitude drove their decision to make cuts to the canadian food inspection agency and now canadians are faced with a crisis that is growing larger every day
9015010 so because the harper government was more interested in deregulation than the health and safety of canadians we now have a system where americans require higher standards than we do

9015142 she collapsed in the bath because she accidentally caught a glimpse of her holy image in the mirror and passed out
9015143 no way im buying any gear what those freaks are wearing
9015144 the difference between stupidity and genius is that genius has its limits
9015145 i believe in pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps i believe it is possible i saw this guy do it once in cirque du soleil it was magical
9015146 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9015147 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
9015148 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
9015149 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
9015150 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9015151 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9015152 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9015153 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9015154 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9015155 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9015156 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9015157 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9015158 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9015159 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9015160 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9015161 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9015162 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9015163 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9015164 sometimes i think she has desperate character written on her the clothes we wear send a message and i think thats the message i dont think thats her intention though
9015165 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9015166 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
9015167 palin is strongly opposed to abortion and supports capital punishment
9015168 religion as a litmus test or anybodys personal opinion on evolution or creationism
9015169 palin is considered to have similar policy positions to john mccain in most respects one major exception is drilling for oil in the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr which palin strongly supports and mccain has opposed palins position on anwr drilling differs from mccains she has also praised obamas energy plan over the plan proposed by mccain
9015170 palins husband todd is a commercial fisherman and is one quarter yupik eskimo
9015171 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9015172 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9015173 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9015174 over 90 000 civilians have been killed in the iraq war
9015175 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9015176 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9015177 sides he aint 100 black his mama were a white woman werent she
9015178 shoot i had a big ol mongrel of a dawg once thought he was human
9015179 obama is in fact a human being not a dog if he wants to be looked upon as a black man that certainly is his prerogative
9015180 youre sayin obama aint got no better sense than my ol one eyed mutt boy i think you might be needin to look in your heart
9015181 dont call me boy either uncle im a man and dont you forget it you hillbilly simpleton
9015182 you say that youre a man but on a scale of white to black youre tellin me gray is black youre a feared to call gray gray cause it might offend black aint that right
9015183 well no uncle zeke not exactly i mean not at all hell i dont know what i mean we just have to adjust our way of thinking to accommodate others
9015184 son aint no man worth nothin if he dont allow people to have an opinion that he dont share nobody gits special treatment in the eyes of god you smarter than god
9015185 bringing god into the mix just isnt right leave him out of it hes got nothing to do with any of this
9015186 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
9015187 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
9015188 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
9015189 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9015190 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9015191 a third of all stage iia melanoma victims die within 10 years
9015192 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9015193 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9015194 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9015195 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9015196 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9015197 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9015198 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9015199 we definitely have more confidence coming into this training camp than we did a year ago at this time
9015200 you cant help but have more after the run we went on finishing where we finished and knowing where we could have been in the cup finals just pushes us to work harder and makes us that much more hungrier it will be fun to see the younger guys who got some incredible experience last year take that next step i think theyre all ready and there is no question that they have grown as hockey players we want to have a good regular season and hopefully win our division and put ourselves in position to make another deep run the guys will all be ready to go this year
9015201 ive been skating for a while now and getting in good shape
9015202 you always feel like its a short summer but when you play deep into may it really is shorter but the experience was great and we all cannot wait to get out there and be together as a team again hopefully we can get through training camp quickly and get to the season i think most of the guys enjoy the games more than camp but its what you have to do to prepare but we honestly cannot wait i know i cant
9015203 having richie and mo also there at the center position is great for all of us
9015204 it is hard to score goals in this league and when you can build several strong lines that have the ability to score its hard to stop teams can shut down one line but it is hard to shut down two or three good lines with talent a lot of times last year we would have the other teams best defensive line against brenden and my line because we were scoring goals now we are deeper at forward and we will give other teams more to think about it should create some good opportunities and i know i am looking forward to that im very anxious and excited about seeing this team on the ice and seeing what we can do
9015205 we didnt get off to the best start last season and that is our focus right now get off to a good start and put ourselves into position to make a run at the division
9015206 we have a lot of last years team back and that is exciting we have some good leaders on this team and a lot of talent were all one year older with more experience and we expect a lot out of ourselves were all working toward the same goal
9015207 barnes has been playing here for a long time and i know his family loves it here in dallas
9015208 he was a big part of our team and a big leader for us
9015209 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9015210 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9015211 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9015212 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9015213 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9015214 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
9015215 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9015216 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9015217 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9015218 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9015219 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9015220 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9015221 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9015222 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9015223 the next u s president is going to be ishmael whether we like it or not and whether he knows it or not
9015224 bradford amp bingley on friday reported a pre tax loss of 26 7m in first half profits compared with a profit 180 4m a year earlier following a sharp jump in arrears and losses on its structured credit portfolio
9015225 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9015226 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9015227 waa your socially dangerous music is hurting my fragile dictators psyche
9015228 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9015229 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9015230 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9015231 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9015232 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
9015233 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
9015234 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

9015261 i do not believe the institution will have any difficulty filling my position at the reduced salary with top notch candidates
9015262 any time you give someone a pay cut it feels like a demotion some people leave
9015263 if you build a lifestyle on a certain level of income its hard to change
9015264 one has to ask whats the logic of paying clough 500 000 and then paying the others so much less

9015269 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
9015270 with so many jurisdictions now using some version of so called problem solving courts the question arises what are the best intermediate sanctions to use for probationers as opposed to revoking them to prison
9015271 the use of jail as an intermediate sanction was correlated with higher rates of recidivism a relationship that should be examined more closely
9015272 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9015273 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom

9015316 my eight years with quebecor have been very exciting and rewarding
9015317 the trust that the companys president and chief executive officer pierre karl peladeau placed in me gave me the opportunity to play a role in building one of canadas largest media and communications companies in the new environment created by the digital revolution quebecor is now fully equipped to face the competition from global giants and to offer all its audiences tools and products that are comparable to the best in the world it has been a privilege to be part of the growth of this cutting edge company and i thank pierre karl and his entire management team
9015318 luc has made an enormous contribution to the quebecor media success story of recent years and to creating a major communications group that enables quebec society to keep control over its cultural industries
9015319 i am pleased to announce that luc will continue cooperating with quebecor on an ad hoc basis both as an advisor and true to his first calling as a journalist as a commentator on current affairs
9015320 i will certainly think back on my years at quebecor with nostalgia but i felt that the time had come to move on
9015321 i thank everyone ive worked with i am confident that quebecor will continue to be an exceptional organization that benefits all of society

9015330 once business people see how much more they can do with trackvia than say a traditional spreadsheet program like excel they immediately sign up
9015331 by combining with optium we have created new industry leadership with unmatched breadth of products to meet the ever increasing demand for solutions that expand manage and optimize optical network bandwidth the extensive product portfolio and unique manufacturing flexibility resulting from this merger generate a powerful platform for creating added value for our customers and shareholders

9015336 encouraging kids to eat well and make good choices for themselves is an age old issue
9015337 with a bit of planning and some enthusiasm its easy to teach children good nutritional habits for example when shopping for lunch items why not start with a trip to the longos salad bar to pick up some fresh salad there is a selection of over 40 fresh and taste tested whole foods to choose from at most locations pick up a little cooked chicken some caesar dressing and wrap it in a whole wheat pita to create a healthy lunch in a matter of minutes
9015338 wuxis proximity to shanghai offers an advantage for achievos japanese customers as shanghai is an important hub for japanese business interests in china
9015339 achievos japan business group already enjoys a significant operation in shanghai furthermore establishing operations beyond chinas large urban centers such as shenzhen beijing and shanghai is an important part of our overall business strategy and a key differentiator between achievo and its indian counterparts the large indian based it companies are limited to specific regions that offer the necessary urban infrastructure china by contrast has many urban as well as suburban centers with infrastructures already in place we believe establishing r amp d centers in these cities shields us from the rapid inflation seen in larger metropolitan centers and allows achievo to offer additional value to our customers as a result
9015340 wuxi is a beautiful city and its importance to chinas high technology industry is growing especially for our japanese customers

9015431 its unfortunate because its very reactive and it typically winds up costing you more if you do fix on fail it usually costs you more
9015432 you need to do a good analysis about whether this is acceptable risk

9015448 many people said the wall should be very high considering the security threats
9015449 the situation was very volatile and a clash was likely if we pushed on
9015450 we have given way to let them back into the government house to prevent a clash all security forces have left the government compound
9015451 we went there to demand responsibility from the police who ordered the beatings of protesters
9015452 we definitely wont leave the government house until we can topple samaks administration
9015453 he cannot stay on for long i am very sure of that you can see people coming more and more to join us
9015454 during exercise the body loses fluids and sodium through sweating this causes a decrease in blood volume thereby increasing sodium and chloride concentrations in the blood the increased concentration of electrolytes in the blood through decreased blood volume is what triggers the thirst mechanism by the time an athlete becomes thirsty the electrolytes are already out of balance so restoration of blood volume is critical for the prevention of dehydration water consumption is effective in increasing blood volume however there is a consequential dilution of sodium in the blood due to the increased blood volume and excessive sodium losses in sweat so electrolyte replenishment is key
9015455 i like him a lot walsh said after the draft

9015457 much of the left is so preoccupied with debunking generalizations and affirming the differences among groups real as they often are that it has ceded the very language of universality that is its birthright
9015458 the lefts attention is now paid to group self assertion rather than say campaigns against poverty or the bankrupting of public education
9015459 whatever universalism now remains is based not so much on a common humanity as on a common enemy the notorious white male
9015460 unless it learns to speak its own language of commonality the shards of the left will be condemned to their separate sectors sometimes glittering sometimes smashed and mostly marginal
9015461 it is time to get your mind right for the party that is coming your way

9015467 when my good friend and chimaera comics publisher george singley offered a position as chimaeras marketing pr director i decided i was going to leave shadowline to get in on the ground floor with georges new business venture
9015468 its an exciting time to be a member of chimaera studios
9015469 this puts the power in the readers hands by giving them more options
9015470 and were currently in talks to increase those options as well
9015471 edgar allan poo is currently being published online by chimaera studios

9015473 some members think the interagents should enter the conflict immediately and stop the nazi threat themselves others believe the team should take a wait and see approach before committing to the conflict
9015474 so honestly the interagents are a conflicted team of superheroes much like the american people of that time one thing they agree on however is that something must be done to end the war they just cant agree on what action they should take the bombing of pearl harbor is the catalyst that forces them to make a decision
9015475 i have read numerous books on world war ii over the course of my life and if my television is on im watching the history channel
9015476 beyond that its interesting to me that you can draw a parallel to world war ii and any military conflict the united states has been involved in by using a world war ii setting im hoping i can do this without ruffling any feathers fingers crossed
9015477 those were straightforward light superhero fare interagents is really a social commentary and political thriller with superheroes
9015478 its an engaging story that will be enjoyed by readers in their teens to reader in their hundred and teens superhero fans will definitely enjoy it but i also think the casual comic fans and history buffs will enjoy it too
9015479 bruce basically took my plot and wrote the scripts after the scripts were complete i went back and rewrote tweaked and changed what i felt needed to be reworked
9015480 i was completely swamped when we started the project so bruces help really saved me a lot of time
9015481 valerios strong retro style and gorgeous colors really bring the story to life
9015482 its amazing how he managed to capture the characters and mood of the story so perfectly i think his work will blow readers away not literally mind you but anything is possible
9015483 fans can check the chimaera site for updates on all rpg books we will also be sending out press releases as well as previews of the interagents companion as its release approaches
9015484 an industry has grown up around adoption in which profit rather than the best interests of the child takes the centre stage
9015485 appropriate legal safeguards and a functioning alternative care to parental care can prevent abuse and allow intercountry adoption to continue for those who need it
9015486 the existing rules are not comprehensive enough and we must create necessary legal and other infrastructure before accepting new requests
9015487 parents were led to believe that the child will return to them but this is not the case

9015513 the issues are fantastically complex even most copyright experts are perplexed by the morass surrounding digital music licensing
9015514 should future judicial rulings reject co interpretations contained in the final rule those rulings could cast doubt on the rule as a whole
9015515 the question of the copyright offices regulatory authority is unclear so it would be better served to let congress and the courts settle the buffer issue rather than enter a legal morass
9015516 this is one of the fundamental issues for the digital age and we think the legal process has already started to give us the answer to the question of the legal standing of buffer copies under copyright law

9015533 i ran into ralph nader who stopped by the democratic national convention in denver on wednesday and shared some strongly worded criticism of vermont senator bernie sanders over single payer healthcare

9015535 this is a purely politically motivated shift and only resulted because he sees which way the wind of public opinion is now blowing if johnson has been on this side earlier some action might have been taken years ago in time to avoid the current energy crisis before it happened
9015536 he has voted many times in the past with his democratic counterparts to oppose the expansion of american production including voting twice in 2008 to maintain the ban on offshore drilling
9015537 senator johnson once again is late to the party many republicans like myself have been promoting home grown solutions to high energy prices for a long time with the american public now fed up with 4 gas democrats like tim johnson are finding the political pressure is just too great to remain opposed to drilling

9015571 according to what we know now evidence has been obtained at the scene suggesting that the shots fired at the vehicle came from german guns
9015572 whether shots were fired from the other side towards the vehicle has yet to be conclusively established
9015573 there are no grounds at the present time to accuse any of the german soldiers of wrongdoing
9015574 i am pleased to be in woodward today to present a 1 million dollar grant from eda that will help build the woodward community campus
9015575 the campus will be located next to and work jointly with the new facility constructed by northwest oklahoma state university to offer academic and economic development programs and assistance for the area
9015576 in oklahoma over the past five and a half years eda grants have resulted in almost 12 000 jobs being created or saved investments of about 22 7 million have leveraged another 24 million in state and local dollars and more than 437 million in private sector dollars this local experience is confirmed by studies that show that eda uses federal dollars efficiently and effectively creating and retaining long term jobs at an average cost that is among the lowest in government
9015577 today is truly a great day to be in woodward this eda grant is a great addition to the 5th fastest growing city in oklahoma i would particularly like to thank senator inhofe for all of his tremendous work in securing federal assistance not only today but for his previous efforts including assistance for downtown enhancements improvements at our airport and buildings at southern plains range research center woodward is certainly grateful for senator inhofes continued leadership

9015608 the coast guard have been and will remain in full cooperation with new hampshire authorities
9015609 we were aware of the charges and have been following this closely since he was sentenced in new hampshire
9015610 and when he did not make it to his sentencing hearing we worked with new hampshire
9015611 there are a series of allegations about the member through the coast guard things of an administrative nature they are not criminal but could result in discipline up to the possibility of dismissal most are covered under the privacy act but we continue to actively investigate the allegations
9015612 when the economy bounces back well be ready for it with a fresh look a well assembled team and a head start on the competition
9015613 weve listened to feedback from our customers who asked that we provide a specific threshold for data usage and this would help them understand the amount of usage that would qualify as excessive

9015618 over a month ago her office announced that the 44 year old and her husband todd were expecting their fifth child in may it was a secret the beguiling brunette a runner managed to keep from even her staff then april 18 she surprised us again by giving birth a month early to trig palin 6 pounds 2 ounces in true sarah fashion her amniotic fluid leaked in texas she gave a speech at a republican governors association convention as scheduled anyway and then returned to alaska to deliver
9015619 immediately the family made this announcement trig is beautiful and already adored by us
9015620 trig palin has down syndrome early prenatal testing alerted the palins to this chromosomal abnormality as it is alerting more and more families in the early stages of pregnancy unfortunately because of early screening more children with down syndrome are aborted and fewer and fewer are being born
9015621 children with down syndrome do bring unspeakable joy into this world i know the laughter and blessings my 5 year old nephew ethan with down syndrome has brought to our family but how do you explain this joy to a perfection at any price world
9015622 the application begins the formal recertification process which includes two unannounced surveys
9015623 i do think at some point were going to be out of money to pay the bills that issue will have to be addressed at that time this is just one issue in a very challenging budget this year

9015627 hes going to choose someone who can be a partner in governing hes going to choose someone who brings character and principle to the table and who shares his priorities and im confident that hes going to make a great pick
9015628 quintessential john mccain hes trying to make a play for independent voters trying to bring in energy from outside washington to try to reform washington
9015629 it would be a clear sign by the mccain campaign that they would be making a bid
9015630 in the last 24 hours weve seen both campaigns refocus themselves in a powerful way on the hillary clinton supporters
9015631 he cannot say any more that barack obama doesnt have the experience to be commander in chief when he chooses a woman whose signature achievement two years ago was that they won an award from the national arbor day foundation
9015632 john mccain is going to make the choice from his heart

9015638 i see as many wild and stupid drivers out there as ever
9015639 theyre changing lanes without signaling if theres two feet to spare theyll cut right in
9015640 you may have more bumper thumpers but you arent getting as many injury crashes as when people put the throttle down
9015641 i dont know people who drink and drive anymore it is literally not socially acceptable
9015642 they are complete with all the matches from the events as well as backstage interviews and additional bonus materials all that and new original covers support chikara by buying our official releases available
9015643 i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper
9015644 by my fifth child i know what labor feels like
9015645 i have always found that my non muslim colleagues and friends are very supportive during this holy month of ramadan
9015646 at work many of my colleagues will try not to eat or drink around me and i am always touched by their thoughtfulness
9015647 immigrants from different lands have come to this country and have been able to integrate within a generation
9015648 of course this requires the immigrants to reach out of their own cultural comfort zone and get involved and engage with their local community and neighborhood i think the most important part of integrating into american society is to understand that you are an american and not see yourself as separate from mainstream society
9015649 i have never had any problems wearing the hijab in the united states
9015650 i think its important for people to know that for many of us in america wearing the hijab is a personal choice something that was not forced upon us by our parents or spouses
9015651 u s laws protect right to wear religious garb at work
9015652 but it isnt just the muslim americans who invite people to iftars in fact some of my non muslim friends have invited me to iftars in their home
9015653 just recently one of my dearest friends invited me to his home for iftar and said that he and his wife both non muslim would even prepare the meal with halal meat that they were going to purchase specifically for this occasion i was really moved by their kind gesture
9015654 when i was young few people in the united states knew what ramadan was now nearly every american has heard of ramadan and all americans now know we have millions of muslims in the u s information about islam has increased greatly
9015655 i would like to point out that the muslim world includes elements of the west and the western world includes large numbers of muslims so blending is part of the process
9015656 trust starts with trustworthiness it also includes respect and listening and tolerance for different points of view ramadan is an excellent time of year to spend more time listening and reflecting and trust building
9015657 i think america is unique in this regard that you can integrate into mainstream society without completely giving up your traditions and values
9015658 for u s muslims ramadan is reminder to help local communities http www america gov st diversity english 2007 september 20070918140944glnesnom0 9367945 html
9015659 ramadan is time for getting to know muslims in america
9015660 even during the cold war politics never got in the way of cooperation
9015661 if avian flu is carried by wild birds to north america
9015662 there is a genuine sense among americans and russians that they can learn from each other
9015663 reinforce s the need to strike a rational balance between opioid misuse and effective control of chronic pain
9015664 thus it is reasonable to assume that our prevalence estimates provide a conservative approximation of the scope of exposure to opioids in this country
9015665 the recent increase in public health concern for safe and effective pain management is appropriate
9015666 its my recipe and ill call it whatever i want
9015667 you will need one large guinea pig per serving the fatter ones are easier to catch
9015668 homeland security has admitted they dont have enough resources to be out there on the streets all the time
9015669 my goal is for hopefully one person on every block to be trained to watch his own house and family his own block
9015670 most of us are happy to call police its little boys who have never grown up
9015671 thats where i think these kinds of security issues should be addressed
9015672 the nypd does not encourage or cooperate with paramilitary groups
9015673 certainly not ones who arm or intend to arm its members
9015674 i commit to you today as the program executive officer for deepwater that the type of design and structural program management decisions that occurred with the 123 foot patrol boats will not happen with future deepwater assets
9015675 i want to clearly state that the decision to suspend operation of these boats was in no way related toc4isr command control communications computers intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance or topside equipment issues rather the decision was based entirely on ongoing structural problems
9015676 that notwithstanding clarifying and addressing issues with c4isr and topside equipment on the cutters is of utmost concern to us i appreciate the cooperative relationship weve had with the department of homeland security inspector general as his office has looked at these issues weve benefited from his staffs frank assessments were actively addressing both of these areas to ensure the national security cutter does not experience the same problems
9015677 this testing conducted during the evaluation period for our vessels and by independent certified experts outside of deepwater ensures that national security is not compromised i assure you that at no time did our 123 foot patrol boats engage in mission operations without first successfully completing standardized testing i have directed adherence to the same rigorous testing protocols in certifying systems aboard the national security cutter and any discrepancies will be resolved prior to its entering active service
9015678 theatrical fantasy come to life beaux arts design for the 21st century
9015679 the new lobby will be a beautiful fantasy reflecting our sense of imagination and joy and showcasing our history in a theatrical way
9015680 the lobby will only enhance the wonderful experience our telluride by the sea patrons have come to expect with its charming mix of history salty air and film lovers portsmouth buzzes when telluride by the sea arrives
9015681 it seems most everything comes too late so nothing comes too late
9015682 i think its a combination of factors from subject matter to content and research and follow up
9015683 no one inside or outside the coast guard is more surprised with the number of senior insiders talking to cgr the number of sources inside terri dickersons organization for instance is a moving target as terri has used the tool of constructive discharge with the precision of a surgeons knife we have lost sources but gained a new one each time the frustration of employees who have their rights trampled on daily inside the office of civil rights provides a continual flow of information said jackson
9015684 it was 2 in the morning or so and it seemed like johns father had been sleeping before it happened
9015685 he got to the point pretty quickly after we got moving
9015686 captain mccain was upset but he didnt go on talking about it very long
9015687 he wanted to get home he just said no more of that the important thing was that we not jeopardize anything for ourselves
9015688 even during the cold war during the harsh confrontation between the soviet union and the united states we always avoided direct clashes between our civilians even more so between our military personnel
9015689 ordinary experts even if they teach military affairs should not do so in combat zones but in training areas and training centers
9015690 what was the purpose of that gentleman being among the special forces and what is he doing today i so far cannot answer
9015691 i wish we had americans and american weapons but its not the case

9015695 we did not kill up to 90 civilians as has been alleged
9015696 ive seen the account stated from both the u n and certainly from the afghan government ive also seen it discussed that in fact that didnt happen
9015697 we know that when collateral damage occurs that it really does set us back so we work exceptionally hard to make sure that doesnt happen
9015698 were looking to do that as rapidly as we can

9015701 this election has never been about me its been about you
9015702 our students faculty and staff recognized that they could help build awareness and they put a plan in place and carried it through i am so proud of their accomplishments
9015703 the sole purpose of organization is to raise awareness and funding for research that has the greatest promise of saving ryan and other boys with dmd
9015704 we cant do that alone the sanford brown team was a great partner and we appreciate their leadership
9015705 it is apparent that the stage of disease incubation in infected donors played a large role in the likelihood of transmission the longer that bse or scrapie had been carried by donors the greater the likelihood of the disease being transmitted with transfusions of infected blood
9015706 the study shows that for sheep infected with bse or scrapie transmission rates via blood transfusion can be high particularly when donors are in the later stages of infection
9015707 while it may not correlate directly to what happens in the human population due to factors such as species differences in genetic susceptibility to disease it provides greater insight into the role of how vcjd may be carried through infected blood by understanding how vcjd can be transmitted through blood transfusions we can ensure the most effective control measures to minimise human to human infection

9015710 i cant imagine any comparison shopping engine going for that much when you look at none of them were sold for that much and they had traction in the market its astounding to me
9015711 european e commerce is much further behind u s e commerce
9015712 im beside myself trying to figure out how microsoft thinks theyre going to monetize this
9015713 microsoft is not an e commerce company so its a little strange that theyd be buying a company that focuses on e commerce
9015714 however it does make sense in the context of search basically they want to make live search the best place to start when youre buying a product online
9015715 now microsoft will not only be able to direct you to the product youre looking for theyll also be able to send you to the site that offers that item at the cheapest price
9015716 microsoft is still third in market share and theres been no progress in the three or so years since they started making search and search advertising a priority
9015717 they remain at anywhere between 8 percent and 10 percent while yahoos at about 30 percent and google is at 60 percent
9015718 theres a lot of rumor and speculation out there about kindle one thing i can tell you for sure is that there will be no new version of kindle this year a new version will come out sometime next year at the earliest
9015719 i dont think theyre punting on an opportunity now if its not ready now it doesnt make sense to rush
9015720 competitors have a lot to overcome if all they have is hardware like itunes for music amazons got the device and service tie in thats pretty powerful

9015730 the ad is not acceptable for air on the nbc network because the spots address controversial issues and it is our policy not to air ads addressing such issues on our network

9015742 the times reports on the problems of adding wind farms to the power grid because of the grids old design it
9015743 thats no problem excess electricity gets sold to the power company who stores it for you
9015744 the amount of solar energy reaching the surface of the planet is so vast that in one year it is about twice as much as will ever be obtained from all of the earths non renewable resources of coal oil natural gas and mined uranium combined
9015745 in january 2007 the texas legislature convened helped win pickens a key new legal right it was contained in an amendment to a major piece of water legislation the amendment one of more than 100 added after the bill had been reviewed in the house allowed a water supply district to transmit alternative energy and transport water in a single corridor or right of way
9015746 pickens still needed the power of eminent domain if he was going to build his pipeline and wind power lines across private land and by happy coincidence the legislators passed a smaller bill that made that all the easier the new legislation loosened the requirements for creating a water district

9015777 the australian drought of the early twenty first century threw long standing chasms between use and realities of water supply into relief the issue of water scarcity in australia has always existed but as a nation we have always managed to ignore it however these present conditions have created increasing pressure for water users and managers to ensure adequate supplies for consumption
9015778 the information gained through risk screening exercises can aid in providing a national snapshot of risk prioritizing regions or individual catchments and identifying key drivers of risk for a more focused management effort
9015779 debate about water use in the murray is not simply one between environment and production but also on involving lifestyles given the increasing pressure on australias water resources it is essential that institutions appreciate and incorporate the value of amenities when making water resource management decisions
9015780 kevin mcsweeney of ohs gave an introductory talk in bacchus in the perkins student center the presentation included a short video about how fires can affect a college student on or off campus as well as providing information abut the safety equipment and systems on the ud campus
9015781 the participants then formed three groups with one going to another room in perkins one to the harrington beach basketball courts and a third group going to gilbert hall e
9015782 we had to crawl down the corridor through the smoke staff members could opt of the activity is they chose to do so
9015783 on harrington beach staff members were taught how to use a fire extinguisher to put out a fire and then had an opportunity to use fire extinguishers ud police reviewed fire drill protocol including how to respond to an alarm
9015784 the goal is to increase awareness in the areas of fire safety fire reaction and public safety programs
9015785 we value the opportunity to reach this important group of students they are literally our frontline for information exchange with student residents
9015786 we offer fire extinguisher familiarization as a chance for participants to recognize that these fire safety devices are available in the event that they need to use them to facilitate evacuation or if they have confidence enough to extinguish a small fire
9015787 we dont want them to risk injury attempting to extinguish a fire
9015788 our aim is to explain why an item appears on the list and not just tell somebody to do it because we said so
9015789 the participants now know that unattended cooking and oven incidents were our leading causes of preventable fire alarm activations in residence halls last year
9015790 if we had unanswered questions or concerns from one module of the training we were able to speak with an expert at another smaller session
9015791 having all the resources in one place made it easier to grasp the material
9015792 we want to eliminate nuisance and false alarms this training was just a first step in developing an annual program and will help to foster a great relationship with the delaware state fire school the aetna fire department and the newark fire marshal with our departments at ud
9015793 i think everyone who participated was able to walk away better informed and with a higher level of confidence to react to a fire emergency in our residence halls
9015794 well i was hmm if i recall correctly i was well i do seem to remember spending a lot of time at target

9015819 credit suisse is what we here at the center for responsive politics call a heavy hitter and one of the most influential organisations in federal politics
9015820 for the companies its about getting access to these individuals once they are elected its about developing a relationship with these people so that you can provide them with your perspectives
9015821 companies seek political influence and try to prevent politicians from hurting them
9015822 the employees who give funds to the candidates are not the average employees rather they are the companys elite high level executives including the ceo who can contribute as an individual and as a member of the political action committee
9015823 gathering information from lobbyists is a good thing because their companies know problems well and have ideas but the problem for democracy is that politicians do not get or seek the opposite points of view before making policy
9015824 the danger it poses for democracy is that politicians do not obtain or seek the opposing point of view before defining an approach or taking steps

9015835 we have seen god do the most awesome miracles on behalf of the children teachers and administrators in the schools
9015836 god brought a grandma to our group who happens to live on their street and now they get to go to church every week
9015837 we prayed god would provide for their every need especially their salvation
9015838 all three came to know the lord and are doing well
9015839 some moms come in with heavy burdens and hearts not really knowing how to pray but as they focus on god and pray their lives change from worrying moms to mighty prayer warriors
9015840 the joke about boiling the boot and the pukeko for 10 hours and then eating the boot has been around for years
9015841 t s eliot i think says somewhere that before a country has a culture it has a cuisine
9015842 in a larger sense that might be right but we had got things the wrong way around if our ancestors had brought a cuisine with them then their suitcases of recipes were either washed overboard or lost by british airways at heathrow new zealanders as a nation could not cook
9015843 while our culinary dexterity as slice bikkie and cake makers may not be as sexy as bronzed mediterranean peasants conjuring a delicious meal out of a rocky hillside it is ours
9015844 the full tins that this baking produced also seem to me to nicely bring together frontier hospitality scottish traditions of hospitality and maori manaakitanga hospitality and respect for guests the sharing of food the taking of gifts of food and wine when visiting is another aspect of new zealand food behaviour which has its origins in these parts of our past
9015845 the lange government revolution meant all the rules changed again it got overwhelmed by international styles
9015846 one of the things thats interesting about the idea of a national cuisine is that it seems to be something that people only start talking about and codifying at the point they perceive that its disappearing
9015847 the idea of boiling poultry instead of roasting it is something that we tend not to do and so i did a bit of that using boiler chickens that you can get from chinese supermarkets theyre very hard to find elsewhere any more its interesting when youre used to these industrialised chooks that roast to the texture of marshmallow to get a piece of poultry that can stand bubbling away in the pot for hours and still emerge with some sort of texture
9015848 people telling their fellow citizens what they should be eating
9015849 theres a strong pattern of that in new zealand cooking
9015850 ive interviewed a couple of women whose mothers were staunch followers of ulric williams both of them lived well into their 90s but both of them suffered from goitre because he was very much against iodised salt you really do have to deal with the lack of iodine in new zealand soils
9015851 he seems to have been very influential i remember living in flats in the 1970s where it was thought that anything that contained white flour or white sugar would cause people to drop dead within minutes of eating it
9015852 in the 1930s there was quite a number of flash english cookbooks by chefs that have toheroa soup we were obviously exporting it in tins its one of the few things that was seen as luxurious enough to turn up in those books
9015853 and pavlova has spread across the world lemon delicious pudding turns up in all sorts of spots the first thing thats identifiably a lemon delicious pudding turns up in 1916 in new zealand so we can probably claim it as one of ours
9015854 las presuntas heridas y muertes ocurrieron en otro pa s y las investigaciones realizadas por esas autoridades locales que todos los demandantes residen en ese pa s todas las personas heridas en los accidentes eran residentes y fueron tratadas de sus heridas en ese pa s y que los demandantes est n gobernados por las leyes de ese pa s
9015855 si bien la sentencia que devuelve los casos a la justicia argentina se podr a considerar una derrota hay ciertas condiciones que se han impuesto en una primera instancia que hacen que el caso prosiga de manera muy auspiciosa
9015856 por ejemplo la obligaci n de traducir al idioma espa ol y certificar de toda la prueba disponible el compromiso de ford firestone para la no oposici n por prescripci n en el territorio de origen entre otros

9015858 this is indeed a real hero this is not like any hero weve ever seen before

9015860 this case illustrates the dangers of meeting someone in this way and inviting them into your home
9015861 he has now been allowed to practise again anywhere he wants in effect
9015862 it would be totally unreasonable for me to expect him never to work again
9015863 but what is perfectly reasonable for me to expect is that he should be properly qualified
9015864 you are never going to see your son again and you are never going to say hello to him
9015865 you are never going to give him a hug or see your grandson open his christmas presents with his dad there

9015920 as someone who knows that his decaying northeast philadelphia neighborhood will only get more dangerous should obama be elected i couldnt be happier about the palin selection
9015921 palin undercuts mccains argument that obama lacks experience i assume most persons realize that mccain makes that argument only because he doesnt think he can get away with denouncing obama as a negro communist
9015922 the main thing the palin selection accomplishes is the destruction of obamas putative glamour now wonder boy is just a black guy who thinks too much of himself and the timing the morning after his speech from mt olympus

9015946 the first presidential decision any candidate for our nations highest office makes is selecting his or her vice presidential running mate john mccains decision today to pick alaskan sarah palin failed to live up to that standard mccains pick of someone who is clearly not ready to be a heartbeat away from being commander in chief once again calls into question if john mccain has the judgment and temperament to lead our nation
9015947 has the record of reform and bipartisanship that others can only speak of
9015948 i do now have to tell alaskans that such pressure could have been perceived to exist although i have only now become aware of it
9015949 many of these inquiries were completely appropriate however the serial nature of the contacts could be perceived as some kind of pressure presumably at my direction
9015950 could be perceived as some kind of pressure presumably at your direction
9015951 governments in the us and uk are already being briefed by their own military strategists about how to prepare for a world of mass famine floods of refugees and even nuclear conflicts over resources
9015952 there will be huge falls in the amount of crops that you can grow because there isnt the rain and its too hot
9015953 the ones in the european union like spain and italy
9015954 it may mean the collapse in the global trade of food because while some countries still have enough there is still a global food shortage
9015955 if you cant buy food internationally and you cant raise enough at home what do you do you move so refugee pressures huge ones are one of the things that drives these security considerations
9015956 india and pakistan are both nuclear armed countries all of the agriculture in pakistan and all of the agriculture in northern india depend on glacier fed rivers that come off the himalayas from the tibetan plateau those glaciers are melting
9015957 theyre melting according to chinese scientists to 7 per cent a year which means theyre half gone in 10 years
9015958 india has a problem with this pakistan faces an absolutely lethal emergency because pakistan is basically a desert with a braid of rivers running through it
9015959 those rivers all start with one exception in indian controlled territory and theres a complex series of deals between the two countries about who gets to take so much water out of the river those deals break down when theres not that much water in the rivers

9015961 some of them actually im afraid weve already got them wrong in the sense that there is going to be some major climate change
9015962 that borders going to be militarised i think theres almost no question about it because the alternative is an inundation of the united states by what will be effectively climate refugees

9015967 hemos venido realizando todo lo que se ha planificado para esta etapa hemos cumplido toda las unidades de trabajo tratando de aprovechar el tiempo no s lo en la cancha sino en la convivencia de los jugadores y estamos convencidos que a base de trabajo esfuerzo y unidad vamos a sacar los partidos adelante

9015969 it appears chicken is still being used as a political tool

9015972 i admitted under torture that i had contaminated the children that i had collaborated with the cia and the i was ready to admit everything that was after the episode with the dog
9015973 the 5 0 thing puts a lot more extra pressure on us as it would take us up to second in the world rankings
9015974 that is the kind of pressure we want pressure is a privilege and if we win 5 0 it takes us right up to the top it is something we have talked about and if we deliver we can win 5 0 the dressing room is very happy place
9015975 we are putting pressure on their batters and playing to our potential were hitting their good balls for four and doing a really good job on them
9015976 i know south africa really well and they wanted to beat us they are very proud people and stubborn people
9015977 the cricket we are playing is not good cricket but england are playing unbelievable cricket they are one of the best one day sides we have played against recently
9015978 it has always been a dream to play for england as an individual you couldnt ask for more i played against south africa for the lions and although it was always going to be tough they knew i could bat

9015993 hes the steady hand we need when the worlds economy is so uncertain
9015994 harpers the kind of person who knows where he stands hes a straight up guy
9015995 i think that the vice presidential choice that john mccain makes is probably the most important choice hes going to make in this entire campaign
9015996 because he has no room for error no margin for doubt if he picks a pro choice running mate it will confirm the unease and the mistrust that some evangelicals and dont forget this social conservative catholics feel about mccain
9015997 probably governor sarah palin of alaska because shes a person of strong faith
9015998 she just had her fifth child a downs syndrome child and theres a wonderful quote that she gave about her baby and the fact that she would never ever consider having an abortion just because her child had downs syndrome shes strongly pro life
9015999 shes a virtual lifetime member of the national rifle association she would ring so many bells and i just think it would help with independents because shes a woman shes a reform governor i think that from what i hear that would be the choice that would probably ring the most bells along with mike huckabee of course whos a southern baptist
9016000 a lot of people hear about a broader evangelicla agenda and they think oh evangelicals are giving up on believing that life begins at conception theyre not giving up on that at all not at all
9016001 sarah palin clearly addresses the issues so many conservatives are concerned about it balances out the ticket
9016002 shes also really a checkmate for the democratic party because folks who were looking to make history for barack obama can make history by voting for john mccain in seeing the first woman elected to the vice presidency it was a very strategic move by john mccain
9016003 sarah palin is the whole package there couldnt be a better vice presidential pick
9016004 by choosing the boldly pro life sarah palin as his running mate john mccain has taken his stand as the one true authentic pro life ticket
9016005 let me challenge one assumption this catholic is voting for obama
9016006 the republicans now have the first presidential ticket to include a woman
9016007 the republicans now have the first presidential ticket to include a woman
9016008 if palins presence on the gop ticket inspires white evangelicals and pro life catholics to put their full weight behind mccains candidacy it could prove disastrous for the democrats
9016009 the republicans now have the first presidential ticket to include a woman

9016012 it has been a true honor and joy to serve as the president of iowa central for the past 13 years
9016013 the thing we struggled with was whether his personal life was you know his
9016014 i think we all thought that was true on the other hand his position i guess what you do in your personal life does affect the publics perception of what you do on the job

9016019 as the inflation rates have hardened beyond tolerable levels monetary policy would continue to address aggregate demand pressures which appear to be strongly in evidence
9016020 inflation rate will remain in double digits till february 2009 if the oil prices remain relatively benign we could see rbi move from tightening to neutral policy stance
9016021 an overriding priority for monetary policy would be to eschew any further intensification of inflationary pressures
9016022 it would be too long a story to go into now

9016025 during the kargil war one unit of troops stationed there prayed at a kali temple and they decided to pitch in funds for an auto drum bell
9016026 one of the soldiers was from coimbatore so he suggested the rks brand and since then other temples in the area have bought the rks auto drum bell as well
9016027 the tirupati temple complex has seven of our auto drum bells

9016039 we think 250 gb is an extremely large amount of bandwidth
9016040 a low bandwidth user downloading an hd movie at 8 p m in peak time puts more stress on the network than someone who downloads lots more in the middle of the night
9016041 if fewer than 1 percent would be affected by this whats the point
9016042 if they are going to put caps then they need to give us what i think is an acceptable expectation a meter
9016043 figure out a way to tell us what is our monthly usage and let us know if we are running up against a 250 gb cap we know when to stop
9016044 if you believe the 0 05 kb e mail then you also believe in the tooth fairy
9016045 it remains unclear how the cap announced today helps solve comcasts supposed congestion problems
9016046 though the proposed cap is relatively high it will increasingly ensnare more users as technology continues its natural progression

9016048 i would also like to register my disgust at whats been happening for several days and my sheer disappointment that oracle of all companies would allow an application to go live without thorough testing or if it was thoroughly tested in uat without rolling back immediately when it was obvious that there were problems in the production environment
9016049 uptime is still not where it should be of course forums oracle com is business critical for a lot of folks as well as for oracle and im glad they consider it so
9016050 we made a conscious decision early in this process to stick with the upgrade to fight through the problems instead of run from them

9016052 the selection of a vice presidential candidate is one of the most significant and telling decisions a presidential candidate can make

9016056 the suspicion would arise that someone in the us created this conflict on purpose to stir up the situation and to create an advantage for one of the candidates in the competitive race for the presidency they needed a small victorious war

9016113 i thought it was a great speech he went right to the issues he started to go on the attack for the campaign it was very well done and of course barack obama can give a great speech and i think it got the party all fired up

9016120 it was an incredible experience to live through and to be listening to obama today it gives hope to the possibility that america can do the right thing and rise above race and creed

9016123 to see obama deliver this speech tonight makes it all worth it
9016124 larry assures us that hes had a lot of experience in interiors
9016125 and vice versa im not sure what he meant by that but im sure ill hear about it next time im on the tonight show also larrys obviously good at keeping secrets even from his wife so thatll help this fall when we plan to secretly sell oil leases on government land to the oil companiesssss oops please disregard that last statement my friends

9016129 the conservative base of the party was very upset at the thought of john choosing former pennsylvania governor tom ridge or senator joe lieberman because they were too liberal and not tough enough for their taste
9016130 so we are excited about johns choice and believe we have a winner in dr kevorkian
9016131 todays conservatives favor death they overwhelmingly support the death penalty either handed out by a court or by other means such as death by war death preferred to government provided health care death to political enemies preferring workers die on the job due to unsafe working conditions rather than have government safety regulations the list goes on kevorkian is the natural choice
9016132 mccain is a charming nitwit just like bush and now dr kevorkian well anything to do with death is just like cheney
9016133 cheney symbolizes a tough guy driving around in a humvee leaving dead bodies in his wake while dr kevorkian does the same thing with a van the advantage here for mccain is that he can show he wants to conserve energy as the van gets better gas mileage than the hummer
9016134 another reason john likes dr kevorkian who recently got out of jail for his part in an assisted suicide
9016135 is that john can relate to anyone who was held as a prisoner in any case we now think this ticket is strong enough to scare the democrats to death
9016136 and also for our community to go out and vote
9016137 i just wanted to be in harlem to watch the speech
9016138 we found a black guy an older gentlemen who had never voted
9016139 no one tells you you changed my mind but i think we put something in their mind about obama and we said dont be afraid
9016140 i always felt like where do i fit in and obama to me is such an interesting eclectic mix
9016141 he can understand a wide range of people and he has woken up passion in people

9016151 what does he want from me im not interested in writing to an old man of 30 years but i did write back as i was brought up to be a polite girl and he wouldnt let go
9016152 the day i married him i cried my eyes out
9016153 i didnt want anything to do with him and he didnt know what to do with me it turned out to be a wonderful marriage he was a great guy he understood my trauma
9016154 i wanted people in america to realize how lucky they were
9016155 i think its an experience worth talking about if you dont learn from history you are apt to repeat history

9016166 plaintiffs free speech rights will have some restrictions during this convention
9016167 given the unique geography of the city of saint paul the number of people attending the convention the space that the national and international media needs in order to assure that freedom of the press is honored the protest space cannot be expanded
9016168 there will be 15 000 media representations looking for stories
9016169 i woke up in the morning and said was that a dream
9016170 as evidenced by her speech in ohio today governor palin will bring a lot of energy and enthusiasm to the ticket and to john mccains administration as governor of alaska sarah palin has proven to be a real leader as a woman a wife and a mother she would bring a unique perspective to the office i am not surprised that for his choice john mccain looked outside of washington for an executive with a proven record of challenging the status quo
9016171 i could not be more thrilled with sarah palin as john mccains pick for vice president
9016172 not only is this an exciting choice for women in maine and across the country but her solid record of results on ethics reform energy independence and cutting wasteful spending in alaska sends a strong message to washington that change is on its way
9016173 john mccain has made an outstanding choice in governor palin as his running mate
9016174 barack obama has been running for president since he was elected to the senate while governor palin has been working hard challenging the status quo and cutting wasteful government spending in alaska she is an excellent fit for mccain for the country and particularly for maine the combination of proven reformers mccain and palin will be a force to be reckoned with
9016175 this is a selection that should send chills down the spines of nanny state urbanites everywhere as i understand it not only does this woman have a horde of children she also snowmobiles and owns guns and although i can not say with certainty that she has a shotgun across the back window of her pickup i wouldnt be surprised
9016176 governor palin is also an executive the possibility of four windbag senators on the two tickets was possibly the most chilling aspect of this years election i will add that senator mccain at least has some heroic credentials to go with all that hot air
9016177 governor palin beat an incumbent governor in the primary and then a former governor in the general election in a very poor republican year by running as an eccentric outsider with blunt no nonsense proposals this is certainly an inspiration to me
9016178 but most importantly for the future of the us governor palin is a strong advocate of drill now and drill everywhere we cannot continue to give foreigners little scraps of paper redeemable in the work of americans for oil im sure she knows how to get the caribou to agree
9016179 when i met senator mccain i told him i hoped he wasnt counting on riding in for that tie breaking electoral college vote on my coattails but he assured me he was which is a cause for some trepidation on my part

9016403 the kids have a lot of fun just when we transition into doing the calisthenics from the games we switch it up so they do stay engaged in it

9016416 i have a contract with real madrid now but we are still negotiating with chelsea
9016417 a lot of things are being published and they are not the truth
9016418 it is not true that i said that i was going to apologise to the press
9016419 theres just too many issues with this offense for people to deal with
9016420 we had two and a half weeks to deal with it the rest of these folks will get two days good luck acc
9016421 had dwyer in our sights about three times and just couldnt tackle him
9016422 we are a team that is very young and new to the big scene
9016423 41 points is a lot better than 14 im sure of that an ugly win is better than a pretty loss
9016424 in this offense you dont know when someone is going to break a long run
9016425 but a wins a win we would have liked to do a lot of things better defensively than we did we are in no way satisfied we have to do a lot of things better
9016426 i was trying to make a play for the team but unfortunately it didnt work out that way
9016427 it didnt happen i have to learn from this and try to make better decisions
9016428 it feels like i didnt play football in two years
9016429 it feels good to be out there i picked up where i left off now just keep it going
9016430 it will be a hard game to watch on film because of all the mistakes well learn from this
9016431 hes up in it and hes running it doesnt take him a long time to get to full speed he has those instincts you come out of the crib with ive seen him in two games and hes been darn good
9016432 the history here thats not too impressive of a record
9016433 hopefully we can add on to that a little bit more
9016434 certainly not the way we drew it up the thing thats really painful for me and the staff is you want to give people a reason to believe
9016435 i feel like we let a lot of people down
9016436 i was proud of them it would have been easy to come here and not be ready to play
9016437 i dont know if ive ever been this nervous about an opening game weve always played well as the underdog but i was really concerned about having that top 25 ranking coming in here
9016438 kirbys been through some ups and downs we felt like he deserved the opportunity and we gave it to him
9016439 i thought griffin provided a spark which is what he has to do for us
9016440 the values of hard work and integrity that i learned growing up in warren have carried me through life
9016441 i started erickson capital so i could provide clients with the personalized service and attention they deserve previously working for a big wirehouse i found myself spending half my time in corporate meetings
9016442 after more than 25 years of observing how investors behave during various economic climates its clear to me that few people care about stock market volatility when the market is up
9016443 theyre only concerned about volatility when theyre losing money i try to guard against the downside risk and use financial products that protect principal in any market so people can sleep better at night and still meet their financial goals
9016444 although ive lived away for many years ive always considered mid coastal maine my home and probably always will
9016445 i was only the reserve keeper for the junior side
9016446 but then one day i was asked by mr scolari to join the first team for training
9016447 it was amazing i had leapfrogged the main junior keeper and here i was training with brazil international goalkeeper dida who was someone i looked up to and still do
9016448 just to be involved gave me masses of confidence and i learned so much from dida and scolari in those early days
9016449 you might read about my background my mannerisms and you might think im a little eccentric but youd be wrong
9016450 im a guy who likes to be happy and i come to work with a smile on my face i appreciate what ive got now because it hasnt always been that way for me
9016451 my family had very little money we had no electricity and the only time i saw a tv was if i went to the home of one of my friends it was a very sheltered upbringing
9016452 if arsene said he needed 30 million for a striker he would get it no problem at all
9016453 it is not our decision who he spends money on and nor will it ever be we totally back arsene but there is a dual problem for him
9016454 if we were to buy the sort of big names that people talk about we would be looking at relatively mature players who then need to be integrated into the way we play
9016455 secondly it impacts on the youngsters and in many cases arsene thinks it is quicker for us to bring a player through our system but that does not mean all we are interested in is the artistic achievement award
9016456 we are not settling for second best we want to win trophies and i think it is time we did but arsene also believes in creating teams with a certain style
9016457 there were great hopes that we would buy heavily this summer but i would refute that we have not bought well
9016458 nasri has two goals in two games at the emirates stadium and if ars ne could find the right player he would buy again but he hasnt
9016459 i hear all the time that we have no money but i just wish someone would take the time to look at our accounts
9016460 this is a proper business which produces its own cash and lives or dies by its performances
9016461 our net payments are 20 million and the revenue increase from the new stadium is close to 50 million explain to me how that stadium is a drain on the club when it produces an extra 30 million a year
9016462 this constant suggestion that the stadium is bleeding us dry is c
9016463 the reality is our wage bill is very similar to manchester united substantially above liverpool and substantially below chelsea but that is to be expected
9016464 we pay good salaries but we pay them more evenly so we do not have extremes of very high and very low wage earners there is an ethos of a team effort
9016465 sparkys teams are strong tough and have a great will to win they reflect the way he used to play football
9016466 maybe my personality rubs off on my team as well im looking forward to a good old battle mark is proving to be a very very good manager and city have big ambitions but so have we maybe we can do better than last season when city beat us twice
9016467 id like it if we had played in europe this week you cant complain too much because thats a sign that youre making progress
9016468 city have had enough time to get back had plenty of time to recover and prepare for sunday so therell be no excuses for both sides in terms of tiredness

9016474 llevo muchos a os en esto y he pasado por muchas situaciones pero bueno as es el futbol hay que sobreponerse seguir trabajando y pensar que cada partido es una nueva oportunidad de hacer bien las cosas de ganar y demostrar que uno est bien
9016475 era un partido en el que tuvimos que correr de m s por el hecho de que ellos manejaban bien la pelota pudimos sacar esa ventaja que buscamos el equipo supo defender muy bien se sacrific bastante contento porque se pudo ganar
9016476 siempre va haber cr ticas nunca se conforman lo importante es que juegue bien o juegue mal tigres necesitaba los tres puntos y si bien la racha hoy es muy buena y eso nos pone contentos a nosotros
9016477 s salir a ganar hay que tener esa mentalidad de ir por los tres puntos de local como de visitante as que contra el am rica iremos con esa mentalidad por los tres puntos no hay que ir ni a empatar ni perder vamos por los tres puntos porque si bien uno est all arriba sabe que en la tabla porcentual est abajo
9016478 am rica siempre fue un equipo duro se caracteriz por jugar bien y estar all arriba sabemos que ellos quieren terminar esa racha que son ya cinco partidos que no ganan as que nosotros trataremos de impedir eso y seguir en nuestra racha
9016479 la verdad no s pero vamos sumando minutos de poco a poquito ayer ya jugu 60 70 minutos de a poquito vamos a ir siguiendo con este ritmo y esperemos que pronto pueda terminar los 90

9016621 and i know up here in alaska most every alaskan believes that anwr should be drilled and no one cares more about alaskas environment our lands our wildlife our fresh air our clean water than alaskans themselves and we know that this can be allowed safely cleanly ethically this type of exploration and development of an american supply of energy
9016622 its been grossly misunderstood on many fronts when you see the pictures the visuals used in the opponents message and usually this is extreme environmentalists their message as to why anwr shouldnt be touched you see pictures of mountains and rivers and beautiful green valleys thats not anwr anwr is a flat barren plain that is very very rich in resources

9016699 my daughter was traumatised after the incident she came back from school on thursday and informed her mother we decided to take action against the teacher
9016700 we know that the teacher was expelled from a nearby school for misbehaving with girl students despite a tainted record the school administration hired him they did not bother to check his credentials
9016701 none of the parents or the girls complained to us or the police on thursday on friday several guardians stormed into the school campus had we received a complaint we would have definitely taken action against him
9016702 the rest of the four cases came from outside the ndmc area one even from moradabad and we have accordingly informed the mcd officials
9016703 the other four cases pertained to other areas and it was just that the patients came to hospitals in our area for treatment for instance a person from moradabad gave his address as gole market which was in fact the address of his relative here

9016730 its been very very hard on our family to deal with this over and over again
9016731 it opens old wounds every time we have to go through another parole hearing but we must have the peace of mind that comes with doing everything we can to keep this guy in prison
9016732 this guy robbed us of the opportunity to be around our dad

9016739 it was his job to protect people but after that we didnt have him anymore to protect us

9016775 this semiconductor maker is a good choice for investors who would like to add to their information technology position with shares of a first class company
9016776 broadcom located in irvine california designs semiconductors for the wired and wireless communications industry it is a major supplier to apples iphone which has taken the world by storm this past year
9016777 specifically it powers the brilliant display screen that has captivated users since the launch of the iphone last year full disclosure ive just picked up my new 3g iphone
9016778 it also provides the chip that delivers the gps navigation in the new iphone the company holds over 2 000 u s and foreign patents and has more than 7 400 pending patent applications
9016779 financially the company is solid with annual revenues in 2007 of about 3 8 billion and net income of 213 million 37 cents a share fully diluted figures in u s dollars
9016780 for the latest quarter ending june 30 broadcom reported net revenue of 1 2 billion an increase of 16 3 over the first quarter of 2008 and up by 33 7 from the 897 9 million reported for the second quarter of 2007
9016781 broadcom shares traded as high as 43 07 last october so the stock looks inexpensive at this level and value buying right now seems very sensible the 2009 p e estimate is 16 which is reasonable for a high growth business and well below the five year median level of 24 times earnings
9016782 there are also some outstanding legal issues between broadcom and qualcomm but those seem to be going broadcoms way the company is debt free and recently authorized a share buy back of 1 billion that extends to 2011 i would prefer a dividend instead of a buy back but you cant have everything buy with a target of 35

9016869 exigimos de la autoridad un alto a la represi n
9016870 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
9016871 me asombra la facilidad con la cual a partir de estos hechos se estigmatiza al pueblo mapuche como un todo cuando quienes vivimos en la regi n de la araucan a y conocemos al campesino de esta etnia sabemos que se trata de personas emprendedoras cuya principal preocupaci n radica en sacar adelante a sus familias y en poder trabajar para conseguirlo tal como cualquier chileno
9016872 conozco al pueblo mapuche he visto como se desconocen sus derechos ancestrales he compartido con l desde mi primera infancia he alojado en sus comunidades y s que son los chilenos a los cuales la sociedad otorga menos oportunidades y de los cuales m s se abusa esto llega al punto de que cuando el estado les asigna recursos como ocurre con el programa or genes hay una corte de intermediarios y consultoras de partidos pol ticos que tienen como conducta permanente aprovechar en propio beneficio los dineros que se destinan al pueblo mapuche
9016873 mientras hay subsidio para plantar rboles en los campos de la araucan a y as desplazar a las ciudades al mapuche no hay subsidio para que estos campesinos puedan siquiera mantener una agricultura de subsistencia ello es inducido por las pol ticas de gobierno para expulsar al mapuche de sus tierras y fr amente desruralizar la araucan a
9016874 la injusta estigmatizaci n que cierta prensa hace del pueblo mapuche el aprovechamiento de ciertos pol ticos de los recursos que la ley destina al pueblo mapuche y la desruralizaci n impulsada desde el estado forman parte del clima contrario a la generaci n de paz social que nuestra araucan a necesita para dejar de ser la m s pobre del pa s y ser la regi n perdedora de la cual hablan los organismos internacionales
9016875 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
9016876 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
9016877 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

9016891 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
9016892 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
9016893 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
9016894 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido

9016913 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
9016914 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
9016915 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
9016916 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio

9016999 competitors have a lot to overcome if all they have is hardware like itunes for music amazons got the device and service tie in thats pretty powerful
9017000 the basis of competition is where its likely to be interesting both in terms of the quantity and quality of applications but maybe even more importantly in terms of the ease of use
9017001 thats where apple with their iphone app store seems to have really struck a nerve theyve made it incredibly easy for users of the device to get at the applications

9017008 the fcc also expects them to make a filing with a detailed plan outlining not only what they intend to do but what their practices were when they were blocking bittorrent
9017009 i dont see the fcc releasing its bite on comcast with just this plan comcast is still faced with opposing the fccs order of disclosing its past practices
9017010 during the second quarter cannasat divested its position in prairie plant systems and ended the strategic alliance agreement between the two companies this decision marked an important and fundamental strategic shift for the company as we now focus all our efforts and resources developing safe and therapeutically effective cns drug candidates we look forward to the second half of 2008 as we continue to advance our innovative and promising cat 310 and cat 320 products
9017011 to have the chief justice of our nation judge our final four moot court competition is a great privilege for our students and the university of florida
9017012 it is a tremendous understatement to say that it has elevated both the significance of this annual event and the anxiety levels of our student competitors
9017013 give hints regarding his judicial philosophy during his interactions with the competing students and fellow jurists on the panel
9017014 im not trying to prove anything here i consider this adapting to the environment
9017015 if i was still on level ground like i was before in the other storms i know i would be dreading gustav
9017016 there still tends to be more value put on the things we would like to show our neighbors
9017017 i feel a lot better now though because at least i know i will have a home to come back to
9017018 its like youve been slapped so hard in the past that you can almost still feel it i just know how much work it was rebuilding everything
9017019 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
9017020 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
9017021 republicans talk about putting country first but tell that to marion indiana they sent my job overseas
9017022 we need a president who puts the barney smiths before the smith barneys
9017023 next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this county for a third
9017024 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight
9017025 he said that our economy had made great progress under this president
9017026 he said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong and when one of his chief advisors the man who wrote his economic plan was talking about the anxiety americans are feeling he said that we were just suffering from a mental recession and that weve become and i quote a nation of whiners
9017027 how else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than 100 million americans
9017028 how else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax peoples benefits or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college
9017029 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way
9017030 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
9017031 i will cut taxes listen now cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families
9017032 because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
9017033 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook
9017034 i love his country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag
9017035 america we cannot turn back not with so much work to be done not with so many children to educate and so many veterans to care for not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend
9017036 on average caregivers only slept about six and a half hours a night and took almost 23 minutes to fall asleep
9017037 using the sleep diary data that subjects kept at the same time however depression was the primary determinant of poor sleep with depressed subjects reporting less time asleep and more wake time over the week
9017038 it is probably not advisable to drive before six weeks after bunion surgery on the right foot our research shows that the reflexes and the power required to brake suddenly in an emergency is fully returned only at six weeks in the post operative period
9017039 however it is extremely important for all patients to discuss when they can return to driving with their surgeon after having any type of surgery to their foot
9017040 we see quite a few states where the number of schools selling junk food in vending machines is very low
9017041 in many places schools are substituting healthier choices and continuing to bring in revenue
9017042 it shows these changes are possible to make all states face the same economic challenges that lead schools to make money by selling junk food this dramatic progress made in states with strong leadership shows the other schools it can be done
9017043 we cant at this point rule out a very early spike in amyloid right after a brain injury
9017044 we havent measured how brain injury affects amyloid beta inside cells nor have we determined whether brain injury affects the ability of amyloid beta to form small aggregates that may be especially harmful
9017045 our ultimate goal is to develop interventions that we can apply after a traumatic brain injury to improve outcomes and reduce the long term risk of alzheimers
9017046 i havent thought obama had a chance for a long time given republican ability at swiftboating but his abandonment of the pro peace pro civil liberties portion of the democratic base indeed his open warmongering against pakistan and russia and refusal to criticize the bush police state clinched it
9017047 we would typically expect to see this time of year
9017048 inequities in health avoidable health inequities arise because of the circumstances in which people grow live work and age and the systems put in place to deal with illness
9017049 the conditions in which people live and die are in turn shaped by political social and economic forces
9017050 to marshal the evidence on what can be done to promote health equity and to foster a global movement to achieve it
9017051 reducing health inequities is for the commission on social determinants of health an ethical imperative social injustice is killing people on a grand scale
9017052 the study suggests that the critical ingredient in smoking that may be causing emphysema is cadmium a well known contaminant of cigarette smoke the worry is if you are exposed to this cadmium through other sources you can also be at risk for emphysema
9017053 with a larger population we will be able to better disentangle the independent effects of cadmium and
9017054 one is that they dont know how to walk not walking they become deconditioned and lose cardiovascular fitness with the treadmill type of training you improve walking and also increase fitness
9017055 the most important clinical aspect of the study is that it is saying recovery can occur long after a stroke and can occur even after all the routine therapies have been tried
9017056 scientifically the most important point appears to be that rewiring of the brain may be involved in this process not just body conditioning
9017057 the average stroke patient now has about eight physical therapy sessions over six to 12 weeks
9017058 should be part of standard treatment for every stroke survivor who has a walking habit
9017059 most physical therapy departments have treadmills but they dont use them to the extent that we used them in the study
9017060 because this is exhausting it should always be done under supervision
9017061 there is always the risk of running into heart problems and falling we used special treadmills with handrails and also monitored the heart rate to achieve the level of exertion we needed
9017062 this survey reveals that there are some big unheard messages these kind of data help us to quantify the differences between countries and to highlight where additional efforts are needed some of these countries have rarely had any population survey data to help their programme planning efforts
9017063 its a short term solution because were using antibiotics more than wed like but it is working
9017064 it reduces the amount of group b strep in the vagina so there is less exposure to the baby during delivery
9017065 some of the estimates are more than twice that number are being given antibiotics because people arent following the protocol closely
9017066 they should get to the hospital early enough to get their antibiotics and they need to be aware of signs of illness so theyre ready to get their baby in for treatment immediately
9017067 sadly we frequently see patients admitted to a hospital with a devastating stroke who are known to have atrial fibrillation yet were either not taking warfarin or were taking a dose that is not therapeutic we consider these to be potentially preventable strokes
9017068 on one hand we have an extremely effective and cheap medication for stroke prevention warfarin yet on the other hand it remains under used in people who would benefit most from it
9017069 this is a public health priority because atrial fibrillation is one of the most common causes of stroke
9017070 many more strokes could be prevented if anti coagulation therapy were optimized in the population at large
9017071 this is mainly because its a hassle however this study confirms that many strokes can be avoided if patients are adequately anti coagulated therefore both patients and doctors need to do a better job of overcoming the inconvenience of warfarin
9017072 warfarin is usually the best and safest available treatment to prevent stroke in people with atrial fibrillation increasing the uptake of warfarin would reduce the risk of death and disability of stroke
9017073 what we learned from hurricane katrina is that disaster preparedness efforts must focus on evacuating and caring for vulnerable populations particularly the elderly including those in hospitals nursing homes and private residences
9017074 what we do not know is the reason for the imbalance in deaths
9017075 our data seems to point toward the inherent decision that is made when the tumor is formed whether it is highly malignant or not moreover since the characteristic might be dependent on the normal cell status one might imagine that they might be different between individuals
9017076 this does suggest that cells can sit for a long time then be activated
9017077 but these cells were injected into the circulation normal breast cells are not supposed to be in the circulation
9017078 cells that did not have any oncogenes in them and do not transform spontaneously as per all published studies we could see little colonies of these cells when we inspected the lungs
9017079 at no point never did we see a solid vision that would resemble metastatic colonies but it appears that every time we looked at the animal the colonies appeared to be larger
9017080 its an important step to show whether or not the first step of the metastatic cascade is something a normal cell can accomplish
9017081 without fair use copyright holders would for the most part license course packet excerpts from their copyrighted works anxious to earn the additional royalties associated with classroom adoption and cognizant of the fact that a faculty member can always assign other reading if a given copyright holder asks for an unreasonable price or imposes unreasonable terms
9017082 the vice president is a heartbeat away from becoming president so to choose someone with not one hours worth of experience on national issues is a dangerous choice
9017083 if john mccain thought that choosing sarah palin would attract hillary clinton voters he is badly mistaken
9017084 the only similarity between her and hillary clinton is that they are both women on the issues they could not be further apart
9017085 senator mccain had so many other options if he wanted to put a women on his ticket such as senator kay bailey hutchison or senator olympia snowe they would have been an appropriate choice compared to this dangerous choice
9017086 in addition sarah palin is under investigation by the alaska state legislature which makes this more incomprehensible

9017092 we created this contest to celebrate the unsung heroes of college football
9017093 last year a kangaroo from the university of akron hopped and kicked its way to the top mascot title in the land
9017094 mascots work as hard as anyone on the field but are lost in the shadows of touchdown celebrations and pre season and post season accolades of the flashy all star quarterbacks and running backs
9017095 this is a great tribute to them and fans should show their support bragging rights and national recognition are on the line
9017096 the howard university registrar did a search yielding the following howard university architecture computer science computer civil chemical electrical and mechanical engineering have zero students from crenshaw washington prep westchester locke dorsey view park inglewood high schools that is 0 as in zero
9017097 this represents a major step forward in our understanding of the dry form of macular degeneration
9017098 and with the identification of this potential target we can try to develop treatments for a disease which for the moment we cant treat
9017099 this raises particular concerns regarding rnai therapy for wet amd
9017100 but by establishing this link between the treatment for the wet form of amd and the potential harmful effect on the dry form of the disease we can perhaps better understand the mechanisms of both diseases
9017101 i think these results have to be taken with caution because the association effect of tlr3 with amd is very small when compared to the diseases association with some other genes
9017102 and there has been already one study saying there is absolutely no association of the tlr3 genetic variant with amd so this raises a question and a need for further edification it could be that this is just a spurious finding and there is in fact no association with amd
9017103 i will not plead in line with my standpoint on this court
9017104 the fat cells we found in our obese patients were deficient in several areas
9017105 we began with the idea of a woman who lives in a white world and suddenly she feels it is lacking sensuality and wants to break free from its monotony
9017106 she craves color dimension and flavor so she goes to the experts to help make over every aspect of her life from beauty fashion interior decorating and cooking
9017107 in addition increases in the frequency of spanking are associated with increased odds of abuse and mothers who report spanking on the buttocks with an object such as a belt or a switch are nine times more likely to report abuse compared to mothers who report no spanking
9017108 this study demonstrated for the first time that parents who report spanking children with an object and parents who frequently spank children are much more likely to report other harsh punishment acts consistent with physical abuse
9017109 seven variables can be combined into a convenient risk scoring system before coronary angiography is performed to predict in hospital mortality following pci
9017110 this model may be useful in providing patients with individualized evidence based estimates of procedural risk as part of the informed consent process before pci
9017111 these changes are different and separate from the changes in thinking skills that occur as people get older
9017112 we found accelerated changes in peoples mental skills that indicated a terminal decline phase years before death
9017113 cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease or dementia that is too early to be detected could be factors
9017114 increased health problems and frailty in old age often lead to inactivity and this lack of exercise and mental stimulation could accelerate mental decline
9017115 these are things that happen i enjoyed the prayer breakfasts we always had a good attendance so im assuming everyone enjoyed it
9017116 this is a promising new lead in the search for biological pathways that contribute to obesity
9017117 this finding may eventually lead to the development of new drugs to regulate appetite in people who have not had success with other treatments
9017118 overall there was no difference in the two groups people taking telmisartan and those taking placebo
9017119 however we did find a difference in that for those who were in the study longer the drug had an effect compared to those who were in the study for a short time
9017120 these effects have not been seen early after a stroke they may be more delayed
9017121 the follow up time in this study was only two a half years and it may have hurt us
9017122 but this study in itself doesnt say you have to use angiotensin ii receptor blocker early
9017123 other studies have suggested that these drugs may be better for stroke risk reduction but in this study we cant say that
9017124 the two drugs were essentially the same in terms of their ability to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke as well as reducing the risk of heart attack and death after a stroke
9017125 both drugs are equally effective neither drug is superior to the other in terms of reducing a recurrent stroke
9017126 in some patients we may use plavix particularly in those who have cardiac disease and in some patients we may still use this combination of persantine and aspirin choices are helpful since different people respond differently to different medicines
9017127 these results indicate that human egalitarianism and parochialism have deep developmental roots and the simultaneous emergence of altruistic sharing and parochialism during childhood is intriguing in view of recent evolutionary theories which predict that the same evolutionary process jointly drives both human altruism and parochialism
9017128 it takes a third grader to do the math and see that it would be a smart move in the long haul but we need to see if we have the reserve funds
9017129 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
9017130 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
9017131 my concern about the campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
9017132 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
9017133 we believe you are offering a high risk test that has not received adequate clinical validation and may harm the public health
9017134 the presently accepted regenerative medicine idea is that you make a stem cell from a patient bring it back to the beginning as it were then you are left with the problem of how to instruct that cell to become a beta cell or a motor neuron
9017135 we asked the simple question why should you have to go all the way back to the beginning could you go from one cell type to another
9017136 up to this time we hadnt demonstrated that you could do direct reprogramming
9017137 one present treatment for some diabetics is to transplant islets into the liver so we know that liver cells are a reasonable home for beta cells
9017138 if were lucky in two to five years we can think about doing that in people
9017139 if we physically inject something into the pancreas it almost always induces
9017140 maybe when the history of the whole subject is written it will be possible to say which was the best idea
9017141 i cant emphasize enough at this point that were too ignorant to know what is the best way to treat patients and until we know that it is essential that we use embryonic stem cells and ips cells to teach us about the mechanisms of disease until we know how to succeed we have to aggressively pursue all avenues
9017142 everyone will know that when you come here it is public service
9017143 i believe the smithsonian is in a good place now
9017144 i do not believe the institution will have any difficulty filling my position at the reduced salary with top notch candidates
9017145 any time you give someone a pay cut it feels like a demotion some people leave
9017146 if you build a lifestyle on a certain level of income its hard to change
9017147 one has to ask whats the logic of paying clough 500 000 and then paying the others so much less
9017148 i dont think that makes for very good morale among staff
9017149 there was also a significant prolongation of survival with a 40 percent reduction in the risk of death
9017150 the benefit of velcade was not only observed in good risk patients but also in high risk patients
9017151 we now have a new standard of care for newly diagnosed patients
9017152 we are in a new era in the treatment of myeloma
9017153 we have a new paradigm of relatively easy drugs compared to the usual chemotherapy which is adding to quality of life and longevity in myeloma thats a big deal
9017154 the future with repetitive doses of lower doses of medicine to control the myeloma is clearly surfacing
9017155 its an exciting time in the treatment of myeloma and this treatment represents a significant additional option for patients with myeloma who are not candidates for transplant those who are over 65 or may have other significant illnesses that prevent them from being considered for transplant
9017156 now with all the new treatments we have be it the bone marrow transplant or whether it be the use of the newer drugs the outlook for myeloma patients has improved considerably
9017157 but we are clearly in a situation where we have made substantial progress
9017158 if deemed to be at high or immediate risk of delivery prior to 32 weeks women and their doctors should consider using magnesium sulfate to prevent their child from having cerebral palsy
9017159 we define high risk as threatening delivery prior to 32 weeks
9017160 its too early to know if magnesium sulfate has an overall effect on the incidence rate of cerebral palsy
9017161 in the second case reported aug 18 death was due to a complicated medical course that included necrotizing pancreatitis
9017162 since 2006 the u s prescribing information for byetta has included information about pancreatitis
9017163 in 2007 after discussions with the fda amylin and lilly amended the prescribing information to include pancreatitis as a precaution
9017164 based on our evaluation we believe byetta continues to have a positive benefit risk profile for patients with type 2 diabetes
9017165 for every 3 000 patients who have taken byetta for a year one would have reported a case of pancreatitis
9017166 most pancreatitis cases resolve with supportive treatment and stopping the suspected medication including byetta

9017198 antipsychotics are effective in treating potentially very distressing psychiatric symptoms but as with all drugs their use can be associated with a range of benefits and possible side effects
9017199 this study has further clarified the potential for antipsychotics to increase the risk of stroke
9017200 this risk is substantially higher in patients with dementia than those without these findings need to be factored into prescribing decisions made by doctors caring for patients with often distressing and difficult to treat psychiatric symptoms
9017201 we believe that the risks associated with antipsychotic use in patients with dementia generally outweigh the potential benefits and in this patient group use of antipsychotic drugs should be avoided wherever possible
9017202 for other patients careful consideration must be given to the likely individual risks and benefits of any prescribing decision
9017203 important topic and elevates the concern about risks of antipsychotics to a whole new level the fda u s food and drug administration might investigate whether availability limitations or warning labeling should be imposed
9017204 older people with any physical vulnerability are about 13 percent more likely than those without one to report verbal mistreatment but are not more likely to report financial mistreatment
9017205 perhaps the respondents are including fairly routine arguments perhaps about money with their spouse sibling or child in their reports or perhaps older adults are more reticent to report negative behavior
9017206 the population of this country is aging and people now live with chronic diseases longer so its important to understand from a health perspective how people are being treated as they age
9017207 his holiness the dalai lama has been experiencing some discomfort in the past couple of days his personal physicians attributed this to exhaustion and have advised him to cancel his engagements for the time being and instead complete the remaining medical tests that began earlier this month in mumbai the indian city formerly called bombay it has therefore been decided that all his schedules for the next three weeks including the visit to mexico and the dominican republic are being canceled with immediate effect
9017208 exhaustion and fatigue are typically problems that have to do with exertion
9017209 if you feel as if you have to sit down to relax your muscles and you dont feel like moving or you cant move because your muscles are so fatigued that they have no further ability then thats exhaustion
9017210 it does require more of a work up to make sure that its not any underlying illness or disease
9017211 if youre feeling exhausted going grocery shopping if youre feeling exhausted doing mundane activities that you used to be able to do then that should be evaluated
9017212 it probably does because people in general tend not to be in the same physical shape the same degree of conditioning as they age
9017213 particularly if hes trying to do his usual level of activity that hes been doing for many years but just cant keep up with it anymore
9017214 can you rest any more efficiently at those sites than at home no probably not so if you need to rest home is a good place to do it
9017215 sleep is restorative not only for mental functioning but also for physical functioning

9017217 everybody needs a certain amount of sleep just to reach the sleep stages that are restful and help us rejuvenate and feel rested when we wake up and if you dont get enough hours of sleep per night you dont get enough of those restful stages of sleep

9017224 why does this generation ask for a miraculous sign i tell you the truth no sign will be given to it
9017225 teacher we want to see a miraculous sign from you
9017226 a wicked and adulterous generation asks for a miraculous sign but none will be given it except the sign of the prophet jonah
9017227 suppose one of you wants to build a tower will he not first sit down and estimate the cost to see if he has enough money to complete it for if he lays the foundation and is not able to finish it everyone who sees it will ridicule him philippians 3 13 14brothers i do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it but one thing i do forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead i press on toward the goal to win the prize for which god has called me heavenward in christ jesus it is wise to make plans check costs before hiring someone to help with marketing and be ready to finish before we start we must be willing to follow through on our time commitment as well as money when we choose to say yes
9017228 shes 44 years old is she ready to be president john mccain is 72 and has cancer im writing these words right as the news is breaking around 8 40 am rocky mountain time and the first question the yakkers are raising is what we call here the so called heartbeat away question she was a mayor of a town in alaska with a population of 8 000 just three years ago
9017229 easily the least experienced running mate in recent memory which is pretty scary given mccains age and his history of cancer
9017230 this cowgirl seems completely lost and desperate for approval on stage
9017231 fought oil companies and party bosses and do nothing bureaucrats
9017232 someone who has fought against corruption and the failed policies of the past someone who stopped government from wasting taxpayers money on things they dont want or need and put it back to the people

9017234 knows what its like to worry about mortgage payments and health care the cost of gasoline and groceries
9017235 the long odds to win a tough election on a message of reform and public integrity
9017236 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington but when you get to know her youre going to be as impressed as i am shes got the grit integrity good sense and fierce devotion to the common good and is exactly what we need in washington today
9017237 to serve as vice president beside such a man would be the privilege of a lifetime and its fitting that this trust has been given to me 88 years almost to the day after the women of america first gained the right to vote
9017238 i cant begin this great effort without honoring the achievements of geraldine ferraro in 1984 and of course sen hillary clinton who showed such determination and grace in her presidential campaign
9017239 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9017240 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9017241 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9017242 not to be a hypocrite but ever since ive been here ive wanted to be able to pound the football
9017243 and we havent yet so were going to find out because were going to pound it that will help everything get better it will help the play action pass it will get guys open in the intermediate routes and it will help the pass protection because people are going to have to worry about stopping the run first
9017244 i think eight nine 10 years ago that was very true nowadays you see so much movement on defense so much blitzing and so many different looks it gets a little harder to do that but you have to work at it and emphasize it thats a conscientious effort that we have made its a theme and challenge we have put in front of our kids
9017245 open it up lets try a quick strike and get some points on the board
9017246 well go across the field at the end of the game and shake their hand
9017247 there is no better feeling playing football as an offensive lineman than when you physically beat a team and they i dont want to say quit but they subconsciously quit
9017248 thats a really helpless feeling when people can just run the ball right at you
9017249 you turn on the tv and listen to any head coach in america especially nfl or major college its the same you gotta run the ball and you gotta stop the run it starts there and we have made an emphasis on doing it
9017250 if the game allows you to be real patient then you can be patient
9017251 if you get behind then sometimes you have to shift gears every game is a separate entity and you match up certain ways against certain teams and patience is based upon how the game is going
9017252 you have to do what is best suited for your team and your players and we feel we have a good corps of running backs that are very capable and i feel were bigger and stronger and more veteran thats our team and thats what were gearing ourselves to
9017253 brownie fema director michael brown youre doing a heck of a job
9017254 i think dave trembley has done a great job here he has done everything he could do to change the focus and direction of this organization
9017255 i dont think he ever gets outmanaged i think he has the respect of the players he also has a passion for the game itself that as a player you really appreciate hes into it every day hes not showing up here at 5oclock
9017256 if you could timewarp back to 1983 with a copy of
9017257 the album is so complex so riddled with stops starts breakdowns and solos that much like
9017258 what are the highlights almost every song on this album is at the very least interesting
9017259 so is it as good as the first four only time will tell probably not but at least it sounds like it belongs to the same back catalogue as those albums a metallica written the old way album through and through
9017260 hey think of it this way at least you wont have to go to work tomorrow
9017261 you dont even have an opinion youre only saying what glenn beck told you to say
9017262 no no you want to make me go crazy all over the place
9017263 no need for crazy just a little casual calm conversation
9017264 all this criticism of raikonnen reminds me of when filippo inzaghi was at juventus if he did not score in three matches everyone said he was in crisis
9017265 he is motivated and we must work hard so that he is in a position to make a quick start especially on the new circuits which i dont like and are doing harm to formula one

9017304 several american officials said the israeli exercise appeared to be an effort to develop the militarys capacity to carry out long range strikes and to demonstrate the seriousness with which israel views irans nuclear program
9017305 have openly voiced support for a pre emptive nuclear strike
9017306 a senior defense official told abc news there is an increasing likelihood that israel will carry out such an attack
9017307 public warnings by u s hawks close to cheneys office that either the israelis or the u s would attack iran between the november elections and the inaugural of a new president in january 2009
9017308 he said that guys like me were in what we call the reality based community which he defined as people who believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality
9017309 one oil speculator told me that oil would hit 200 a barrel within minutes
9017310 react fiercely and nobody can imagine what would be the reaction of iran
9017311 irans response to any military action will make the invaders regret their decision and action
9017312 the first bullet fired by america at iran will be followed by iran burning down its vital interests around the globe
9017313 a military strike in my opinion would be worse than anything possible
9017314 the possibility that war with the united states and israel was imminent
9017315 its always awkward to talk about hypotheticals in this case but i think that while iran cannot attack us directly militarily i think that their capacity to potentially close off the persian gulf to all exports of oil their potential to unleash a significant wave of terror both in the well in the middle east and in europe and even here in this country is very real their ability to get hezbollah to further destabilize lebanon i think is very real so i think that while their ability to retaliate against us in a conventional military way is quite limited they have the capacity to do all of the things and perhaps more that i just described
9017316 a democratic senator told me that late last year in an off the record lunch meeting secretary of defense gates met with the democratic caucus in the senate such meetings are held regularly gates warned of the consequences if the bush administration staged a preemptive strike on iran saying as the senator recalled well create generations of jihadists and our grandchildren will be battling our enemies here in america gatess comments stunned the democrats at the lunch
9017317 repeatedly made clear that he opposes an attack on iran whether by israel or his own forces and moreover favors dialogue with tehran without the normal white house nuclear preconditions
9017318 a u s attack on irans nuclear installations would create trouble that we arent equipped to handle easily not with ongoing wars in iraq and afghanistan adm mike mullen the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff drove that point home in a press conference last week at the pentagon

9017328 its unfortunate because its very reactive and it typically winds up costing you more if you do fix on fail it usually costs you more
9017329 you need to do a good analysis about whether this is acceptable risk

9017344 its really a shame and from the people we talk to staff and people alike it seems that everybodys kind of puzzled why its closing because it seems very popular
9017345 theres a tremendous amount of sadness as you can imagine this is a place that no one wants to end including our employees
9017346 it goes beyond just a great group of staff its a group of people whove invested everything they had to make this as realistic and special as possible

9017370 ho amato subito questo personaggio proprio per la sua intensit drammatica e in fondo un personaggio che somiglia ai tanti che ho interpreti e che in qualche modo mi appartengono con le loro ombre e le loro luci soprattutto con le loro imperfezioni appartengono a me ma non solo e daltra parte nellordine delle cose che in ogni buon film ci sia qualcosa che commuove e dia i brividi nella schiena poi a qualcuno di noi capita di provare quei brividi anche pi volte nella vita
9017371 ma il cinema deve comunque farti tremare deve affondare lo sguardo nelle zone grigie laddove non esiste il bianco e il nero il giusto e lingiusto ma solo il sentimento di ci che si sente come giusto o come sbagliato solo partendo da queste premesse si pu raccontare il comportamento umano che qualcosa che mi ha sempre affascinato osservare da vicino e da lontano dunque un film come questo per me perfetto perch riesce a miscelare molto energicamente comportamento umano e contingenze
9017372 io scelgo di raccontare in modo mai lineare perch la realt a non essere mai lineare ma sempre complicata intrecciata stratificata e perch non voglio mai pormi in una situazione rigida nei confronti dei miei personaggi non voglio mai giudicare al massimo tento di amarli e di capire qualcosa di ognuno di loro anche la scelta di aprire il film con il corpo nudo di charlize non casuale io credo che il corpo nudo comunichi tantissimo perch non esprime solo lesterno ma anche lanima nascosta cos con quella scena dapertura io ho voluto sottolineare la contraddittoriet del personaggio che mentre sembra una donna forte e senza vergogne in realt fragilissima contraddittoriet che poi ci di cui voglio parlare insieme alla follia di questa contemporaneit che vorrebbe cancellare la morte e che reprime il corpo continuamente e poi mi interessa capire come ognuno parla a suo modo

9017382 the 5 0 thing puts a lot more extra pressure on us as it would take us up to second in the world rankings
9017383 that is the kind of pressure we want pressure is a privilege and if we win 5 0 it takes us right up to the top it is something we have talked about and if we deliver we can win 5 0 the dressing room is very happy place
9017384 we are putting pressure on their batters and playing to our potential were hitting their good balls for four and doing a really good job on them

9017387 it has always been a dream to play for england as an individual you couldnt ask for more i played against south africa for the lions and although it was always going to be tough they knew i could bat

9017390 this would give us serious concerns and may well be a step too far we are not aware of any justification for the state to hold every uk citizens phone and internet records we have real doubts that such a measure can be justified or is proportionate or desirable we have warned before that we are sleepwalking into a surveillance society holding large collections of data is always risky the more data that is collected and stored the bigger the problem when the data is lost traded or stolen
9017391 given ministers appalling record at maintaining the integrity of databases holding peoples sensitive data this could well be more of a threat to our security than a support

9017405 capitalism is the astounding belief that the most wickedest of men will do the most wickedest of things for the greatest good of everyone
9017406 i confess that i am not charmed with the ideal of life held out by those who think that the normal state of human beings is that of struggling to get on that the trampling crushing elbowing and treading on each others heels which form the existing type of social life are the most desirable lot of human beings
9017407 for us it all started on the mound and shawn tolleson gave us a really good performance
9017408 tolleson had very good command kept his fastball down and didnt make very many mistakes at all he gave up a two strike hit and followed it up with a walk or a hit batter and they were able to create some offense there and get a couple of runs on the board he pitched really well and that was as important for us as anything
9017409 the guys just did a great job at the plate
9017410 nebraska threw a bunch of really good arms at us and while we didnt get a ton of hits youre not usually going to get a ton of hits against those kinds of arms we did get some free bases and we got some timely hits
9017411 the big hit in the game was when they chose to take a gamble and play the infield in with the bases loaded and thats a gamble shavers hansen bounding ball gets over the first baseman and cleared the bases and then they had to play again after that and adam hornung got one to go through on the right side those two balls werent well struck they were just situations where we put the ball in play and got the benefit out of it
9017412 we really wanted to go up there and be aggressive and to be ready to jump on that first pitch fastball if they were throwing it
9017413 the lefty dan jennings that threw today we saw him in relief during the big 12 games that we had during the year and he had a pretty good slider so being able to attack his fastball was important for us we all went out there with a do or die attitude and we got it done
9017414 it looked like a pretty confident pretty mature group of guys
9017415 they were back in the game theyve still got outs to play with that was as big as anything we got off to a good start they responded and then we responded we didnt shut it down we played the game all the way from start to finish
9017416 early in the game i was able to get good command of my pitches
9017417 i was getting my fastball down in the zone they were hitting a lot of ground balls and infield pop ups later in the game i struggled a bit with control but luckily i was able to get a few outs
9017418 after our last game at texas tech we knew that we had to come out and bring our a game to win this thing and do what we want to do
9017419 this is a new start for us we need to play every game like we did today this was the a team that we brought today and most of the year we really havent brought that everyone knows now what we are expected to do so we just need to bring that game out again on friday
9017420 we have to win or we are not going to play anymore we have been telling each other that for the last three weeks but it hasnt really clicked i dont really know what the problems have been but today on the field you could tell it was a different team we drew walks we situational hit we pitched well and there were no flaws in the game today so that is what we need to do on friday
9017421 im sure it will be the same as it was last night it is intense
9017422 we are gunning for everybody because we know we can win we think we can win we are happy that we won but we know that we have another good to team to face and another good team after that we have to take it one game at a time one pitch at a time it is pretty intense because we need to play our best ball and we know it
9017423 i see we are getting nowhere i try to save my energy and efforts for people who are actually interested
9017424 peter was magnificent last season when they were missing while harrison and hooper have brought valuable leadership skills to the squad we will need those qualities for the first couple of months
9017425 the most marketable heavyweight out there simply because of his freakish size
9017426 there is no one in the heavyweight division who can beat niko if he continues to improve
9017427 we want a match with wladimir klitschko this would be a huge fight in germany
9017428 i am here in germany to get the belt back i am in great shape and i will show it when we get in the ring
9017429 it would take too long to describe all the things i have changed in my game
9017430 i have prepared very hard and very long i am in very good shape i want to win
9017431 they see this season as the one to throw their kitchen sink at us we are aware of that leeds sees itself as the 13th premiership club and we must go up this season
9017432 the opportunity at leeds was the right one for me
9017433 i went back to my room after the race and even my room mate jo who ive known for years said have you changed everyone expected that winning would make me a different person so they treated me differently
9017434 there was the parade through my home town from hildenborough to tonbridge i said to my mum that it would be really embarrassing if no one turned up but there were 80 000 people
9017435 mum said i couldnt go because i was tired and didnt have anything to wear
9017436 mum just couldnt believe it she still cant she says things like but youre just you just kelly this is mad it is but its been fun
9017437 i had to throw myself into something i love challenges
9017438 i knew if i could get hold of girls who had talent i could offer them help and inspiration im not saying that my training camps will create olympic champions but i can make sure all the girls who come on them know how to be the best they can be
9017439 i feel i want to teach them about winning what it takes why some people win and some dont
9017440 also it was as if it was my time after the 20 years of hard work id gone through i remember being in the car before leaving for the olympic training camp in athens i was nervous and my friend was fiddling with the radio trying to find a british station to break the tense atmosphere
9017441 he could see i was nervous so he started chatting what sort of music do you like he asked tina turners
9017442 he carried on twiddling then just as we got to the training ground tina turners voice belted out simply the best the athletics track was in front of me my song was playing i had goose bumps all over me it was a sign it was my turn i really believed id win and thats a powerful feeling to have
9017443 everyone was looking at me i was leaping around almost crying with joy shouting im ready its my turn i do want the girls to know that its not easy though its hard to be the best in the world mentally as well as physically
9017444 i saw a pair of scissors on the shelf i picked them up and started to cut my left arm with one of the blades i made one cut for every day that i had been injured i felt i was punishing myself but at the same time i felt a sense of release that drove me to do it again
9017445 youve got to keep going the only way to win is to fight your way through and keep going then for some of us the dream comes true
9017446 when i was playing i dealt with many players if i felt they werent pulling their weight
9017447 that sort of conflict has never been a problem to me i challenged people im comfortable with that
9017448 i thought everyone should be like me and theyre not but i have to let people be themselves
9017449 maybe i didnt do that as a player and was maybe too intense maybe that was the downside of me before i finished playing
9017450 in fact i havent slept a wink for nine months
9017451 there has obviously been a lot of speculation about me but the derby fans have been great ill never stop showing my appreciation
9017452 to this day i still believe in what i said
9017453 i didnt say it just to get a shocked reaction off people maybe i shouldnt have said it publicly but i still believed it it was my way of pushing something aside clearing it from my mind and knowing that i was going to be better than that next time
9017454 the physios here know im quite strong character wise so they let me get on with my work
9017455 ive been brought up believing that no ones going to give you anything and it was the same with my injury no one was going to do my rehab for me i had to do it myself
9017456 a lot of lads earning good money at a young age will just go out and buy everything with me the only thing i did buy when i signed my first good contract at west brom was a porsche cayenne i didnt go out and buy a 20 grand watch or anything the rest went in the bank
9017457 thats what im like its the way ive been brought up i couldnt look my mum and dad in the eye having just paid a hundred quid for a plain white t shirt when i could have given the money to them
9017458 some people go out and buy bentleys but id never get a car like that until ive played at least 400 premier league games it would be ridiculous for me to be pulling up in a bentley next to someone like john carew whos achieved so much in his career and who might have a more modest car
9017459 it would have been a massive blow if gareth had left
9017460 you cant hide from that but weve managed to keep him and also improved the squad i think we can do as well or better than last year
9017461 me i want to play for england i want to push on and do as much as i can by doing well against players like torres thats the only way youre going to get noticed

9017464 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states created this conflict deliberately to create tension and help one of the candidates in the u s presidential campaign
9017465 im surprised that what im telling you surprises you its all on the surface actually
9017466 something may have happened with toronto that has brought jay back into play

9017468 de golfballetjes zijn de belangrijke dingen in het leven je familie je kinderen je geloof je gezondheid en je favoriete bezigheden dingen die ervoor zorgen dat als er niets meer op de wereld was dan deze dingen je leven toch gevuld zou zijn

9017472 there is sound scientific evidence that using a cellphone while driving can be extremely dangerous
9017473 it greatly increases your chance of a serious road crash resulting in a hospital stay the consequences of serious collisions can last a lifetime as physicians we see truly tragic evidence of this every day in our practices
9017474 this is an important first step toward what we hope will be a full ban in the future
9017475 there are no potentially pathogenic bacteria tested that this nano particulate engineered silver solution has not killed
9017476 in the industries i work in if you have something that critical you generally build more redundancy
9017477 if this faa outage happened at a power plant id be telling them to open up their checkbook and expect to be fined
9017478 dont happen on a mass scale or a regular basis
9017479 we are making sure people are getting from one place to another
9017480 we should see significant improvements by the end of september which should prevent the type of problem we had on tuesday
9017481 its common you see it in retail too its the whole dont fix it if it aint broke thing
9017482 its unfortunate because its very reactive and it typically winds up costing you more if you do fix on fail it usually costs you more
9017483 you need to do a good analysis about whether this is acceptable risk
9017484 one of the things the government is betting on is the fact that if theres a failure its not a safety issue
9017485 from time to time we are going to have a glitch but its a tradeoff
9017486 would i like to see more modern equipment in the system sure but most folks would not want to see their taxes tripled to pay for new technology every two years
9017487 that is so wrong and puts the public and the workers at such risk it can not happen again
9017488 but my question to the minister is does it make more sense to have five dangerous people out on the street right now or would we have been better off to have some people brought in and do the proper searching
9017489 we hope its not a whitewash and just a coverup of what the real concerns of the staff out there at the corrections centre
9017490 obviously if information comes in to their intelligence that there could be an escape there is an obligation quite frankly on behalf of management to institute some procedures to ensure that doesnt happen
9017491 its not a technical recession but still the components are very weak
9017492 consumer spending is slowing residential investment was negative business investment was negative the only thing keeping growth positive was government spending and inventories
9017493 as expected the pace of economic activity remains slow as a result of the u s slowdown and its impact on our export sector
9017494 canada is not an island this is a global phenomenon the global economy overall is slowing
9017495 canada is better positioned than most to weather this period of global economic uncertainty
9017496 theres a pattern here every time canada is governed by a conservative government the economy stalls jobs are lost and deficits loom
9017497 stephen harper and jim flaherty continue to talk about how good the fundamentals are in canada in spite of the fact that by any economic definition canada is slumping even statistics canada admits that the struggling u s economy is doing better than canadas
9017498 while final domestic demand continued to outpace gdp growing 0 5 in the quarter foreign demand for canadian goods and services registered its fourth consecutive quarterly decline
9017499 todays report confirmed that the economy grew at a mild pace in the second quarter marking an improvement over the first quarter but still indicating limited momentum in the pace of activity
9017500 the slump in employment in july moderating housing market activity and indications that us economy may have already hit this years high water mark in terms of the pace of growth in the second quarter will leave the bank of canada with concerns about the downside risk to their projection that the economy will grow at about a 1 5 pace over the second half of this year
9017501 the second half of the year is expected to remain soft as the follow through from weakness in the u s impacts canadian markets as such we expect rates to remain steady at 3 on wednesday when they meet next

9017504 the promise to top up arts funding looks good on paper and scores some political points but doesnt have any foundation in reality
9017505 the federal conservative government has increased funding to the arts in the past year from 3 2 billion to 3 4 billion
9017506 we believe that all government programs need to be reviewed to ensure that the public is being well served and these programs were not producing the results that canadians expect from their hard earned tax dollars
9017507 with a health care crisis in the province ongoing issues at memorial university national media attention this week about unsafe drinking water in rural newfoundland and labrador and his testimony at the cameron inquiry into botched cancer tests starting to draw closer ramping up the abc campaign helps the premier try to distract from these challenging issues at home
9017508 in the past couple of weeks the public has been made aware of the elimination of at least a dozen federal arts programs and there may be more bad news to come
9017509 in this province many of our artists accessed these programs particularly those which enabled them to bring the arts and culture of newfoundland and labrador to national and international audiences
9017510 amounts to another slap in the face to the people of this province and indeed the entire country

9017512 jesus what should i tell the people that want to vote for obama
9017513 im disturbed with obama because he is in cahoots with reverend wright and reverend wright is in cahoots with the nation of islam and louis farrakhan id prefer to have good decent christian in office as president instead of a closet muslim like obama
9017514 you dont have to change everything in english football because of a third goal scored by croatia he said
9017515 you have great players in england you have a good team but you have to prepare to win
9017516 but the euros were a fabulous success because of the atmosphere in the stadiums and the cities and because teams took a positive approach
9017517 i am president of uefa i am neutral but it was very gratifying for me to see spain win spain had small skilful players in midfield xavi fabregas iniesta etc and played the best football fantastic attacking football it reminded me of the football we watched growing up turkey were also positive they kept attacking they never gave up germany performed well also
9017518 there were three games in geneva three in klagenfurt and then it is over in a week because there are only 31 games he explained
9017519 that is not good for the development of the city or financially we could increase to 24 teams without reducing the technical quality it is not fair on the 16 to 24 who did not qualify like england it is a big football festival it would last three more days
9017520 with my background as a footballer i have the power to say these things with my job as president i have the power to do these things but im only interested in doing the right thing for football
9017521 one moment was very important when i stopped being coach of the french national team in 1992 i became president of the organising committee for the 1998 world cup
9017522 i signed a contract to do that and i then refused to sign a contract to become coach of real madrid and because of that i met people like blatter who asked me to help him get elected for the presidency in 1998 i became his adviser and because of that i end up as president of uefa
9017523 my relations with sepp blatter bask in sunshine smiled platini
9017524 i am going to his village for a party soon
9017525 we want all clubs in european competition to be clean we put cska moscow and steaua bucharest out because they dont respect things they dont have the money but they buy the players you cant have that
9017526 in germany and france it debt is forbidden but it is allowed in england
9017527 the english will not predominate france italy and spain all have good teams i am not at all sure that it will be two english teams in the final again
9017528 it was in a game for nancy against nantes in 1975 now i can admit it
9017529 the referee didnt see it i was happy to do it on that occasion if we could win the match because i cheated everyone was happy
9017530 what the referee cant see the supplementary referees can see we wont have diving around it will also mean less running for the central referees who can referee until they are 50 we will test it at the uefa youth championships

9017542 consumers are certainly worried about the job and housing markets but lower have given them some tangible relief and we are seeing that relief expressed in the various consumer confidence figures
9017543 with the tax refund effect on spending now more or less over we think the worst is yet to come for consumers
9017544 i like that store because even though at first it seems very expensive we always seem to find unique things to buy that are very reasonable
9017545 its a true testament to destino that i tried not only a wide variety of food during dinner there recently but some raw food to boot
9017546 im really sorry i know it is a problem here one guy actually carried a guy out of the locker room and threw him into the managers office to kick him out
9017547 i was so dreading bike shopping because so many used bike shops in the bay area have gotten bad reviews or mediocre reviews
9017548 they fixed my car when tahoe snow and i made it go boom gently
9017549 obviously investor sentiment toward the u s equity market has been abysmal until recent weeks when theres been a shift to u s equities
9017550 valuations are pretty beaten down but the u s economy is likely to recover quicker than europe the u s seems like a pretty good bet right now
9017551 there are more outflows year to date than any previous year since we started tracking equity fund flows in 2000
9017552 weve been looking for the right location in the troy area for about six years

9017563 let me start by saying that i cannot pull off any clothing skunfunk offers simply due to the fact that they do not have my size and its

9017566 corporate taxes are most harmful for growth followed by personal income taxes and then consumption taxes
9017567 its time for big corporations to pay their fair share
9017568 i was like are you going out like that he was in his pyjamas and i was waiting to see if he was going to change he grabs a scarf and puts it around his head
9017569 then he grabs the kids and puts a scarf around their heads so i grab a scarf and put it around my head and off we go
9017570 a historic moment for women and for the republican party as well as a choice guaranteed to energize values voters this is a grand slam home run for john mccain
9017571 i believe we now have the most pro life ticket in history running on the
9017572 gov palins credentials as a leader include taking on political corruption and reducing spending but her promises of change were not just words they became actions and her concern for country has been passed down to her five children her oldest son track joined the army last year on the sixth anniversary of the september 11th attacks and is serving his country
9017573 all conservatives should be proud to support this historic ticket of proven reformers with records of self sacrifice for their country and their families
9017574 many clinicians lack knowledge about how to identify smokers quickly and easily which treatments are effective how such treatments can be delivered and the relative effectiveness of different treatments
9017575 indiana data show that even brief interventions by our doctors dentists nurses and assistants can increase the number of hoosiers who try to quit
9017576 these new guidelines provide a blueprint for clinicians and health care systems describing how smokers can access effective treatments how clinicians can provide such treatments quickly and effectively and how health care systems can support both smokers and clinicians in smoking cessation efforts were pleased to award a grant to clarian health to begin implementing these practices
9017577 nicotine addiction often requires repeated intervention and multiple attempts to quit which is why support from health care providers is essential
9017578 identifying smokers and providing them with brief advice and help with quitting in clinical practice are both very effective and cost effective
9017579 tobacco cessation is among the top three highest priority and cost effective preventive services as a healthcare professional i found this to be true very early in my practice as a respiratory therapist while we are asking about smoking status national benchmarks show there is much room for improvement in delivering cessation assistance the community intervention trial for smoking cessation commit showed that 75 percent of people were being asked about use 49 percent advised to quit and only 25 percent being offered assistance like medications when more than 60 percent of our smokers want to quit we as health professionals need to be providing the means to assist them it has become clear over the last decade that providing smoking cessation counseling may be similar to that of annual colon cancer screening annual flu vaccinations mammograms and cholesterol screening this is why the clarian tobacco control center has launched an effort to assist healthcare providers in integrating evidence based components that will allow them to provide brief cessation intervention
9017580 the choice of governor sarah palin as the presumptive gop vice presidential nominee comes on the heels of a week which saw the crafting of the most conservative pro life and pro family platform in republican party history the platform was articulated with the dedicated efforts of many conservative women standing on the shoulders of long time conservative leaders such as phyllis schlafly the gop platform is a solidly pro woman document i salute the efforts of delegates such as mary summa from north carolina sandy mcdade from louisiana and bunny chambers from oklahoma who stood up for women everywhere in creating this platform governor sarah palin is a testament to the hardworking women across the nation who sacrifice for their families and their country on a daily basis i am elated with senator mccains choice and applaud his continued commitment to creating a pro woman pro life pro family administration

9017845 for instance suppose a prisoner finds out another prisoner has money or other assets they might find themselves coerced into a marriage with a more powerful inmate who might try to lay claim to half their assets
9017846 the law requires they treat people the same so thats a good principle to have in mind when they are drafting regulations

9017885 a significant part of palins base of support lies among social and christian conservatives her positions on social issues emerged slowly during the campaign on abortion should be banned for anything other than saving the life of the mother stem cell research opposed physician assisted suicide opposed creationism should be discussed in schools state health benefits for same sex partners opposed and supports a constitutional amendment to bar them
9017886 teach both you know dont be afraid of information healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both and you know i say this too as the daughter of a science teacher growing up with being so privileged and blessed to be given a lot of information on on both sides of the subject creationism and evolution its been a healthy foundation for me but dont be afraid of information and let kids debate both sides
9017887 i am pleased to see senator obama acknowledge the huge potential alaskas natural gas reserves represent in terms of clean energy and sound jobs
9017888 the steps taken by the alaska state legislature this past week demonstrate that we are ready willing and able to supply the energy our nation needs
9017889 over the next five years we should also lease more of the national petroleum reserve in alaska for oil and gas production and we should also tap more of our substantial natural gas reserves and work with the canadian government to finally build the alaska natural gas pipeline delivering clean natural gas and creating good jobs in the process
9017890 we in alaska feel that crunch and are taking steps to address it right here at home
9017891 this is a tool that must be on the table to buy us time until our long term energy plans can be put into place we have already enjoyed the support of alaska senator ted stevens and it is gratifying to see senator obama get on board
9017892 windfall profits taxes alone prevent additional investment in domestic production without new supplies from american reserves our dependency and addiction to foreign sources of oil will continue
9017893 yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
9017894 magical man is shaping the fate of our world in addition god is a fictional character
9017895 but now i am confused because if i am to believe in evolution why would nature create organisms who would never reproduce
9017896 we were continually noticing that clients buying internet leads and having them directly fed into icosales were experiencing much higher conversion ratios
9017897 we wanted to bring this same experience to our clients doing their own pay per click ppc and search marketing campaigns
9017898 we have completely freed sales agents in industries like automobile sales and real estate from their computers
9017899 we have auto dealers on their lots and real estate agents in front of homes saying mrs jones i just got your web inquiry and i have the car or home you wanted right in front of me
9017900 loyalty to petrified opinion never broke a chain or freed a human soul
9017901 this man wishes to be accorded the same privilege as a sponge he wishes to think
9017902 i become fearful when i see people substituting fear for reason
9017903 i want you to grab life by its little bunny ears and get in its face
9017904 there are bad laws and cruel laws and the people who enforce them are both bad and cruel
9017905 with the first link the chain is forged the first speech censored the first thought forbidden the first freedom denied chains us all irrevocably
9017906 but the limit of tolerance for these human foibles is obtained when the proponent of a questionable scientific doctrine endeavors to maintain it against all possible odds by misrepresentation misinformation and suppression of contradictory data and by insinuating unfairness in opponents of his views
9017907 man stands alone in the universe a unique product of a long unconcious impersonal material process with unique understanding and potentialities these he owes to no one but himself and it is to himself that he is responsible he is not the creature of uncontrollable and undeterminable forces but his own master he can and must decide and manage his own destiny
9017908 i dont think there should be a prohibition against debate if it comes up in class it doesnt have to be part of the curriculum
9017909 i wont have religion as a litmus test or anybodys personal opinion on evolution or creationism
9017910 its ok to let kids know that there are theories out there
9017911 my dad did talk a lot about his theories of evolution
9017912 he would show us fossils and say how old do you think these are
9017913 im not going to pretend i know how all this came to be
9017914 foxnews source releases information that governor sarah palin is mccains vp pick
9017915 her scandal is nothing in comparison to obamas relationships with racist rev wright and terrorist bill ayers
9017916 many hillary supporters supported her solely because she was a woman and very few listed hillarys pro abortion position as the primary reason for her support hillary has waffled on that position throughout her career as for experience experience as a mayor and governor trumps that of a jr senator whos never actually there her scandal is nothing in comparison to obamas relationships with racist rev wright and terrorist bill ayers obama is rich most people in the us view being rich as a measure of success only dolts that are miserable failures themselves hold it against someone biden is a complete non factor a pro abortion catholic get real hes a joke and a terrible choice thats why he was a non factor when he was a candidate to begin with
9017917 all one poster merely suggested is the acknowledgment that many people believe that there is a god responsible for creation
9017918 darwin knew that accepting his theory required believing in philosophical materialism the conviction that matter is the stuff of all existence and that all mental and spiritual phenomena are its by products darwinian evolution was not only purposeless but also heartless a process in which the rigors of nature ruthlessly eliminate the unfit suddenly humanity was reduced to just one more species in a world that cared nothing for us the great human mind was no more than a mass of evolving neurons worst of all there was no divine plan to guide us
9017919 usb thumbdrives or flash drives are a non obvious but easy way to spread malware
9017920 his answer the computer was probably infected with some type of malicious software
9017921 by default autoplay is disabled on removable drives such as the floppy disk drive but not the cd rom drive and on network drives if you enable this policy you can also disable autoplay on cd rom drives or disable autoplay on all drives
9017922 in the industries i work in if you have something that critical you generally build more redundancy
9017923 if this faa outage happened at a power plant id be telling them to open up their checkbook and expect to be fined

9017925 we are making sure people are getting from one place to another
9017926 we should see significant improvements by the end of september which should prevent the type of problem we had on tuesday
9017927 its common you see it in retail too its the whole dont fix it if it aint broke thing
9017928 its unfortunate because its very reactive and it typically winds up costing you more if you do fix on fail it usually costs you more
9017929 you need to do a good analysis about whether this is acceptable risk
9017930 one of the things the government is betting on is the fact that if theres a failure its not a safety issue
9017931 from time to time we are going to have a glitch but its a tradeoff
9017932 would i like to see more modern equipment in the system sure but most folks would not want to see their taxes tripled to pay for new technology every two years
9017933 people like this and i have nothing against it so i should like it too
9017934 we create value for our customers so they will come back again and again

9017944 im not against people trying to make living i have a compassion for those folks but at the same time the taxpayers of mississippi shouldnt be subsidizing a plant that wont even hire their own workers
9017945 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
9017946 the union uses the tactic of saying immigration was coming and the members of the union would not be taken
9017947 i need a job and got kids i heard that they need some help now
9017948 all them mexicans got fired because they didnt have a pass all these businesses have been taking americans jobs
9017949 that doesnt justify but it certainly explains why they might be hiring individuals who show up and say ill work for you
9017950 the bible is a particular kind of literature it was not written to satisfy human curiosity or to evoke religious speculation on heavenly mysteries but it is a call for faithful response during ones whole life
9017951 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
9017952 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
9017953 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
9017954 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
9017955 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
9017956 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
9017957 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
9017958 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
9017959 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
9017960 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
9017961 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
9017962 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
9017963 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
9017964 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
9017965 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
9017966 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

9017975 nos sorprendi encontrar que antes de que una mosca vuele en respuesta a la amenaza de un depredador o un matamoscas sta planea la direcci n de su salto haciendo una serie de complejos movimientos
9017976 el objetivo de estos movimientos para planear la hu da dice el profesor dickinson logran posicionar cuidadosamente el cuerpo del insecto para que las patas queden situadas en la mejor posici n para escapar en direcci n opuesta de la inminente amenaza
9017977 estos movimientos son muy r pidos toman unos 200 milisegundos
9017978 esto ilustra la rapidez con la que el cerebro de la mosca puede procesar la informaci n sensorial y convertirla en una respuesta motora apropiada
9017979 esto quiere decir que la mosca debe integrar la informaci n visual de sus ojos con la informaci n mecanosensorial de sus piernas

9018007 the cathode material has been a little more difficult but we have several different candidates and we have made full working batteries
9018008 once you do the genetic engineering with the viruses themselves you pour in the solution and they grow the right combination of these materials on them
9018009 we definitely dont have full batteries on those fiber architectures weve only worked on single electrodes so far but the idea is to try to make these fiber batteries that could be integrated into textiles and woven into lots of different shapes
9018010 what were working on is not thinking about a particular device application but trying to improve the quality of the anode and cathode materials using biology just to make a higher quality material for energy density
9018011 we havent ruled out cars thats a lot of amplification but right now the thing is trying to make the best material possible and if we get a really great material then we have to think about how do you scale it
9018012 john mccain hit it out of the park with his selection of governor palin
9018013 this is a bold fresh and exciting choice that clearly demonstrates that republicans arent reading from a script but giving the nation a real choice between an inexperienced senator running with a washington insider versus a true independent minded maverick american hero running with a successful and dynamic female executive a conservative and a reformer who couldnt be further from washington as usual
9018014 sarah palin has more executive experience than obama and biden combined
9018015 this is exactly the kind of reform and real change we need in washington
9018016 whatever else history may say about me when im gone i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way

9018019 when you give players creative control you have to expect theyre going to do the unexpected some of its really good for what they were shooting for its amazingly explicit especially when those creations are animated we just have to make sure those people arent messing up the experience for others
9018020 there are still things we want to do with the african setting and i think its safe to say well continue to explore it that said we might find something new and compelling about the antarctic setting that wants us to make the next game there but honestly were still at the preliminary stages
9018021 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have

9018029 airline travel is airline travel its been bad for a long time
9018030 i suspect prices will go up fewer people will travel and if youre willing to pay the price it will be fine
9018031 despite this sluggish u s economy the general demand picture is better than it was post 9 11
9018032 in addition you have this consistent response across the board of airlines raising fares and adding fees
9018033 if somebody sees a good fare they should grab it
9018034 the reality is and i dont want to diminish this the industry is going to have to cover its costs
9018035 if there are fewer flights that wont bother me but if flights are really expensive i just wont go or ill go by myself instead of bringing my son and husband
9018036 and then youre good to go you dont have to worry about that
9018037 a very very small number of people would have purchased tickets for travel in september or thereafter before the flights were taken out of the fall schedule in may and june of this year
9018038 i think if oil prices continue to go down you will hear calls for relaxation of fuel surcharges but that doesnt mean they wont hike base airfares
9018039 i dont think most people in every aspect of their trip will notice a difference
9018040 if there is a silver lining it may be that as a result of fewer overall operations they may see better on time performance

9018063 membuat suatu rekomendasi agar kesalahpahaman pada masa lalu tidak terulang
9018064 sama seperti ketika penyanyi inul diberitakan akan ke malaysia dan masyarakat malaysia memberikan tanggapan buruk dengan mengatakan bahwa apa yang dilakukan inul adalah budaya indonesia padahal itu salah itu bukan budaya indonesia

9018067 he made the tackle on the interception i thought that was encouraging not the interception the tackle
9018068 im sure people are going to have problems with the art in this comic i know they are because ive read the complaints about the last issue but i love what travel foremans doing here his new style which i termed last month as a kind of lenil yu meets early jae lee mash up is vibrant and expressive and makes this comic look like nothing else on the shelf right now while david ajas work on earlier issues added grace and beauty to the kung fu follies foreman turns this book into a stylish midnite movie full of exaggerated kicks and craggy figures its a perfect match for duane swierczynskis script which traffics in mysticism and destiny but largely concerns itself with gritty personal violence this story may be about a magical creature that kills iron fists but it feels like a brutal knife fight in the back alleys
9018069 almarhum meninggal dunia dalam usia 72 tahun karena sakit jantung yang telah diderita cukup lama dan telah beberapa kali menjalani operasi di rumah sakit

9018074 theres a real pressure out there on growers that goes beyond what the science justifies
9018075 without going through a review process is something companies have the right to do but it would be better if theyd go through the program
9018076 if you remove it they will go into the field
9018077 we have two extraordinary resources in this area wildlife and our agricultural community

9018082 mccain has chosen to balance his ticket with a principled conservative gov palins life story is one of sticking to principle she is living proof that a person can take on the corrupt political establishment including corrupt leaders in her own party and achieve great things
9018083 theres an old expression in politics go along to get along not this time the selection of sarah palin is one big kick in the pants to the corrupt establishment in both parties
9018084 police are dragging their feet in opening a case against police officers in whose bus hippo meat and an elephant foot were found at the mururani veterinary checkpoint in kavango last week
9018085 a herd of 60 elephants entered bankura district last night according to senior forest officials on tuesday morning the herd was sighted at the bankadaha range in the jungles under the panchet soil conservation division in bishnupur the herd comprising four tuskers is the first herd to enter bankura this monsoon at asthasole the herd entered agricultural land and destroyed a significant amount of standing crop the forest division however doesnt have any plan to drive the elephants out of bankura
9018086 rising elephant numbers in a protected forest park in ghana are angering farmers whose crops are being raided in an unwanted side effect of a plan to slow deforestation
9018087 new orleans and the moon have always seemed to me to have an understanding between them an intimacy of sisters grown old together no longer needing more than a speechless look to communicate their feelings to each other this lunar atmosphere of the city draws me back whenever a time of recession is called for each time i have felt some rather profound psychic wound a loss or a failure i have returned to new orleans at such periods i would seem to belong there and no place else in the country
9018088 its always been a special scene where you could find some space where you could expatriate without having to go to paris and if youre marginal if you know an exile from your own culture this is a place where you can find some room to find to define who you are
9018089 new orleans offered homes to creative people and troubled people and people who didnt fit where they were so they came here to try to find some kind of acceptance and some kind of more than acceptance happiness you know you can find acceptance but new orleans gave you acceptance and happiness it let you dance with people like you
9018090 this year it is actually worse i have been here 54 years and i have never seen the water so low the situation so bad
9018091 i dont think the outside world realises just how dangerous the situation is not just for israel but for the whole region
9018092 there is a very real danger that this could lead to over salination the lower red line indicates the level at which the sustainability of the lake is threatened we are certainly very alarmed by the authorities willingness to go to the black line this development could well be irreversible
9018093 our cousins i say that because the bible says we are cousins have been drilling in areas they should not and this is diverting the water this is the politics of the middle east
9018094 they should be setting up manydesalination plants to get water from other sources theyre using israeli expertise in these matters all over the world but this is the one country which isnt using it enough i dont think it would be possible to deprive the farmers of their water so what is needed is alternative sources its that simple
9018095 quite big cracks are now appearing on the walls of our home that is due to the heat caused by the drought this is the hottest i can remember we desperately need some rain pretty soon maybe this is global warming
9018096 but the pumping out of the water doesnt help my husband was a fisherman and he has seen how the water has gone over the years and with it the fishes
9018097 we used to say even a few years ago that one place where you couldnt go wrong fishing was kinneret hebrew name for the sea of galilee but now it is getting very very hard because the stocks are so low many fishermen fear for their livelihood and so do i but it seems no one really cares about us
9018098 of course many of the disciples of jesus were fishermen at galilee if you recall he said he would make them fishers of men well that wouldnt be possible now there are hardly any fish left around here
9018099 fighter jets struck the militants hideouts in peochar killing 22
9018100 their command and communications structure has also been destroyed this was their key area where they had set up ammunition depots which were also demolished
9018101 this strike was carried out after intelligence that top taliban cleric mullah fazlullah was hiding there
9018102 the company informed the airport of the possibility of replacing the aircraft but eventually decided to stick with the aircraft
9018103 there is some kind of engagement to have some understanding of where we are because its not clear whether the talks have collapsed or are still on
9018104 the mediator has to help us appreciate where we are in terms of locating a way forward
9018105 we are trying with mbeki to get zanu pf to be flexible because there has not been any indication of movement of flexibility on the part of zanu pf
9018106 just with the south african mediators there is no zanu pf
9018107 we hope the talks can lead to the finalisation of the political and outstanding matters so that we can start with a normalisation of the political economic and humanitarian situation in zimbabwe
9018108 unless there is a political solution we dont have the necessary framework to deal with the economic recovery package for zimbabwe and the humanitarian crisis
9018109 it will be determined by the progress made they will continue until all parties feel they have covered sufficient ground
9018110 i will not quit at this moment i will not declare emergency rule i will wait and see tomorrow
9018111 police will still adhere to my earlier order they merely went to post a court order not to clear protesters
9018112 there will be no coup because a coup will not be able to solve the problems
9018113 i am confident that police are able to oversee the situation
9018114 there are now up to 3 000 police deployed outside government house
9018115 i am convinced that the military will not forcibly crack down on us
9018116 pad must go ahead and intensify the protest we think that more unions will join us and it will lead to more airport closures
9018117 well begin with a reign of terror a few murders here and there murders of great men murders of little men just to show we make no distinction
9018118 this is one emergency that we cant drill our way out of
9018119 no fair we didnt know we could pick people from outside the united states
9018120 hello back up girl here what seems to be the trouble

9018122 it is and its making me cranky but theres no time for that now this is an emergency miss management has been taking over marketing campaigns all over town
9018123 it seems she encouraged one of burghtowns major advertisers to launch a billboard marketing campaign that is definitely not rated for general audiences and the billboards are offending people all over the city
9018124 my mommy wont let the deputy mayor show them to me but i hear theyre really bad thats why we called you
9018125 because you know the billboard people arent answering their phones
9018126 and i called the marketing company who designed the ads but they all really kinda dont feel like taking the ads down right now
9018127 and we all know you dont actually have a family or gosh even a
9018128 hahaha i have changed all of the citys billboards to a campaign for my client that is so racy so over the top so mind numbingly stupid and so fingernails on chalkboard offensive even girls gone wild gary glitter life long porn stars and courtney love will be calling in to complain about it
9018129 by the time i am done with this city everyone in burghtown will have my clients messaging burned indelibly in their minds forever hahahahaha
9018130 back up girl you but i thought a monk marathon was on tonight
9018131 the continual battle against tasteless marketing ideas never stops miss management anyway monk would want it this way im going to clean up this town
9018132 youll never stop me back up girl i have my hand in businesses all over burghtown
9018133 wherever you find catch phrases that dont make any sense
9018134 or ads selling jeans without a single pair of jeans in the picture
9018135 wherever you find typos on banner ads or badly mixed metaphors
9018136 or multiple copies of the same flier stuffed in your mailbox
9018137 i am there you cant get rid of me back up girl i am all around you
9018138 how the client wanted something that would grab the attention and ive given it to them
9018139 ill tell you how through something thats even more powerful than your cheap publicity tactics miss management good old fashioned quality writing
9018140 you might have won this one but i wont be down for long and just you wait
9018141 the presidential elections are coming up and the candidates need a fine ad woman with an aesthetic just like mine so why am i waiting around this hick town im off to dc
9018142 i thought the pitch to manny was a good one i just tip my cap to him i just moved on
9018143 i attacked the strike zone a little more i wasnt nibbling at the corners i was down in the zone i was confident in my stuff i trusted my fastball a little more today thats what ive been doing all year and i need to get back to that
9018144 without such a channel for contacts we will have difficulties trying to bring our points of view to each others attention
9018145 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
9018146 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
9018147 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency

9018161 commercial production at yk and the link to the new varandey transportation corridor will intensify the development of resources in the timan pechora oil and gas bearing province which will certainly contribute to increased oil production in russia the development of the yk field is a graphic example of the mutually rewarding cooperation between lukoil and its strategic partner conocophillips
9018162 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
9018163 i watched his obamas speech ast night in a restaurant they even turned up the volume so everyone could hear most everyone was watching with big eyes cheering and smiling it was awesome it reminded me of good hopeful and inspiring times in american history i would read about in history books but never experienced myself and honestly never thought i would
9018164 sen mccain made an outstanding pick from the choices that were on the table
9018165 gov sarah palin is an outspoken advocate for pro family policies that energize social conservatives she has a record of advancing the culture of life at every opportunity including championing a ban on partial birth abortion and promoting parental consent for minor abortions
9018166 i was fortunate to get those few waves out at the beginning that allowed me to get a few maneuvers in
9018167 it was really tough out there really fast and racy and not easy to get scores unfortunately for layne she wasnt able to find a wave she could really open up on
9018168 i had a bit of a wobbly start to the year but ive had two really good events in a row and to be back on top is an amazing feeling its my second year on tour and im looking to defend my title im excited to be where im at heading into the next few events
9018169 im really proud of steph shes been the form surfer all event and she deserved the win
9018170 im just happy that i can still hang with the young girls and to finish in the final and move up to third is a great place to be heading into the back half of the season
9018171 winning the asp pro junior event the other day and gaining entry into the rip curl pro mademoiselle was one of the best wins of my career
9018172 to be able to compete against the best girls in the world and to finish third is the best finish of my career i wish things could have gone the other way in that heat but they didnt and i am still very very happy to finish third
9018173 steph gilmore got two waves and there wasnt really anything else that came through im still happy with a 3rd and i feel like im surfing good so im happy with my finish here and the next events in brazil so im happy to head home
9018174 it was great to hear one of my favorite writers talk honestly about his work
9018175 this cat does extensive research i mean he puts in the kind of research that like james lipton would have his crew do on largehearted boy
9018176 i was interviewed by a very bright and engaging fellow
9018177 wow do i tell him things i wouldnt expect to say in an interview hes that good its the closest ive come to being on pamela ribon
9018178 very seldom do i get to say all these things because im not asked about them and i appreciate your asking
9018179 hes a funny smart guy and asked a lot of good questions
9018180 one of the great literary interviewers of our time listen for how often his subjects are struck by his discovery of an unknown to them pattern of imagery or tic of diction
9018181 that should have been my first warning when you first said ill give you a softball question like theres going to be a hardball but what
9018182 i know who you are i know exactly what you do
9018183 while i had listened to several of the bats casts over the last year it is only when you consume one sometimes two a day over the course of a week that you really begin to get the wow factor of all the bat has time to do i mean the intros alone are sort of other worldly
9018184 bat segundo is clearly a nutcase i would advise anyone against paying him any credence
9018185 what could quite possibly be the coolest radio show in the history of ever
9018186 i cannot believe she would question the importance of the bat segundo show
9018187 really a matt segundo who is vamping it up with a vampire accent
9018188 an interweb sideshow of great distinction and absolutely spiffing podcasts
9018189 a terrific literary podcast that boasts some absolutely stellar author interviews
9018190 it was great to hear one of my favorite writers talk honestly about his work

9018206 in many respects one could think we were on a huge college campus but the war hangs over everything the career mens wives dont seem as worried about it as the wives of other second lieutenants who want to serve their time and get out of course the career women could be putting on a front because they have to
9018207 gov palin will have to convince voters that she and mr mccain are in touch with womens issues for example how will she deal with the fact that as senator mr mccain voted many times against raising the minimum wage the minimum wage is absolutely a womens issue
9018208 ive stated id like to be back next year but i just want an answer i need to know im racing somewhere next year
9018209 we got that first taste of being in the top 35
9018210 michigan we just missed the setup and that was disappointing since we ran so well there the first time last week its bristol we were running top 12 and just got wrecked nobodys fault martin truex jr blew a tire and that got us out but the car was fast
9018211 we are running better if were not top 15 its a bad day we dont expect to miss the race i expect to try to qualify top 15 every week and try to run there and thats what we have to do
9018212 i always kind of thought the cars were just slippery you could slide them around
9018213 the big difference is theyve actually got a lot of grip in them so to actually start the slide is probably the toughest thing to do and the transition back to the next corner is tough
9018214 yes you who else do you want to want to buy land or not
9018215 while conditions in the financial sector have been challenging we believe bankatlantic bancorps stock price has been unfairly depressed largely due to misinformation provided to the market
9018216 bankatlantic remains well capitalized under all regulatory guidelines unfortunately it has been wrongly associated with other institutions that are not we believe bankatlantic bancorp presents a remarkable buying opportunity for bfc
9018217 senator mccains choice of sarah palin is another excellent example of how he is not afraid to shake up the establishment in washington
9018218 she is a tough executive who like senator mccain is not afraid to stand up for what is right for her constituents
9018219 having the primary on top of the holiday season just barely a few days after the iowa caucus i think does a great disservice to the voters
9018220 the idea that we had holiday greeting television ads was just unbelievable

9018227 as a tourism community at this point we are operating business as usual
9018228 in a very sort of counterintuitive way it was a net benefit for the hotels in the area because of storm displacement and temporary housing
9018229 its not the way you want to boost your business but unfortunately its the reality
9018230 jiwa dibersihkan dari seluruh sifat dan akhlak tercela karena puasa berisi kekuatan penyucian dan membatasi gerak setan yang selalu menggoda manusia untuk berbuat kejahatan

9018238 hello back up girl here what seems to be the trouble
9018239 i need you to give me the names of all the people who filled out the anonymous survey
9018240 mr blank im afraid we hadnt set the system up to collect that information since you know the survey was anonymous
9018241 then just give me their e mail addresses we can figure out their names from those
9018242 mr blank i dont know how to tell you this but the system you approved wasnt programmed to capture that data either as it was you know an anonymous survey
9018243 the anonymous survey was anonymous so your colleagues would feel comfortable sharing their opinions and so you would get honest answers if you knew who they were then the survey wouldnt be anonymous anymore it would be er nonymous
9018244 well i just think there are a number of people who didnt respond to the survey and we want to get as many people as possible so i need to know whos missing and remind them
9018245 im mad as hell and im not going to take this anymore
9018246 i didnt always comport myself in the way that i wanted to my private life has been lived in the public arena because yall got me started so young

9018265 down the long lane of history yet to be written america knows that this world of ours ever growing smaller must avoid becoming a community of dreadful fear and hate and be instead a proud confederation of mutual trust and respect

9018286 defendant has for a long time past been and still is infringing the patent in suit by making selling and using electric motors embodying the patented invention and will continue to do so unless enjoined by this court
9018287 a patentee need only plead facts sufficient to place the alleged infringer on notice as to what he must defend
9018288 i f a pleading to which a responsive pleading is permitted is so vague or ambiguous that a party cannot reasonably be required to frame a responsive pleading the party may move for a more definite statement before interposing a responsive pleading
9018289 the allegations are sufficient to state a claim for indirect infringement and willful infringement and the appropriate vehicles for clarification of the allegations are the disclosures mandated by the local patent rules and discovery conducted under the federal rules of civil procedure

9018305 within the next 10 years the us china israel and a host of private companies plan to set up camp on the moon so if and when they plant a flag does that give them property rights a nasa working group hosted a discussion this week to ask who owns the moon the answer of course is no one the outer space treaty the international law signed by more than 100 countries states that the moon and other celestial bodies are the province of all mankind no doubt that would irk all of the people throughout the ages like monks from the middle ages who have tried to claim the moon was theirs but ownership is different from property rights people who rent apartments for example dont own where they live but they still hold rights so with all of the upcoming missions to visit the moon and beyond space industry thought leaders are seriously asking themselves how to deal with a potential land rush cowboy style

9018359 after delimitation a lot of changes have taken place in the constituencies and making the previous lok sabha results a base for seat sharing is no longer a feasible idea we would expect the samajwadi party to adopt a practical approach on this issue
9018360 there are several seats like the pratapgarh seat that have traditionally been a congress bastion the rampur seat is one of them and we would definitely like to field our candidate from here
9018361 we are not very strong in up and are therefore adopting a practical approach we will seek 25 30 seats and if the samajwadi party does not agree we are ready for a friendly contest in the rest of the seats
9018362 we are aware that we will not gain much from the alliance with the congress which does not even have a vote bank of its own in up however the psychological pressure that the congress sp alliance will exert on the bsp will work to our advantage and lead to a consolidation of secular votes in our favour

9018368 the seat sharing will be pragmatic realistic and honourable for both the sides

9018375 the deal is not unexpected because naspers hasnt ever limited itself to one type of media as indicated by its intent to sell m web and focus on core competencies naspers is positioning itself as a content provider for every type of media and this speaks to that strategy the investment puts them in a good position for emerging markets and targets the majority of the populations there who use mobile and will continue to do so for far more than just voice an investment like this will position naspers to offer mobile social networks to clients and advertisers with a platform through which they can do two things firstly it increases their mobile advertising revenues secondly it increases the audience for content this is particularly important for africa where theres a growing belief that mobile will be the predominant method of accessing the internet and content
9018376 by the end of 2007 our mobile ad business was showing tremendous growth so i contacted mih again now that our business model had become ad driven we spoke a language that media companies understand it didnt take long for mih to make up its mind by the beginning of 2008 mih signalled it wanted in
9018377 the common footprints we have make this a strategic relationship for developing our media properties particularly in south africa india and thailand we look forward to working closely with the group to ramp up our growth
9018378 weve had many players not practicing if one player is just a little bit out of rhythm it really throws our systems off
9018379 that hasnt stopped me before so im not exactly sure we cant continue to play like this and expect to have a chance to be in the playoffs
9018380 obviously we did not do too well but we have to move on and look past this and look forward to the houston comets
9018381 we have six more games to focus on and our real concern is making the playoffs
9018382 we have a high level of respect for georgia southern
9018383 most of their kids are from in state just as ours are we think it will be a pretty heated rivalry a great majority of our georgia guys have high school teammates on their team
9018384 i dont know how theyre going to react if we were playing in front of 92 000 or in front of 4 000
9018385 i just dont know i wish i did i sure would sleep better at night
9018386 is it a good thing its good if we stay there if were there at the end
9018387 i would have to think its a motivating factor for our guys and an excitement factor for our guys to feel like people believe that about our program but its going to be up for judgment every week from this week forward
9018388 no really ill never see you just make sure you remember me
9018389 she said the exact same thing happened to her son 10 years ago they heard a rattle in his chest and put morphein under his tongue it doesnt look good

9018391 to make sure that her husband dies in comfort and peace she has to go into debt and possibly get ill herself from worry thats bullshit its all a hustle it costs a lot to be born and die and then they get you in between
9018392 they want more troops in afghanistan they want to send more support to georgia to protect the oil line there neither one says bring home the troops from iraq from the bases you know the bases are going to stay there the embassy as big as the vatican thats going to remain so their foreign policies are exactly the same
9018393 we create the threats why are we on the borders of russia provoking the russians i mean the georgians initiated the military attack against these enclaves where there were mostly russians its a fact that were over there that we create these crises
9018394 they have been told to be ready to cut off supplies as soon as monday
9018395 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
9018396 they never say were going to cut off your oil because we dont like your foreign policy
9018397 there is a risk that they might do something like cutting oil to hurt the worlds democracies if they get angry enough
9018398 within a decade it will be very hard for russia to push us around
9018399 folks barack and i come from very different places but we share a common story
9018400 his obamas life is a 21st century incarnation of the american dream

9018402 lets not equate differences with lack of patriotism we all love america equally
9018403 we cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives weve set weve got to have a civilian national security force thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
9018404 mobilizing masses of disaffected youths into paramilitary units like those in fascist italy and national socialist germany is a hallmark of all great democrats like hitler and mussolini
9018405 joe biden firmly fits into the liberal interventionist school of thought that dominated the democratic party during the latter half of the 1990s through 2003

9018413 acostas talent is staggering in each of her milagro de los santos novels she shows readers all over again just how funny ridiculous and thoroughly gifted she is at plotting the story never lets up and every character can be measured in great significance
9018414 fast paced funny and hip marta acostas inimitable writing style makes bride of casa dracula a must read for vampire fiction fans it also has a wide cross over appeal and i would recommend this novel to anyone even readers who wouldnt normally choose paranormal romance since it has such a wide entertaining appeal loved it
9018415 the bride of casa dracula is an amazing book with some of the most intensely sexy and emotional scenes of the whole series
9018416 the fast paced witty read that we have all come to enjoy from marta acosta yet it is so much more than that this story has more twists and turns than the hollywood hills themselves and an ending that will leave you stunned im on pins and needles waiting for the next installment in one of my new favorite series for this year
9018417 omg i cant get over how great this book is i really liked the first two but this is the best i read so many books that i rarely get giddy over what happens but this book made me giddy
9018418 this brilliant piece of work by marta acosta kept me up for a couple of nights and when a book causes sleep deprivation it simply means that i loved the book is a great read because it is not filled with vampire stereotypes its unconventional hip fun and exhileration
9018419 the mystery in the story and new characters in this newest release will have readers on the edge of their seats with anticipation right till the end meanwhile the sexy romantic and hilarious aspects all fans have come to enjoy and love are just as prominent as before

9018437 we need to monitor all our personnel related costs to make sure we are managing our resources well
9018438 at the same time overtime in many cases is required to ensure the continuity of our service to the public such as dealing with hospital or safety emergencies or other situations where it makes more sense economically to pay someone overtime than to hire additional permanent staff
9018439 in the long run it would be more economically sound not to have that overtime bump
9018440 overtime should be an exception it should not be the rule
9018441 we chose that location because its central its easily accessible its highly visible
9018442 we still believe its the best permanent home for the clock but inevitably when you put anything a piece of sculpture a countdown clock in a public place you take a certain amount of risk so the best you can do is manage that

9018579 it was very entertaining well produced by our production team along with the radio le mans crew and we think we may be on to something
9018580 i hope people can now understand why we get so animated about these qualifying sessions in the last ten minutes of the prototype session we were actually jumping up and down with excitement im pleased you didnt see that it may have been somewhat embarrassing i expect no different an outcome at detroit this friday the cars come within millimeters of the concrete walls to get the most from their cars look for a few of the more brave souls to come in contact with the barriers on their way to pole position

9018642 untuk itu hanya mengingatkan pfpm jangan cetak fasilitator instan untuk melahirkan fasilitator handal tidak mungkin dilakukan dalam waktu singkat

9018661 i could read from ratan tatas statement that he is troubled in west bengal so i invited him to come here instead and we will give him a red carpet welcome there are a lot of probable sites for the nana project in maharashtra we have a mega project policy in maharashtra and whatever concessions there are in that policy will be given to the tatas if they decided to come here
9018662 we will offer a market price to the farmers and give proper compensation for their land all problems related to land acquisition for industry have become synonymous with the state of west bengal
9018663 orissa is willing to consider the nano project if tata approaches us
9018664 nothings been announced but i wouldnt be surprised if theres a third particularly on the heels of hellboy iis success and i know guillermo has an incredibly well articulated idea about what the third movie needs to be itll answer a lot of questions it almost needs to happen because with the ideas that he has about closing the trilogy it would be a shame for it go unfinished
9018665 he is working on a legion of super heroes which were really excited about were thrilled because geoff is i dont know if you know him but hes the greatest guy to work with
9018666 and weve been wanting to have him come in to do freelance for awhile and weve known him through jeff loeb actually so we were really thrilled that timing wise it all worked out for him to come and do it this year
9018667 we kind of figured hed have a lot of ideas and that we should just throw him whatever he wants
9018668 i am writing to you to urge you to oppose an exemption for india from the rules of the 45 nation nuclear suppliers group nsg
9018669 as you know the nsg operates by consensus so by blocking such an exemption south africa can prevent grave damage being done to the international nuclear non proliferation regime

9018673 but then he turns around to the people who had their jobs outsourced and says sorry we dont have the money to help you look for another job instead he says that investment would be bad for business thats old time republican corporate politics and it has crippled our state
9018674 tell eldest that we found a dead mouse in our shower this morning i havent seen too many mice large rats yes they tend to burrow under the date palms but no real mice the two most recent rat
9018675 that announcement made my head spin iron man isnt dark iron man worked because favreau brought in all the best iron man creators and had them read the script and asked them tell me what we did wrong and it worked because it had all the best things about iron man boiled down into the best movie they could make the dark knight was really good because it had all the best things about batman boiled down into the best movie they could make making a dark and gritty superman movie because dark knight made a ton of money is incredibly stupid
9018676 you always have to always keep superman very distinct from batman
9018677 batman can be brooding and bleak and dark but superman if you want to take a realistic approach to him thats fine but i dont think you can turn him into an angry character superman is about the hope in people the good in people whereas batman is about the more driven hungry for justice angry side of us so i dont know if doing a dark superman is the approach but im all for a reboot
9018678 superman the character inspires hope as opposed to batman who inspires fear
9018679 superman for all seasons is about clark kent trying to deal with the fact that he has this incredible power and responsibility and that was an interesting concept to me and one of the other things that i find interesting is that hes set out to perform a job that will never finish a never ending battle is that dark i dont know
9018680 heroic struggles are basically all dark in tone the idea of villains implies something bad happening to good people most of the time and thats dark heroes look brighter emerging from dire consequence successfully
9018681 i focused on the part where theyll make the films as dark as the characters allow us to go
9018682 hopefully they realize that superman is not a dark character but that doesnt mean the story cant be darker or more threatening what makes superman hard to write in the 21st century is that hes a creature of hope and he lives in a brighter more optimistic world than say batman
9018683 dark light whatever good is the main thing were looking for when we plunk down our ten bucks
9018684 there was a fan who wrote something that frank told me about
9018685 what it said was that the fan wanted exactly what hed seen before if we got an exact remake of a movie we would all be yawning what we have to do is give them something they didnt know they wanted that way they walk away with an oh my god factor by that they would say oh my god i didnt know that the surprise thing i try to do that in every film i work on
9018686 ive directed and produced a lot of things at warner bros film roman then again the way the business is you dont turn away any work its either feast or famine and i like feasting
9018687 ive known frank all the way back when he was working on batman the animated series i was working on tazmania
9018688 i did the hulk fight in ultimate avengers 1 and marvel really liked that when they had another space for a director frank paur told them that i should be the guy plus craig kyle told me i had him when i did the hulk fight so thats how all that came together
9018689 what was interesting is when i got the script i immediately thought of young avengers
9018690 i also initially thought it would be a marvel version of teen titans then i read it and saw the story was very dark and really thrilling so i started thinking that this could be a case where we took children and started watching them grow in front of us you would see them under the protection of a family figure then watch them start to question the parents and then start to make decisions on their own of course a lot of drama starts to happen along the way in other words no matter what they are real kids they just happen to have super powers they are not mini adults i really liked that
9018691 i did aim it for kids without talking down to them thats what i really like
9018692 because i have that background and have done my share of action adventure i felt that i really could do this actually the way i approached it was more action adventure in the sense of given the situation how would you feel at that moment when their whole world breaks apart what i made sure of was these kids dont feel up to the task still they have to play up to the task even though it feels all wrong to them i also made sure to play that to the audience too
9018693 what was interesting is when we were at comic con i got to sit back and watch the audience
9018694 there is a scene where we introduce hawkeye it has torunn being beat up by the iron avengers until he shows up and saves her i swear i heard women swoon especially as he has kind of that swash buckling ready to go attitude from that moment on i knew he won the fans hearts
9018695 what most fans have to realize is while the other kids have been living in antarctica and not even knowing it hawkeyes been living in the real world all that time hes a little more mature than the rest of them its more than him being a little older than them too he had a really hard look at the world i did scale him slightly larger so he is about a year or two older anyway at the same time he can also see the value of james he knows when to sit back and let things happen
9018696 since cap always played it by the book so does james
9018697 then again i gave james red hair on purpose like his mother the black widow he can think out of the box that also gives him a little more edge he will do things that cap would never do to himself
9018698 for me torunns story is one of faith when she was put down on earth she didnt really know anything about her father or asgard one thing we had to cut out early was a scene where she had a shrine to asgard with everything looking like it was viking but still have a can of swiss miss in it i mean anything that has even a remote thing to do with that era she puts in she doesnt really see anything that would truly mean shes asgardian until the end its only in the end where her faith is finally justified
9018699 we have a story arc for azari which we had to cut out because of time
9018700 obviously azari is tchallas son he also has the mutant thing that im not allowed to say in the arc tchalla is a man putting on a cat costume we want to switch it with azari he actually is a cat putting on the guise of a man
9018701 what we want to do if we go forward with this is azari trying to suppress his cat part of himself that is why hes a little more uptight than the rest of them hes trying to hold back the animal in him what we are thinking of doing is showing how the other characters are maturing and growing up hes going to deteriorate in fact we have it where eating meat is whats starting to change him its something he will have to deal with
9018702 if this does go forward one thing i might set up is the original battle with ultron as the ultimate event in this universe
9018703 another project i would eventually like to do is how ultron ultimately came about
9018704 from there i would ask what did s h i e l d do what did other people do to bring about this event i would like to show that ultron was definitely the fault of the predecessors
9018705 when it was time to pick ups noah crawfords james voice actually cracked in between some sessions
9018706 what were now thinking is being weve started with kids we will actually have the characters change to match the way the kids change
9018707 one thing i will say is that to some degree frank paur and i have been dropping easter eggs in our projects there might come a time where we might tie them all together whether my universe is going to be connected to franks like tying my thor into his in hulk vs thats yet to be done lets say if things go right and people get to see all of it there will hopefully be an arc that runs through all of them
9018708 a man with 10 wives would collapse and die but my own power is given by allah that is why i have been able to control 86 of them
9018709 to my understanding the koran does not place a limit and it is up to what your own power your own endowment and ability allow god did not say what the punishment should be for a man who has more than four wives but he was specific about the punishment for fornication and ery
9018710 we were already out with the why so serious campaign
9018711 we said to ledgers family look is this an issue would you like us to pull this and heres what they said heath loved the movie was very proud of it this was just an accident they were fine with it more than fine they were completely supportive
9018712 it surprised us and once in a while it is kind of fun to be surprised on the upside
9018713 if you look at the performance of begins in theaters on dvd and just how much the fan base really loved the movie there was never any question for us
9018714 we just loved what chris did from day one and were very excited about going back on the journey with him
9018715 ledger has always struck me as a bit of a stiff
9018716 ledger seems spectacularly unsuited to the weirdness of the joker
9018717 we were already out with the why so serious campaign
9018718 we said to ledgers family look is this an issue would you like us to pull this and heres what they said heath loved the movie was very proud of it this was just an accident they were fine with it more than fine they were completely supportive
9018719 it surprised us and once in a while it is kind of fun to be surprised on the upside
9018720 if you look at the performance of begins in theaters on dvd and just how much the fan base really loved the movie there was never any question for us
9018721 we just loved what chris did from day one and were very excited about going back on the journey with him
9018722 ledger has always struck me as a bit of a stiff
9018723 ledger seems spectacularly unsuited to the weirdness of the joker
9018724 he wanted to make the movie into even more of an event
9018725 it became very clear when the family and others started to see some of heaths bravado performance and what a centerpiece it was to the movie that there was no thought of marketing the film without him as some suggested in the press around that time
9018726 we just ignored it because it was his personal business
9018727 if he had asked us to involve ourselves we would have been willing to discuss that but he didnt mention it and we didnt mention it
9018728 there are a lot of us who emotionally would love to do it
9018729 but its really chris call chris is the kind of filmmaker who just doesnt think about the next movie before he has completely finished the movie he is working on

9018737 i kind of expected mccains pick was not going to be something that was going to be the conventional pick knowing him the way i know him it was going to be an out of the box type of selection and this caught everybody by surprise
9018738 her name wasnt mentioned it came down to the tim pawlentys the mitt romneys but i think that whatever bounce the obama campaign gets and they will its going to be deflated quickly with sarah palin when shes introduced
9018739 last night senator barack obama had a chance to address all the sexism and misogyny that was leveled in this campaign against hillary clinton and he chose not to take that
9018740 so in terms of sitting well with women on the democratic side we see that john mccain gets it john mccain selected a qualified woman with a lot of experience and accomplishments to be his running mate as opposed to barack obama who chose against the person that got more votes than anyone in history so i think that thats actually whats sitting poorly with women right now
9018741 actually when you look at sarah palin you see that she is a family woman shes a mother of five you see that in alaska she has an incredibly strong record as a reformer
9018742 so i think thats where peoples concern is going to be that its a person with accomplishment and experience whos been chosen she just happens to be a woman as well

9018747 shareholders are informed that whilst it is correct that airlines png and virgin blue are in discussions no concluded agreement has been reached with virgin blue regarding joint arrangements
9018748 the shortfall in the end came to 463 000 instead of the original 1 5 million
9018749 the fact that agriprocessors is being forced to recruit workers from eight thousand miles away from postville is pretty telling
9018750 these men and women are probably the only people left who have not heard about the atrocious treatment of workers at the plant we are extremely concerned that they will get to postville learn about the conditions and false promises and be forced to stay because of travel related expenses and incurred debt
9018751 at first glance gov palin appears to have impressive conservative credentials
9018752 of course for michigans sake we would have loved to see our favorite son mitt romney be on the ticket but there is a lot to get excited about with sarah palin
9018753 this helps with the voters that propelled granholm to victory in michigan suburban voters especially women in places like oakland county and west michigan it will excite the base who feel so strongly about a pro life conservative candidate she will appeal strongly to our voters all across michigan who believe in the right to bear arms and can speak the same language of the hundreds of thousands of michigan voters who spend their fall hunting deer in northern michigan
9018754 and her reputation as a reformer with no tolerance for government officials who abuse power and dont serve citizens will have great resonance in michigan that has been dragged through the kilpatrick scandals for the last year and has watched the granholm bring michigan progress to a screeching hault sic
9018755 in the first amendment the founding fathers gave the free press the protection it must have to fulfill its essential role in our democracy the press was to serve the governed not the governors the governments power to censor the press was abolished so that the press would remain forever free to censure the government the press was protected so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government and paramount among the responsibilities of a free press is the duty to prevent any part of the government from deceiving the people and sending them off to distant lands to die of foreign fevers and foreign shot and shell

9018800 as ice melts and climate change proceeds in a runaway state theres a lot more killer whales coming into the arctic in the summer and theyre changing the behaviour of narwhals and belugas

9018900 i think it best to repeat the quote made by another much feared francis jeffrey whose sentiments towards irvings work mirror my own on this most excellent and readable of biographies
9018901 she said you had interested her more than any one she had seen since she left italy

9018918 the job i do now i think is important and what i really want to do is make a difference

9018925 there isnt a woman in the world that doesnt have a friend or a partner whos actually experiencing some sort of violence against them so i think although domestic violence hasnt happened to me personally i certainly know women who are dealing with this struggle every day

9018935 the end of the ideological and military confrontation of two political systems has not led to demilitarization of world politics as some expected

9018944 dwia members can look forward to welcoming a dynamic director who will continue the work to improve conditions for the entire danish wind industry i am certain that he will strengthen the association so we will have an even stronger position in time for the climate change conference in copenhagen next year

9018952 in west virginia if you want to build a new medical facility you have to get a certificate of need to prove that its needed this means instead of just building the medical facility you have to figure out how to convince the bureaucrats that what youre doing is needed thats what they did in the former soviet union it doesnt work very well
9018953 and yet the competition brings us cars that are much better than a planned economy can produce but west virginia politicians think they know best when it comes to health care

9018969 we have serious reasons to believe that american citizens were right at the heart of the military action this would have implications for american domestic policy if this is confirmed we will have grounds to suspect that somebody in the u s has created this conflict to aggravate the situation and create a competitive advantage for one of the presidential candidates

9018980 what did you hear and do you have any questions
9018981 this was a brutal and cowardly attack and there can be no excuse or justification for it
9018982 it is deeply concerning that those responsible carried out this assault in the presence of young children
9018983 the damage that they may have suffered both physically and mentally was obviously of no concern to the thugs responsible for this heartless act the local community is clear in its abhorrence and disgust at this attack

9018996 the met want me off the case and are going to the very top to force me out
9018997 they are in denial about their treatment of tarique ghaffur and feel that he is bringing this case because of the people around him tarique ghaffur is not stupid he is an assistant commissioner and he alone has decided to proceed with this tribunal they are unhappy because we are running rings around them

9019001 the problem is that the government has done such damage to business confidence in its commitment to tax competitiveness that it needs to do a lot to recoup the lost ground
9019002 there is an urgent need for a clear statement of principal by the treasury that the uk only wants to tax profits made in the uk and those diverted from the uk
9019003 as the chancellor has said previously we will look to reduce the rate of corporation tax further as circumstances allow
9019004 this would bring greater certainty and proper consultation in place of damaging uncertainty and a lack of consultation we have seen

9019042 these days stags take entry one by one and then form a big group inside we think thats unsafe for the women who are new to the country honestly foreigners understand each other better and know how to talk to or approach women rules are for everyone weve often been told to soften our stand on entry but wed rather lose business than risk an unpleasant event

9019143 but senator clinton made an unfortunate remark an ill advised remark about king and lyndon johnson
9019144 i didnt make the statement i havent remarked on it and she i think offended some folks who felt that somehow diminished kings role in bringing about the civil rights act she is free to explain that but the notion that somehow this is our doing is ludicrous

9019198 over the years the health insurance companies have certainly interfered with the patient physician relationship
9019199 they have become the unseen but ever present censor of what the doctor orders
9019200 when i started filing managed care claims in the early 1990s i had to add two full time employees just to handle the added paperwork
9019201 the patients doctors and patient care seem to take second fiddle to insurers profits insurance codes preapprovals business plans and the like all controlled by business types in suits who have never directly helped a sick person in their life
9019202 the first questions patients are asked when they see a doctor is what kind of insurance do you have
9019203 he feels physicians are forced to ask that up front
9019204 the insurance system that pays physicians is a volume driven system that doesnt allow for the extra time you need to spend with some patients
9019205 had to see a lot more patients every month just to cover the additional staffs salaries and benefits
9019206 im just like an old country doctor hang out a shingle take care of patients and charge a fair price

9019212 credit goes to the boys for the way we came back we kept making mistakes through the series we were not consistent in the batting department
9019213 it was good to win the series with a game to spare
9019214 these tracks are said to be slow but the bounce has improved over the last few years i am happy with the way our batsmen have played the spin it was important to keep the strike rotating and our batsmen did that well
9019215 according to the church people i approached and underlined by the undertaker an atheist cannot be buried in donegal because the churches catholic church of ireland and presbyterian own the graveyards therefore unless one is willing to compromise ones beliefs by agreeing to a religious service it is impossible to be buried

9019248 despite the work of our congressional delegation we are about 329 million short of full funding for the bridge project and its clear that congress has little interest in spending any more money on a bridge between ketchikan and gravina island
9019249 much of the publics attitude toward alaska bridges is based on inaccurate portrayals of the projects here but we need to focus on what we can do rather than fight over what has happened

9019269 wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears
9019270 pushing lies distortions and manipulations about barack and university of illinois professor william ayers
9019271 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
9019272 this is really unprecedented with the show the way that people are flooding the calls and our e mail boxes
9019273 should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks
9019274 knowing and willful attempt to evade the strictures of federal election law
9019275 yea they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils and shed innocent blood even the blood of their sons and of their daughters whom they sacrificed unto the idols of canaan and the land was polluted with blood thus were they defiled with their own works and went a whoring with their own inventions

9019277 i was peacefully sidewalk chalking when i was forcefully pushed to ground by a police officer from behind
9019278 as i was being cuffed on the ground the police officer pushed his knee into the back of my neck i was pulled roughly off the ground and taken away i was given no warning to stop and was completely shocked when i was arrested
9019279 i was rushed by a police officer without warning and lifted up off the ground and was cuffed i was then dragged by the police into the westin hotel
9019280 it was understood by the young women that sidewalk chalk was an accepted medium and they were given no warning by the police before being cuffed and dragged away
9019281 i think the officers were keyed up were not sure whether they acted of their own accord or had orders
9019282 i am horrified and outraged at the treatment of these two girls not only were they legally expressing their opinions on the public sidewalk but they were doing so peacefully and without incident the officers acted without provocation and should be ashamed of themselves for terrorizing two young women
9019283 i am also appalled that the city of denver boasted of the citys preparation for the convention but clearly neglected to train their police force to respect the first amendment and the rights of citizens to peacefully demonstrate
9019284 the city of denver sent a clear message to civic minded young people this week the first amendment doesnt apply here
9019285 i am shocked at how cowardly these police officers behaved by attacking little girls without warning or provocation

9019293 the president is of the opinion that the american people can be our influential targets
9019294 it would be gullible to think that america is seeking to relinquish its past policy
9019295 we have received no note in this connection but if we are to receive a note as mr ahmadinejad says we will examine it and will decide with a view to the interests of the two countries
9019296 it would give the urban townships a little more money and rural townships a little less

9019301 ondrej sosenka has seriously violated the rules but first of all he has harmed himself because this will likely be the end of his career
9019302 this is obviously one of our bigger loads and so were happy to have all of this equipment here so we can really get rolling
9019303 it really is taking that area that we had in the northwest and trying to make sure it fits here in this space and so far its been a pretty good fit
9019304 its been a little bit of a puzzle but its all worked out very nicely
9019305 i have been stopped a few times by city fans and i always said i wanted to come back
9019306 i was just never sure when it was going to happen but as soon as i met the manager mark hughes he made it clear how much he wanted me that made it pretty easy
9019307 obviously from the outside you can see it was a tough time
9019308 but i felt wanted there i always gave it 110 per cent and when i got my chances which were admittedly limited i did the best i could and dont have anything bad to say about them chelsea is a fantastic club with fantastic supporters
9019309 facilitate use of one or more controls provided on the control docking unit
9019310 on the third hole his 12th i really hurt my wrist again in the rough but im sure the physios will sort it out
9019311 i had it the same all summer in 2004 and got it sorted out
9019312 its something to do with my neck and shoulder affecting the hand it feels good to be in contention with so much riding on the week
9019313 mentally im strong im enjoying my golf and enjoying the challenge and right now it looks good for me
9019314 but im sure the guys behind will keep the pressure on so theres no relaxing
9019315 other guys deserve it more than me darren clarke paul casey colin montgomerie paul mcginley they all have far more experience
9019316 ill just have to try again in two years time

9019324 she changes the image of the republican party from purely white male to more diverse and thats good for the party in a year in which the democrats have the first african american nominee
9019325 gov palins story is one that all americans will find inspiring shes a washington outsider with a commitment to the conservative principles that will make our nation stronger
9019326 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9019327 but one of the fascinating things is what it may tell us about john mccain we now know if we didnt before that john mccain is a gambler this is high stakes this is rolling the dice and thats very interesting
9019328 the kennedy family occupies for the moment a place of equilibrium and purity
9019329 the violent deaths of john and robert murders most foul and horrifying tore the nations heart as painfully as did the death of abraham lincoln and the historical consequences of their deaths were arguably as baleful now the last brother the only one to survive beyond the youthful cusp of maturity is dying too teddy was the youngest and the slowest the one who relied the most abjectly on family connections for his advancement and who at chappaquidick in 1969 and then with his doomed and damaging campaign for president in 1980 seemed destined to do the most to squander and tarnish the family legacy yet in the twenty eight years since then he has gradually constructed a life of large and consistent accomplishment that has earned him a stature that in its way is as impressive as his brothers last night was a surprise at least to me i imagine the tv audience knew all about it a greater surprise was the strength of his voice and his message this was no feeble invalid kennedys energy was fully a match for that of the vast crowd that he and his niece caroline who introduced him with great affection and respect were there less to celebrate themselves and their past than to accelerate a future represented by barack obama whom they plainly see as the inheritor of what they represent kept the moment from becoming maudlin the tears that streaked so many faces came from everywhere tears can come from from joy and grief from pride and sorrow from love and hope from a simple upwelling of mingled emotions the lion roared one last time and we were all his cubs
9019330 my brother need not be idealized or enlarged in death beyond what he was in life to be remembered simply as a good and decent man who saw wrong and tried to right it saw suffering and tried to heal it saw war and tried to stop it
9019331 those of us who loved him and who take him to his rest today pray that what he was to us and what he wished for others will some day come to pass for all the world
9019332 you visited virars residents when you needed their support now its your turn to reciprocate by solving their problems after all you have grown up with them they are angry and rightly so why do you want to be treated as pardesi babu in your own home

9019336 what happened we get water once in two days and the power cuts are 10 hours long actors should remain in bollywood and not experiment with politics they dont understand our problems
9019337 educated people did not support him tribals voted for him as he dances well well he continues to dance well can you imagine an mp telling his voters during the floods that he would visit them next time

9019346 it wont be a blog but a platform to exchange ideas and get feedback and im quite prepared for criticism if you take tough decisions therell obviously be many who will disagree with you if i bothered about critics i would get no work done
9019347 tamil nadu is my priority and i see myself back there in the near future there is such a political vacuum there our the pmks target is to come to power in 2011

9019351 i never smoked i did not even try of my ten close friends at mmc eight smoked and only two didnt i guess i didnt do a lot of things because of my father i did not want to disappoint him
9019352 the media focus on the controversies and dont talk of the ministrys achievements
9019353 the national rural health mission has turned around rural healthcare in india and is being held up as the last bastion of hope for the public health sector by international experts such as the economist jeffrey sachs but all the media report is about smoking and junk food
9019354 back in 1989 at one of the first ever auctions of indian art a husain sold for a sum of 10 lakh rupees
9019355 abroad galleries are eager to set aside entire halls where an installation can first be constructed and then be displayed
9019356 it starts there i agree but then it moves on to deeper cognitive levels of perception it is a grand metaphor of urbanity
9019357 it seems to have leapfrogged industrialisation to enter directly into a post industrial stage
9019358 the recent upsurge in the indian art market and the rising trend to invest in art does not trouble sundaram

9019366 kami harus bekerja keras untuk bisa meraih trofi uefa cup dan scudetto musim ini sebab kami sangat ingin merengkuh kedua gelar itu
9019367 saya pikir kami adalah favorit peraih scudetto bersama dengan inter milan juventus serta as roma namun kami memiliki kelebihan di sektor penyerangan sebab ketiga tim di atas tidak memiliki barisan striker dahsyat seperti kami
9019368 meski kecewa dengan sikap para pemain libya tak ingin melanjutkan pertandingan namun bagaimanapun kami tetap senang indonesia tampil sebagai juara padahal mereka sadar turnamen ini diadakan untuk merayakan kemerdekaan indonesia

9019389 companies like ibm intel sgi mips freescale hp etc are all working to ensure that linux runs well on their hardware that in turn makes their offerings more attractive to linux users resulting in increased sales
9019390 voters are eager to hear side by side discussions by the mayoral candidates on a broad range of significant issues facing the community
9019391 this is an unprecedented opportunity for that discussion who will replace mayor l douglas wilder
9019392 it takes a third grader to do the math and see that it would be a smart move in the long haul but we need to see if we have the reserve funds
9019393 r ight now the thing is trying to make the best material possible and if we get a really great material then we have to think about how do you scale it
9019394 concerning yeshuim who are considered and recognized as jews we have never yet heard of this is absolutely unacceptable ask any jew on the street if this phenomena is probable and their definite answer will be no
9019395 she has raised many extended and tortuous claims as to the possible link of a jew believing in yeshu a as the messiah as if we are living today in the beginning of the first century and as if since then nothing has transpired as it relates to different religious structures that have been established and that have disconnected themselves from judaism and for all those who choose to join those different paths

9019400 how much of the hierarchy in the medal table is indisputable and how much depends on your point of view
9019401 a very positive end to the test with again good reliability weve had a very productive week here completing all our programme and accumulating some useful information to prepare for the italian grand prix its always a pleasure to test in monza and thanks to the drivers test team and particularly ferrari bridgestone and our other partners for all their efforts weve had a very useful test that has helped to build on the step in performance that we saw in valencia
9019402 today we made some positive steps forward for the italian grand prix particularly with the balance and set up
9019403 at the moment it seems relatively benign but there are dangers lurking
9019404 will comcast count some traffic against the cap but not other traffic as in comcast generated video
9019405 we think 250 gb is an extremely large amount of bandwidth
9019406 a low bandwidth user downloading an hd movie at 8 p m in peak time puts more stress on the network than someone who downloads lots more in the middle of the night
9019407 if fewer than 1 percent would be affected by this whats the point
9019408 if they are going to put caps then they need to give us what i think is an acceptable expectation a meter
9019409 figure out a way to tell us what is our monthly usage and let us know if we are running up against a 250 gb cap we know when to stop
9019410 if you believe the 0 05 kb e mail then you also believe in the tooth fairy
9019411 it remains unclear how the cap announced today helps solve comcasts supposed congestion problems
9019412 though the proposed cap is relatively high it will increasingly ensnare more users as technology continues its natural progression
9019413 i do not care whether or not this forum has loads of funky new features if no one can get to the site and or post anything whats the point
9019414 i would also like to register my disgust at whats been happening for several days and my sheer disappointment that oracle of all companies would allow an application to go live without thorough testing or if it was thoroughly tested in uat without rolling back immediately when it was obvious that there were problems in the production environment
9019415 uptime is still not where it should be of course forums oracle com is business critical for a lot of folks as well as for oracle and im glad they consider it so
9019416 we made a conscious decision early in this process to stick with the upgrade to fight through the problems instead of run from them
9019417 regardless i do want to apologize for the downtime youve suffered through thus far
9019418 uhm this author and i would probably get along very well on a day to day level but id probably try to steer clear of political discussions with him
9019419 so this time we have escalated the penalty to a black screen that reappears every hour until the user validates his or her copy of win xp pro
9019420 mdec respects the rights of companies to protect their intellectual property its a reminder that software piracy doesnt pay especially when malaysians are themselves putting a lot of effort into creating original software
9019421 microsoft has stopped selling win xp in the market so you have to wonder why it is spending time and money to take down users of pirated copies of this os
9019422 why isnt it also targeting users who have pirated copies of windows vista
9019423 so if im using a pirated copy of vista at this time i wont be hassled got to wonder about that

9019430 it was no wonder our movement had failed to spread
9019431 unless you grew up with us soaking up the lore how could you hope to understand or join us it was all so sloppy so disheveled a whole loose stack of fables and fourth hand yarns clipped to a modest sheaf of creeds with a lot of health advice thrown in
9019432 life was suddenly after suddenly so many suddenlys in quick succession that people wrote made up tales to stop their onslaught to rest in the illusion of some smooth flow
9019433 i lost everything not just naturally but they broke in looters and they had a ball they ransacked all my drawers
9019434 my whole family is in new orleans and they are elderly so if anything was to happen of course its going to hurt
9019435 im keeping a close tab of everything and they know they can come here
9019436 i felt like i played one of the best games i have ever played i messed up on a couple of assignments but that s what is going to happen when moving to a new position
9019437 i had about four or five pancake blocks my pass protection was really good i got to the linebackers really good overall my pass protection has improved great lately it s one of my strengths now
9019438 i left them a couple of voicemails about me switching positions i think overall that is what coach joe pendry had in mind
9019439 i am glad my coaches gave me the opportunity to play getting to know two positions is an advantage alabama opens their season saturday night at the georgia dome against i think alabama has some of the greatest coaches in the sec
9019440 they are going to surprise clemson i know i am going to be there i talked to william ming and we are going to meet up there i think alabama fans are going to come out and be very supportive
9019441 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
9019442 all of us at showtime wish david and his family the best during this very private time
9019443 at first they had me in a bunch of furs
9019444 yeah i have furs on my wall but i dont wear furs i had to show them my bunny boots and my north face clothing
9019445 a woman of faith who has a strong position on life a consistent opinion on judges
9019446 lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9019447 sarah palin for her entire political career has been underestimated
9019448 shes tough shes tenacious i believe that she does have what it takes to get out there again her ability to connect with voters and make a case is very very very strong
9019449 right now nearly 4 000 centrifuges are operating at natanz
9019450 if nobody wants to talk with us on these issues and co operation with russia is not needed then for gods sake do it yourselves
9019451 new allegations are being made and new discovery is being produced all of which must be reviewed personally by mr graham
9019452 with both crude and total oil product inventories running significantly lower than they were when either hurricanes katrina or rita sidelined gulf oil production both oil and gasoline prices are more exposed to potential storm related supply disruptions than they were three years ago
9019453 a comparable hit to production could easily send gasoline prices to new record highs with pump prices in the united states rising to us 5 per gallon and send natural gas prices spiking as well
9019454 the question is whether demand destruction can keep pace with the destruction in supply
9019455 while supply disruptions and attendant price hikes will be temporary there will be lasting impacts from hurricane damage on future supply growth as there have already been from the 2005 storm season
9019456 the general trend to gasoline prices would be flat to slightly lower reflecting a sort of underlying slowing global growth and therefore a slowdown in demand for crude oil
9019457 that should take a further froth off crude oil prices and allow for gasoline prices to slip a bit further
9019458 if there is damage to infrastructure if rigs are offline for more than just a few days for precautionary reasons then you could see oil and gasoline prices move upward temporarily
9019459 no tengo una no necesito escuchar m sica que me deprima con pensamientos negativos

9019466 if this faa outage happened at a power plant id be telling them to open up their checkbook and expect to be fined
9019467 dont happen on a mass scale or a regular basis
9019468 we are making sure people are getting from one place to another
9019469 we should see significant improvements by the end of september which should prevent the type of problem we had on tuesday
9019470 its common you see it in retail too its the whole dont fix it if it aint broke thing
9019471 its unfortunate because its very reactive and it typically winds up costing you more if you do fix on fail it usually costs you more
9019472 you need to do a good analysis about whether this is acceptable risk
9019473 one of the things the government is betting on is the fact that if theres a failure its not a safety issue

9019477 we suppose it was just a matter of time before ipod docks and htibs achieved some sort of unholy union and their demonic lovechild has appeared at ifa say hello to the philips cinemaone essentially a mashup of an ipod speaker system a dvd player and a soundbar its designed to plug in to your flatscreen via hdmi and provide surround audio through five dsp driven speakers and 4 inch sub all in a package about the size of a football the divx compatible dvd player seems decent with 1080p scaling and dolby digital and dts support but even though the speakers use the same soundbar tech found in philips ambisound line weve got our doubts that this thing sounds any good most soundbars weve heard require a separate large sub to be effective no pricing or release date yet but wed wait to actually hear this thing in person before we started to set aside spare change
9019478 right now weve got what john harwood and the chicago tribune jill zuckman reporting that it is palin

9019482 makes it a federal crime to knowingly provide false information with the intent to disenfranchise another person in a federal election
9019483 tricksters have moved online because of the low probability of being caught and also because anti spam laws and no call lists exempt political messages
9019484 by early november were expecting spam emails to be sent giving the wrong location for a polling station or incorrect details about who has the right to vote theres even a web site thats offering to register voters for 9 95 of course it doesnt cost anything to vote
9019485 may attempt to finagle personal information including social security number or even credit card information from people signing up to register
9019486 in a tight race where every voter counts the implications are serious
9019487 if youre a non citizen and you register or vote theres a record that connects you to that registration and voting and it can be and has been investigated
9019488 and if youre convicted which is a relatively straightforward thing if youre a non citizen and youve actually registered and voted you can be put in jail for five years for each count you can be fined up to 10 000 dollars and probably most serious you can be deported
9019489 and in return you get at most one incremental vote now for the vast majority of people those odds just dont make sense
9019490 as the leading global manufacturer of submersible motors installed hundreds of feet below ground for decades franklin has been utilizing the motors power cable to communicate motor telemetry to the surface for system monitoring however our engineering teams in madison wisconsin and saco maine have developed a unique way to apply this know how in a filling station as part of the process the teams evaluated both wired and wireless technologies that could minimize the financial burden of an isd installation given the checkered historical performance of wireless communication in gas stations we chose the more robust solution that utilizes the stations existing proven power lines as we have reported before there are two carb approved isd systems we are pleased that the innovations to franklins isd system have resulted in the only one that can be installed without pulling wire or breaking concrete additionally our system is the only system that shuts down the dispenser only and not the whole gas station when it receives a dispenser alarm these innovative features reduce installation and operating costs for the station owner and minimize the lost revenue and the inconvenience of station down time to station owners and consumers respectively further we have included another innovative product with each system a one year trial license for our get connected anyware tm communications software this software allows the station operator to monitor station forecourt activity from any computer anywhere through the internet

9019523 they were all in this together and it is a tragic situation
9019524 its inaccurate to say we were all in this together
9019525 were headed to the next adventure out on the plains of meridiani
9019526 we safely got into the crater we completed our exploration there and we safely got out we were concerned that any wheel failure on our aging rover could have left us trapped inside the crater
9019527 weve done everything we entered victoria crater to do and more
9019528 our experience tells us theres lots of diversity among the cobbles
9019529 we want to get a better characterization of them a statistical sampling from examining more of them will be important for understanding the geology of the area
9019530 the patterns broadly resemble what we saw at the smaller craters opportunity explored earlier
9019531 by looking deeper into the layering we are looking farther back in time
9019532 if opportunity were driving with only five wheels like spirit it probably would never get out of victoria crater
9019533 we also know from experience with spirit that if opportunity were to lose the use of a wheel after it is out on the level ground mobility should not be a problem
9019534 both rovers show signs of aging but they are both still capable of exciting exploration and scientific discovery
9019535 i do not care whether or not this forum has loads of funky new features if no one can get to the site and or post anything whats the point
9019536 i would also like to register my disgust at whats been happening for several days and my sheer disappointment that oracle of all companies would allow an application to go live without thorough testing or if it was thoroughly tested in uat without rolling back immediately when it was obvious that there were problems in the production environment
9019537 uptime is still not where it should be of course forums oracle com is business critical for a lot of folks as well as for oracle and im glad they consider it so
9019538 we made a conscious decision early in this process to stick with the upgrade to fight through the problems instead of run from them
9019539 regardless i do want to apologize for the downtime youve suffered through thus far
9019540 in the industries i work in if you have something that critical you generally build more redundancy
9019541 if this faa outage happened at a power plant id be telling them to open up their checkbook and expect to be fined

9019543 we are making sure people are getting from one place to another
9019544 we should see significant improvements by the end of september which should prevent the type of problem we had on tuesday
9019545 its common you see it in retail too its the whole dont fix it if it aint broke thing
9019546 its unfortunate because its very reactive and it typically winds up costing you more if you do fix on fail it usually costs you more
9019547 you need to do a good analysis about whether this is acceptable risk

9019551 its difficult to pass on any road course really but here its not like you drop a wheel off in the gravel and keep going or get pushed wide you hit a wall theres just nowhere to go
9019552 the only other spot you can make up spots outside of actually passing would be through strategy through fuel saving through pit stops i think a lot of us tend to rely on strategy for the cleanest passing
9019553 we had a top five finish last weekend at infineon and i plan to use that momentum going into the race this weekend

9019586 theres always something to work on its going all right but still plenty more to work on
9019587 everyone is having to change moderately but rugby is still rugby you have still got to go out there and kick a ball around and things like that
9019588 but it is a game of pace now you have got to be able to run fast and it is just like any other sport the faster you are the better chance you have got
9019589 youve got to focus on technique in order to put through as much power as other big guys can i enjoy it because it is quite technical and i like to think i contribute to the team
9019590 i know them all and they are a good bunch of guys and it would be really nice to get one over them so im looking forward to this week so hopefully we can stick it to them
9019591 theyre a tough side but hopefully we can go out there and give it our all
9019592 our aim is to win the thing but we have to get there first its important for us to cement these wins away from home as much as our home games
9019593 weve already dumped a home game which isnt flash so youve got to make up for it somewhere else we target the franchise unions to try send a statement out there that we are here to stay
9019594 last year we took everyone by surprise and now weve got to work a lot harder everyone knows what were doing but were building slowly weve just got to keep the momentum going now were two in a row
9019595 defence is about attitude its one of those things you either want to make tackles or you dont
9019596 we work pretty hard on our fitness even though both teams were waning at the end there it was a pretty torrid game a lot of turn over of possession probably not many free kicks which was surprising
9019597 we got ourselves into try scoring opportunities and once again just little mistakes cost us a chance to convert
9019598 its disappointing because we have worked hard in the last week on doing the right thing in that attacking zone but clearly weve got to do more work there
9019599 weve got to give a bit of credit to the opposition their defence was very strong they managed to slow our ball enough so they could get their defence into place and that puts us under pressure with our passing and catching
9019600 i thought ben smith had a fantastic game a young fella whos probably in his fourth or fifth game for otago and i thought he did tremendously well not only in retrieving the ball but kicking it down field
9019601 glen horton was again terrific we just have to create a bit more space for them so that they can score some tries
9019602 there is hardly any chance that musharraf will ever be tried in pakistan
9019603 hes laughed off the reports that he is about to leave the country
9019604 he said im not going anywhere im staying in pakistan
9019605 many people said the wall should be very high considering the security threats
9019606 mr musharraf said he couldnt afford it so we settled for medium range tiles

9019617 lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling

9019623 alan garc a se inspira en fujimori y montesinos para gobernar
9019624 con todo respeto debo decir que a veces el presidente alan garc a se est inspirando demasiado en el gobierno de fujimori con el asesoramiento de vladimiro montesinos ese autoritarismo se observa porque sin consultar ha metido un tren de decretos legislativos que no tienen nada que con el tratado de libre comercio
9019625 lo digo como ciudadano y como ex jefe de estado mirando al futuro del per yo no tengo ninguna mala intenci n el per no puede caer en el autoritarismo de hugo ch vez o de fujimori o de montesinos ya hemos superado eso

9019630 the fact that palin is a mother of five who has a 4 month old baby a woman who is juggling work and family responsibilities will speak to many women
9019631 but will palin speak for women based on her record and her stated positions the answer is clearly no

9019642 my wife didnt mean what she said about pride in country
9019643 i tried to ignore him but my buttons were pushed
9019644 while the palin choice is surprising on many levels including the important fact that she has no real foreign policy experience and governed a town of 7 500 before becoming governor less than two years ago her fight against corruption mirrors mccains own
9019645 a key consideration with the palin pick is whether she will bring over any of those 18 million clinton democrats who wanted their woman in the white house and were bitterly disappointed to see that chance slip away
9019646 ummm i have news for you wingnut or clintonista the obama biden ticket is unbeatable

9019683 sarah palin is an intelligent well regarded governor of two years and was the mayor of a town of 9 000 however senator john mccain has made his candidacy about a single argument experience and sarah palin doesnt have it on his birthday senator mccain chose a running mate who simply has no track record of exercising good judgment on national security and foreign policy issues to be one heart beat away from the presidency

9019716 i think as they come to know gov sarah palin they are going to see her not simply as an embodiment of those strong conservative values that thrill my heart but they are going to see her as an embodiment of an accomplished american woman
9019717 and i believe that will resonate with millions of american women

9019723 anoles are highly visual species so in that sense its not surprising that they would use visual displays to mark territory
9019724 still the finding is surprising because these are the first animals known to use non acoustic signaling at dawn and dusk
9019725 these patterns have remarkable parallels with the dawn and dusk choruses reported for many acoustically communicating animals
9019726 the dawn chorus may be a way of communicating having survived the night
9019727 if in the morning a bird doesnt hear its neighbor or an anole doesnt see its neighbor it may be an opportunity for the animal to expand its territory
9019728 as in humans if an anole can do many of these push ups it shows that he is in prime physical condition these displays of strength help avert actual physical confrontations between male lizards which can be very fierce and destructive
9019729 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9019730 even during the cold war the soviet union consistently fulfilled its contract obligations to supply energy to europe irrespective of political or other circumstances

9019733 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9019734 russian american tensions are high and any decision on the documents which will define further cooperation would be hasty and emotional in the current situation it would be best if the white house waits for the question to be depoliticized and assessed pragmatically

9019746 the present litigation is more complex than the misinformed and mischaracterized allegations of copyright infringement
9019747 the litigation involves the anti competitive nature of the apple eula and similar anti competitive tactics related to the misuse of apples copyrights issues related to the fair use of various intellectual properties by psystar also come into play
9019748 psystar alleges that there is no technical reason that a third party could not accumulate and assemble the hardware components in an apple labeled computer hardware system such that said system would be capable of running the mac os that is such that the system would constitute a mac os capable computer hardware system
9019749 on information and belief psystar alleges that but for the exclusionary conduct of apple and other conduct amounting to unfair competition as set forth in greater detail herein and as exemplified by the activities of psystar a third party could and would assemble the hardware components capable of running the mac os
9019750 that but for the anticompetitive conduct of apple as outlined herein apple labeled computer hardware systems would otherwise be a competing member of the otherwise diverse mac oc capable computer hardware systems market
9019751 any other operating system including but not limited to the windows operating system lacks the potential or ability to deprive apple of its customers especially at a significant level of business as it concerns the mac os
9019752 we have seen increased interest in opencomputer with only a slight decrease in sales
9019753 we are allowing more people to take advantage of a great operating system that apple has created at a more accessible cost than the pricey mac

9019764 senator i am honored to be chosen as your running mate i will be honored to serve next to the next president of the united states
9019765 as governor ive stood up to the old politics as usual
9019766 this is a moment when principle and political independence matter
9019767 by choosing governor sarah palin as the vice presidential candidate john mccain once again demonstrates good judgment and a commitment to challenging politics as usual
9019768 truly none of this makes any sense this governor continues to try and expand medicaid programs but slashes funding for the department of children and family services and the department of human services he is balancing his bloated budget on the backs of some of our most vulnerable citizens
9019769 and tourism and recreation are important revenue generating businesses in illinois with rising gas prices people are staying closer to home and visiting our historic sites and utilizing our parks this governor is cutting off his nose to spite his face shuttering these sites will mean a significant loss of tax revenues
9019770 i was overwhelmed and amazed by the sheer energy of it
9019771 we are expecting a huge rise in demand for our film services
9019772 erics presence makes us an even more appealing resource by adding strength and a proven track record to the compositing side eric and i have worked together at the same studios at the same time but on different shows
9019773 our specialty is creating the kinds of visual effects that the audience is not even aware of
9019774 i am most passionate about working with directors and other artists and helping them to create spectacular visuals
9019775 with a twist has excellent resources and great talent and i feel that my skills and experience are an excellent fit with theirs i look forward to helping them develop their film services
9019776 the new muse composition engine is incredibly dynamic and powerful users can create a much wider range of soundtracks with greater control over creative elements they can also pop in a pre set track and fly through their project
9019777 we have made muse 2 0 so much more flexible and simpler to use video editors with little to no experience with soundtrack creation will be able to bring muse immediately into their video workflow and create royalty free soundtracks without having to spend a serious amount of time learning the controls for facilities and projects that house both video and audio post the muse integration with other professional soundtrack tools enhances the overall workflow video editors can get a jump start on the track while audio pros finesse the output muse file in their daw for finishing
9019778 i am blown away by muses simple interface its responsiveness to user settings and its ability to interpret a scenes footage
9019779 composers can break out of their normal creative habits using muse as a creative sketch pad to try out musical ideas very quickly

9019784 dan how do you keep your physique sonic the chicken place and now bonchon i am interested in the secret
9019785 let me date myself here while many significant events happened in my lifetime before this incident this is my first memory
9019786 john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time
9019787 today as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
9019788 you cant truly stand up for georgia when youve strained our oldest alliances
9019789 so let me spell out exactly what change would mean if i am president
9019790 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
9019791 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9019792 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb russian aggression i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease
9019793 i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy
9019794 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
9019795 we send our congratulations to governor sarah palin and her family on her designation as the republican nominee for vice president it is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9019796 we are hoping that our efforts in resolving the conflict in georgia will be acknowledged
9019797 we in alaska feel that crunch and are taking steps to address it right here at home
9019798 this is a tool that must be on the table to buy us time until our long term energy plans can be put into place we have already enjoyed the support of alaska senator ted stevens and it is gratifying to see senator obama get on board
9019799 she was able to talk that kid back into the appropriate behavior and she did it by conveying that she understood how he was feeling
9019800 she didnt have an air of status about her someone else had to tell me she was the wife of the senator

9019810 im not sure whether we are ahead of our time or whether it just took a long time for interest to build in what we do
9019811 i would describe the new album as very intense in its form
9019812 the atmospheres range between tranquil and totally barbaric its not a return to the past but the next step the continued progression and evolution of the band
9019813 the new album is not as dissonant as some of the past albums
9019814 it can make it easier for the layman to recognise and digest consonant melodies are much easier to recognise for the average person because they will have had a much higher level of association with them through the music they have heard during their lives but its not easy to listen to because the sound is very layered and requires concentration
9019815 pleased doesnt really describe the way we feel about conqueror
9019816 our reaction when we first heard it was numbness really none of us expected it to come out as great as it did
9019817 the guys and i did an amazing amount of work
9019818 when people hear it i think they will see the gates of slumber in a whole new light
9019819 getting great gigs in places like gothenburg rome or nuremberg a city where we can pull 200
9019820 you can see here this is what i pay and this is what they send me as reimbursement for it so i make seven dollars on this one i mean now our software is so sophisticated that throughout the day when a new prescription comes in i check and see what its really going to cost me and my programs update me on what its really going to cost so i know right then i mean its pretty easy to see a negative number and say im not going to be able to fill this one too much longer
9019821 people are spending money at the register that they dont realize theyre spending on overpriced over the counter items
9019822 so i guess i can just call about the next one
9019823 you can call up here and make an appointment any time
9019824 see this is what i was talking about these medicare seminars were doing are becoming very popular see most seniors dont realize that they need to pick a medicare plan within a certain timeframe if they dont they start getting penalized 1 for every month until they do some of these people have had this going on for 2 years and at 24 it may not every be worth them even signing up anymore
9019825 hes so frail he cant hear right now so his assistant was the one who sat down with him it takes him a while now to communicate his assistant was the one who was telling me all of this

9019831 i was playing very well but the greens were ridiculous
9019832 they were really bumpy all you could do is hit a good stroke and hope it was really really disappointing
9019833 im not going to smile because martin missed the cut but thats big news
9019834 i gave myself a talking to on the ninth and just tried to stay patient maybe i was trying too hard
9019835 i know its tight and i knew i had to be here at the weekend if i didnt it was pretty much over
9019836 if i can play great i still have a chance
9019837 but youre scared almost with putts of 20 feet or over
9019838 the scoring is not great and you can make a big move in a short time unfortunately im going to have to rely on some luck on the greens
9019839 right now it looks good i didnt feel quite as good today as i did yesterday but im onto something and feeling good about the game in general
9019840 there has been enthusiasm from local residents and the city council which provided the land for these homes
9019841 we need almost 30 000 more to meet our target of 350 000 by the groundbreaking on september 13 we invite the community to contribute and join us that day
9019842 most of these women have never done construction but they have a sense of adventure and the desire to help those less fortunate right here at home
9019843 these houses will provide shelter for a qualifying needy family local to monrovia
9019844 we are happy to be able to donate the land for these homes knowing it will change lives for the better and build an even stronger community

9019904 man in capitalist society confronts a reality made by himself as a class which appears to him to be a natural phenomenon alien to himself he is wholly at the mercy of its laws his activity is confined to the exploitation of the inexorable fulfilment of certain individual laws for his own egoistic interests but even while acting he remains in the nature of the case the object and not the subject of events

9019954 at the moment it seems relatively benign but there are dangers lurking
9019955 will comcast count some traffic against the cap but not other traffic as in comcast generated video
9019956 we think 250 gb is an extremely large amount of bandwidth
9019957 a low bandwidth user downloading an hd movie at 8 p m in peak time puts more stress on the network than someone who downloads lots more in the middle of the night
9019958 if fewer than 1 percent would be affected by this whats the point
9019959 if they are going to put caps then they need to give us what i think is an acceptable expectation a meter
9019960 figure out a way to tell us what is our monthly usage and let us know if we are running up against a 250 gb cap we know when to stop
9019961 if you believe the 0 05 kb e mail then you also believe in the tooth fairy
9019962 it remains unclear how the cap announced today helps solve comcasts supposed congestion problems
9019963 though the proposed cap is relatively high it will increasingly ensnare more users as technology continues its natural progression
9019964 i do not care whether or not this forum has loads of funky new features if no one can get to the site and or post anything whats the point
9019965 i would also like to register my disgust at whats been happening for several days and my sheer disappointment that oracle of all companies would allow an application to go live without thorough testing or if it was thoroughly tested in uat without rolling back immediately when it was obvious that there were problems in the production environment
9019966 uptime is still not where it should be of course forums oracle com is business critical for a lot of folks as well as for oracle and im glad they consider it so
9019967 we made a conscious decision early in this process to stick with the upgrade to fight through the problems instead of run from them

9019970 women voters are electrified and sarah is someone who is truly in sync with the way real american women think
9019971 the republicans seems to have overestimated the influence of gender on the voting behavior of women in a partisan context
9019972 sarah palin is clearly a beneficiary of these historic battles for gender equity but will not be perceived as their champion it feels a bit like a hail mary pass at the end of a football game and suggests great insecurity within the mccain camp fritz mondale picked geraldine ferraro as his running mate in 1984 when the odds of victory were heavily against him ferraro didnt help mondale in 1984 and i suspect that palins influence over this years outcome will be similarly weak
9019973 bold and extremely strategic giving the obama campaign no time to enjoy the success of their own party extravaganza
9019974 mccains selection of vice presidential running mates is very bold and extremely strategic he is targeting the disgruntled hillary vote at a time when the obama campaign seemed to take the independent womens vote for granted the democrats cant attack her too vehemently or else they could lose even more women swing voters they cant charge her with inexperience because of the senators own liabilities in that area mccain just changed the entire calculations of the election giving the obama campaign no time to enjoy the success of their own party extravaganza
9019975 mccain rolled the dice palin brings obvious strengths to the ticket
9019976 in picking sarah palin john mccain rolled the dice and shook up the presidential campaign
9019977 palin brings obvious strengths to the ticket a reform minded western governor with executive experience and a deep understanding of energy issues her son is soon to be deployed to iraq she has another child who had downs syndrome and her profile is a great fit with the mccain profile
9019978 on another level sen obamas selection of joe biden motivated this pick on a couple of levels by not selecting hillary clinton obama opened the door to the selection of a female candidate for mccain whats more by selecting a candidate from an electoral lightweight like delaware mccain was freer to select a running mate without reference to electoral power or strength and obamas relative lack of experience in elective office insulates palin from similar charges

9019983 osama bin laden has never lived in the americas but thanks to the slaughter he directed on september 11 2001 he became the most important u s elector by triggering bushs rise in the polls the greatest vote getter that mccain could hope for would be if bin laden would allow himself to be captured or if he carried out another massive attack
9019984 osama however must be wondering whether a victory for obama would be more dangerous to him than one by mccain since the african american will give the united states a new image and get the u s out of iraq to concentrate on hunting down and capturing him
