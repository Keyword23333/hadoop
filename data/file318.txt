3180000 law on his side and he didnt care about ashleys feelings
3180001 yep he sure does but hes a big boy gracie
3180002 i guess i do gracie and i have a big butt too
3180003 guess what life is going to smack us in the face with next
3180004 before we begin i would like you to stop and reflect on this one thought it may be the most important thing that you take away with you tonight
3180005 i have anywhere from 15 to a peak max of 30 traders all using the same meetme conf during the day my is running on a old 4u 500mhz machine dual board one processor installed now with the exception of of a few problems from software sip phones our implementation has been relatively problem free
3180006 measured for about a 12 hour period and over 5000 total phone calls per day with this server you can see the load average jump from 0 00 to 6 25 in a matter of a minute
3180007 the load is extremely depandant upon what you are doing with it for example a simple ivr zap t1 channels only system can handle 10 times the number of consecutive calls of a sip amp zap conference call system at least in my experience
3180008 dual xeon 3 06 120 channels 60 calls with h 323 g 729 using less than 10 cpu no transcoding is being performed
3180009 look for the recent capacity testing thread weve had some discussions on it but so far the bottom line sounds like you wont be able to run more than 20 25 decent quality calls before asterisk dies when transcoding and h323 are involved
3180010 i read somewhere that one of our associates here has experienced about 45 calls when transcoding the question becomes if this is all we can do with one server what is the point of getting 4 e1s digium card while one can never be able to use 120 channels transcoding from voip to tdm
3180011 my rule of thumb has been 100 g 729 channels for a dual 3 0ghz xeon machine cost around 42 per channel i buy scsi systems with raid and that includes the 10 charge for the g 729 license not including digium 4 t1 e1 card your mileage may vary in both performance and price cost for an as5300 style solution around 110 per channel and thats on the used market pricing plan
3180012 i know its late but i just wanted to say thanks for coming to see me ill call you tomorrow so we can have a chat and plan doctors visits and so on im very happy for both of you and im very excited to help to give the ultimate gift and happiness to the most wonderful people will forever bring a smile to my face have a good night ill call you tomorrow
3180013 i have definitively weakened our status in the world to the point where we can do nothing about aggression but whine feebly were it not for my brilliant policy of getting the worlds mightiest military bogged down in an endless unnecessary war in iraq the world might still give a crap what we think thankfully that is not the case
3180014 the russian invasion of georgia unthinkable eight years ago is against all international laws and norms i have made this once unchallenged superpower so weak theres absolutely nothing we can do about it from iran to russia to venezuela no evil government is afraid of us at all to our friends like georgia youre on your own this is my legacy to the american people the historic moment when we realized we were impotent on the world stage and everyone else realized it too i promise to make inneffectual pronouncements in the coming days and weeks and hopefully russia will withdraw when theyve decided they met every one of the goals of their illegal aggression
3180015 its not easy to erase the political and military influence of a superpower thankfully we learned the lessons of vietnam it can be done just get bogged down in occupying a small country for a long time i have promised to continue all the policies of this administration that made this possible iraq has been a harsh message to our enemies if you are an agressor the us military is stuck in iraq and isnt leaving anytime soon take that bitches if elected i promise to have all options available for dealing with our enemies from doing nothing to whining impotently if you like what bush did for america vote for me
3180016 it could be a required or optional change but it has to occur to a band after they have released their first album there are so many candidates to choose from but list the band and the singer since some bands have had more than one primary lead singer change in their history i e van halen with sammy hagar
3180017 bitte nicht einsteigen und alles aussteigen wir haben eine betriebsst rung
3180018 well thats the first fuckin hole ive ever had to dig
3180019 sen mccain is clearly willing to note who he thinks is the aggressor here
3180020 i dont think you can excuse defend explain or make allowance for russian behavior because of what is going on in georgia
3180021 thats kind of like saying after saddam hussein invaded kuwait that kuwait and iraq need to show restraint or like saying in 1968 when the soviet union invaded czechoslovakia that the czechoslovaks should show restraint
3180022 sesungguhnya allah bila menyukai sebuah kaum maka dia akan menurunkan cobaan kepada mereka maka barangsiapa yang ridha dengan ujian itu maka keridhaan allah baginya dan barangsiapa yang membenci maka kebencian pula yang akan dia terima
3180023 orang yang paling berat menerima cobaan adalah para nabi kemudia orang orang terbaik setelah mereka seseorang dicoba sesuai dengan kadar keagamannya cobaan itu akan senantiasa diturunkan kepada hamba sehingga ia dibiarkan berjalan diatas bumi tanpa menanggung satu kesalahan pun
3180024 sungguh unik perkara orang mukmin itu semua perkaranya adalah baik jika mendapat kebaikan ia bersyukur maka itu menjadi sebuah kebaikan baginya dan jika ditimpa musibah ia bersabar maka itu juga menjadi sebuah kebaikan baginya
3180025 orang orang shaleh mendapat cobaan kemudian orang orang yang terbaik setelah mereka lalu yang terbaik setelah mereka al hadist

3180051 their language resembles somewhat that of the adighe they are distinguished from their neighbors by their social democratic organization and their physiognomical and bodily construction the expression of their irregular features is ferocious of medium height and thin they are vindictive bloodthirsty robbers and without faith having only vegetated for centuries they have hardly any history christianity was first introduced into abkhazia by the emperor justinianus but showing little fruit queen thamar had this people baptized again the advent of the turks however frustrated her object and the abkhaz became mohammedans they remained notwithstanding all these changes attached throughout to their ancient customs and idols they have a great veneration for old trees particularly oaks and every tribe possesses one of these sacred trees
3180052 this is probably a conflict where the united states would not be accepted by both sides as a mediator
3180053 the georgians would welcome american participation i suspect the russians would probably not accept us because in moscow we are seen as too close to georgia
3180054 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
3180055 no country of the former soviet union has made more progress toward consolidating democracy eradicating corruption and building an independent foreign policy than georgia
3180056 this conflict is therefore about our common trans atlantic values of liberty and democracy
3180057 you talk about the americans of course they are in a sense part of the conflict that is why we must emphasise the presence and the strength of the european union
3180058 we and the europeans have leverage the russians know how seriously we take the situation

3180087 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3180088 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3180089 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3180090 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3180091 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3180094 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3180095 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3180096 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3180133 in the instance at hand the consequences are that your grades will suffer diminution

3180163 for advertisers to prosper they need competitive markets we think google is a fantastic company our sense is that if the transaction with yahoo proceeds theres the potential the development of yahoo ad system panama and other competing systems will atrophy over time
3180164 we like to see a healthy market with lots of players and competition
3180165 if this gives more volume than converts its a good thing for advertisers

3180168 if this gives more volume than converts its a good thing for advertisers
3180169 the advertiser will find itself spending more for the same amount of clicks because theyre coming from the most expensive part of the ecosystem
3180170 we dont know how much yahoo is going to implement this
3180171 we think this is making the pie bigger and helping advertisers by making sure their ads are matched better
3180172 what worries me is wheres the r amp d going into the next generation of search
3180173 theres enough choice in the marketplace that if you want to find a consumer you dont have to use search alone

3180188 we felt that men were playing a much more involved role in the home than was being portrayed in society
3180189 you see a lot of marketing directed toward mothers but we felt theres an increasing role that men are playing in families
3180190 ten or 15 years ago car companies were speaking primarily to men and assuming men were making the majority of car purchasing decisions only for research to show that women were really weighing in
3180191 i think the same is true for a lot of home decor and other home brands when it comes to speaking to men they want their home to reflect their personality as well
3180192 it should not have been a big wow that men were embracing their feminine side in 2003
3180193 if you go to the supermarket on the weekend its 40 percent male and theyre buying comparable goods to women
3180194 theres been a blurring of gender roles over the last decade and we have to think of who the homemaker is 25 years ago the homemaker was june cleaver but today it could be anybody we have to appeal to him or her thats the starting point and i dont think any brands are necessarily talking about the new homemakers
3180195 were intimidated by cleaning because we dont know how to do it
3180196 if you demystify it and we think we can do it faster and easier were on it
3180197 we have seen across all of home care that the male consumer is increasing in prevalence and ease of use
3180198 we talk about size of prize where are the largest consumer groups that we need to target and we really find that the women consumer is boss for the most part we think that women are making or influencing purchasing decisions
3180199 citrus mixed with green notes and a watery fresh impression
3180200 that story is really echoed in last years fragrance launches in cleaners theres a very similar fragrance story in mens fine fragrance and many of the new citrus scents in cleaners
3180201 you could make deductions on your own but in studying the category we would not say were seeing activity that specifically speaks to casting the net for cleaning products beyond women head of households to include men
3180202 however that being said there are these mega trends out there in the world that are totally gender neutral that are certainly hitting the cleaner category
3180203 im a single guy and i do theyre definitely a demographic that were aware of and watching but the lions share of the shopping within this category is being done by women head of households and even if shes not out there buying it shes a key influencer on the men in her life
3180204 packs 400 inch pounds of torque into a 4 pound package
3180205 is what we call permission to play in new categories for men
3180206 its very much in the realm of performance to get men to buy
3180207 you cant necessarily talk about thread count the way you can with women and get men to buy the sheets it might be telling men that they want the 200 thread count so they can get the size 2 girl
3180208 what we want to do is give men more permission to care about this stuff
3180209 children of the 70s and 80s are coming to their household formation stage and the landscape is much different those younger men have come to accept that there are jobs that they have to do as a household like cooking cleaning and housework and that those things will be shared
3180210 is no longer seen as an emasculating thing to be in the kitchen
3180211 was seen as a bit effete and appealed much more to a female audience

3180219 we would never want to intentionally upset or leave out a gender
3180220 the reason we say mom is because when we did the online customer research before we created the home line we asked both genders to participate but the majority of people who got back to us were mothers
3180221 its not the 19th century they dont need us in some fundamental ways so we have to step up
3180222 marriage is more fragile and if men want to have kids and stay married they have to pick up the slack
3180223 if youre courting young women its a good idea to say that you cook
3180224 youll get two people in your corner the woman and her mother wholl say he cooks hes a keeper

3180312 hes remarkable achievements in advancing australias foreign policy interests in the pacific region over a period of more than 20 years serving successive australian governments were recognised with the awarding to him in 2001 of the public service medal for his outstanding contribution to the development of australias relationship with the pacific
3180313 on behalf of the australian government i extend my deepest sympathy to mr urwins family at this very sad time for them
3180314 they can however be justly proud of gregs exceptional career and the enduring contribution he has made to developing and strengthening the relations between the countries and peoples of the pacific a region of fundamental importance to australia
3180315 in 1980s about 80 per cent of the total milk was produced by large milk suppliers who made 20 per cent of the total number of the farmers engaged in milk production supply to rewa factory and 20 per cent of the total milk came from small producers who were 80 per cent of the total dairy farmers
3180316 and today we have about equal 50 50 contribution to the total production by the small and large milk producers
3180317 we expect in future more and more smallholder milk producers will contribute to the nations total milk production
3180318 milk production from smallholders when compared to large producers is totally a different ball game
3180319 generally they produce milk for their home consumption and would like to sell surplus for some extra income

3180340 we will spend less this year than last year and that is a rarity in government
3180341 it would be utterly unacceptable for russia to try and destabilise a democratically elected government on its border with a view to any sort of regime change
3180342 the international community would view that extraordinarily dimly and would have diplomatic consequences for russia
3180343 the consequences for world security human rights and energy security are tremendous and huge

3180347 e xpanding nato would be the most fateful error of american policy in the entire post cold war era
3180348 confrontational rhetoric notwithstanding russias leaders are conscious of their strategic limitations indeed i would characterize russian policy under putin as driven in a quest for a reliable strategic partner with america being the preferred choice but the movement of the western security system from the elbe river to the approaches to moscow brings home russias decline in a way bound to generate a russian emotion that will inhibit the solution of all other issues it should be kept on the table without forcing the issue to determine the possibilities of making progress on other issues

3180356 mary kate olsen deserves a lot of credit for taking a stand against these vile and diabolical agents of the state who if for no other reason want to prosecute anyone for any reason whether they did have anything to do with mr ledgers death or not
3180357 shes absolutely doing the right thing by refusing to cooperate with them
3180358 we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death
3180359 a nd the fact is that ms olsen does not kow the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
3180360 what happened to ledger was a tragedy thats a given
3180361 its been long accepted since the release of the coroners autopsy results that he died of a lethal yet accidental overdose of drugs that his body couldnt handle we can reasonably conclude that he was abusing those drugs even though they were except for two fake prescriptions legally prescribed but the truth of the matter is that despite this horrible tragedy it was ledgers fault for getting himself killed he could have gotten help at any point in time before this happened hes to blame for his own death not mary kate olsen or anybody else for that matter
3180362 the fact that these federal goons want to coerce her to stand before a federal judge and a grand jury on the suspicion that she might have had something to do with his accidental death shows exactly how self righteous and repugnant these people are
3180363 she had nothing to do with his death theres no evidence proving that she is somehow guilty of any involvement in his death all the rumors and claims to the contrary are purely circumstantial
3180364 todays cops in the united states and everywhere else are trained to arrest people whether they commit any crimes or not not to keep the peace or provide assistance as they used to do decades ago
3180365 not only that they are trained to use anything against you whether youre under arrest or not also their interrogation techniques are devised to make you incriminate yourself whether youre guilty or not mary kate obviously understands this therefore she deserves the accolades for her action there i hope other americans will do the same thing that she did
3180366 the states obsession with olsen is positive proof that the war on drugs has become out of control and it needs to stop
3180367 its time to end the war on drugs at the federal state and local levels this unnecessary further investigation of ledgers demise is not an investigation at all but rather a government witchhunt against a hollywood actress whom they think must be guilty because of her platonic relationship with ledger and that she must have supplied him with the drugs its time to pull the plug on this program now once and for all
3180368 he gave me all his personal belongings and said goodbye to me
3180369 he took off because he knew if he got caught hed go back to jail
3180370 in his eyes he was either going to die or go to jail and he chose to die
3180371 it is simply unfair for any patient to receive an excessive and surprise medical bill
3180372 it is unconscionable that low income families are exposed to aggressive tactics threats to their credit and improper and coercive billing practices designed to intimidate them into making excessive payments they are not obligated to pay i urge the governor to sign this bill into law
3180373 families enrolled in these two programs are in low to moderate income working families already struggling to make ends meet
3180374 they should never be charged more than their co pay just because through no fault of their own they ended up with an out of network radiologist or anesthesiologist
3180375 if you look at full auctioning of permits what happens
3180376 the day that they are auctioned you have a net transfer of wealth from the private sector to the public sector at that moment what then happens to climate change nothing has happened you have just had a transfer of wealth
3180377 is it wise to have a propane facility of this kind immediately adjacent to residential properties
3180378 obviously in light of what happened the answer is no
3180379 the yard had a right to be there a legal right
3180380 were going to investigate whether thats appropriate from the citys perspective were also going to work with the provincial regulator who oversees these kinds of facilities to make sure the regulations are being followed and are adequate to protect torontonians
3180381 at the federal level there are rules that govern the transportation of dangerous and toxic compounds and that includes propane
3180382 when a city is looking at where theyre going to locate a facility all of those federal rules and regulations are applied but its up to the city to actually make the rules
3180383 we have very strict regulations in place and a very robust safety system
3180384 if this is a 1 6 kilometre area of evacuation why isnt the propane yard 1 6 kilometres away
3180385 i was very surprised to the see the pictures of the explosion
3180386 its very typical of what youd normally see in this type of the facility when things go awry
3180387 something like 500 people died in that explosion and in toronto it could have been as bad as that
3180388 were just fortunate that our fire department was able to get a lot of water on these tanks when flame impinges on these pressurized tanks they literally explode sending shrapnel in all sorts of areas
3180389 we know people are probably expecting a cheese fest and thats just not what we do
3180390 the truth is jeff and i write how we write
3180391 everythings got to come out of real emotion we want to deal with issues and show consequences but not the issue of the week and pound you over the head
3180392 they were able to develop such a loyal fan base
3180393 this has the glitz of an aaron spelling show but at the same time gabe and jeff have taken it and given it a sense of humor they really flip it on its ear sometimes
3180394 as long as it doesnt hit you over the head
3180395 i think its important to show what kids really use
3180396 things can take a turn and you can get a big head or get jaded
3180397 the next two weeks were going to be unveiling more and more ads and everybody that we talk to is saying get ready get ready
3180398 and were all like where are we going to hide
3180399 engineers have pinpointed the issue causing the 502 errors and it looks as if users should start to regain normal functioning of their account thanks for being patient while we worked to sort out this problem
3180400 placing first and primary emphasis on dollars rather than human values
3180401 liberal pushing for tax increases and higher education improvements advancing civil liberties and human rights setting aside thousands of acres for wilderness protections and embracing the very concept of government
3180402 progress and they interpreted it as expanding prosperity and realizing human potential for all minnesotans not just protecting the property rights and incomes of the ownership class
3180403 good government principles of accountability and efficiency and for modernization
3180404 living within its means and was enormously popular with business leaders
3180405 price of government under carlson and tax rankings that put minnesota near the top five states minnesotas economy outperformed the nations during the 90s and dramatically overachieved compared with low tax midwestern states
3180406 no new taxes religion took hold and a government slashing and rebate mentality prevailed minnesotas total revenues as a percentage of personal income are at their lowest level in decades and interestingly the states economy is underperforming the nations for the first time in decades
3180407 i have often defended government against uninformed claims that it is wasteful or that its work is insignificant

3180417 ronald weinland stated that the reason that there are many cog groups today is that
3180418 i have denounced at least 6 individuals who claim to be prophets and 2 who claim to be apostles that also claim to be part of the church of god thus i am not just reporting about him and his group though not the living church of god

3180420 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light save it for 2050
3180421 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3180422 couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution
3180423 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from specific decisions she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make
3180424 her hesitancy and habit of avoiding hard choices exacted a price that eventually sank her chances at the presidency
3180425 clintons top advisers never agreed on the answer over the course of the campaign they split into competing factions that drifted in and out of clintons favor but always seemed to work at cross purposes and clinton herself could never quite decide who was right
3180426 this decree seeks to protect enhance and in some cases restore the trust that our faith calls for between the church and the children and adolescents entrusted to their care

3180447 i think that the public is going to decide this on a very simple basis
3180448 they know that the city council is lying to them in saying this is a fee not a tax and they resent having their vote taken away from them as guaranteed by the taxpayer bill of rights

3180458 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3180459 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3180460 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
3180461 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos
3180462 celebrar n consultas y cooperar n de buena fe con los pueblos ind genas interesados por conducto de sus propias instituciones representativas a fin de obtener su consentimiento libre e informado antes de aprobar cualquier proyecto que afecte a sus tierras o territorios y otros recursos particularmente en relaci n con el desarrollo la utilizaci n o la explotaci n de recursos minerales h dricos o de otro tipo
3180463 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
3180464 por un mundo sano convocada por la conferencia de religiosos y religiosas conferre de la di cesis de copiap
3180465 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3180466 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3180467 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3180468 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3180469 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3180470 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3180471 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3180472 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3180473 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3180474 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3180475 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3180476 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3180477 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3180478 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
3180479 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro

3180484 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3180485 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3180486 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3180487 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3180488 umbral de un verdadero golpe de estado contra el orden constitucional
3180489 al t pico estilo de las dictaduras que precedieron a la recuperaci n de la democracia en 1982
3180490 toman aeropuertos toman cortes departamentales electorales y balean carros coches de ministros
3180491 las fuerzas armadas son los garantes de la democracia concepto que incluye el precepto constitucional de garantizar la estabilidad del gobierno legalmente constituido sea el actual o cualquier otro que recoja la voluntad del pueblo que es el gran soberano
3180492 los resultados del proceso cualquiera que estos fueran con la mayor cordura y sentido de responsabilidad
3180493 como en cada caso de violaci n a los derechos humanos exijamos juicio y castigo digamos ni perd n ni olvido y rechacemos la impunidad

3180497 doth ease its heart of love in i am gone
3180498 why do i know ye why have i seen ye why
3180499 to me his arms were spread to me his voice
3180500 art thou too near such doom vague fear there is
3180501 my life is but the life of winds and tides
3180502 shall i say crouch ye groan what can i then
3180503 and first as thou wast not the first of powers
3180504 now comes the pain of truth to whom tis pain
3180505 of what i heard and how it made me weep
3180506 full of calm joy it was as i of grief
3180507 and a wave filld it as my sense was filld
3180508 o joy for now i see ye are not lost
3180509 now ye are flames ill tell you how to burn
3180510 thy name is on my tongue i know not how
3180511 why should i tell thee what thou so well seest
3180512 why should i strive to show what from thy lips
3180513 like one who once had wings o why should i
3180514 what are the stars there is the sun the sun
3180515 the sands of thy short life are spent this hour
3180516 what am i that should so be saved from death
3180517 thy fated hour that thou hadst power to do so
3180518 they come not here they have no thought to come
3180519 and thou art here for thou art less than they
3180520 though i breathe death with them it will be life
3180521 will i be kind to thee for thy good will
3180522 doth ease its heart of love in moan and wail
3180523 still suck their fill of light from sun and moon
3180524 still buds the tree and still the sea shores murmur
3180525 no smell of death there shall be death moan moan
3180526 moan moan for still i thaw or give me help
3180527 where roofd in by black rocks they waste in pain
3180528 tierra que la forestales las adquirieron bajo leyes de la dictadura de pinochet a costa de negarle el derechos hist rico sobre la tierra a las comunidades mapuche
3180529 valorar lo alcanzado producto una lucha que muchos han pagados con c rceles y condena inesperada pero que nada es en vano por que la unidad de todas la luchas sociales en alg n momento de nuestra historia derrotara al sistema opresor neoliberal y pasada las elecciones municipales de octubre viviremos un chile distinto y nosotros la izquierda lo mapuche seguiremos avanzando en un proyecto de sociedad que contemple definitivamente nuestro territorio y autonom a

3180533 las personas privadas extranjeras que operan en el pa s como es la empresa manquiri subsidiaria de la minera americana coeur dalene como en el presente caso y que tienen adem s instancias encargadas de velar que el desempe o de sus inversiones es la tarea de opic no derive en da os a las comunidades ind genas y originaria son bien acogidas sus iniciativas de soluci n de conflictos que permitan alcanzar una real y efectiva restituci n de los derechos vulnerados o en riesgo de ser vulnerados
3180534 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales

3180538 this was an honest mistake on my part and i take full responsibility for it
3180539 this is in no way should reflect badly on either the city of elgin or the chicago bandits ballclub they are both outstanding organizations i have enjoyed serving the city as a councilman and will miss doing the job
3180540 i think its a sad situations for the city to have that happen
3180541 he brought a fresh outlook as to how the city markets itself
3180542 mike has done a very good job for the city of elgin and has been a big reason why we moved to the city
3180543 hey this is bitter but its the right medicine in the long run
3180544 we are very interested in the techniques of planting cassava producing alcohol from cassava and the exploitation and utilization of other agricultural products
3180545 well just off the top of my head i find it interesting that all these people are ranting and raving about saving the environment when theyll probably blow like ten thousand pounds of fuel on their private jet planes getting down to cabo this weekend

3180548 one of the attributes the next mca president should have is the ability to speak out for the
3180549 why are you on the phone were in a competition weve got another dive to do
3180550 as it became apparent they werent going to continue to function they decided to sell off the license we swooped in and grabbed it we took no assets there was nothing to be had to be honest were building everything from the ground up
3180551 youll venture through space exploring new civilizations and life forms
3180552 youll also beam down to planets and have adventures inside your ship its a galactic wide game theres going to be tons of space to investigate we have a great system for exploration which will allow for almost infinite possibilities
3180553 there might be a ship called enterprise flying around but its probably not the same ship anymore
3180554 most of the characters will have either retired or passed on but youll definitely be going to all the places you know and love from star trek expect to see oldies like vulcan and bajor but also fan favorites like andoria and qonos
3180555 youre going to see the actual game working and functioning
3180556 this isnt renders this isnt concept art everything that people will see on sunday is going to be taken right from star trek online as it stands today so hardened people should know that a release date might be closer than they think
3180557 schweitzer asserts that the women are in fact more motivated by the personal than the political
3180558 our approach to security software and optimization tools has been to offer consumers the flexibility to choose an appropriate solution whether it is a combination of standalone products or a comprehensive and fully integrated package to meet individual consumer needs
3180559 our approach to the 2009 range is no exception to this philosophy
3180560 its going to be in the orchards and its going to bear some wonderful fruit when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river and all the placentas of all that tribe all that clan whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength this tree was just growing taller and stronger above the rest of mother nature around it it was gorgeous
3180561 it clearly is going to be difficult to get a loan the fed cutting rates doesnt help a lot when you cant get a lender to make a loan
3180562 and further by these my son be admonished of making of many blogs there is no end and of much reading of blogs is a weariness of the flesh
3180563 the most obvious consequence is the cost associated with hiring the 26th employee
3180564 the colorado springs chamber knows a good business opportunity when it sees one and fixing roads with no tolls or new taxes is good business
3180565 were thrilled that the pikes peak business community has joined leaders from the west slope and around colorado in throwing its considerable weight behind this pro jobs pro growth measure
3180566 im excited that the colorado springs chamber has endorsed our proposal to start fixing colorados roads and bridges
3180567 amendment 52 presents a unique opportunity to invest existing state revenues in transportation and to keep colorado moving
3180568 make no mistake about it the push to pass amendment 52 is a statewide effort and its gaining momentum in a big way
3180569 were honored to have the endorsement of the springs chamber and theres a whole lot more like it to come
3180570 my wife and i have travelled to reside in england
3180571 if i still have luck i would come back to die on thai soil like every other thai person what happened to my family is like fruit from a poisonous tree the fruit will also be poisoned
3180572 there is a continuation of dictatorship managing thai politics which is followed by interference in the justice system these are my political enemies they do not care about the rule of law facts or internationally recognised due process
3180573 clearly thaksin is very angry by the way things have turned out he is obviously extremely emotional theres a fighting tone hes not given up completely
3180574 this isnt all that different from the oil crisis in the 70s in terms of the response of consumers to driving less to changing the cars they purchase
3180575 i have no plans to do a lot of long distance driving until gas can come down a little more
3180576 i noticed every day as i go by the gas keeps going down in prices
3180577 for the same reason it went up nobody really knows
3180578 its what 40 cents where am i gonna spend that take it down to 2 dollars so i can go some place
3180579 it was good to see him smacking that ball into the net like that
3180580 i was lifted by the fact they were so positive and showed such resolve after what was frankly the embarrassment of athens it was entertaining to watch and i liked the way they just seemed ready for it
3180581 i understand that comes with the territory because past champions tested positive for drugs
3180582 the olympic champion does have to be clean and then to be able to prove it
3180583 people will always speculate about drugs and they know what im doing in the us where im getting drug tested a lot
3180584 i dont know how usain is taking this but i assume its a lot of pressure
3180585 people in his country are expecting him to come home with that gold medal i assume its the same for asafa
3180586 we wont see a clean olympic 100m champion not even a single clean participant no doubt about it
3180587 insulin helps after training together with protein drinks it transports proteins and minerals faster through the cell membrane
3180588 its a very expensive option but again it would be an option if we were allowed to speak to the lad
3180589 if that happened then who knows but as far as were concerned weve made contact with chelsea and thats where it lies at the moment
3180590 i asked giovanni for advice and he spoke to me as a friend and not as a fan
3180591 he told me that glasgow was a nice city and that i would have absolutely no problems here
3180592 we are different players and time will tell but i will obviously do my best to show that i can do as well as carlos or mikel arteta former rangers midfielder now with everton
3180593 however at the moment i am thinking only of the future and i feel that barcelona is in my past right now i am thinking only of playing now for celtic
3180594 will feels it is an injustice and he is down about the decision
3180595 the celtic player has a handful of his shirt and actually loses his balance
3180596 they solve their symptoms they make them feel good and they essentially want to stay on them forever because once they go off them acid reflux returns
3180597 there may be patients who have very mild symptoms of heartburn who while they get relief from these medications may find they get equally good relief with less aggressive medications
3180598 i get the pains in my bones i can feel the bone pain
3180599 i think the first thing we need to do is stop the medicine altogether
3180600 its amazing that youre trying to take care of one situation and youre causing a problem in another area
3180601 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3180602 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3180603 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3180604 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3180605 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3180606 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3180607 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3180608 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3180609 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3180610 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3180611 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3180612 could be done for the season after suffering a subluxation of the tendon in his right middle finger saturday night
3180613 i really dont know any intercostal or ribcage or oblique area its hard to put a timetable on it i think its definitely a good sign that i felt better today than yesterday
3180614 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
3180615 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it

3180619 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
3180620 its a synchro team theres two of us and thats the hard thing about it
3180621 both of you have to be on your game at the same time and that just didnt happen today
3180622 he had a pop at me before the last dive when we were sitting down i saw my mum in the audience and i asked her to give me a call and tom went to me why are you on the phone were still in the competition and weve got another dive to do thats just thomas hes over nervous and thats how it was today thomas should not be worrying about what im doing but today he was worrying about everyone and everything and that to me is really the sole reason why he didnt perform today
3180623 but it was a great experience and i really enjoyed myself i had so much fun out there thats all you can ask getting the experience we just had a bad day i tried to not make it feel different but there was lots of pressure on me and i was very nervous it was there for the taking but it wasnt my day today now im looking at 2012 like ive always said
3180624 and i hope he takes a lot of experience from this and that it stands him in good stead unfortunately i dont have another chance

3180626 the process of awarding earmarks is broken and in need of reform to rebuild americans confidence and trust in the federal government
3180627 moratorium slattery proposes a one year moratorium on earmarks to allow congress to pass meaningful earmark reform legislation meaningful earmark reform legislation should include the awarding of projects based on merit and full disclosure of requested projects by members of congress prohibition slattery endorses the plan proposed by house republicans to prohibit monuments to me lawmakers should not be allowed to name projects that they have funded after themselves funding for too long earmarks have allowed funding to be distributed without scrutiny slattery s proposal dictates that federal spending should be done on a competitive basis and that funds should be award on the merits of the project accountability a provision in the honest and open government act requires members of congress to identify what earmarks they requested received funding this is not enough slattery proposes that members of congress be required to disclose their request for an earmark within 48 hours transparency members must also submit a plan for how the money will be spent to ensure that taxpayers dollars are being responsibly and justifiably spent

3180833 the huge inflows of investment to support the olympics and recreate beijing have had an important ripple effect on economic growth not simply in beijing but in areas surrounding the capital the beijing statistical bureau estimates that spending on the olympics has added 2 5 percent annually to beijings overall economic growth since 2002
3180834 though china has experienced some significant hardships this spring the games will probably be even more important to the country than initially expected
3180835 i am anticipating a two way boom for both companies in china and in any country after the olympic games
3180836 when i conducted my interviews with chinese execs in january i was impressed by the short term focus that everyone had there was a strong sense of taking advantage of new opportunities now it was interesting because traditionally you think of china as a culture with a long term focus

3180843 i just met with my national security team to discuss the situation in georgia i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening the georgian capital tblisi
3180844 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3180845 would be inconsistent with assurances that we have received from russia that its objectives were limited

3180852 st marys has had a deputy registrar office since the memory of man runneth not to the contrary we find ourselves in a somewhat unique situation here in western auglaize county

3180854 we have to do whatever we can to keep that in st marys

3180947 the rudd labor government is getting on with the job of implementing the 2 2 billion worth of new housing measures announced in the may budget
3180948 this roundtable is a terrific way of informing other levels of government developers and the community about our housing agenda which will help make housing more affordable again
3180949 i congratulate local federal mp sharon grierson for her initiative in holding this important event
3180950 our housing affordability problem has taken a decade to develop and it wont be fixed overnight
3180951 the current housing undersupply is driving up both housing prices and rent
3180952 this is a great example of government and business working together to tackle the challenges faced by small businesses in remote locations
3180953 the result is real benefits to communities in the form of sustainable jobs and enterprises
3180954 well soon be opening a remote enterprise centre in alice springs as part of the national enterprise connect network the aim of enterprise connect is to link small and medium sized businesses to ideas technologies and markets
3180955 desert knowledge australias linking business networks lines up perfectly with this goal and im pleased that weve been able to support this initiative in partnership with the aboriginals benefit account and private sector partners
3180956 dhimurru has been preserving nature and the local yolgnu culture for the last 16 years in north east arnhem land
3180957 the government is very pleased that rio tinto alcan is also making a significant contribution to building the new headquarters
3180958 dhimurru is providing on the job training in literacy and numeracy business administration and indigenous leadership
3180959 this training develops greater confidence and skills for the staff to represent yolngu interests
3180960 the rangers are doing incredibly valuable work out on country and sea and are community and yolngu role models
3180961 the government is getting on with the job of implementing the new measures for housing affordability that were announced in the may budget
3180962 older australians who are struggling to find affordable housing in their communities will benefit from the governments 623 million investment in a new national rental affordability scheme which will help to build 50 000 new affordable rental properties around australia
3180963 rent for these properties will be 20 per cent below the market rate for eligible tenants if demand for rental properties is still strong a further 50 000 properties will be built from 2012 onwards
3180964 the reason i held this forum was to talk to the community about their changing housing needs
3180965 like many parts of australia my electorate has an increasing proportion of people over 55 years old and they are finding it harder than ever to access affordable and suitable housing
3180966 i am keen to ensure that residents of my electorate take advantage of the opportunities provided through the governments housing agenda
3180967 that is why i was so pleased that housing minister tanya plibersek was able to talk about new programs like the national rental affordability scheme today

3180974 the australian government recognises the importance of the youth voice on various issues facing the world today and supports the international leadership and participation of young australians
3180975 the current generation of young australians does not have to wait its turn to participate in public debate and discussion
3180976 the sports leadership grants for women program is one important way the government is addressing the under representation of women in sport
3180977 these grants will enable more women to undertake accredited sports leadership training in areas where they traditionally tend to be under represented
3180978 for example a grant to the lakemba sports and recreation club in sydney will help the club train 60 women in a soccer coaching course significantly all the women are from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds where sport is not a traditional pathway for women

3181009 russian forces came to the central route and cut off connections between western and eastern georgia
3181010 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia

3181012 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3181013 let me know if you can post about the site
3181014 let me know if you are going to write about this in your newspaper column
3181015 we have had an excellent month of new business in northern europe a record for the company and clear evidence of a renewed confidence in isoft

3181019 for example volunteering builds social capital within communities and makes australia a stronger country in which to live and the voluntary work that many of our senior australians do really is invaluable
3181020 the welfare and care of the residents is our primary concern i am also concerned to ensure that staff are supported and looked after that is why we are working with uniting aged care to ensure that residents of bridgewater continue to receive the high standard of care they deserve
3181021 the engagement of uniting aged care will also benefit the employees of bridgewater who will be able to continue to deliver quality aged care confident that their salary wages and other employee entitlements will continue to be met
3181022 uniting aged care has extensive experience in the delivery of aged care in victoria they currently operate a number of residential aged care services and care for several hundred residents across the state

3181035 the report is a valuable contribution to assist the government develop its approach to the reform of australias privacy regime
3181036 my office strongly supports these three key elements which we believe are necessary to ensure australias privacy law meets the challenges of the years ahead
3181037 the governments commitment to prioritise and work on a unified set of privacy principles as well as new health and credit regulations within the next 18 months is welcome
3181038 the privacy act has worked pretty well to date but it now needs a host of refinements to help us navigate the information superhighway these days information privacy touches almost every aspect of our daily lives including our medical records and health status our finances and creditworthiness the personal details collected and stored on a multiplicity of public and corporate databases and even the ability to control the display and distribution of our own images
3181039 during our extensive consultations around the country the overwhelming message we heard was that australians do care about privacy and they want a simple workable system that provides effective solutions and protections
3181040 at the same time people appreciate that other interests often come into the balance such as freedom of speech child protection law enforcement and national security australians also want the considerable benefits of the information age such as shopping and banking online and communicating instantaneously with friends and family around the world and of course businesses want to be able to market effectively to current and potential customers and to process data efficiently including offshore
3181041 a one size fits all approach could never work so we have endeavoured to craft sensible solutions to the various particular problems in many cases this will involve the privacy commissioner providing education and guidance to individuals businesses and government agencies but in other circumstances stronger action and sanctions may be required
3181042 were opening our doors to the public for the first time in two years so they can find out what were doing to help stop climate change and so the kids and the young at heart can have a bit of fun with science
3181043 people will be able to view our solar field and go into labs and see some of our experiments into clean coal and smarter energy systems
3181044 were opening our doors to the public for the first time in two years so they can find out what were doing to help stop climate change and so the kids and the young at heart can have a bit of fun with science
3181045 were particularly catering for the kids with the inclusion of science shows and hands on activities its an interactive and exciting way to demonstrate basic scientific principles and get kids excited about learning
3181046 well be asking visitors to build a catapult from paddle pop sticks rubber bands and sticky tape so were expecting some interesting results
3181047 this is an ideal chance for people living in the hunter to have a look around the energy centre and meet some of the people behind our energy research
3181048 the meeting provided an important opportunity for the commonwealth nations to harness the excitement and energy of the olympic games and utilise sport to bring about positive outcomes in health education and community wellbeing
3181049 sport can be used as a mechanism for social change and economic advancement particularly in developing nations
3181050 the meeting provided an excellent opportunity for commonwealth countries to show leadership and assist each other tackle common issues through sport
3181051 the nation august 1 2008 is both regrettable and undermines the efforts of the new distinguished thai foreign minister to settle the problem existing over thailands claims on some overlapping zone near the preah vihear temple
3181052 all australians are immensely proud of you know that their thoughts and best wishes go with as you compete against the worlds finest athletes over the coming weeks
3181053 the australian olympic team is here in force and ready to give it their all
3181054 with the raising of the australian flag our athletes have symbolically turned a little piece of beijing into australia and signalled our arrival at the games to the rest of the world
3181055 as democrats with a great respect for national interests all political parties that took part in the election should accept the election outcome
3181056 sam rainsy and his people cry like this every time after an election but his cries cannot defeat the law
3181057 the cpp received 90 seats because the people sincerely supported and voted for the cpp as they found that only the cpp can lead the country and that the srp is not reliable
3181058 if we join the meeting it means that we recognize the election outcome thus we will not join the meeting
3181059 if there is no proper and fair resolution to election fraud the nrp will boycott the na session but the boycott does not mean that we will abandon our parliamentarian seats
3181060 cannot accept the election outcome if our lawsuits are not resolved and we will not attend the na session but we will not abandon our seats in the na
3181061 first the srp want to join the government but the cpp does not want them second the srp wants to share the positions of na commission chairmen or vice chairmen with the cpp
3181062 if any party does not attend the session after seven days of its first session it the boycott is automatically regarded as an abandonment of the na seats
3181063 were a small startup company people should not expect us to earn money when we have the kind of project that we do with the kind of timeline that it has
3181064 considering alternate energy holdings moved from virginia to idaho they have nothing to show for it for over a year of work idahoans were skeptical before and theyre skeptical now
3181065 if the military confrontation over the border dispute near preah vihear temple continues the two countries will lose economic advantages including revenues from tourism
3181066 thailand wishes to find a solution to the issue of the temple of preah vihear in a peaceful and amicable manner making full use of the existing bilateral mechanisms including meetings between the two foreign ministers the thai cambodian joint boundary commission jbc and the general border committee gbc
3181067 differences of views on boundary issues between two neighboring countries are not unusual
3181068 this issue is just one small part of the overall relations between thailand and cambodia
3181069 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3181070 as you may know if a candidate fails to get at least 15 at a precinct caucus their supporters can switch and choose to caucus with those backing other candidates or declare themselves uncommitted
3181071 if the presidential caucus in iowa were held today please tell me which of the following people would be your second choice
3181072 the farther we get in the process the more we use a qualitative judgment process
3181073 sen cochran feels confident in the proposal mississippi put forward
3181074 were sure that when people look at the strengths of the mississippi research facilities they will be convinced that we are the number one choice
3181075 it is no secret that mississippis entire congressional delegation is supporting this project
3181076 mississippi ought not to be criticized for having one of the most unified bipartisan and supportive congressional delegations in the nation some are trying to use the media to damage mississippis application the fact is mississippi and our consortium partners represent the best proposal
3181077 we had easy places to train staff and a pool of trained individuals ready to work in that kind of facility we thought we had a very strong proposal

3181084 the new testament says the church is the body of christ but for the last 100 years the hands and feet have been amputated and the church has just been a mouth and mostly its been known for what its against
3181085 im so tired of christians being known for what theyre against
3181086 one of my goals is to take evangelicals back a century to the 19th century
3181087 that was a time of muscular christianity that cared about every aspect of life
3181088 im worried that evangelicals be identified too much with one party or the other when that happens you lose your prophetic role of speaking truth to power
3181089 and you have to defend stupid things that leaders do
3181090 politics is always downstream from culture i place less confidence in it than a lot of folks i dont think thats the answer politics is not the right tool to change the culture
3181091 what the church is for rather than what it is against

3181099 our procedure does not require scalpels and stitches nor does it lead to abnormal blood and tissue loss or the doll like hair patterns of other methods plus we have a much higher success rate than other techniques
3181100 our goal now is to train as many doctors as we can in the united states in our technique
3181101 we receive many more inquiries from hair loss patients in the u s than we can handle plus these people should not have to bear the travel costs to our clinic when there are so many competent physicians available right here
3181102 establish a standard by which all doctors in the industry abide

3181127 men would always tell me oh youre so beautiful you have such a great body you could be doing movies
3181128 considering the number of outbreaks reported worldwide the global hpai highly pathogenic avian influenza situation can be said to have improved markedly in the first half of 2008

3181130 i like to try new things theres just something about the feeling of ice on my nipples that turns me on its so cold and im so hot it gives me goosebumps and its just this super intense sensation that makes me wanna reach down and touch myself
3181131 yes i do and yes it does i like to do it when im masturbating cause sometimes my clit will get sensitive from rubbing it too much but i wont want to stop cumming so ill take a breather and put some ice on my button to cool it down and numb it a little when the ice melts i rub the cold water all over my spread pussy so it mixes with my juices and drips down my slit and into my ass crack it gives me shivers just thinking about it
3181132 first a guy has to lick my pussy lightly and stick his finger in a little bit building me up until im super horny and begging for more then when my pussy is tender and sticky even the lightest blow on my cunny will make me quiver and squirt

3181142 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3181143 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3181144 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3181145 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3181146 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3181147 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3181148 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3181149 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3181321 web 2 0 didnt help us understand the social web with any particular insight so im reluctant to hop on the gov2 0 bandwagon but i will try to give some definition to how these emerging trends impact the public sphere
3181322 this feels good and damn thats a change from what were used to
3181323 creative industries such as digital media and information and communication technology
3181324 i think sometimes when you say one a days its like theyre sitting on golf carts and playing golf theyre not we met all this morning had lunch and then went to practice the meeting time is invaluable for young guys i dont think you ever get enough of that time i think the veterans get a little tired of it if its the same system but its not the same system its a new offensive system and i think everybody and then its important that they go on the field and transfer what weve learned in the classroom
3181325 yeah it is and i think the way weve done it has helped us ive been very careful of that and trying to practice a certain way to get the physical ness in practice that you need and then give them a rest i think the players appreciate that they get wore out if you hit them all the time so you have to do things where its not hitting its just mental or how fast that you practice were always constantly teaching fundamentals and techniques but today was a physical day and they knew it and tomorrow will be another physical day and then wednesday will be too well tune it down after that
3181326 yeah with so many young guys were in the classroom in the morning and thats the key classroom work but youre right then you come out and have a two hour practice and its what were going to do tomorrow
3181327 i would say hes out this week by next week i think hell start to come around
3181328 well see im always cautious he needs to practice and i dont want to put him in harms way if hes not 100 it was good to see him out here today tomorrow well give him a little more
3181329 this last game we didnt get any throws to him but hes done well in practice weve got to get him the ball in the game hes picking up the offense and hes a good special teams player too
3181330 he was okay hes a big physical man thats one thing he can do he plays on the other side of the line of scrimmage those young guys who play inside the tackle have to come up with pass rushing skills thats the hardest thing for those guys he understands blocking he understands the running game hes very powerful its going to take time but eventually hes going to have to learn how to beat the guard one on one in pass rushing thats something he didnt do a lot of in college he was a two gap guy they didnt put him on the edge so its something new to him
3181331 there are still some things in the run game that weve got to get corrected the gap responsibilities of the linebackers then eight men in the box we knew that and thats a part of building weve got some young linebackers who are playing a lot
3181332 the veteran guys and the guys who have been in training camp are ahead of the young guys thats what you see its according to how many young guys are on the field at the same time and on one side of the ball thats where you see a lot of errors but were trying to correct them weve got a long way to go and we know that
3181333 i dont handicap them i just let them play the thing that we have to do is give these guys the ability to get on the field and play and compete after that its production
3181334 he taught us two and a half hours in the morning and three hours in the afternoon but you had 125 guys and its different today you could do it then
3181335 when you think about back then you have to practice that long if youre going to be fair to everybody and let them practice i think that gets a bit overblown now as far as taking the pads off then you didnt do that until after the game or the practice you always had your pads on
3181336 dick had to deal with it here but you had the world league so you had some exemptions

3181348 clearly an exit from the time warner equity stake into a cash generating asset would be attractive but at the current time none have been proposed that we could take action on
3181349 its not like other shows where its like they have to do the walk of shame out
3181350 its very actually breezy if you will but usually for the most part they will leave within one to two days of being eliminated from the show
3181351 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3181352 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3181353 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3181354 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3181355 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3181356 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3181357 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3181358 secondly is it acceptable practice to receive a crisp 100 bill from that source
3181359 these are the people who registered with us who filled in their details and are seriously looking at the manning valley as a place to live and work
3181360 it is our challenge now to match them up with job vacancies and other business opportunities while their housing needs will be passed onto real estate agents
3181361 generally people who come to the show are motivated and enthusiastic about moving to the country we were able to pass on lots of information to them and we had plenty of people manning our stand to deal with their inquiries
3181362 numbers were a little down on saturday possibly due to the races also being held at rosehill
3181363 numbers bounced back on sunday however and by the end of the weekend we had given out about 400 dvd information kits as well as brochures and copies of the times country week feature including the property times
3181364 they were a big hit as people thinking about a move usually ask first about real estate prices
3181365 i will offer the people of port macquarie the best possible opportunity to send the major parties the message that we do not want electricity privatisation

3181369 getting a veteran that may slip through the waiver process may look good on paper create a buzz for the fans and make it look like were trying to fill the spot
3181370 if we dont really believe that that will translate into success in this ballpark and thats very key in this ballpark then it doesnt make sense to do it
3181371 youre better off bringing someone that has been trained specifically in our minor league system major league spring training has gotten experience in the ballpark

3181376 im also proud to say that we continue to assemble a truly world class management team with the recent addition of our new cfo coo mr jacques kerrest mr kerrest brings a wealth of financial and operating experience to the team and coupled with our board of directors who collectively have deep industry experience we are all focused and quite passionate about our prospects for success we also have a number of exciting initiatives underway that will enable us to capitalize on the growing market opportunity for identity assurance
3181377 i hope it will not be the case that i get priced out of a move
3181378 if the club dont want me they know that ive been a faithful servant so in a perfect world being allowed to leave for a reasonable price would happen but in football you never know so im just keeping my fingers crossed and working hard
3181379 the uncertainty isnt difficult to deal with we have to be professional if newcastle decide they want to keep me im not going to moan about it ive been patient for a few years and its been frustrating but you have to be professional im a footballer i need to make sure my bodys right and that im in the right frame of mind
3181380 newcastle were my team when i grew up and thats who i want to play for but football comes first for me
3181381 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3181382 faltam pouco mais de dois anos para o encerramento dos oito anos de governo do presidente lula e entre os pontos que ainda faltam ser concretizados de seu programa que se insere dentro da agenda dos principais movimentos sociais brasileiros est o a abertura dos arquivos militares ainda n o divulgados e a repara o plena dos as ex presos as pol ticos as suas fam lias e das gera es que aguardam um reencontro do brasil com seu passado para alavancar um futuro ainda mais democr tico e justo
3181383 im a textbook definition of that perfectionist girl who has huge expectations of herself
3181384 its hard for me to take care of myself lets put it that way i am my last priority
3181385 truth i dont im not a lady who lunches its a lull in the day
3181386 weve had audrey hepburn weve had twiggy weve had veruschka weve had kate moss
3181387 im trying to figure out why i am to blame for skinniness truthfully ive never seen myself as being too thin
3181388 sometimes ill look at photos and be like oh thats not a good look but generally speaking im not too thin
3181389 id never thought about the size of a characters hands ever
3181390 i never got invited you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am
3181391 i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
3181392 they voted me one of the top five olympians in all time some of them are dead but they invited the other ones to go to the olympics but not me
3181393 i won seven events if they had the 50m freestyle back then which they do now i probably would have won that too
3181394 but as soon as the swimming was over and michael phelps didnt break my record every time i went to beach volley they put my face on the volleyballs
3181395 any of the campaigns that would have tried to push that would have been burned by it
3181396 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3181397 theres a tremendous under served need in the marketplace to enable small businesses to use the web as a sales and marketing environment
3181398 people reach out for information help and advice using twitter its a free and relatively easy w ay of keeping in touch with people during the day
3181399 we are spending a lot of time taking out the technical complexity of using these tools
3181400 by making a simple join when i publish on my wordpress blog it appears within seconds on my personal blog and then within minutes it appears on my facebook profile its about efficiency i can share something and do not have to repeat myself eight different times
3181401 its a way of seeing at the touch of a button what is being published across multiple platforms
3181402 by having online conversations about what you are passionate about people will be drawn to it
3181403 its a great way of creating goodwill towards your business
3181404 business owners could see it as an opportunity to share the latest news about their company or be seen as a leader in their industry sharing their thoughts
3181405 the fans online were really debating rauls defense after last nights game

3181408 so what is it that will work i dont know can i think of ideas well maybe there is something out there that will work but the big thing in this story is that students are unique
3181409 in every case the police had to ignore facts that demonstrated that they were arresting the wrong person
3181410 theres another dennis smith in the world and he and i share the same birthday
3181411 because it doesnt even look like him hes thin hes i dont know if its white but hes lighter skinned than him
3181412 they were deprived in that manner of an opportunity tell the judge im not the person in that warrant
3181413 there are systemic administration failures on the part of denvers top policy making officials to make sure that this doesnt happen or to make sure that if it happens its detected and fixed as soon as possible
3181414 and i just dont know this might happen in denver and in other jurisdictions
3181415 i fell and tumbled maybe three or four times and injured my ankle
3181416 it was real hard because i gained a lot of weight about 20 pounds
3181417 i wouldnt be surprised if its been 25 to 30 percent of people commuting or at least taking it out for a bike ride
3181418 its not that the roads are unsafe its just you have more people out on bicycles and a lot of them are fairly new and they dont understand the rules of the road
3181419 its about educating people when you have a law on the books it makes it more real
3181420 drivers need to know that bicycles belong there that they have every right to the road that cars do and that sometimes theyre going to have to slow down
3181421 you need a slightly wider tire so you dont have to pick your way around potholes and cracks in the pavement and so you can ride predictably in a straight line

3181425 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light save it for 2050
3181426 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3181427 couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution
3181428 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from specific decisions she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make
3181429 her hesitancy and habit of avoiding hard choices exacted a price that eventually sank her chances at the presidency
3181430 clintons top advisers never agreed on the answer over the course of the campaign they split into competing factions that drifted in and out of clintons favor but always seemed to work at cross purposes and clinton herself could never quite decide who was right
3181431 we got the banner out of the bag held it up and immediately the banner was grabbed by undercover police
3181432 we knew they were in the area and right on top of us
3181433 we didnt even know where we were flying to until we were handed boarding passes at customs
3181434 we dont believe we are in a position to wait much longer for resolution of this question
3181435 your concept would not only require stopping pay but also issuing minimum wage payments and determining the appropriate treatment of multiple deductions for each employee
3181436 then after the budget is passed we would need to restore full pay and again determine the appropriate level of deductions offsetting the prior adjustments
3181437 implementing system changes of the magnitude needed to accurately pay each employee should not be taken lightly
3181438 if they are not performed thoughtfully and accurately the system changes could subject the state to further litigation and unnecessary costs

3181554 polisulfon memiliki ketahanan terhadap klorin yang lebih baik dibanding poliamida karena rantai utamanya terdiri dari cincin cincin aromatik dan ikatan karbon sulfur dan oksigen yang kuat
3181555 dengan demikian polisulfon tidak mengandung ikatan ikatan amida yang sensitif terhadap serangan klorin cair
3181556 dulunya gugus gugus hidrofil ekstra ditambahkan ke polimer setelah polimerisasi sehingga menempatkan gugus gugus ini pada posisi yang paling tidak stabil sebagai gantinya kami memadukan gugus gugus ini kedalam monomer sehingga ketika polimerisasi terjadi gugus gugus ini berpadu secara langsung dengan struktur polimer
3181557 membran yang sangat tahan terhadap klorin ini dapat menghilangkan tahapan tahapan proses yang memakan banyak biaya dan secara signifikan meningkatkan daya tahan membran yang digunakan dalam desalinasi

3181580 we now know that hivcide i was clearly superior to the triple drug combo cocktail in all parameters we observed
3181581 the novel mechanism of action of hivcide i defines a new class of anti hiv drugs this enables that it can be combined with the existing cocktail in such a combination a much greater level of effectiveness could be achieved compared to what is possible today
3181582 if our preliminary results can be duplicated in humans it is quite possible that hivcide i either alone or in combination with the current combo cocktail may provide a functional cure for hiv aids
3181583 while many have thought that people wont be able to take medicines as well as they need to due to limited resources in poor countries our review of all studies on the topic strongly suggests that children in low income countries are able to maintain at least a comparable degree of art adherence if not better adherence than children in high income countries
3181584 healthcare systems need to carefully monitor how children with hiv take their medicines this kind of monitoring can be particularly difficult in low income countries so its very helpful for healthcare providers to understand how others do this monitoring and how well its working
3181585 we were not completely surprised to find the high rate of adherence to art in children in low income countries because it mirrors the results of adult studies but there is no question that it is reassuring to learn that even in settings where families face many challenges children are still able to adhere to a demanding yet essential medication regimen
3181586 our efforts to increase access to art must be coupled with research to inform strategies to deliver that therapy
3181587 i am disappointed the federal government will not be assisting the many new hampshire families impacted by this severe weather

3181673 hey theres washington dc to the north with 3 major airports and even norfolk to our east why would an air carrier choose richmond
3181674 estamos de cora o aberto para aceitar o jogo uma da outra s vezes sa mos para o mesmo lado cometemos erros mas usamos o instinto para vencer
3181675 n s nos comportamos bem em certos aspectos e usamos a intelig ncia para resolver os problemas com rapidez agora chega de emo o

3181677 we should start 2009 by calling a referendum on whether to approve the states new constitution policy
3181678 if we cant reach substantive agreements then we must address all those issues which divide us to a referendum issues like re election the compatibility of autonomous governments land issues
3181679 it is very probable we wont be able to find harmony between regional autonomy statutes and a new constitution
3181680 thats why we need a new referendum on the new constitution
3181681 the energy affordability gap is reaching into more moderate income households
3181682 in fiscal year 2008 the gap between incomes at the bottom of the national income range and energy prices continues to widen
3181683 has outpaced the increase in purchasing power of low income households
3181684 decisions about buying heating oil can be tough in any year but with current high and unpredictable oil prices the decision this year may involve considerably higher stakes for many family budgets already squeezed by broader economic and energy trends
3181685 a significant number of massachusetts households will have severe difficulty heating their homes during the upcoming winter because of rapidly increasing costs
3181686 the story is the gap is large and it is growing
3181687 the total aggregate cost of residential energy for low income consumers will increase by 6 8 billion during the year ahead from 33 5 billion to 40 3 billion assuming normal weather conditions
3181688 seventy two percent of the increase will be borne by the 53 of low income households that heat with natural gas
3181689 the impact of the increase in home energy prices has been to push upper income households
3181690 heating oil customers are likely to be particularly hard hit
3181691 shes not white i dont know what she is but shes not white
3181692 youre not white i think they would look good on you
3181693 yea like everyone is going to just hold hands and every things going to be fine right off
3181694 instead of a so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preference to minorities i think american people are going once they see the
3181695 in the era of globalisation where economic and technological development are important the value of integrity of people is challenged
3181696 members of society are better educated want to know their rights and do not hesitate to voice what they want
3181697 they expect politicians to carry out tasks for the benefit of the people and the country
3181698 this has to be corrected integrity has to be shown in the daily lives of politicians
3181699 of course were discussing preferences this is a time when those discussions are going on and its one of the elements thats in the mix
3181700 we have worked long and hard so that legislation in this area is necessary
3181701 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe
3181702 let me be clear we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people
3181703 we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century not regression to the conflicts of the past
3181704 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
3181705 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
3181706 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
3181707 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate cease fire
3181708 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
3181709 the group of eight highly industrialized states becomes again a club of leading market democracies
3181710 it is always in our interests to engage to listen to build alliances to understand what our interests are and to be fierce in protecting those interests
3181711 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe
3181712 let me be clear we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people
3181713 we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century not regression to the conflicts of the past

3181717 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate cease fire
3181718 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
3181719 the group of eight highly industrialized states becomes again a club of leading market democracies
3181720 it is always in our interests to engage to listen to build alliances to understand what our interests are and to be fierce in protecting those interests
3181721 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3181722 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3181723 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3181724 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3181725 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3181726 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3181727 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3181728 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3181729 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3181730 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3181731 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3181732 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3181733 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3181734 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3181735 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3181736 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3181737 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3181738 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3181739 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3181740 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3181741 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3181742 i didnt think i was going to be the center coming into training camp then a couple guys go down and
3181743 i thought ive done well ill find out what they think after they watch the films
3181744 dont let anyone touch him hes a lot more important than i am
3181745 for the center the big thing is you have to snap the ball and make the calls but its all using your hands staying square and being physical snapping with the nose guard on top of you is tough
3181746 i have high expectations for our defensive football team the bar has been set pretty high so im pretty picky with them they know it so when a player or group doesnt perform to that absolute level hes capable of performing then im going to talk about it with him
3181747 im the sixth from the top you have that many heads in the household it definitely teaches you patience and you know you have to wait your turn sometimes
3181748 but you have to stay positive because whenever your opportunity arises you have to step up to it
3181749 ive been in seattle for six years playing behind shaun
3181750 if thats not patience i dont know what it is i definitely think its the opportunity now i just need to take advantage of it and do everything i can to help this team win
3181751 i thought mo got off to a really good start
3181752 ill start julius in the next game were going to play both of them thats the plan the challenge will be to juggle the halfbacks and this game will give julius more touches than he had the last game
3181753 i had some older brothers who were not too involved in school at the time and i kind of took the path that they took
3181754 me going to school the last like two years was kind of a nonexistent thing i was doing what they was going which wasnt the right thing
3181755 since oregon i kind of looked like this is my last chance to recover and accomplish what i want to accomplish in football i made mistakes in high school i wasnt going to make any more mistakes like that again
3181756 he tweaked it a little bit in the game did something
3181757 i suppose theres a chance but we havent even talked about it yet
3181758 now look it if you ask matt hell give you the history of his back since he was 11
3181759 bobby is a very important part of what we do offensively
3181760 the young uns have to step up and play weve said that already and now they just have to do it for a while
3181761 no way did he think he was going to be in this position six months ago and now here you are
3181762 who knows he might be the starting center on opening day
3181763 now even if i wanted to go a different way you cant mess around because we will have two receivers who are going to be on the roster who will not be playing

3181766 eosinophils are really the red headed stepchild of white blood cells
3181767 the med school paradigm is that eosinophils are a host defense against big parasites that cant be gobbled up by smaller immune system cells instead you bring in these eosinophils that secrete a bunch of nasty things that kill them
3181768 this is a situational weapon not the howitzer that you pull out to kill everything
3181769 when these cells are tackling some of the larger parasites they release toxins that can float around and do damage
3181770 this is important work to highlight it really brings forth a new hypothesis

3181773 after seven years of blind alleys and false accusations we have to ask well has the fbi once again let their zeal replace evidence
3181774 a person who has been briefed on the investigation said on sunday
3181775 evidence amassed by f b i investigators against dr bruce e ivins was largely circumstantial
3181776 newly released fbi evidence makes a strong circumstantial case that bioweapons researcher ivins was a delusional sociopath who had the opportunity motive and means to be the 2001 anthrax killer
3181777 a flask of anthrax spores recovered in 2004 from ivins personal workspace at ft detrick the army weapons lab where he worked
3181778 bin laden terrorists for sure have anthrax and sarin gas
3181779 it may well be that absent a trial it will fall to reporters to aggressively test the solidity of the case against ivins
3181780 but this is a circumstantial case with no absolute proof that he did it
3181781 amy the fbi says it can trace the anthrax used in the attacks directly to dr ivins and it says he repeatedly tried to mislead investigators
3181782 tonight a lawyer for dr ivins says the fbi never found anthrax in his house or in his car or anything else directly linking him to the mailings
3181783 and without a trial well never hear what dr ivins wouldve said in his own defense
3181784 even when you look at the scientific evidence in that flask the anthrax spores that were in that flask charlie a lot of researchers in that lab also had access to it
3181785 oh by the way lets give you the reasons to why we think he sent out and went on this homicidal rage
3181786 well he helped develop a vaccine for anthrax he probably wanted to continue to see that developed so that by killing people by having come up with some unknown way of this high military grade anthrax we would keep the vaccine program going
3181787 hes involved hes got a role in it hes done something

3181795 we all speak very highly of senator mccain and his war record but the next sentence is its not about that
3181796 this is a bill that john mccain called too generous but barack obama was an early supporter of
3181797 he has been a tireless advocate for our troops who are currently serving as well as all the soldiers from different generations who have returned to civilian life unlike his opponent john mccain does not need to make campaign stops overseas in an attempt to beef up his foreign policy credentials

3181944 hwa is dead people have such hatred for him he died over 20 years ago move on do you get joy from this people are willing to believe what they read on the internet from people they dont even know sick sick minds
3181945 one of the harshest realities people can face is to learn that they have been lied to about their religious beliefs that they have been deceived this is one of the most difficult barriers in life to break people instinctively defend their beliefs because they are foundational to their entire outlook on life the core of their decision making process in all matters of life lying deception is one of the most refined character flaws of mankind
3181946 herberts predictions were wrong because he wasnt a prophet he was an apostle

3181950 from the 30th of june we have no longer been able to ship a pc with a xp licence
3181951 however what we have been able to do with microsoft is ship pcs with a vista business licence but with xp pre loaded that is still the majority of business computers we are selling today
3181952 looking into a crystal ball i dont think businesses will see much value in upgrading to vista until late next year and even so microsoft will probably have come out with something else by then
3181953 given that theres a mountain of evidence to refute this report including multiple reports from forrester and other top tier analysts this appears to be more focused on making sensationalist statements rather than offering a thoughtful industry perspective based on conversations with it operations professionals or deep knowledge of enterprise deployment cycles
3181954 how is this useful guidance to customers its disappointing to see such a respected organisation like forrester take this approach
3181955 this research suggests that many are erring on the side of caution preferring to double count rather than risk understating environmental impact

3181957 you ought to be in awe of that spirit and that mind that it could go that far that it can be that evil and that cruel and yet that is the mind that god has been dealing with for six thousand yearrrrss and only a few has he drawn out to work with to mold and fashion
3181958 im dumbfounded the person goes on to say here in answering their relative
3181959 thats an amazing thing to me the willingness of people to believe anything that somebody writes out there and yet ive heard story after story from some of you of things that have been written out there and some of them about you and people are willing to believe it because its written down
3181960 and its against you because thats really what they want
3181961 thats what they want to believe so what theyre looking for is something against gods people against anyone they can to find fault and yet theyre willing to believe it and they dont know who theyre believing
3181962 perverts distorted minds of people whose lives are sick and putrid cuz i can tell you people who write some kinds of things their minds are so distorted and twisted up to have such bitterness and evil in their hearts and their minds get on with your life find some joy someplace
3181963 are you finding joy in such distortion and trying to find fault your life is revolving it blows my mind its an amazing thing isnt it
3181964 heres something this could be something look there was a flood
3181965 i know that you cannot tolerate wicked men that you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not and have found them false
3181966 woe to the world because of the things that cause people to sin such things must come but
3181967 a leader of a cult lives to control his followers their submission gratifies him reinforces his ego he is all controlling what seem insane to us is completely logical to the group theyre just people theyre marginalized alienated vulnerable their looking for purpose meaning they crave certainty the cult gives them friends family and all it asks from them is loyalty and obedience theyre happy to do that so they remove their will whew no more doubt no more torment
3181968 we have had many athletes coming in some have come in with old traumas that perhaps havent been recognised also because its a very strong competition many people have new injuries
3181969 they are working shifts and they are rushed off their feet i havent seen them since they started working there last month
3181970 i talked to one of the chinese practitioners before we arrived mostly focusing on sleep disturbances and other types of imbalances
3181971 when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river

3181973 many parents have found this to be a fun activity as well as giving them a unique artistic keepsake of their pregnancy

3182010 two members of the commission brought up the fact that they still were not convinced that the president had been shot from the sixth floor window of the texas book depository

3182078 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3182079 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3182080 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3182081 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3182082 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from taxes and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3182083 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3182084 someone smashed one of the alarm call points after a big night out we know exactly who it was and the guest has been charged 1500 for the call out fee and to fix the call point

3182087 following an incident at the hotel two cabin crew members were stood down pending an investigation
3182088 this gene has been associated with a combination of kidney and eye disease in human patients
3182089 here we found a mutation that affects only the eyes suggesting that this gene might be a candidate for human patients with eye disease only
3182090 the new information that the nphp4 gene can be involved in eye diseases only can shed light on the etiology of some low frequency eye diseases in people where similar mutations may be involved
3182091 if i could leave any message never stop learning period
3182092 you can hunt around and you will find a few kids meals that are nutritionally pretty good
3182093 but the vast majority of meals are too high in calories saturated fat or sodium they are all made with refined white flour rather than whole wheat flour not the kind of meals we ought to be encouraging people to eat
3182094 kfc is proud to offer a variety of kids meals for those looking for lower calorie lower fat options
3182095 a 2007 consumer survey conducted by the association showed that four out of five customers said there were more healthy options available and more food choices available than there were two years earlier
3182096 look for grilled or baked items such as grilled chicken or grilled lean burgers and avoid fried foods
3182097 choose low fat or skim milk or 100 fruit juice over other beverages that simply provide calories without nutritional value
3182098 milk and juices typically come in small portions appropriate for children
3182099 however sodas and shakes made for kids are often more than enough for an adult
3182100 it appears that for people who have a certain genetic makeup the initial physical reaction to smoking can play a significant role in determining what happens next
3182101 if cigarette smoking is sustained nicotine addiction can occur in a few days to a few months
3182102 the finding of a genetic association with pleasurable early smoking experiences may help explain how people get addicted and of course once addicted many will keep smoking for the rest of their lives
3182103 understanding the genetics of complex disorders such as nicotine addiction will require much more research traits

3182212 its encouraging to see from this report that demand for higher education remains solid despite various changes to the system there continues to be real growth in the number of applications and a pattern of stability in recruitment
3182213 whilst it is encouraging that student numbers have not decreased in our universities it is extremely worrying that there has been no change in the number of students from the very backgrounds the government is spending considerable sums of money on persuading to apply
3182214 with applications to university up significantly and the proportions from lower socio economic groups increasing i am confident the new system is working in major part this is because we have a better fairer and more progressive system of student financial support with no one paying tuition fees before university and because we have brought back and greatly expanded access to non repayable student grants
3182215 obviously its a tough situation but this team has shown great perseverance all year and i expect it will continue

3182228 the results of the convention energized libertarians and all advocates of liberty to resurrect the moribund boston tea party and the rest as they say is history
3182229 my plan is to recruit as many new boston tea party and boston tea party of michigan members as possible
3182230 my hope is that if we get more former libertarians former republicans former democrats many independents and people from all walks of life into this party we will become a stronger force to be reckoned with i hope we can achieve that i certainly wont get my hopes up but it is my belief that some good things will happen from now until in the future

3182251 no that would give the wrong impression bishop nichols was the opposite he was the catalyst we had an ecumenical service in my church and the local catholic parish priest canon frank hegarty a very good friend of mine and my sponsor in the church had spoken to bishop nichols
3182252 we spoke after the service at the end of which he said give me a call if i can be of any help i phoned him a week later and he was very kind arranged an interview and that was it

3182262 as soon as you come out of your break the balls right here
3182263 you just have to have your hands up real quick
3182264 when you have a guy who can pressure the defense in many ways you know every routes available on the field
3182265 i wouldnt only say its just how fast the ball is coming
3182266 hes not going to wait for your eye contact he expects you to be ready for the ball
3182267 theres no such thing as a decoy route not as long as you have brett back there
3182268 like i tell the guys even when youre covered youre not really covered if you have two hands and two arms youre not covered because hes going to hit one of them so just find a way as long as you can see him he can see you
3182269 he just threw it up in the air and let him get it and youre like wow
3182270 laveranues couldve closed his eyes and it was right there in his hands
3182271 just growing up and watching him play and now him actually being my quarterback id be lying to you if i told you it wasnt way different
3182272 i didnt ever think it was going to be like that but im getting used to it every day
3182273 ive never played with a quarterback whos had a no look pass in their repertoire
3182274 you would think its a lot harder to catch because its coming so fast but his spiral is so tight that its actually a lot easier to catch
3182275 he does like to spread the ball around a lot
3182276 he gets the ball to the tight ends a lot i spoke to bubba and he said be ready hes right because at any time the ball can be coming your way it makes it a little more fun because you get out there and youre running routes and you know youre a live option on every play

3182297 la actual estructura que tiene el consejo no le sirve al deporte misionero la parte ejecutiva queda sometida a un camino burocr tico muy largo y estamos haciendo depender a los deportistas m s que de nuestra propia gesti n de la buena voluntad de funcionarios que a lo mejor no conocen el deporte no tienen por qu conocerlo porque son funcionarios administrativos de otro orden y no es justamente en el seno del propio consejo donde se resuelven desde el punto de vista administrativo todas aquellas tareas que nosotros nos planteamos esto hace que obviamente en la mayor a de los casos estamos llegando con las soluciones o sobre la hora o muchas veces tarde y esto crea un malestar en toda la gente que est en el propio consejo los empleados que hace mucho tiempo est n sufriendo esas consecuencias en los deportistas en los dirigentes y en nosotros mismos que circunstancialmente estamos ah son situaciones inc modas y hasta insalubres porque de pronto se plantea un accionar donde se supone que est todo para resolver el problema a un deportista y se entre en una vor gine burocr tica pasan los d as los meses y la cuesti n no sale con otra estructura con una secretar a de deportes como tienen todas las provincias del pa s menos misiones esto ser a de m s f cil resoluci n
3182298 el gran trabajo de desarrollo que se hizo en los ltimos tres a os ahora que est activado hay que permitir que se desarrolle con un sentido y con una conducci n que marque una pol tica deportiva para la provincia
3182299 todo esto lo digo desde la experiencia profesional de mis 36 a os de profesor 45 de deportista fui director de deportes en el regreso de la democracia no lo dije antes porque ten a tiempo antes para trabajar y hacer valer la situaci n desde el propio trabajo ahora los tiempos biol gicos son otros y tengo que tomar un poco m s protagonismo desde mi funci n
3182300 est escrita e inclusive charlada con el propio presidente del consejo y todos estamos absolutamente de acuerdo es m s no es necesario cambiar la ley porque la que est en vigencia es espectacular contempla todos los problemas que pueda tener el deporte en todas sus versiones el federado el escolar el de la salud el deporte educativo pero no est el organismo el instrumento para llevar pol ticas adecuadas en el momento preciso no existe porque solo est el consejo del deporte que deber a ser un cuerpo colegiado y no est conformado y la ley dice que el consejo debe ser un rgano consultivo para que tenga como objetivo debe hacer una vez al a o el congreso provincial del deporte lo que emane de ese congreso deber a tener car cter vinculante y a partir de ah la secretar a de deportes empezar a trabajar para atender las necesidades de los deportistas
3182301 lo nico que habr a que hacer es modificar la estructura para aplicar la ley del deporte en la provincia similar a la de naci n para adecuarnos a la pol tica deportiva nacional
3182302 hay otros sectores pol ticos que no tienen mucho inter s en la cuesti n especulan con no cambiar nadie por las dudas que alguna vez les toque a ellos volver a usufructuar de ese tipo de situaciones
3182303 hist ricamente se han dado situaciones que se han repetido a un costo muy alto para el estado y se siguen repitiendo como sucedi con luz y fuerza en la liga nacional deportivamente fue un xito no acompa ado por otros sectores despu s de eso qued un gran vac o ahora por suerte se est volviendo a llenar con trabajo genuino propio de gente de misiones que hace que los chicos tengan una v a de desarrollo ojal que si se sigue avanzando no desechemos a los nuestros y hagamos de agencia de trabajo de gente de otros lugares

3182307 i started reading up on the neoconservatives and was horrified and nauseated by what i found cult followers of a demented philosopher guru named leo strauss the neocons advocated what amounted to a mentocracy government by systematic lying
3182308 the worst part was that the neocons were now in control of the federal government
3182309 the neocons are psychotic mass murderers in love with war the most basic and pervasive form of mass murder one of them michael ledeen approvingly cites machiavelli a prince must have no other objectives or other thoughts or take anything for his craft except war but how to provoke war when most people desire peace ledeen explains in order to achieve the most noble accomplishments the leader may have to enter into evil

3182318 it continues to this day as first responders suffer from the aftereffects its almost like radiation poisoning after a nuclear attack first come the initial victims and then those whove been poisoned by the clouds of lethal dust
3182319 and thats only whats been officially reported in medical records
3182320 there are a host of other ailments such as cancer diseases affecting vital organs and mental health issues
3182321 im a new yorker and should have known about this much sooner hold me up is probably one of the most personal songs i have ever written and i wanted steve john and all of the responders to know that they have my support
3182322 i think that if given the opportunity most people would want to contribute to this cause
3182323 heres their chance to help while the political end of this gets worked out
3182324 russian forces came to the central route and cut off connections between western and eastern georgia

3182326 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3182327 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3182328 virtually all production has been shut down because of this
3182329 russian forces have destroyed senaki military base and have left it
3182330 pre planned cold blooded and pre meditated murder of a small country
3182331 no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3182332 there is an immediate and pressing need to end the fighting and disengage all military forces in south ossetia the georgian government has offered a ceasefire which i urge the russians to reciprocate without delay
3182333 all that we have had from the international community is humanitarian aid which is starting to arrive and statements re georgia fighting rages in s ossetia russian tanks head for battle
3182334 it is expected that supplies distributed by the us embassy in tbilisi will be exhausted by the end of the day
3182335 releasing 250 000 dollars in initial funding that can provide emergency relief supplies that can assist up to 10 000 people
3182336 it is expected that supplies distributed by the us embassy in tbilisi will be exhausted by the end of the day
3182337 releasing 250 000 dollars in initial funding that can provide emergency relief supplies that can assist up to 10 000 people
3182338 russian and georgian forces must immediately cease hostilities throughout georgia and return to their august 6 positions
3182339 furthermore in escalating the conflict through its attacks on georgian towns and cities outside south ossetia russia has ceased to act as a peacekeeper it is imperative that russia respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia
3182340 military force will not resolve this dispute the only viable long term solution is international mediation and peacekeeping
3182341 we understand that we may face a massive money withdrawal so it seems logical to keep the assets in the banks
3182342 but we havent seen any kind of panic so far
3182343 much of the foreign money is invested in the infrastructure road railway and pipeline construction so it will be hard to withdraw
3182344 we try to export our wine and fruit to europe and the united states but they have very high standards so we would prefer russia
3182345 the situation in georgia highlights the greatly increased risks related to energy transits through the country
3182346 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3182347 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3182348 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3182349 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3182350 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3182351 what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression
3182352 in order to prevent the circumstances in which ukraine could be drawn into a military conflict ukraine reserves the right to bar ships which may take part in these actions from returning to the ukrainian territory until the conflict is solved
3182353 it makes a third party involved and its quite unexpected
3182354 the russians have crossed the border and are now in control of zugdidi
3182355 we saw russian military trucks passing by we saw hundreds of soldiers there was a mix of soldiers from the regular army and soldiers that are supposed to be peacekeepers
3182356 is absolutely a war between russia and america the biggest mistake was in underestimating us now youll see what happens
3182357 the whole of south ossetia is in ruins the role of those who came here today is 100 per cent humanitarian they came to rebuild infrastructure
3182358 in the past two days about 2 000 people volunteered these are men with experience of military operations in hot spots
3182359 not one newspaper in the west has written the truth about whats happening here no one has written that the georgians were the ones who started this that they are the ones shooting women and children
3182360 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3182361 moved with care not to worsen relations with the us
3182362 the navy was ordered not to allow supplies of weapons and military hardware into georgia by sea
3182363 a blockade of the coast would mean that we were at war with georgia which we are not
3182364 the actions by the ukrainian side are contrary to ukrainian russian agreements and are hostile to the russian federation
3182365 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3182366 no one needs cold war with russia but this country has intruded into the territory of a sovereign state i was surprised at bushs embracing putin in the opening of the olympic games after that putin was sitting while bush and first lady were applauding the american team
3182367 putins next target will be ukraine but he can not do it there georgia has 5 million population and ukraine 50 million there are other factors too
3182368 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one

3182373 the court has adopted an interpretation of the statute that is blatantly unconstitutional equating discussion in a public forum with computer intrusion

3182426 we will stand up for oppressed people from cuba to north korea and from burma to zimbabwe and sudan it reads making it clear the party considers north korea an authoritarian country that suppresses the human rights
3182427 we support the belated diplomatic effort to secure a verifiable end to north korea s nuclear weapons program and to fully account for and secure any fissile material or weapons north korea has produced to date
3182428 too often in recent years we have sent the opposite signal to our international partners it says in asia we belittled south korean efforts to improve relations with the north
3182429 we believe that trade should strengthen the american economy and create more american jobs
3182430 we will not negotiate free trade agreements that stop the government from protecting the environment food safety or the health of its citizens give greater rights to foreign investors than to u s investors or require the privatization of our vital public service
3182431 we will work with canada and mexico to amend the north american free trade agreement so that it works better for all three north american countries it says on the withdrawal of troops from iraq the draft platform says the u s can safely remove our combat brigades at the pace of one to two per month and expect to complete redeployment within 16 months

3182458 when youre making little mistakes like your entries thats nothing but nerves
3182459 something i saw before the third dive was that tom after they had blown the whistle he started to take a step and then stopped so hes in a hurry he wasnt relaxed and calm i dont know what his pulse rate would have been but blake walked around as if he had the weight of the world on his shoulders this is half way through the contest and they didnt come back
3182460 if they had drilled that they would have been right in the mix also i thought they lost the judges confidence after that you have to dive good so the judges cant hurt you but they seemed to cop some pretty tough scores

3182474 but i am afraid these clues do not reveal much as to what lady jadrien is planning
3182475 and if marquess thinks no one is reading them except who he intended them for he probably is not being careful in what he put into those messages

3182477 marquess is planning to perform the traveling through time spell
3182478 but he doesnt have the counter spell to bring him back
3182479 im sure with his supposed induction into the protection that zephyr allowed him access to the wizards witness
3182480 that i would think would be the first place he would start for a
3182481 the boy will find nothing there since there really is not such a place
3182482 marquess is messaging someone at the insurgent who might have more access to other types of information
3182483 would there be any way that he could actually find that counter spell

3182820 it was smooth we just went to the board and found their names and took them up to their class
3182821 they were excited to go into their class and everything was alright
3182822 last year my third grader she cried that she didnt want to go to school on the first day
3182823 so i told her today that we have to get out of the house and get her to school on the first day with no tears and we did

3182825 crabtree is physical hes a good receiver hes got all the tools but hes got to refine some things
3182826 in the league hes not going to be able to run through everybody hes got to work on his technique snugging and pulling to get off press coverage other than that he runs pretty good routes
3182827 they were trying to dog me i just improved on the field and had fun
3182828 from day 1 he thought he belonged on that level with the top guys not just in college football but in football
3182829 last year it usually was me just catching the ball over people
3182830 he was a big play threat last year but he wasnt really the deep threat that we wanted there were a lot of runs after the catch
3182831 most guys would be satisfied with what he did last year but hes not hes coming out here practicing right now like its his last day
3182832 i dont know if his numbers will be the same hes going to have a lot of attention and be a marked man for sure but i guarantee you right now that hes so much further along than he was last year that people wouldnt believe it

3182835 this information about the duration of the leak was of concern to me and raised many questions about the maintenance of the navys nuclear propulsion force
3182836 concerns about the maintenance of the fleet are particularly relevant given the recent circumstances involving the poor maintenance of the uss stout and the uss chosin
3182837 this decree seeks to protect enhance and in some cases restore the trust that our faith calls for between the church and the children and adolescents entrusted to their care
3182838 it is the intention of the archdiocese that no person who has been convicted of sexually abusing a child will work with children at an office parish school agency or institution of the archdiocese
3182839 i dont hold much hope that this lesson will be taken by the current administration whose moral bank account is woefully overdrawn i would not be surprised if bush cheney harmed our international standing even more by ignoring the jury and holding hamdan indefinitely

3182843 the mbbs bachelor of medicine and bachelor of sur gery degree from mmmc has been recognised by the mmc since july 2003 and its graduates allowed to register as medical practitioners in malaysia

3182845 islam does not victimise anyone if there are any problems with conversion like property and divorces the syariah courts can settle it

3182848 they recorded my statement last saturday and we are ready to help the sabah aca in its probe
3182849 we will bring this matter to our board of directors soon
3182850 we are not going to compromise on the politicians wrongdoing
3182851 however the la was incomplete and i asked him for a proper documentation
3182852 the politician was reluctant to do so saying that i should trust him as he was a well known
3182853 i have all the evidence to prove that the politician had misused his power
3182854 he asked me to begin the construction without signing any documents and only made an initial payment of rm200 000
3182855 i trusted him and he promised me that he would pay the balance
3182856 however on july 14 he sent me a letter of termination of the rm20 5 million contract without notice
3182857 suhakam believes a worker local or foreign deserves to be treated the same and enjoy the same privileges
3182858 however many companies still mistreat their workers to the point where it borders on slavery going against the ilo convention
3182859 we must ensure that all foreign labour is treated humanely this includes providing good living conditions fair wages and the guarantee of basic human rights
3182860 i explained to them what they wanted to know i told them to investigate other matters as well i am open and i want them to take action in the matter
3182861 i dont like to sweep things under the carpet we must take action against those who are irresponsible and not hide what our friends did
3182862 if the aca says everything is okay then it will be easier to answer the rakyat otherwise there will always be suspicions

3182865 we never trained to race early in the day and that was revenge for what happened this yesterday morning
3182866 i definitely didnt want to set a world record but i felt good in the water there is still a long way to go
3182867 i am pleased federica got the record i felt bad for her in the 400 this yesterday morning

3182870 my role with portsmouth and the national team is almost the same
3182871 its very different to what i was used to at dinamo and then at hajduk i played behind the strikers i like it i can see where im playing because youre not always playing backwards
3182872 we are both so happy and proud to be british
3182873 to have two british girls on the podium what more could you ask for
3182874 it was a lot harder than i thought it was going to be and i felt like i was just holding on at the end
3182875 aside from market conditions which did not offer barcelona a clear opportunity to sign one of the few strikers with the capacity to compete with etoo his performance in the pre season cannot be underestimated
3182876 we are in a tough pool and have to win every game so i am definitely happy to win this one
3182877 i had barely settled into my coaching box when we scored the first goal it showed we were not nervous
3182878 i cant be happy when we missed so many goals it is unacceptable at the start of the tournament
3182879 we had seven penalty corners and wasted all of them it makes it difficult for us now but we will fight all the way
3182880 i am not surprised we had problems getting into the game at the start
3182881 we have a young team and for many of them it is their first olympics so a bit of nervousness was natural but once we settled down we just got better and better
3182882 the punishment of fading into footnote obscurity a numbered ward of the state he did not destroy
3182883 i would sum this one up as a tired football team quiet no hits kind of unusual the 1 on both sides i think played well as far as doing what they needed to do the 2 defense has a way to go but i think they are just tired we are a tired football team tonight
3182884 we have never had a better line linebacking core then we have right now
3182885 we will sit down as a staff every position will have a goal will evaluate our strengths and weaknesses and during practice well put ourselves into a situation to try to make us better
3182886 takeaways are becoming a big thing to us we led the nation in 2005 and we won the conference the last couple of years we have had a lot of sacks but we havent had as many takeaways we really need to get the opportunity to get ourselves in that situation
3182887 good charlotte i dont wanna be in love dance floor anthem
3182888 i dont know what this song is about when i was writing this i was going through a divorce and the only thing i can say about it is that it
3182889 illness is usually accompanied by a period of grief because so many dreams and hopes can die when we lose our health but there is also hope for a new purpose most often one that we never would have imagined if we had our health
3182890 will have a catastrophic effect on americas ability to develop new drugs
3182891 even then we have a meeting first thing in the morning and a draw is conducted to first pick the matches from which the athletes will undergo testing
3182892 once the matches have been determined we then draw the players and there could be several tested for the day as there isnt a fixed number each day
3182893 i would like to thank my leader my coach as well as all who have helped me in the team without their help i would not be sat here
3182894 we already knew there would be many people cheering for us and the training for that certainly helped
3182895 it was a technical mistake it wasnt just nerves i was just too pressed up at the start so i didnt make a clean entry

3182900 we now know that hivcide i was clearly superior to the triple drug combo cocktail in all parameters we observed
3182901 the novel mechanism of action of hivcide i defines a new class of anti hiv drugs this enables that it can be combined with the existing cocktail in such a combination a much greater level of effectiveness could be achieved compared to what is possible today
3182902 if our preliminary results can be duplicated in humans it is quite possible that hivcide i either alone or in combination with the current combo cocktail may provide a functional cure for hiv aids
3182903 the funding will support research into how brain cells create memories during these periods of acute stress at a time or situation of extreme stress it is important for your brain to work optimally and to find the best way to escape clarity of assessing the situation is therefore paramount it is also critically important to remember and learn from the situation if it recurs you can refer to the earlier experience and know how best to escape
3182904 professor lightman and i co founded bristol neuroscience five years ago to promote dialogue within bristols diverse neuroscience community i am delighted that one of the resulting collaborations is a joint project between our laboratories
3182905 we expect that of the 200 to 300 program participants 25 percent will reduce their blood pressure cholesterol and cardiovascular risk levels and 85 percent will increase their commitment to a healthier lifestyle
3182906 this grant will provide the financial support necessary to provide the screening education and follow up to achieve such outcomes in the forsyth county area
3182907 we believe that this investment will help us further our mission of improving the health and well being of our fellow north carolinians it is important that we continue to support innovative and effective programs and services that help individuals and communities across the state
3182908 its a very essential process to be able to repair the dna
3182909 our study addresses one step of this very complicated process we figured out how a critical enzyme is regulated
3182910 solving one structure gives you just a snapshot but if you have several structures you can understand how they work
3182911 if we can find a way to target the machinery that corrects damage happening during cell division we could specifically kill those cells undergoing rapid division
3182912 while many have thought that people wont be able to take medicines as well as they need to due to limited resources in poor countries our review of all studies on the topic strongly suggests that children in low income countries are able to maintain at least a comparable degree of art adherence if not better adherence than children in high income countries
3182913 healthcare systems need to carefully monitor how children with hiv take their medicines this kind of monitoring can be particularly difficult in low income countries so its very helpful for healthcare providers to understand how others do this monitoring and how well its working
3182914 we were not completely surprised to find the high rate of adherence to art in children in low income countries because it mirrors the results of adult studies but there is no question that it is reassuring to learn that even in settings where families face many challenges children are still able to adhere to a demanding yet essential medication regimen
3182915 our efforts to increase access to art must be coupled with research to inform strategies to deliver that therapy
3182916 the interesting thing is that were seeing these things like extended posture and arms extended out from the body these behaviours that make you look larger theyre very similar to the dominance displays that are seen in other animals like chimpanzees
3182917 these behaviours are really quite reliably shown in all these different groups which is sort of to me pretty compelling evidence that what were talking about is a universal response to success and probably likely to be innate as well
3182918 this isnt an expression that is foreign in any way or unknown in any way to western cultures its just not shown by these individuals in this situation and my thinking on that is that thats because shame is really highly stigmatized in western cultures
3182919 my guess is those behaviours behaviours that we see in the congenital blind sample thats a real indicator of what sort of the natural way of responding is and then the cultural difference is indicating culturally shaped inhibition of that response
3182920 in the event that they lose one of the things thats important to a lot of athletes is that they still demonstrate sportsmanship and that they manage some of that disappointment some of that shame to the extent that family members or people from their country that are looking on arent ashamed of how theyve reacted
3182921 primarily the goal is to get them to place mentally emotionally physically where they perform their best and a big part of that is understanding respecting and embracing their emotions so when something goes wrong theres going to be a swell of emotion and you dont necessarily have to suppress or deny that you just have to accept that its there quickly let it run its course and reload for whatevers next
3182922 master cpl doyle was killed while he was protecting his position and his fellow soldiers
3182923 erin was a big tough mountain of a man who enjoyed the outdoors
3182924 he was a true warrior and just the person you would want beside you in a firefight
3182925 their normal contact drill is as soon as they get hit with something its 360 open up on everything that moves
3182926 thats probably what happened and in the meantime we think maybe a coalition soldier got hit
3182927 the compass convoy is the one we suspect opened up on the canadians
3182928 the six i shot in the third end forced me to readjust to the left unfortunately i adjusted too much and i shot a seven after that
3182929 adjusting during competition is normal but i was nervous and that cost us dearly
3182930 i think i shot well in the match but my teammates could have done better
3182931 well not so much maybe thats not the right move
3182932 look life is not fair dont expect it to be fair work twice as hard and you know just keep focused on working hard and eventually it will pay off
3182933 it appeared all of the testimony was in favor of her gleason
3182934 was he actually prosecuting or was he defending her gleason
3182935 i anticipate that charges will be filed and i will be handling the case basically i just tried the case over two days it was not to a regular jury as far as guilt beyond a reasonable doubt but theres no reason for me to hand the file over to anybody ive basically now prepped the case and just tried it so thered be no reason for me to hand it over to any other attorney and or the attorney generals office

3182947 the relationship between young men and the police in these hot areas is very difficult
3182948 the police are on edge because when they get out of their cars they dont know what is going to happen the young people are on edge because they feel they are being harassed
3182949 if you are male a member of a visible minority and drive a sports car you can be targeted
3182950 one youth told me he was stopped 10 times in one day that is a lot and i think the young people are fed up
3182951 feelings of hatred and revenge between police officers and young people are fuelled by both sides and when an event like this happens it doesnt take much to set this powder keg ablaze
3182952 were ahead of any police department that we know of we have to continue to work on that
3182953 anti gang strategies for example tend to compromise relations with some communities especially the black community because at the ground level some people take anti gang to mean targeting young black males
3182954 what happened here is an unfortunate event but will not set us back
3182955 when jennifer jumped 4 90 then 4 92 at the us olympic trials on july 6 it made me so angry because everyone started to say isinbayeva is finished we have a new star
3182956 it made me angry and i am happy for that feeling because i hadnt felt it enough since my last world record
3182957 today i feel like the previous yelena before i was full of problems but after changes in my technique my personal life my coach my life generally i think i am stronger now in my personal condition
3182958 i run faster i long jump longer but more important inside i feel so happy so calm
3182959 hmm we should demolish this and build a mcdonalds here
3182960 im a republican and mccain has a lot of experience
3182961 im honored to have heidis support and i want to assure her that i never miss an episode of the hills
3182962 on a day when major news organizations across the country are taking senator mccain to task for a steady stream of false negative attacks his campaign has launched yet another
3182963 10 leading black religious voices in the anti gay movement
3182964 not only is mccain a nitwit so are all the people around him
3182965 huamanity is leading the wrong kind of life contrary he is also the average man of the prosperous middle classs of his time and ours and he is confronted with disease dying and death he is an ordinary person neither virtuous nor particularly vicious a go getter in his profession a family man as marriages go who has children but has drifted apart from his wife he is slowly awakened to self conscousness and a realization of the falsity of his life and ambitions
3182966 i hope you hang yourself with your h amp m scarf while jacking off listening to mozart you bitch and moan about la wishing you were in the rain reading hemingway

3182968 hmm we should demolish this and build a mcdonalds here
3182969 i just think john edwards is an incredibly creepy individual and the very definition of faggy
3182970 once again ann coulter has made a cynical and desperate bid for attention by using a vulgar dehumanizing anti gay slur more and more fair minded americans believe that theres no place for this kind of bigotry and coulters shrinking media platform only confirms how out of step she is with the rest of this country

3182981 i would like to thank the players and the fans for their fantastic support and i wish the la galaxy much success in the future
3182982 both parties have agreed on mutually agreeable terms to part company
3182983 it is an amicable arrangement and we appreciate and respect the issues that ruud has highlighted with the club and are very grateful for all the hard work he has contributed while with the organisation hopefully he has laid the foundations for future success for the los angeles galaxy
3182984 with ruud moving on we believe that this is the right time to make more sweeping changes throughout the organisation
3182985 for example i hear so many guys using the terms tailor made and custom made interchangeably when theyre totally different
3182986 many guys can tell the difference between designers and wholesale brands or between high and low thread count in fabric but theyre baffled when it comes to the finer distinctions like the difference between custom suits and tailored suits thats where we can help
3182987 it comes down to the fact that if youve got two weeks or more then ordering a tailor made suit online and getting it handmade for your exact measurements by skilled tailors all for under 300 is really hard to beat

3182994 labels are good if they help you understand whats going on and bad if they lock you into some sort of fixed category where you either dont believe you can get out or perhaps worse start to feel comfortable and liberated from your own responsibility for your life and health
3182995 somehow in the last generation of doctors we seem to have lost our ability or perhaps our perceived right to give patients advice about their health only if we diagnose them with a disease or pre disease do we have something to tell them
3182996 i have trained very hard for the olympics and the victory is satisfying it is never easy playing taufik he is a true champion but i was determined and that made the difference
3182997 i knew that taufik would make me work hard but i was bent on making him do the same hence the reason for my aggression i think that caught him off guard
3182998 that is a problem with me but i have no complaints today yesterday as i started the first game well
3182999 in fact i even led 11 9 at the break which is something strange for me as i always struggle in the first match of every tournament
3183000 i still made some silly mistakes and i will have to minimise them as they could prove costly in the later rounds

3183003 als dat klopt betekenen deze russische acties een dramatische en brutale escalatie van het conflict in georgi

3183006 obamas campaign donation pages are rife with donations that end in cent thousands of them odd numbers all cathy and i have gone through thousands and thousands of foreign donations that end in cents as in dollars and cents for obama and there were none for mccain more evidence of foreign contributors since americans living overseas would almost uniformly be able to contribute dollars the donations dont show up on the fec search either by individual or by the candidate if you scroll through the pages of the donations alphabetically for obama the dollar amounts are what youd expect legitimate donations to look like i e 250 500 1000 2300 but when you look at the database of transactions it is nothing like that you get 74 37 42 95 116 38 29 70 like that those are actual examples clearly this is what you would get if you converted a foreign currency into dollars e g 50 euros would be roughly 77 12

3183011 at first a minute into it i was like im done playing i was just thinking the worst once i started getting the tingling back i got reassured
3183012 whatever route you have you better run it hard because the ball could be coming

3183014 its starting to show the guy can still play football
3183015 as soon as you come out of your break the balls right here
3183016 you just have to have your hands up real quick
3183017 when you have a guy who can pressure the defense in many ways you know every routes available on the field
3183018 i wouldnt only say its just how fast the ball is coming
3183019 hes not going to wait for your eye contact he expects you to be ready for the ball
3183020 theres no such thing as a decoy route not as long as you have brett back there
3183021 like i tell the guys even when youre covered youre not really covered if you have two hands and two arms youre not covered because hes going to hit one of them so just find a way as long as you can see him he can see you
3183022 he just threw it up in the air and let him get it and youre like wow
3183023 laveranues couldve closed his eyes and it was right there in his hands
3183024 just growing up and watching him play and now him actually being my quarterback id be lying to you if i told you it wasnt way different
3183025 i didnt ever think it was going to be like that but im getting used to it every day
3183026 ive never played with a quarterback whos had a no look pass in their repertoire
3183027 you would think its a lot harder to catch because its coming so fast but his spiral is so tight that its actually a lot easier to catch

3183047 i herd on the news that rusia has invaded but i dont see them no where wats going on
3183048 studies have shown that when used in combination with optimal medical therapy crt is associated with a 50 percent reduction in hospitalization for heart failure and a 36 percent reduction in mortality or death
3183049 we did this study to analyze if and how this new therapy is being used in u s hospitals
3183050 thats a small percentage when you consider that we estimate 30 percent to 50 percent of hospitalized patients with heart failure were eligible for crt based on previous studies
3183051 that means that there are a lot of patients who potentially could benefit from the device who arent receiving it
3183052 we also found that 10 percent of patients discharged with a new crt implant had an lvef of greater than 35 percent which suggests that those patients are over treated they have not been shown in trials to benefit from the therapy
3183053 i talked to some folks at sony but they were not interested in carrying the game later on i talked to someone from a different division who was interested but by then i had signed with microsoft and started the xbla port

3183060 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
3183061 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
3183062 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

3183072 two years ago i had decided to add a ccf fund pcrix to my asset allocation but i was not able to add it then with required minimum without affecting the overall desired allocation in the portfolio
3183073 1 you have waited two years whats the hurry wait another year and go without the insurance really ccf being so high now its likely not providing much insurance anyway
3183074 weve previously found that a low risk lifestyle was very important in preventing coronary heart disease and diabetes and now weve also found that these healthy habits can lower your risk of stroke
3183075 a healthy lifestyle is associated with an 80 percent lower risk for ischemic stroke compared to people who have none of these lifestyle factors
3183076 more than half of ischemic strokes might have been prevented if everyone adhered to these healthy lifestyle factors
3183077 identifying the specific normal cells that cancer come from can provide critical insight into how cancers develop this may help us develop more rational and effective approaches to treatment
3183078 simply mutating a gene is not enough to cause cancer the mutation has to happen in the right cell type at the right time in the case of patched gnps provide the critical context for tumor formation
3183079 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety
3183080 still to identify the first candidates for genes associated with an anxiety prone personality is a step in the right direction
3183081 this is telling you that being a runner being active is going to reduce your disability and its going to increase your survival
3183082 late in life you still see the benefit of vigorous activity
3183083 illness would be compressed between later age of onset and age of death and that paradigm was controversial because it went against conventional wisdom and had no proof
3183084 running delayed the onset of disability by an average of 16 years and that is largely a conservative number because the control group was pretty darn healthy
3183085 i always thought that the two curves would start to parallel each other and that eventually aging would overpower exercise
3183086 i think that will happen but we cant find even a little twitch toward that gap narrowing in the present time
3183087 vigorous activity has a really dramatic impact but we cant ignore that there are also helpful benefits to people who are active at all levels meaning those people who are just out walking
3183088 its so important to be physically active your whole life not just in your 20s or 40s but forever
3183089 i think this study demonstrates that the problem of refractive eyesight errors is on the increase particularly in terms of the amount of nearsightedness in the american population
3183090 no one knows for sure what accounts for this but its a pretty smart hypothesis that the increased amount of near work that were doing as a population may be increasing the incidence of nearsightedness and it does suggest that we should be looking into ways to deal with it
3183091 i would hazard to suggest that in general the widespread prevalence of refractive issues today could be related to environmental factors like extensive use of tv and computers and among the young video games because today we get much heavier loads on our eyes from all of that and those are strenuous activities for our vision
3183092 half the u s population needs glasses of some sort so this does not strike me as unusual at all
3183093 and so even though many patients routinely come in concerned about having a surgical problem its much more often this sort of issue im a surgeon but im very happy to tell people you dont need surgery and often they dont they just need eyeglasses
3183094 there are studies that link low vitamin d levels to the development of heart disease peripheral arterial disease diabetes hypertension and different cancers
3183095 those who had the lowest levels of vitamin d had a 26 percent higher risk of death from all causes compared to those with the highest vitamin d levels
3183096 i think people should optimize their diet and sun exposure to get an adequate level of vitamin d without taking supplements
3183097 it may be a good idea for people who are at risk for vitamin d deficiency including african americans and people who dont spend a lot of time in the sun to get their vitamin d levels checked by their doctor
3183098 we know that being vitamin d sufficient reduces the risk of having your first heart attack by more than 50 percent reduces the risk of having peripheral vascular disease by as much is 80 percent and decreases the risk of prostate colon breast and a whole host of other cancers by as much is 50 to 70 percent

3183102 the more he spoke to me about it the more i realised he had a wonderful idea for a light entertainment show
3183103 he wanted me to do it and it changed my life
3183104 he had a nose for a hit he was a wonderful showman and a great believer in his producers and he backed us to the hilt
3183105 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3183106 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3183107 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3183108 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government
3183109 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3183110 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3183111 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3183112 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3183113 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3183114 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3183115 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3183116 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3183117 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3183118 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3183119 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3183120 in this incident the positive and proactive initiative of the atc controller who on realising that mobile audio communication from the pilot was intermittent quickly switched to texting his instructions instead
3183121 this contributed to the safe resolution of the incident and for such the controller should be commended for his actions
3183122 obviously its a tough situation but this team has shown great perseverance all year and i expect it will continue
3183123 well continue to monitor the waiver wire but this underscores the emphasis that weve placed on depth we havent gotten to this point on the back of any one player its been a team effort all year and i expect that to continue
3183124 different things create opportunities you can reflect on the negative part or on the positive of giving these guys opportunities to help this team further our lead in the standings
3183125 thats the way were going to look at it it doesnt do any good to dwell on the other side
3183126 most crops in asias major wheat growing areas are vulnerable to ug99 so if it gets to these areas food shortages and famine could result
3183127 ug99 could also pose a bio security threat to australia
3183128 the challenge is to now identify and deploy more multiple resistance gene combinations that protect wheat against ug99 or find other ways to protect wheat from this fungus

3183133 when i was laying there on the field thats the most scared ive ever been
3183134 laying there for about a minute i couldnt feel my left side after the trainers came out about 30 seconds later i could start to get the feeling back its something i dont want to experience again
3183135 it was the first chance i had to do any contact since december of 06 so i was just real pumped up and i was the first one down there
3183136 i ran into the guy and the next thing i know im laying on my side and i couldnt move my left side thats basically it i hit him pretty hard i had to pick the biggest guy too
3183137 my mom was watching the arizona cardinals game and she saw my name go across the bottom line that i got carried off on a stretcher so she was freaking out
3183138 they taped it so im going to have to watch it when i get a chance to but it was kind of crazy
3183139 they said it scared them too they were just glad that i was all right
3183140 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3183141 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3183142 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3183143 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3183144 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3183145 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3183146 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3183147 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3183148 we are starting to roll out a fix now and hope to have the problem resolved as quickly as possible

3183154 is it wise to have a propane facility of this kind immediately adjacent to residential properties
3183155 obviously in light of what happened the answer is no
3183156 the yard had a right to be there a legal right
3183157 were going to investigate whether thats appropriate from the citys perspective were also going to work with the provincial regulator who oversees these kinds of facilities to make sure the regulations are being followed and are adequate to protect torontonians
3183158 at the federal level there are rules that govern the transportation of dangerous and toxic compounds and that includes propane
3183159 when a city is looking at where theyre going to locate a facility all of those federal rules and regulations are applied but its up to the city to actually make the rules
3183160 we have very strict regulations in place and a very robust safety system
3183161 if this is a 1 6 kilometre area of evacuation why isnt the propane yard 1 6 kilometres away
3183162 i was very surprised to the see the pictures of the explosion
3183163 its very typical of what youd normally see in this type of the facility when things go awry
3183164 something like 500 people died in that explosion and in toronto it could have been as bad as that
3183165 were just fortunate that our fire department was able to get a lot of water on these tanks when flame impinges on these pressurized tanks they literally explode sending shrapnel in all sorts of areas

3183189 civilization is a complex phenomenon and we can screw up
3183190 it would not surprise me at all if this were to occur
3183191 yes we have no experience with athletes here but the treatment is safe and we can help you
3183192 it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs it takes two weeks i recommend four intravenous injections 40 million stem cells or double that the more the better we also use human growth hormones but you have to be careful because they are on the doping list
3183193 i dont know how it was arranged or what level of hospital this was but it supports the idea that the world of athletics is very aware of gene doping and already pursuing it
3183194 there are interesting preliminary results but i cant expand on that
3183195 but were all encouraged by the results and wada very much wants to be ahead of the curve on this and has funded a dozen or more labs on gene doping
3183196 this is all very subjective but the hope is that it will be a fair process that will allow the athlete who has had gene therapy for legitimate reasons to state his or her purpose for it
3183197 the sporting authorities can then either accept or reject it
3183198 if gene doping is happening already as we suspect its being done unethically and with immature
3183199 i can lock you up without evidence and you wont see a lawyer for two years
3183200 when i was in the math club we always used to say dont judge a geek by his glasses
3183201 i can lock you up without evidence and you wont see a lawyer for two years
3183202 when i was in the math club we always used to say dont judge a geek by his glasses
3183203 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3183204 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3183205 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3183206 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3183207 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3183208 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about
3183209 as the days got long there was always one thing that would brighten my day seeing the american flag

3183214 somewhere out there in that chaos of darkness and light of science and protons of gods and stars and death somewhere theres an answer
3183215 there must be pockets of residents that have some kind of a characteristic that is contributing to a higher infant mortality whether thats substance abuse or something else

3183316 at this stage we cannot be sure if this u turn in fianna f il policy is simply the minister for education flying a kite la noel dempsey some years ago
3183317 however all three government parties went into the last election stating their unequivocal opposition to the reintroduction of fees and this is copperfastened in the programme for government
3183318 the reintroduction of college fees by fianna f il would be the most socially retrograde policy measure in a generation this is not about fairness this is not about reform this is simply about asking working irish families to stump up for the incompetence of fianna f il in managing the public finances
3183319 over the past few weeks we have heard a steadily rising chorus of calls for the reintroduction of fees from university presidents and others and it appears from comments made by minister batt okeeffe that the government is now about to capitulate to the pressure
3183320 at a time when we want to encourage more students to enter third level it would be short sighted and short termist to respond to the funding crisis by imposing what would essentially be a tax on those hoping to get a degree

3183356 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
3183357 i think every single candidate for president republican and democratic have lives personal lives that indicate something about what kind of human being they are and i think it is a fair evaluation for america to engage in to look at what kind of human beings each of us are and what kind of president wed make
3183358 its important that the american people have the opportunity to have a president like him
3183359 i didnt want it her cancer to take this away not just from me but from those people who depend on our having the kind of president he would be

3183373 his gallant action directly saved four men from certain serious injury or death america will always honor the name of this brave soldier who gave all for his country
3183374 he was a hero long before he died because he was willing to risk his life to protect the ideals of freedom and justice that america represents
3183375 he was always smiling he had a positive attitude he greeted leaders of the platoon with a sense of pride and urgency and to top it all off he was born on the exact day the u s army was created

3183401 older people have more limited access to psychological therapies than younger people fewer than 10 per cent of older people with clinical depression are referred to specialist mental health services compared with about 50 per cent of younger adults ageist attitudes can alsoinfluence the treatments that gps believe are suitable for older people
3183402 it is scandalous that older people may be denied treatment because depression is wrongly seen as a natural part of getting older
3183403 the truth is that in national security terms hes largely untested and untried
3183404 hes never been responsible for policy formulation hes never had leadership in a crisis or in anything larger than his own element on an aircraft carrier or in managing his own congressional staff its not clear that this is going to be the strong suit that he thinks it is mccains weakness is that hes always been for the use of force force and more force in my experience the only time to use force is as a last resort when he talks about throwing russia out of the g8 and makes ditties about bombing iran he betrays a disrespect for the office of the presidency
3183405 i have to believe that we will come out stronger

3183444 after the glasgow east byelection no one can doubt that labour is in a deep hole
3183445 this is much more serious than mid term blues which may be expected to evaporate as the general election approaches
3183446 first is the frantic search for some magic populist policy solution there is no single get out of jail card and it is foolish to believe that such simplistic solutions will do the trick indeed some are counter productive inviting the publics contempt by implying a desperation to buy support by ditching unpopular taxes or offering dubious incentives
3183447 dangling the carrot of home ownership in front of low income council tenants in current market conditions for example is a deeply suspect proposition
3183448 just as dubious is the siren call for more initiatives one of the greatest mistakes in government is to confuse activity with outcomes just because ministers feel busy devising 101 new ways of tackling a problem does not guarantee the problem gets solved
3183449 by 1995 the position had changed the electorate had decisively shifted their loyalty to tony blairs government in waiting and nothing could save john major we are not yet in that position today david cameron has still not secured the unequivocal support of the electorate
3183450 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3183451 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3183452 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3183453 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3183454 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3183455 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3183456 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3183457 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3183458 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3183459 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3183460 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3183461 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3183462 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3183463 the little man is healthy happy and as loud as his daddy
3183464 we knew it was going to get big but not this big to the point where were just trying to find places for people to go
3183465 china is highly regarded as one of the most important economies in the 21st century and beijing is the heart of this powerhouse the hotel with its enormous size quality amenities and services is a strong addition to our portfolio in this city
3183466 it just hasnt been publicized or presented in the right way
3183467 is their pocketbook hit hard enough for us to get folks where weve been trying to get em for years which is out of their cars
3183468 if we lose one employee it costs us a lot of money to replace them
3183469 more efficiently and avoid misusing it to regulate global climate change
3183470 it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impact affecting species
3183471 these changes take unbiased professional wildlife biologists out of the equation and put decisions in the hands of political appointees
3183472 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the grey whale

3183477 the band heaven and hell would like to apologize for not having played neon knights in jones beach in wantagh new york nor at pnc in holmdel new jersey on the metal masters tour much to their extreme dismay they had technical issues both nights that caused them to have to leave the stage prior to completing their set they would never intentionally be discourteous to people that are there to see them and leave the stage without playing every possible second they could and of all songs neon knights is one of their favorites to play again many apologies for the unfortunate circumstances
3183478 its one of the favorites on the new disc so we cant wait for people to hear it we had a really good time working with brian for the video too and were very happy with his work
3183479 kids come out and go totally bonkers or wait in line for two or three hours just to say whats up its really amazing to be a part of this
3183480 to be honest we dont give a damn what people think about our music
3183481 we just go into writing or recording sessions and give it 1 000 per cent and play it from the heart and its left in the lap of the gods for people to make of it what they will
3183482 i think if we worried too much about reactions wed be sitting at home twiddling our thumbs were really happy with what we made and thats the main thing for us
3183483 i think all musicians are directed by their own sense of creativity
3183484 if you worried yourself about what people are going to think about what youre doing i think the world would be a very stale place to live in

3183493 someone smashed one of the alarm call points after a big night out we know exactly who it was and the guest has been charged 1500 for the call out fee and to fix the call point
3183494 it was a fairly big stuff up by the guest and when she was asked why she did it she said she had no idea and she was upset and disappointed with herself she left next day
3183495 we were about 75 per cent full so thats about 200 people and we aim to get everyone out in about three minutes
3183496 when i was laying there on the field thats the most scared ive ever been
3183497 laying there for about a minute i couldnt feel my left side after the trainers came out about 30 seconds later i could start to get the feeling back its something i dont want to experience again
3183498 it was the first chance i had to do any contact since december of 06 so i was just real pumped up and i was the first one down there
3183499 i ran into the guy and the next thing i know im laying on my side and i couldnt move my left side thats basically it i hit him pretty hard i had to pick the biggest guy too
3183500 my mom was watching the arizona cardinals game and she saw my name go across the bottom line that i got carried off on a stretcher so she was freaking out
3183501 they taped it so im going to have to watch it when i get a chance to but it was kind of crazy

3183506 along with the headline grabbing 4 decline in the price of oil to 114 a barrel on friday there has been a rather widespread decline in commodities across the board over recent weeks
3183507 soft commodities such as wheat 48 and rice 28 have also dropped precipitously over recent weeks equity markets liked it with a strong rally on friday and why not
3183508 for central bankers who have not only had to deal with a combination of stubborn inflation pressures but also economies which are teetering on the brink of recession this is a welcome development
3183509 despite the recent fall in oil prices he trichet defended the july rate hike stressing that the ecb remained strongly committed to preventing second round effects materialising from the current elevated inflation readings
3183510 the soft landing we had anticipated and hoped for has instead been quite rocky
3183511 price reductions are continuing nationally and while there have been reductions in all segments the sharper fall in the price of new houses reflects a more aggressive approach by developers in order to stimulate some market demand
3183512 russian forces came to the central route and cut off connections between western and eastern georgia
3183513 there is parallel growth across all categories including newer areas such as bottled water fruit juice still and juice drinks which are growing in parallel to the more established categories
3183514 new and innovative products have contributed to the growth in the no low calorie product choices as key drivers for the total soft drinks category and in the last few years have come to dominate the overall category orange juice for example is no longer seen as a staple breakfast only product consumers are making healthy choices individually and for their families at all levels and this is reflected in our own industry figures
3183515 in the past we have come through many industry cycles so the current conditions are nothing new to us we have proven before our ability to outperform our peers in good times and challenging times
3183516 many companies in this industry are privately owned family enterprises who perhaps havent felt enough pain in the current economic climate to want to sell up wed suspect that many of them mightnt come to the table for a couple of years with a price we would see as being reasonable for our shareholders
3183517 eircoms storm response plan has been in operation since last saturday with significant extra resourcing deployed to assist our repair teams while we continue to make progress in our recovery plan with over 2 500 faults cleared since saturday the ongoing flooding in many areas of the country is resulting in sustained customer fault reports since the rain storms hit on saturday more than 3 500 additional telephone faults have been reported

3183523 the leprechaun went missing many many months ago and i had forgotten about it
3183524 then i opened the door on thursday and saw he was back it was such a shock i thought well its a bit of mischief but at least he hasnt been put through the window
3183525 murphy was quite badly damaged and there was a tightly wrapped parcel next to him my curiosity eventually overcame my alarm because i did wonder if it might explode
3183526 then i saw it was a beautifully bound photo album and opened it up
3183527 his feet were missing but thats no real surprise given that he was sent abseiling down a mountain
3183528 i just keep thinking how funny it is it makes me smile to see all the people he met on his travels it was a wonderful surprise and of course its so nice to get some good news
3183529 the story really is unbelievable people have mentioned to me how similar his adventure is to the film amelie so perhaps the people who took him got their inspiration from that
3183530 hello first of all i feel i should explain my prolonged absence a gnomes life is full of time for reflection and whilst surveying your garden one summer morning i began to get itchy feet
3183531 i came to the conclusion that the world is a big place and there is more to life than watching the daily commuter traffic and allowing passing cats to urinate on you
3183532 so i decided to free myself from the doldrums of the shire and seek adventure my travels have taken me across three continents 12 countries and more time zones than i can possibly remember
3183533 there have been high points low points and positively terrifying points but i have survived small thanks to the companion with whom i have shared all these moments
3183534 it was a beautifully written letter the intriguing thing is that someone had gone to such trouble to do this for a complete stranger

3183538 we have decided to formalise our position to fifa and will be writing to them seeking a change of venue
3183539 the safety of the players and fans must be our primary concern we will of course monitor the situation carefully but at this stage we cannot be assured of our safety in georgia
3183540 we will work with fifa uefa and the georgian fa to help in whatever way we can to make sure the game does not become a casualty of what is a very sad and difficult situation
3183541 we are discussing the final venue but it will be played in either baku in azerbaijan or abovyan in armenia
3183542 one of the main reasons we originally moved into the x86 processor business was because we believed that ultimately the third party chipset market would disappear and we would need to have the capability to provide a complete platform

3183551 it is obvious that as world champions our biggest strengths are in the lineout and in the scrum
3183552 and it is precisely here where the opposition will try and neutralise us
3183553 we have picked up three things that they do which are illegal in the lineouts
3183554 it starts with their flanker coming through the lineout illegally to stop any ball thrown down to the scrumhalf
3183555 i did a five album deal and i dont think it would be right to be making streets albums after that
3183556 i always envisaged them as a box set and ive got a vision for each of the albums
3183557 the next one will bring it back to the start in a way
3183558 it will be a lot more futuristic in terms of production but a lot more train of thought
3183559 so when you say sex operator is it like oh everyone has the problem sometimes or now im putting peanut butter on my ass
3183560 this is a fantastic opportunity and i am really looking forward to embracing laras world
3183561 i still cant believe they chose me to take on the role of lara and i cant wait to get stuck in this is my dream job i have always wanted to be an action hero and hope to be able to use my gymnastic ability to perform all of laras stunts it is slightly daunting but i am really excited at the same time
3183562 you were always so shy im so proud of you
3183563 but i know youre gonna go home with a confidence you never knew you had and youre gonna work that shit all day every day
3183564 in their debates the church fathers regularly reference the teachings of the apostles which they call traditions and which they in many places state are contained in the writings of the apostles in fact in many places particularly in irenaeus tertullian mattemus and augustine the word tradition is used as a pseudonym for the epistles of paul peter etc the church fathers seemed to have 4 parts of scripture the law the prophets the gospels and the apostolic tradition the reflection is clear
3183565 anyhow that is exactly how i believe tradition works tradition whatever it is within a particular church cannot and must not claim as doctrine anything which cannot be soundly established in scripture
3183566 the whole basis of every attack by the church fathers on heresy was scripture doesnt say it and we havent interpreted the scriptures to say it
3183567 on the contrary traditions must always be based checked against and measured by the clear teaching of scripture
3183568 this is sola scriptura not solo scriptura solo scriptura means me amp my bible all by myself in a dark corner sola scriptura means scripture first scripture primary it never ever meant scripture alone
3183569 nor are they the property of the church but rather the church is owned by the scriptures after all christ is the word and the church is his
3183570 a deposit of faith makes it sound like scripture is the churchs property something the church wrote and collected together
3183571 is it honest from the exegetes point of view to jockey with the words of our lord by taking them out of their context by taking them out of any context in order to transfer them to that of protestant polemic to secure victory in a conflict with which they are not concerned
3183572 that is precisely the point where the reformers and too the church fathers attack such doctrines as indulgences pray for the dead the real though unbloody sacrifice of the mass etc the historical account does not credit the position that these teachings are divine reflecting both a development and in some cases a clear origination papal infallibility for example out of circumstances completely ungodly for one thing the church fathers clearly do not support them their polemic disagrees entirely with the typical traditions defended under sacred tradition

3183627 state may be conceived of as itself the sole source of legality the fons et origo of all those laws which condition its own actions and determine the legal relations of those subject to its authority
3183628 the rechtsstaat could provide redress against administrative action but stopped short of providing a general sanction against governments as a result the prussian government was strictly non responsible in both a political and legal sense
3183629 in most national communities a law draws support from its having been made in accordance with the process established by the constitution which is the ultimate rule of recognition
3183630 the two world wars and the intervening period thus constitute a single unit
3183631 seeking to restore a moral component to political thought political theorists were determined to adapt the old ideal of the rule of law to the conditions of the modern state eminent scholars such as friedrich von hayek louis hartz and seymour m lipset extolled the virtues of constitutionalism defining it as a commitment to the rule of law that core characteristic of the liberal state included limited government protection for individual rights and a role for the judiciary under such protection
3183632 legitimation effect can be defined as the process through which systematic losers come to understand themselves as part of the system as self governing and as having willed their losses and their subordinate status
3183633 the period after 1945 can be said to have witnessed the emancipation of the rechtsstaat in germany yet it is strange that an idea which for so long had been central to the german legal tradition should have been made subordinate to the dictates of arbitrary authority
3183634 the institutionalization of the sovereignty of states and the use of power balancing mechanisms formed the basis of what some analysts have dubbed an international society a society albeit of states or their ruling groups devoted to the interests and maintenance of those states or ruling groups
3183635 the system thus brought into being was thus a product of the character needs and interests of its constituent parts the member states or rather the dominant interests within those states jones 1995 50 jones 1995 53
3183636 the idea that societies which do not possess certain economic systems and corresponding political institutions should be regarded as outlaws that musty be appropriately disciplined and reformed is a very old one
3183637 what vattel describes is something akin to an economic rogue state a state that must be exterminated
3183638 in the end some internationalization of structural constitutional issues may be both unavoidable and even desirable the ultimate violation of a constitution is a military coup and one might think twice about returning to the days when coups were considered purely internal matters
3183639 now however such deviant states are to be identified by all the economic criteria formulated by the ifis states that are protectionist inefficient and encumbered by bureaucracy and government regulation must be eliminated as it were through saps that will bring about their transformation into proper international citizens
3183640 in spite of the progress of multilateralism and internationalism before and during the 1990s the international system remains largely nationally rooted with state actors in competition
3183641 the justice of law justice as law is not justice laws are not just as laws one obeys them not because they are just but because they have authority
3183642 the business of the constitution is to express the politys most basic legal and political commitments
3183643 simple reason tells us that nothing is just in itself everything crumbles with time custom is the sole basis for equity for the simple reason that it was received it is the mystical foundation of its authority whoever traces it to its source annihilates it
3183644 the origin of authority the foundation or ground the position of law cant by definition rest on anything but themselves
3183645 as for the more radical islamist project its supporters considered that the sole possible chechen democracy was a constitutional theocracy the only reasonable alternative to western and russian politically and ideologically prostituted constitutionalism this model envisaged the suppression of democratic institutions for instance the substitution of a secret ballot by an open nominal referendum
3183646 theocracy places all sovereignty and authority in the hands of god
3183647 a mode of governance prioritizing a religious conception of the good that is strict and comprehensive in its range of teaching
3183648 consequently i do not believe that one can divorce religion from the context in which it has existed in the world religion is not merely a series of conduct codes and precepts religion is not merely a moral philosophy nor a naked spirituality it is a world view
3183649 ive never seen anything like this in my career for software
3183650 who knows maybe it will be a 1 billion marketplace at some point in time

3183733 at the time robert gibbs was working with a shadowy group called americans for jobs health care amp progressive values the so called 527 political group paid for the ad but refused to disclose in a timely manner who was financing the effort because federal law did not require it to do so

3183788 its not good enough in our view a month on to have this community still very much in the dark
3183789 what they need is some certainty and what they need is some hope for the future and its not good enough a month on for governments to remain silent and not to provide that hope

3183849 the relatively mild winter of 07 08 has set up a bountiful crop potential for the fall early surges of temperatures into the 90s in april got the vines off to a quick start almost too quick since later spring frosts were still to come by burning hay bales in the vineyard on those frosty nights we were able to avert frost damage thus minimizing bud loss plentiful rain in late june and july helped to relieve the drought like conditions of the late spring and the vines have grown lush on keuka lake we suffered some mild hail damage in late july from severe thunderstorms but the verdant health of the vines has kept them from being overly traumatized as we get closer to harvest we will continue hand manicuring the vines to allow for good air and sun penetration this is the cornerstone of sustainable viticulture a hands on approach that is reflected in the quality wines we produce

3183907 see or would have rather i let it get you
3183908 but still couldnt you have just i dunno used a tranquilliser gun
3183909 this is fantastic she really is quite an aggressive little creature isnt she
3183910 i um dont think you should be taunting it like that doctor i mean what if she escapes or something
3183911 you kidding this cage is completely resistant to lock picking physical tampering telepathic influences and all those other things you humans come up with and since im the one that latched it shut itll only open if im the one to unlatch it dna recognition go get some sleep ive got to run some tests on this little darling
3183912 thanks at least i know where the banana in my dreams came from
3183913 when i was laying there on the field thats the most scared ive ever been
3183914 laying there for about a minute i couldnt feel my left side after the trainers came out about 30 seconds later i could start to get the feeling back its something i dont want to experience again
3183915 it was the first chance i had to do any contact since december of 06 so i was just real pumped up and i was the first one down there
3183916 i ran into the guy and the next thing i know im laying on my side and i couldnt move my left side thats basically it i hit him pretty hard i had to pick the biggest guy too
3183917 my mom was watching the arizona cardinals game and she saw my name go across the bottom line that i got carried off on a stretcher so she was freaking out
3183918 they taped it so im going to have to watch it when i get a chance to but it was kind of crazy
3183919 they said it scared them too they were just glad that i was all right
3183920 the necks just a little stiff but other than that it feels pretty good to finally get out here
3183921 whatever route you have you better run it hard because the ball could be coming
3183922 if youre not looking you may get hit in the head
3183923 its starting to show the guy can still play football
3183924 as soon as you come out of your break the balls right here
3183925 you just have to have your hands up real quick
3183926 when you have a guy who can pressure the defense in many ways you know every routes available on the field
3183927 i wouldnt only say its just how fast the ball is coming
3183928 hes not going to wait for your eye contact he expects you to be ready for the ball
3183929 theres no such thing as a decoy route not as long as you have brett back there
3183930 like i tell the guys even when youre covered youre not really covered if you have two hands and two arms youre not covered because hes going to hit one of them so just find a way as long as you can see him he can see you
3183931 he just threw it up in the air and let him get it and youre like wow
3183932 laveranues couldve closed his eyes and it was right there in his hands
3183933 just growing up and watching him play and now him actually being my quarterback id be lying to you if i told you it wasnt way different
3183934 i didnt ever think it was going to be like that but im getting used to it every day
3183935 ive never played with a quarterback whos had a no look pass in their repertoire
3183936 you would think its a lot harder to catch because its coming so fast but his spiral is so tight that its actually a lot easier to catch
3183937 he does like to spread the ball around a lot
3183938 he gets the ball to the tight ends a lot i spoke to bubba and he said be ready hes right because at any time the ball can be coming your way it makes it a little more fun because you get out there and youre running routes and you know youre a live option on every play

3183959 but dont we have the freedom to say bam bam bhole in this country islamic cries are raised in political rallies in kashmir 24 hours a day nobody seems to object to that why question this
3183960 let the country see for itself here we are carrying the tiranga and there in kashmir you see the pakistani flag let people judge where national interest lies

3184097 la espa a de hoy es fruto de todas esas civilizaciones que se pueden ver en la exposici n y forman un crisol de culturas de mestizaje y cambio cultural que han aterrizado que han estado que han convivido y que han conformado nuestro pa s a lo largo de los siglos
3184098 en este mundo actual globalizado e intercultural es muy importante el di logo por lo que resultaba oportuno presentar esta exposici n
3184099 es una exposici n que habla del mestizaje cultural de espa a de un pa s que ha estado sujeto a lo largo de toda su historia a muchos cambios transformaciones encuentros y desencuentros
3184100 esta exposici n para m xico es muy importante porque nos vincula directamente a la cultura mexicana posterior a la conquista
3184101 so this is one of those all too rare occasions when i wish i could give more than 5 stars
3184102 how is this a marketing job this is a door to door sales

3184114 this a place i have been visting for the better part of 20 years or so
3184115 i saw you immediately grabbed for my ticket to see if i had paid
3184116 so the chinese food is on the healthier side and the quality of ingredients is high for chinese food so is the nice restaurant the only problem is the food is kind of boring in flavor

3184128 he gave me all his personal belongings and said goodbye to me
3184129 he took off because he knew if he got caught hed go back to jail
3184130 in his eyes he was either going to die or go to jail and he chose to die
3184131 were finding as a whole people really are not willing to give up vacations
3184132 we only have one vacation a year so we had to do it
3184133 i think people really are just kind of improvising in order to continue to travel
3184134 this is the kick in the butt i needed to crank out a film every 4 months
3184135 i usually avoid broadway at all costs when im feeling the need to party sip bar amp lounge totally changed that for me
3184136 yeah i know guys come in here expecting a face full of monkey and instead they see that its a restaurant

3184145 theres nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come
3184146 if id won a few more points there we wouldnt be talking this way
3184147 we didnt speak a lot about rankings in any way
3184148 i just think more about you know being at the top for a long time i mean at the top doesnt mean no 1 in the world it can mean deep into grand slams being in the top five top 10 for whatever 10 years 15 years just be up there and having a shot at grand slams
3184149 and i always knew i mean you cant keep your ranking forever if ever that were to happen i think you have to you know sort of have a different maybe approach see whats the next step does it come down to the majors do you want to chase it again
3184150 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intent in georgia and the region
3184151 these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize relations with the united states and europe
3184152 we left behind all the equipment in the hospital and 80 bodies in the morgue
3184153 the situation in georgia is very difficult because russia is doing everything possible to occupy the country
3184154 if tbilisi comes under threat i will inform the residents 12 hours in advance
3184155 thats something thats definitely there for me to see and get me motivated and more excited
3184156 if i could wish for anything in the world i would want
3184157 todo es una farsa porque jam s se consulta a los trabajadores

3184160 al principio recib amos muchas cartas de ellos pero ahora ya no sabemos nada
3184161 s lo es un nombre y no nos distinguimos del resto de refugiados
3184162 algunos emigrantes sudaneses se hiciesen pasar por ni os perdidos lo que paraliz el proceso de reubicaci n de nuestro grupo

3184166 resultar a nuevo para m no sabr a por d nde empezar adem s nunca he sabido si mis padres fueron asesinados o les liberaron
3184167 mi programa ofrece a los refugiados una nueva vida y un nuevo comienzo en estados unidos
3184168 urgimos a todas las partes a que aprovechen esta oportunidad para comenzar un di logo franco para resolver temas pendientes y definir un camino hacia adelante que una a todos los bolivianos
3184169 en su viaje hacia un futuro m s democr tico y pr spero
3184170 una vez que se confirmen cu ntos prefectos han sido revocados lo que corresponder es designar prefectos interinos por parte del presidente de la rep blica

3184172 de forma contundente el bombardeo fuera de osetia del sur

3184175 there is a weight associated with death and darkness there is a counterweight associated with joy blessing and abundant life one will always outweigh the other the latter is much greater for me now i am experiencing joy at a deep level that drives the burden and fear of an unwelcomed end of life near
3184176 is intended as a first step alerting donors who might be considering giving to right wing groups to a variety of potential dangers including legal trouble public exposure and watchdog groups digging through their lives
3184177 estos ataques traicioneros se pueden comparar con la invasi n de hitler a la uni n sovi tica en junio de 1941
3184178 para mantener la integridad territorial de georgia destruyendo la de osetia
3184179 compared to the other candidate do you like yours a great deal better somewhat better a little better and then only asking voters who answered
3184180 the iraqi military and the iraqi people take matters into their own hands and force saddam hussein the dictator to step aside
3184181 he was a sales manager for our company and it occurred to him that there were awards for hitting but none for defense
3184182 call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
3184183 i dont know any other talked about contender who would have an impact in anything more than one state sen clinton would have an impact in 10 or 15 states and could make the difference in those states
3184184 for decades hes been washingtons biggest celebrity and as washington embraced him john mccain hugged right back
3184185 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3184186 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3184187 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3184188 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3184189 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3184190 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3184191 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3184192 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3184193 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3184194 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3184195 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3184196 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3184197 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3184198 i dont need a million people to see my things just the right people who have hopefully good taste to buy my things
3184199 youre always taking a risk with sellers from sites like these
3184200 unless there are guarantees or some seller ratings like the ones ebay has accumulated over time there will always be some bad experiences
3184201 they lost focus all their money comes from sellers buyers are what drive the market but you need quality and protection for the sellers or else they dont even want to deal with the buyers
3184202 this is not about south ossetia this is not even about abkhazia its all about independence and democracy in georgia putin is personally commanding this operation the purpose is to depose the democratically elected government of georgia
3184203 we support the governments urgency in moving swiftly on this
3184204 in the original selection process the airforce took nearly 10 months and botched the job to do what it now plans to do in three

3184207 everyone thinks theyre a traffic expert including me prior to writing this book
3184208 i felt so bad about it i started asking friends whether they were early or late mergers
3184209 the more i looked at it the more i found intriguing things
3184210 the road more than simply a system of regulations and designs is a place where many millions of us with only loose parameters for how to behave are thrown together daily in a kind of massive petri dish in which all kinds of uncharted little understood dynamics are at work
3184211 what do we really know about how it all works why do we act the way we do on the road and what might it say about us
3184212 freed from our own identity and surrounded by others known only by their screen names in traffic license plates the chat room becomes a place where the normal constraints of life are left behind
3184213 may be the most powerful human force we lose in traffic
3184214 it is arguably the reason why humans normally a quite cooperative species in comparison with our closest primate relatives can become so noncooperative on the road
3184215 in 1950 women made up 28 percent of the work force
3184216 today that figure is 48 percent how could the roads not have gotten more crowded
3184217 parents on the school run are thought to boost traffic on the roads by some 30 percent
3184218 i think if there was a miracle drug the fda approved that could save 7 000 lives a year people would want to take a look at it
3184219 it was mostly ad libbed with russell asking her for advice about hosting the show
3184220 theres also a 9 000 pound elephant in it as in the elephant in the room
3184221 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3184222 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3184223 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3184224 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3184225 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3184226 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3184227 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3184228 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3184229 do you realize this wine tastes very poor its been watered down
3184230 eh i eh er um dont need the rioja now
3184231 yeah i seemed to have poured my water into the same glass as my wine

3184233 spending all my time and energy striving towards academic success only to wake up at age 45 or so childless and joyless and potentially not even that successful regretting nothing so much as my own ambition and realizing that i have worked my ass off and done everything i said i would do only to actually really achieve nothing in the greater scheme
3184234 i dont know how to really love and ive never been in love regardless of being married for 13 years
3184235 its because of people like me that certain people dont give themselves 100 in a relationship because people like me hurt them
3184236 molly does it scare you that i have thought all this out
3184237 no it just means i have found a kinder spirit

3184239 for sure him coming here was the best thing that could happen to hockey
3184240 when you do well in los angeles everybody knows and starts watching
3184241 why are you all looking around im getting dizzy spinning like you are
3184242 about time you realize who was talking my master by the way you were right you are my creator and master but those who abuse their power are bound to fall master ang taught you that
3184243 the three of them labeled me a monster because of my metal
3184244 so are you going to tell me your name or do i actually have to name you
3184245 to tell the truth the spirits over there that called me a monster are only using the names their masters gave them because its easier
3184246 his name is reaper this blade that was nameless will now be known as reaper understand and he isnt a monster or a vampire just a very unique blade
3184247 what a marvelous name for a sword as wonderful as you reaper a pleasure to meet you
3184248 arent you going to say something miss ashley or you miss hellia you might have called me a monster but you didnt know any better so i hold no grudge
3184249 what is wrong with you miss ashley all i did was ask if you were alright thats no reason for wanting to punch me
3184250 maybe it has to do with the fact that your arm is around her
3184251 thats why he received the playful name of the villages big teddy bear brother reaper
3184252 thats right a little of the shinki that you used for reaper was used in coatl they are like brothers too
3184253 brothers by blood brothers in arms and brothers through steel so much bonding it could bring a tear to a grown mans eyes
3184254 where are you going do you have any idea what to do
3184255 oh loribeth you cant see my car its such a mess
3184256 well you should have read page 18 and you wouldnt be going through what youre going through

3184258 if we had some sort of secret 100 working missle shield we wouldnt use it for a bunch of uncivilized rednecks i mean those people have genetic problems
3184259 relentless campaign to prosecute and convict the highest echelons of the colombo family and la cosa nostra as a whole
3184260 even after we get 50 percent of the place and our money give him a expletive beating anyway
3184261 the searches in europe are going on as i speak
3184262 they have already seized half a billion euro dollars as well as a large cache of firearms
3184263 all the intelligence we have gathered here in australia all the intelligence about the methodology will be shared with our european partners so we can shut this syndicate down
3184264 i wish every mother in america had a son like mine
3184265 its tragic for him and his family to have to continually go through this its almost laughable
3184266 i know my father loved me but i got to question how much to put me with all these wolves
3184267 he may have tried to portray himself as a reluctant mobster but theres little doubt he jumped in with both feet and then once he saw how it ruined his fathers life and his life he tried to get away from it
3184268 the third time that he walked out of court he gave me a sly grin as he was able to go home to his family but i swore then that until the ends of time that until he goes to hell without an asbestos suit that id see him in court again and that wish has come true
3184269 my family lives in fear as a result of this
3184270 what happens next does it make it all better if i get one in my head does it make it all better if im found in the street
3184271 i know my father loved me but i got to question how much to put me with all these wolves this is the world you put your kid in so much treachery my father couldnt have love me to push me into this life
3184272 but what about nato with americas support georgia will become a member of nato wont that make a difference
3184273 offensive coordinator james franklin today gave them all equal reps and alternated them with the teams were keeping the passing stats and all that the one thing i think is an important stat and maybe the most important stat is to keep track of who puts the ball in the end zone thats the important stat
3184274 theyre playing better than we did last year at this point knock on wood
3184275 there were good things and some things weve got to get a lot better at
3184276 hes getting better and we need him to keep coming along

3184300 the report highlights what can go wrong on holiday it is a reminder to all that taking out comprehensive travel insurance is a crucial part of your holiday planning and not something that should be sacrificed to save a few pounds
3184301 i believe that whatever doesnt kill you only makes you stranger
3184302 im talking about the kind of city that idolizes a masked vigilante
3184303 gothams proud of an ordinary man standing up for whats right
3184304 elected officials not a man who thinks hes above the law
3184305 all of us who stood by and let scum take control of our city
3184306 when their enemies were at the gate the romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city it wasnt considered an honor it was considered a public service
3184307 well i guess you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain
3184308 look whoever the batman is he doesnt want to spend the rest of his life doing this how could he batmans looking for someone to take up his mantle
3184309 harvey is that hero he locked up half the citys criminals and he did it without wearing a mask gotham needs a hero with a face
3184310 real face is the one that criminals now fear the man i loved the man who vanished he never came back at all
3184311 criminals in this town used to believe in things honor respect
3184312 you crossed it first sir youve hammered them squeezed them to the point of desperation and now in their desperation theyve turned to a man they dont fully understand
3184313 respectfully master wayne perhaps this is a man you dont fully understand either
3184314 i found a child playing with a ruby the size of a tangerine the bandit had been throwing the stones away
3184315 because some men arent looking for anything logical like money they cant be bought bullied reasoned or negotiated with
3184316 you got rules the joker hes got no rules no ones gonna cross him for you
3184317 you have nothing nothing to threaten me with nothing to do with all your strength
3184318 im a man of simple tastes i like dynamite gunpowder and gasoline and you know what they have in common theyre cheap
3184319 all you care about is money this city deserves a better class of criminal and im going to give it to them
3184320 then well see just how loyal a hungry dog really is
3184321 a vigilante is just a man lost in the scramble for his own gratification he can be destroyed or locked up but if you make yourself more than just a man if you devote yourself to an ideal and if they cant stop you then you become something else entirely
3184322 i guess this is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object
3184323 youre the symbol of hope that i could never be
3184324 your stand against organized crime is the first legitimate ray of light in gotham for decades if anyone saw this everything would be undone all the criminals you got off the streets would be released and jim gordon will have died for nothing
3184325 no one else will die because of me gotham is in your hands now
3184326 ive seen now what i would have to become to stop men like him
3184327 take it theyll hate you for it but thats the point of batman he can be the outcast he can make the choice no one else can face the right choice
3184328 but the night is darkest just before the dawn and i promise you the dawn is coming
3184329 one day the batman will have to answer for the laws hes broken but to us not to this madman
3184330 both bruce and mr dent believe that batman stands for something more important than a terrorists whims miss dawes even if everyone hates him for it thats the sacrifice hes making to not be a hero to be something more
3184331 well youre right about one thing letting harvey take the fall is not heroic
3184332 this is the jokers chance and when he attacks batman will take him down
3184333 does it depress you commissioner to know just how alone you really are
3184334 does it make you feel responsible for harvey dents current predicament
3184335 those mob fools want you gone so they can get back to the way things were
3184336 but i know the no going back youve changed things forever
3184337 you know for awhile there i thought you really were dent
3184338 why dont you take off your little mask and show us all who you really are
3184339 nothing to threaten me with nothing to do with all your strength
3184340 when i told you that if gotham no longer needed batman we could be together i meant it but im not sure the day will come when
3184341 it was my fault alfred i made them leave the theater
3184342 did i bring this on her i was meant to inspire good not madness not death
3184343 you have inspired good but you spat in the face of gothams you think there might be casualties things were always going to get worse before they got better

3184389 california democrat nancy pelosi may be trying to save the planet but the rank and file in her party increasingly are just trying to save their political hides when it comes to gas prices as republicans apply more and more rhetorical muscle
3184390 as she talks about her legacy in posh book stores millions of americans are struggling to fill up their gas tanks pelosi meanwhile has repeatedly dismissed the republican revolt taking place on the u s house floor refusing to address the no 1 issue facing our country by blocking a vote in congress yesterday she disgracefully mocked the gops call for more energy exploration republicans arent letting her get away with it house gop whip roy blunt who led republicans onto the floor today put it bluntly why is nancy pelosi taking care of personal business rather than the peoples business if democrats were sincere they would join republicans and sign a discharge petition to force a vote on energy legislation blunt said he noted that even rep rick boucher d va refused to sign a discharge petition for his own bill h r 2208 the coal to liquid fuel act
3184391 this past sunday my wife elizabeth and four children were packing the family mini van for a planned vacation to upper michigan when i received an urgent
3184392 we also have to do more to support and strengthen lgbt families
3184393 because equality in relationship family and adoption rights is not some abstract principle its about whether millions of lgbt americans can finally live lives marked by dignity and freedom
3184394 thats why we have to repeal laws like the defense of marriage act thats why we have to eliminate discrimination against lgbt families and thats why we have to extend equal treatment in our family and adoption laws
3184395 desire to build a life with a loved one to provide for a family and to have children who will grow and thrive are desires that all people share regardless of race sex religion sexual orientation or gender identity
3184396 that the cost of the american dream must never come at the expense of the american family for decades weve had politicians in washington who talk about family values but we havent had policies that value families instead its harder for working parents to make a living while raising their kids its even harder to get a break
3184397 since all of the ingredients came from our kitchen cabinets from our cupboards i combined brown rice canned pumpkin garbanzo beans raisins sliced almonds cinnamon nutmeg and onion sauteed in balsamic vinegar and olive oil how to
3184398 for some reason the states struggling most with rural fatalities are not using one of the most powerful tools at their disposal
3184399 it makes no sense that in more than half of the states law enforcement officials can stop drivers for having a burned out tail light or outdated license tags but they are banned from enforcing the safety law that may prevent more highway fatalities than any other
3184400 over 90 percent of thanksgiving trips will be by car and many will pass through rural areas
3184401 those scenic rural drives over the river and through the woods may seem safer than urban trips but thats not true particularly if you can get away with not buckling up
3184402 if youre thinking about buying a passenger car then the crash test scores can be useful to you
3184403 but if you are thinking of buying a truck we have no evidence that the tests are meaningful in terms of real world performance in serious crashes
3184404 it turns out that the government does as good a job as the private sector does at predicting the relative death rate for passenger cars the tests can be seen as complimentary of each other though they are quite different
3184405 shake him until he throws up and chokes on his own vomit
3184406 let me see if ive got this right you want me to study really hard and get good grades so i can get into the right high school where i study hard and get good grades to get into a good college where i study hard and get good grades to get into grad school where i study hard and get good grades so i can graduate and find a good job where i can work my ass off until its time for me to retire right wheres the joy

3184409 were very hard to read it took me a while to type this up sarcasm
3184410 i can give you free medical advice that is better than any dumb doctors
3184411 those damn doctors dont know what they are doing ive seen scrubs and e r there should be somebody more senior preferably male with grey hair and a white coat watching over you flunkies
3184412 this isnt called the brew run because its in brewster ma
3184413 the worst part of getting a blow job is the swallow pause
3184414 ay you know what i mean theyll just be going away on you slurping like a lollipop all systems go and then therell be the pause
3184415 now women women have perfected the pre suck pause unless theres something truly unexpected in the operation theyve decided whether to spit or swallow before the blokes ever got his trousers off
3184416 we may not want to swallow but theres the voice in the back of our heads saying if i were the one receiving instead of giving would i be insulted if the ending was anticlimactic and for a split second theres paralysis because of that sympathy
3184417 thats a fascinating look into the dynamics of male male sex my question is why did you feel the need to explain well now
3184418 i dont care what they say i am not having sex with you to get out of here
3184419 see after hesh got his twelve minutes of mary sue fangirls wrote to the producers and explained that a real fan episode would need to cater to slashers and they totally bought it
3184420 why does that mean everyones now gay and always has been
3184421 after all who wants to have sex with an icky
3184422 because im telling you people it doesnt suck all that much
3184423 fine lets get this over with if anyone asks i was thinking about the debbies
3184424 hyde said looking around the overdecorated church with visible disgust
3184425 what did you expect queer eye for the straight guy
3184426 why do you care if there are two grooms michael and fez are your best friends i thought you were totally down with their gay wedding
3184427 i am im just pointing out that the decorator most definitely had a queer eye
3184428 father bob here is just having a hard time accepting my vows to fez
3184429 quoting ben afflecks gay wedding speech is not a vow michael
3184430 your love has opened up so many parts of my heart that i did not know existed especially the queer parts there are so many things that you are
3184431 but no those vows are for ben and matt and their pure true love alone good day to them
3184432 now kiss me you beautiful thing and lets try again
3184433 so were dead in hell and your running the joint
3184434 running in a covert operation to overthrow wolfram and hart
3184435 whatever and her idea of a good time is to make us redo movies because she needs an undead bitch chuckle or six and wants to get one last good snap on angel
3184436 well if shes going to make us do y tu mama tambien for a week straight when oh when is the bitch going to let us have that threesome
3184437 because im ready willing and able to fuck you man
3184438 i suspect the truth is lilahs tried to fit in the time to play along and not found it
3184439 this is hell after all threesomes might be quite out of the question
3184440 i swear to jesus we should have just stayed together
3184441 on a scale of 1 to 10 i think the eternal torture of taking a beautiful roadtrip together and not getting to fuck rates a minus five
3184442 but ill remind the lady in question weve been very good
3184443 since when did joey and justin fight about fucking chopping bits of their dick off on the tour bus and where the hell did joey come up with all that religious and medical stuff out of nowhere
3184444 would you like me to whip it out for you
3184445 you wondering what my cock looks like is an idle curiosity
3184446 shit id hate to see what a burning desire looks like on you bro
3184447 so you gonna tell me or do i have to show you mine before you show me yours
3184448 hey do you think this how bowie and jagger ended up fucking possibly without the circumcision debate
3184449 you set the mood with a fire on the tv
3184450 buck nasty i see youre as ignorant of fire code as you are basic hygiene
3184451 i cannot have a fireplace in my apartment so i set the ambience with substitutions
3184452 you mean like using viagra cuz you cant provide a natural erection
3184453 i wouldnt know about that why dont you ask your last boyfriend bob dole
3184454 silky your dicks so small they have to find it with
3184455 is that what your mama told you when she put you to bed
3184456 because im not sure that tells you more about me or your mama
3184457 man i thought we werent gonna talk about my mama
3184458 come on if were going to have the forbidden butt sex i want my mother left 100 out of it
3184459 now what do you think the chances are that the so called beautiful snuck into my boudoir and poked holes in all my condoms with his comb
3184460 however because beautifuls so homophobic that he cant touch himself cuz hes afraid of being turned on by a penis he didnt realize you might have relations with another man and told me all about it
3184461 how could you do that to mom and aunt ezri
3184462 but consider this you have twenty five years of letters between two people who loved each other wholly but who put their responsibilities and feelings for others before that you had your father i didnt all i had were those letters
3184463 was a professional answer to lascivious overtures commodore young turner had no idea what to answer when i thus propositioned him
3184464 you couldnt have been serious as if the whelp had the least idea of how to handle it hed turn tail and have elizabeth deliver a blistering tirade on the vice of sodomy
3184465 quite probably but with that mouth how could i resist the question
3184466 and ive always heard tell of the fabled skills of the royal navy
3184467 a good naval officer makes certain his skills arent fable
3184468 it wouldnt occur to him that its something men like us do
3184469 if they had i imagine bevier would still be on his knees somewhere praying for our souls and his
3184470 some things you dont share with your friends until theyre ready to know it
3184471 though i admit this sharing has solved the problem of how cold it gets in the tent at nights
3184472 youre learning the value of practicality very quickly there may be some use for you yet
3184473 youre a boy mr vaughn a boy reaching for the moon instead of appreciating what you have
3184474 and you take it upon yourself ahhh to appreciate for me
3184475 youre much more responsive than your ex wife she needed an adrenaline rush to get wet and each time it took a little more until she would have to contort herself to get off
3184476 next week if youre better i might let you come
3184477 but these men are demeaning what it means to be married
3184478 marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman
3184479 marriage wasnt even a sacrament until the 1400s and that was so the corrupt fucking catholic church could get more political control i mean even a hundred years ago marriage wasnt about love it was about getting a bunch of property and making deals sure its a new thing that gay people want to get married but new ideas arent always bad ones besides unless theyre making you into their gay wife what the fuck do you care dude its not like theyre going to stop being gay if they cant get married
3184480 maybe it means the government shouldnt be involved in marriage at all maybe if you want to hold the religious definition of marriage up we should respect the first amendment and give up all the tax benefits and legal rights of marriage besides what the fuck does gay marriage have to do with tar and feathering these guys violence is no way to give your side a good name
3184481 were really not talking about the religious side of marriage just the civil rights that are extended to married couples
3184482 from now on were going to focus on love in our own marriages and if gays want to settle down more power to them
3184483 why dont you two lovebirds get a room i bet theres a whole section of assachussetts waiting for you two to tie the knot
3184484 screw you cartman next time a rampaging homophobic mob wants to kick your ass im going to let them
3184485 what a retard you should have just let him die
3184486 an act given in love cant be wrong unless its received with a dark spirit
3184487 youll just have to make it through with everyone who loves her and you
3184488 once upon a time i had a lengthy discussion about the nature of hell
3184489 a fascinating discussion a fascinating companion whose name and significance i have quite forgotten what do you think of hell faith
3184490 in fact youre not nearly as far off as you believe faith
3184491 i suggested at first perhaps influenced by our mutual friends that hell is a punishment the realm of those who have not learned the basic lessons of living
3184492 for you its a reminder what have i just reminded you of faith
3184493 that is a reminder that youre a foul filthy thing if you were pure it wouldnt burn but instead you bring shame down on me and all you were
3184494 hell is not a punishment for as my companion and oh i wish i had not forgotten her name for i think it was a woman pointed out that is the nature of purgatory an education by pain which as she quibbled is quite inefficient instead of learning anything youre simply broken
3184495 i argued with my companion that she was perhaps taking an overly optimistic view of human nature
3184496 will ever break through their internal illusions that they of course are above and beyond the law
3184497 but no woman no matter how diabolical can truly be hell theres always some hint of weakness some taint of soft motherly need that ruins the deal
3184498 we decided i think after enough discussion that hell is torture that true hell is mindless endless pain delivered by an uncaring universe because there can be neither hope nor even an end to all things
3184499 perhaps the senior partners control a distilled version of that we postulated but the essence of hell is eternal agony
3184500 hell is torture unending unreasoning without regard for justice or even limit
3184501 do you think he knew that anyone knew this would happen
3184502 this is the eternal war without hope without anything our forgotten heroes they walked on sure their names would at least survive hector achilles arthur lancelot for a warrior glory is eternal so we have forgotten their names and their deeds i suspect i have forgotten so many names because it would be torture for them to know that all their battles are meaningless forgotten as if they werent fought at all
3184503 youll burn terribly but you wont die despite your cowardly wish for oblivion youll sleep in dreams of madness and awaken whole without pain and itll begin again with no end
3184504 ill continue to forget until all i remember that my righteous duty is to hideously mutilate and torture you
3184505 and i will enjoy my work until i remember and then i will go mad again and again you burn i burn the nature of hell
3184506 as you know i have often misunderstood human conventions and practices
3184507 certain feelings are unclear to me and sometimes the customs involved in certain human practices are incomprehensible
3184508 what kind of customs and practices give me an example
3184509 okay say there was someone who you were friends with except that your emotions were stronger for that friend than with your other friends
3184510 and you were not sure if this would be acceptable to your friend except that your emotions are so strong that sometimes there are dreams
3184511 well maybe you could ask that friend how they felt about you
3184512 maybe theyd say they felt the same way or maybe they would say that they hadnt thought about it that way yet
3184513 what if you said these things and the person said they didnt know how they felt and then you tried to convince them by kissing them
3184514 there was much tongue touching and then there was rubbing and touching in many places
3184515 and many pleasurable feelings but just when it seemed that there was mutual pleasure what if that person said we have to stop someone could see what does this mean
3184516 it means that someones going to get my fist in his face
3184517 i think the person likes you star when that happens except he might be afraid of what everyone will say but i promise star the titans will stand behind you both because were friends
3184518 raven will be most delighted to know that she may keep kissing me without fear of things getting weird as she worried thank you robin you are a true friend
3184519 no i will not fuck you spider but i will claim it is possible to torment your aching dick for eternity
3184520 take me fuck me show me how theyd do you
3184521 shes the lady of buckkeep and you share her bed
3184522 folks dont think any further than that lady patience is a widow whos lost the nearest thing to a son and its difficult times whos going to begrudge the comfort of sharing a bed in a castle this cold especially to women
3184523 but what of chivalry i would assume you both prefer men
3184524 if we were both younger i suppose youd assume right
3184525 but would it be wise for the lady of buckkeep to have a lover folks would say she was trying to replace chivalry and that shed doom herself to misery you might think about it yourself queen kettricken a bed can get cold fast
3184526 i get it from her i suppose lady patience was ever one to speak her mind which is troublesome enough in a great lady let alone a servant
3184527 i admit that i am unused to this custom and it seems unnatural to me but as you have said there can be no more scandal for the farseers this is a sacrifice you and lady patience have made for your people
3184528 dont you ever worry that selling your sex might cause you to view it in a way that you dont find fittin
3184529 if i were a prostitute in the style of old earth as mal would have you believe yes alienation would be a very real danger kaylee
3184530 however as a companion my connection to my clients is on a different level than viewing my sexuality as a product or service after all there must be mutual interest for the joining to happen largely i view my job as a cross between psychology and diplomacy with some elements of fellowship and spirituality mixed in
3184531 the client might think hes payin for sex but the companion turns that experience into learning new things fixing snarls opening minds and kind of teaching people that sort of thing like how people think a ships engineer just fixes broken engines but the real job is understanding serenity and keeping her in primo condition
3184532 i think your dear dr tam would have to be blind not to see
3184533 are you sure you still want to do the rest
3184534 after all simons different from the kinds of boys i know i want to have some idea of what that might be
3184535 but im doing this for you to know what sorts of things youll like not to teach you how to please simon
3184536 its simons job to impress me but whats the gorram use of having a fancy doctor if you dont know how to ask him
3184537 i just got good and fucked under the bleachers and i need to clean up
3184538 be a good girl and i might show you what it felt like
3184539 good girl bad girl that shit is all in their fucking heads
3184540 the other day they said you had some kind of a madonna complex probably just because you kissed her at the vmas
3184541 madonnas not a whore or she isnt now so i think its bullshit they say that who the fuck do they think they are
3184542 what was up with him having a chainsaw for a hand
3184543 really tough and funny and how cool was that when she told hoss to go away and he totally did and she doesnt even have superpowers thats the coolest part and when she was all im waiting to be impressed when you were talking to her
3184544 next youll be telling me that you want your own grim reaper
3184545 it would be kind of neat to have him do our chores
3184546 it would be cool to have a friend like mandy
3184547 oooh you like mandy you like mandy you like mandy
3184548 die richtungsentscheidung der europ ischen kommission dvb h als einheitlichen standard f r ganz europa zu unterst tzen wird das mobile fernsehen in einem weiteren entscheidenden schritt voranbringen
3184549 es lag auf der hand dass es in meinem n chsten film egal was es werden w rde blutig und d ster zugehen w rde h tte ich eine kom die gedreht h tte man mir vorgeworfen ich sei unsensibel
3184550 normal day let me be aware of the wonder that you are
3184551 an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
3184552 no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3184553 the movement needs to enter the public eye and not just be talking among ourselves
3184554 were tracking a similar drought pattern as we saw in 2003 and we urge everyone to be extremely cautious
3184555 we are getting into a warmer pattern following the heavy rain we got over the weekend the weather is going to stay on the hotter warmer side for the next couple of weeks which is about as far ahead as we can reasonably predict
3184556 when you look back at the weather from 2003 as a whole starting from january it looks very similar to what the whole weather for 2008 looks like however when you just look at the summer weather then you see differences in summer of 2003 between june and august the kelowna area received 23 6 millimetres of rain since june of this year kelowna has received 51 millimetres almost double the amount
3184557 i saw this flash on the water and before i could do anything i saw the hull of the other boat followed by this horrendous noise before i knew it i was under water with my boat upside down and on top of me
3184558 i basically said my goodbyes because i thought i was dead when i opened my eyes i could see my boat lights and swam to them and found an air pocket then i dove down and got through the obstructions boat tower and popped up i hung on to my boat and was 400 yards from shore so i started yelling for help and the other boat came back
3184559 one of the fellows in the other boat said he ducked and felt my boat go right over his head were all very lucky to be alive
3184560 judging by what the other driver told me he was running at a fairly high rate of speed and as far as im concerned there were no working lights on that boat
3184561 it doesnt matter how safe you think you are when its that dark at night and other boaters dont have running lights and going at an excess speed its impossible to see them until they are driving over you its really not a good idea to be boating at night on this lake even though you might be doing everything right theres always that other person you have to worry about
3184562 rcmp attempted to arrest a 22 year old kelowna woman for causing a disturbance by fighting this woman who appeared to be very intoxicated was previously asked to leave the area after she was observed impeding traffic on leon avenue by sitting on the roadway
3184563 during the arrest the woman continued to fight with the arresting officer even after being handcuffed while she was escorted to the awaiting transporting police vehicle she kicked the escorting police officer
3184564 this vehicle was stopped at the corner of mill street and water street officers advised the individual that he was under arrest for dangerous driving however he refused to cooperate when asked to exit the vehicle
3184565 at one point pepper spray was used in an attempt to subdue the subject however this did not appear to have any affect on him
3184566 there are half a dozen different locations where the pot growers are dumping equipment and soil and its not just regular potting soil its laced with chemicals and pesticides they dumpers have to use rubber gloves to handle it and then they leave the gloves behind
3184567 not only does this stuff look bad it is not a healthy thing for the wild animals in the area they can get injured by this stuff
3184568 in the fall or early spring during the deer hunting season people are leaving carcasses ive also seen cows dropped off just left to rot or when people have pets die they just drop them off
3184569 if they get into the stream system there are some people in this area who actually take their water supply from the creek they could get really sick even die
3184570 ive seen everything tossed in the woods from kitchen sinks to old refrigerators and sofas its very frustrating
3184571 tree branches are not litter animal parts and carcasses are not litter litter is things like plastic bags and garbage
3184572 the litter act was designed for people throwing things out car windows more than anything if someone drives down the road and tosses a mcdonalds burger wrapper out the window that falls under the litter act i dont think when they made this legislation that it would would deal with people dumping garbage in the woods
3184573 we have to have something to investigate just saying there is someone dumping garbage wont help us depending on whats on our plate on a particular day it may not be a high enough priority to investigate
3184574 we will charge an individual and have in the past if there is sufficient evidence such as a license plate then we have the individual clean it up take it to the dump and bring a receipt to show that they dropped it off after which instead of taking court action we go by the way of writing a ticket the maximum ticket fine is 100
3184575 the cost of cleaning up illegal dump sites on public land is about 17 000 each year
3184576 thats down substantially from where it was about 10 years ago when we had a full time crew working five days a week cleaning up sites now we have a contractor who is responsible for this and basically works one day a week
3184577 this will be an excellent addition to the services we offer our small business community
3184578 bizpal will allow our entrepreneurs a more streamlined and simplified start up process

3184585 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

3184588 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3184589 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3184590 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3184591 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3184592 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3184593 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3184594 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3184595 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3184596 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3184597 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

3184602 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3184603 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3184604 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3184605 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3184606 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3184607 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3184608 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3184609 who are open to doing something on the production side
3184610 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3184611 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3184612 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3184613 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3184614 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3184615 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3184616 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3184617 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3184618 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3184619 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3184620 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3184621 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3184622 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3184623 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3184624 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3184625 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3184626 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3184627 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3184628 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3184629 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3184630 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

3184638 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3184639 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3184640 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3184641 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3184642 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3184643 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3184644 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3184645 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3184646 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3184647 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3184648 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3184649 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3184650 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3184651 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3184652 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3184653 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3184654 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3184655 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3184656 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3184657 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3184658 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3184659 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3184660 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3184661 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3184662 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3184663 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3184664 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3184665 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3184666 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3184667 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3184668 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3184669 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3184670 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3184671 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3184672 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3184673 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3184674 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3184675 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3184676 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3184677 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3184678 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3184679 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3184680 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3184681 the suspect was shot with a taser and fell backwards hitting his head on the sidewalk the man was taken to hospital in critical condition but has since been upgraded to stable
3184682 are tasers risk free no they cause people to fall down
3184683 unfortunately our members are finding themselves in situations like this more and more often
3184684 if those officers deem that their safety and other peoples safety is being jeopardized an electronic control device is certainly a tool that members of the police service will deploy

3184686 someone smashed one of the alarm call points after a big night out we know exactly who it was and the guest has been charged 1500 for the call out fee and to fix the call point
3184687 it was a fairly big stuff up by the guest and when she was asked why she did it she said she had no idea and she was upset and disappointed with herself she left next day
3184688 we were about 75 per cent full so thats about 200 people and we aim to get everyone out in about three minutes
3184689 following an incident at the hotel two cabin crew members were stood down pending an investigation
3184690 heroes are people who rise to the occasion and slip quietly away
3184691 heroism feels and never reasons and therefore is always right
3184692 without heroes were all plain people and dont know how far we can go
3184693 i was told by crew members that damage to the helicopter was pretty severe it will stay where it is until the caa are happy and have finished their investigations into the cause of the crash
3184694 however we are very grateful and fortunate that we arent dealing with anything more serious than a broken leg
3184695 if you feel the urge dont be afraid to go on a wild goose chase what do you think wild geese are for anyway
3184696 leave all the afternoon for exercise and recreation which are as necessary as reading i will rather say more necessary because health is worth more than learning
3184697 if you watch a game its fun if you play at it its recreation if you work at it its golf
3184698 the bow cannot always stand bent nor can human frailty subsist without some lawful recreation
3184699 the liberties of our country the freedom of our civil constitution are worth defending at all hazards and it is our duty to defend them against all attacks we have received them as a fair inheritance from our worthy ancestors they purchased them for us with toil and danger and expense of treasure and blood and transmitted them to us with care and diligence it will bring an everlasting mark of infamy on the present generation enlightened as it is if we should suffer them to be wrested from us by violence without a struggle or to be cheated out of them by the artifices of false and designing men

3184774 it would be unfair to consumers with accounts at other firms as well as to the firms that settled if our investigation were to slow down or stop
3184775 this is the key question which has no answer as of now russia is keen on destroying georgias military capability and infrastructure the question is of course what can and what would the international community do
3184776 if the russians want regime change in tbilisi and judging by what their ambassador to the u n said recently that is a likely possibility they may go as far as they need to in order to get georgian president mikheil saakashvili deposed the international community has rhetorically been giving the russian lots of heat but there is practically very little the west can do as evidenced by the fact that the russians chose to invade on the same night as putin and bush were photographed sitting together at the opening games of the olympics in beijing economic and geopolitical realities make russia too important for the west to intervene
3184777 russia looks like it will continue until it achieves its end goal which is depending on whom you ask either gaining control of the conflict zones or destabilizing the country completely the thing is russia is good at muddying the waters by throwing the language of the west back at the west as of today putin is claiming that georgians committed genocide against the ossetians as badly as the georgians may have acted this was not a literal definition of genocide but this way russia can point to the nato bombings in belgrade over their treatment of kosovo as a precedent for russias actions now and the international community realizes that it would sadly be nuts to get directly involved i think the most well see is what we have now which are harsh words from bush to russia and a variety of international diplomats trying to broker a ceasefire
3184778 georgia is not a nato member if it were article 5 of the nato treaty would have automatically brought the rest of the alliance in more or less along the lines how it happened when another alliance was attacked in august 1914 very quickly and according to agreements forged archduke franz ferdinand assassinated in sarajevo austria hungary attacks serbia russia supports serbia germany supports russia france supports russia it is a crucial foreign policy question how does the west deal with russia now a mistake would be to treat it as the former soviet union no summer break for folks in dc or brussels thats for sure
3184779 no georgia is not yet a nato country and that is the partial reason for the timing putin is banking that instability in georgia will lead nato not to accept georgia as a member state in the near future though the u s has been training the georgian army and the georgians have more troops in iraq than anyone aside from the u s and britain they are not part of nato and it is doubtful nato will send troops there
3184780 georgia is not a nato country in fact this april georgia was denied a membership action plan the next phase towards full nato along with ukraine so nato is under no obligation to send troops
3184781 the russians would most likely be fine with a strengthened status quo in abkhazia and south ossetia strengthening those places
3184782 its hard to say if the tanks continue to roll into georgia proper throughout the week and if they end up in tbilisi the goal will almost certainly be regime change they will not want to annex georgia but will want to set up a pro russian government that will not want to join nato and will cooperate with the russians rather than the west on oil production and export mechanisms in the caspian sea again this is likely to happen because there is no one to stop the russians and as of this morning they have refused to agree to a georgian requested cease fire
3184783 see above but briefly they want georgia back in their sphere of influence
3184784 nothing besides the us helping georgia to airlift its 2 000 troops from iraq to georgia
3184785 both the west and the u n are condemning russias actions but practically there is not much we can do the europeans are too dependent on russian natural gas and the united states is too dependent on them on the issue of iranian proliferation also our military is obviously otherwise engaged at the moment and no one is looking to start word war iii with the russians
3184786 this is the crucial question of what the west can do and how whether one wants it or not russia is using the kosovo example to legitimize its actions there is even talk in moscow on establishing an international crimes tribunal against georgia
3184787 obviously this is the kind of russian muscle flexing not seen since the end of the cold war the fact that the united states cannot really come to the aid of a democratic ally like georgia which even went so far as to send troops to iraq to help us says quite a bit about our capabilities at the moment both militarily and diplomatically the russian market dropped significantly after the invasion of south ossetia and it remains to be seen whether economic considerations may have more of an effect on russian behavior than military or diplomatic threats from a practical standpoint it is possible that the u s will use its displeasure with russia on this issue to persuade it to play ball more closely with the west on the issue of iranian nuclear proliferation which means that we will have essentially sacrificed our ally georgia in exchange for closer cooperation on iran a more pressing issue for us these days
3184788 the georgians have been very aggressive about personally reassuring western investors since this crisis began but it is difficult to invest in a regime that may no longer exist after this crisis is over if you are going to invest in russia make sure you have your good friend vladimir putin on speed dial lest he decide to one day nationalize your company and seize your assets
3184789 i dont think it will affect investments in russia too badly businesspeople i know working in russia expect the country to be a loose cannon politically and a relatively solid and dependable presence economically i think russia has shown that to be increasingly the case for the duration of putins tenure for georgia things will be much worse georgia which is a gorgeous country had built up its economy largely based on real estate and other forms of fdi foreign direct investment since it doesnt have the natural resources of many of its neighbors it had worked extra hard to reform its business sector rout out corruption overhaul the tax system and otherwise show what a safe and lawful place the country was for business but even the most risk taking investors will probably think twice before buying real estate in georgia now
3184790 none have either oil or gaz abkhazia is important for transport reasons there are no other ethnic groups in georgia striving for independence but there are significant half a million each communities of armenians and azeris in georgia a consistent democratic minority policy is yet to be developed in georgia
3184791 they are both big deals abkhazia is the bigger region and fighting has already spread there the real issue is the pretext they both serve for the re establishment of russian hegemony in the former soviet republics
3184792 abkhazia has always been the bigger deal because it is geographically more distinct from georgia than is south ossetia has access to the sea and can more or less survive economically on its own neither place has oil or gas as far as i have ever heard and there are lots of other ethnic groups in georgia but they are well integrated into the country the thing about abkhazia and south ossetia is that the conflicts have now become primarily about ethnicity but there were many georgians and children of mixed parents living in regions before really they are independence movement that have became conflated with ethnicity
3184793 well bush did famously look into putins eyes and saw his soul so at the very least lets accuse him of being a not so great judge of character and judging by the soul comment probably not too good with the pick up lines at the bar in his single days
3184794 saakashvili was torn away by bodyguards and pushed to the ground they piled extra flak jackets on top of him fearing an air raid onlookers fled looking skyward and screaming no jets were seen or heard

3184899 under missouri law we are entitled to a recount if the vote total is less that 1 even though the state pays the cost of the official recount we would still have some expenses if the recount proceeds we are weighing the costs and practical considerations before deciding the next step to take the recount cannot begin until the vote totals are certified approximately 2 weeks after the election

3184906 rockefeller and his blue eyed daughter reigh storrow boss had gripped the us publics imagination

3184909 walter is a player with tremendous work ethic and showed last year that he is a player that can contribute to this team
3184910 hes a good pitcher but hes my best shortstop i dont pitch him much but i told him to come out here and be ready to go
3184911 im not usually a pitcher so i wasnt really confident coming into this game
3184912 but my curveball was working and i was throwing everything for strikes
3184913 this was my first year in the rbi program and it felt real good to come here and help my team out
3184914 they showed great energy and character out there they got to the championship game which was the goal so thats fantastic
3184915 im not going to lie it feels great to be able to come out here and win it three years in a row
3184916 he is a player with tremendous work ethic and showed last year that he is a player that can contribute
3184917 i was totally flabbergasted by that article totally caught off guard
3184918 i want you to quote every word i say not part of it but everything i say
3184919 when we made the trade for gary sheffield we received permission from the commissioners office to speak with him before the deal which i did i told him that all i had here for him was the dh role and maybe to play in the outfield once in a great while
3184920 if he did not want to accept that do not accept the trade im still confused by the article because it talks about being platooned doesnt set well with him
3184921 gary sheffield hasnt been platooned here platooning is when you have a left handed hitter and a right handed hitter one plays against a right handed pitcher the other plays against a left handed pitcher that is a platoon to make it perfectly clear
3184922 thats platooning to me if im not playing every day im platooning if youre an everyday player you play 59 out of 59 unless you cant play call it what you want i call it what i want
3184923 he might think its different we might disagree on that its not a big deal its a matter of thats the way i see it
3184924 in my mind im not going to accept thats what i am
3184925 but if thats my position thats fine i didnt want to be put down as dh and i made that clear when i signed here but thats what happened thats my role i dont have to like it i just have to accept it
3184926 im capable of playing the outfield thats just how good i feel if i feel good i have a right to say it if i dont i have a right to say i dont i dont like it but i understand it thats all i said
3184927 whoever takes offense to it thats their problem i havent said anything all year and im not going to start now if they want to take that as a negative thing then go right ahead i really dont care anyways
3184928 like i said im shocked because this caught me totally off guard before injuries put him on the disabled list he played in 39 of 51 games but in seven other games he couldnt go to the post because his shoulder was clicking
3184929 after being on the dl hes played in 36 of 43 games to me thats the farthest thing from a platoon ive ever heard of in my life so im totally flabbergasted by it anybody with a brain knows thats not a platoon
3184930 i also read that he wants to play in the outfield i tried to play him in the outfield it didnt work he couldnt throw the ball in i have medical people telling me its suicidal to play him in the outfield right now hed probably get hurt again
3184931 i just dont get the drift of this im not upset one bit but if you want to lead you dont do that by voice you lead by example
3184932 thats how you lead im not talking about gary sheffield im talking about anybody you dont lead by yelling you lead by example
3184933 you lead by playing hard by showing other people how you play the game bust your butt thats how you lead the kind of leadership sheffield shows is by knocking in runs and pounding the ball thats the kind of leader hes been thats the kind of leader i want
3184934 this is my side of the story ive never considered gary sheffield a platoon player in my life hes never been a platoon player since hes been here and he was made aware of the fact that when he accepted the trade to come here he was going to be the dh
3184935 i dont understand why that all of a sudden is a big point
3184936 hes not going to be an outfielder here hes going to be the dh i tried the outfield thing with him i think i tried every way i could to try to get him going because we need him
3184937 ive always been an admirer of garys because he speaks what he feels i think hes admired me for the same reason nobodys been in his corner more than me
3184938 feel like a caged tiger what the heck are you talking about when hes been healthy hes produced i feel bad that hes had these injuries those arent his fault but theyre not jim leylands fault either i cant help it hes had injuries
3184939 i applaud him for trying to fight through some real serious operations to his credit a lot of people wouldnt be playing hes as tough as they come but to me being the dh is yesterdays breakfast
3184940 russia must reverse the course it appears to be on
3184941 if these reports are accurate these actions would be inconsistent with the assurances we received from russia that its objectives were limited to restoring the status quo in georgian breakaway region south ossetia that existed before the fighting began on august 6
3184942 these actions jeopardize russians relations with the united states and europe
3184943 there are no discussions about the u s getting involved militarily
3184944 you know it goes to show you that god is universal
3184945 to pass a strong resolution getting the russians to show some restraint
3184946 is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint
3184947 to immediately and unconditionally withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
3184948 placing first and primary emphasis on dollars rather than human values
3184949 liberal pushing for tax increases and higher education improvements advancing civil liberties and human rights setting aside thousands of acres for wilderness protections and embracing the very concept of government
3184950 progress and they interpreted it as expanding prosperity and realizing human potential for all minnesotans not just protecting the property rights and incomes of the ownership class
3184951 good government principles of accountability and efficiency and for modernization
3184952 living within its means and was enormously popular with business leaders
3184953 price of government under carlson and tax rankings that put minnesota near the top five states minnesotas economy outperformed the nations during the 90s and dramatically overachieved compared with low tax midwestern states
3184954 no new taxes religion took hold and a government slashing and rebate mentality prevailed minnesotas total revenues as a percentage of personal income are at their lowest level in decades and interestingly the states economy is underperforming the nations for the first time in decades
3184955 i have often defended government against uninformed claims that it is wasteful or that its work is insignificant
3184956 leads you to believe you can do whatever you want youre invincible and therell be no consequences
3184957 when you look into a mirror do you like whats looking at you now that youve seen your true reflections what on earth are you gonna do
3184958 yeah i didnt think anyone would ever know about it i didnt
3184959 ive come to the personal conclusion that i actually want the country to see who i am who i really am but i dont know what the result of that will be but for me personally id rather be successful or unsuccessful based on who i really am not based on some plastic ken doll that you put up in front of audiences

3184999 most crops in asias major wheat growing areas are vulnerable to ug99 so if it gets to these areas food shortages and famine could result
3185000 ug99 could also pose a bio security threat to australia
3185001 the challenge is to now identify and deploy more multiple resistance gene combinations that protect wheat against ug99 or find other ways to protect wheat from this fungus
3185002 we expect the markets for worley parsons services will remain strong
3185003 our key markets and sectors continue to experience positive conditions and we are well positioned to respond to these opportunities
3185004 subject to conditions remaining favourable we expect to achieve increased earnings in 2009
3185005 positive trading conditions across the group continue and demand for our services remains high
3185006 this is especially so in the context of the strong appreciation of the australian dollar in the year
3185007 there has been a significant increase in interest in renewable energy including solar wind biomass and hydroelectric on a global basis
3185008 we expect continued strong demand for renewable energy gas turbine projects nuclear services and front end engineering for clean coal projects
3185009 the full extent of the current economic conditions on project development in the sector in 2009 is unknown but a significant number of projects have been awarded and worleyparsons growing geographic footprint and capability in the new resource regions should provide continued growth opportunities

3185011 global credit markets continue to negatively impact access and pricing of wholesale funds for australian and overseas banks and it is possible that the situation may worsen in the short term

3185014 in singapore we held our leadership position and in the mobile market we continued to gain market share even with the implementation of full mobile number portability
3185015 as we report in singapore us dollars the financial results of our regional associates are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in this quarter the impact was negative

3185018 he loves to compete and he is having a lot of fun this year
3185019 its not fun when you dont know what youre doing
3185020 he knew the defenses because he studied his butt off but he didnt know the pass routes obviously he was behind because it was all new to him you expect that to happen it took two years for a d to learn those things
3185021 last year at this time i was just trying to get comfortable
3185022 i was starting for the first time replacing a d this year is different i want to produce but i also want to make plays
3185023 when we need a play i want to be one of those people they look to to make plays
3185024 when you play on a defense like ours with a ed reed there are certain expectations and you have to play up to those expectations
3185025 we have a great front seven and our defensive line dominates
3185026 without them our linebacking corps wouldnt be as good they allow us to be patient sit back and make good reads overall if we stay healthy i think rex wants us to be more aggressive than a year ago
3185027 we have this unwritten rule on defense that if you see someone throw a punch at one of us were going to pin our ears back and come at you
3185028 todd has a lot of guts and he is a lot scrappier than a lot of people think i felt bad for him messing with haloti but thats our style we always want to be aggressive
3185029 last summer we spent in excess of 125 000 in utility costs
3185030 when you close all your buildings down you have a huge cut in energy
3185031 our employees wanted to give it a shot especially with the price of gas the way it is they saw it as a way to make on less trip into work a week
3185032 the guys really enjoyed it and we got the same amount or more work done
3185033 a lot of guys are really satisfied with the three day weekend and we are not seeing them take off a lot of time
3185034 its easy for a days work to get filled up in that ten hours and all you did was lose that days work so it does take some discipline
3185035 ive often thought it would be so nice if they could just drive to our back door ring the buzzer and have us bring out the meal they just have to sign for it as they always do and be on their way

3185040 the online marketing challenge offers a great opportunity for students to develop their skills and experience in online marketing local businesses also benefit as the adwords campaigns have helped promote their business to a wider community i feel absolutely thrilled that one of my student teams is the global winner
3185041 well that guy had stinky breath he had to go
3185042 more efficiently and avoid misusing it to regulate global climate change
3185043 it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impact affecting species
3185044 these changes take unbiased professional wildlife biologists out of the equation and put decisions in the hands of political appointees
3185045 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the grey whale
3185046 contributed to the circumstances that gave rise to the injury
3185047 the evidence that we have shows that your excessive consumption of alcohol was a contributing factor in the incident
3185048 when i read the cica letter i just had no words i could not take it in it felt like i was being punished for having the audacity to step up and say i dont think this should have happened to me it was like going back to the 70s saying she was asking for it how else could you read the letter but as saying its my fault i was raped
3185049 its appalling the number of women that are probably getting this letter and arent fighting because they dont know that they can
3185050 cica makes decisions on conduct issues in good faith based on the facts available to them in each individual case and any applicants unhappy with the decision in their claim can ask for a review by a more senior member of staff
3185051 although i cannot comment on the individual decisions of the criminal injuries compensation authority i can be clear that it is not our policy to reduce the level of award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption
3185052 this stance supports our view that a victim of rape is not in any way culpable due to alcohol consumption it is never an individuals fault if he she gets raped regardless of how much he she has drunk
3185053 zanu pf is not talking about conceding any real power they are talking about giving up positions in cabinet but they want to remain in control these guys arent serious
3185054 the differences revolve around who will have power theyre not giving up anything on that they entered these negotiations solely to give up cosmetic issues
3185055 there is a lot of pressure on tsvangirai people in the party are telling him that he cannot agree to a deal that does not recognise the peoples will and democracy mugabe should not be allowed to keep power just because he terrorised the population into voting for him
3185056 the pressure for us is coming from the people they dont want to see some kind of half hearted change if we were to do that we would lose credibility if morgan takes something cosmetic from zanu pf he will lose the support of the zimbabwean people
3185057 we support the governments urgency in moving swiftly on this
3185058 in the original selection process the airforce took nearly 10 months and botched the job to do what it now plans to do in three
3185059 after the glasgow east byelection no one can doubt that labour is in a deep hole
3185060 this is much more serious than mid term blues which may be expected to evaporate as the general election approaches
3185061 first is the frantic search for some magic populist policy solution there is no single get out of jail card and it is foolish to believe that such simplistic solutions will do the trick indeed some are counter productive inviting the publics contempt by implying a desperation to buy support by ditching unpopular taxes or offering dubious incentives
3185062 dangling the carrot of home ownership in front of low income council tenants in current market conditions for example is a deeply suspect proposition
3185063 just as dubious is the siren call for more initiatives one of the greatest mistakes in government is to confuse activity with outcomes just because ministers feel busy devising 101 new ways of tackling a problem does not guarantee the problem gets solved
3185064 by 1995 the position had changed the electorate had decisively shifted their loyalty to tony blairs government in waiting and nothing could save john major we are not yet in that position today david cameron has still not secured the unequivocal support of the electorate
3185065 my wife and i have travelled to reside in england
3185066 if i still have luck i would come back to die on thai soil like every other thai person what happened to my family is like fruit from a poisonous tree the fruit will also be poisoned
3185067 there is a continuation of dictatorship managing thai politics which is followed by interference in the justice system these are my political enemies they do not care about the rule of law facts or internationally recognised due process
3185068 clearly thaksin is very angry by the way things have turned out he is obviously extremely emotional theres a fighting tone hes not given up completely
3185069 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3185070 the russian government must reverse the course that it appears to be on
3185071 the georgian army is retreating to defend the capital the government is urgently seeking international intervention to prevent the fall of georgia and further loss of life
3185072 today the statehood of georgia is in great danger and thereby leaving existing world order in uncertainty
3185073 russia seems intent on overthrowing the democratically elected government of georgia and occupying the country
3185074 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several us diplomats it is a real shame
3185075 russian aggression must not go unanswered and its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3185076 people are in panic this road where the troops are is about 2km from the centre
3185077 this is an occupation half of georgia is under russian control our aim now is to build up our troops and to create a defensive line in front of tbilisi
3185078 brought countless programmes to the screen which themselves became legends
3185079 the more he spoke to me about it the more i realised he had a wonderful idea for a light entertainment show
3185080 he wanted me to do it and it changed my life
3185081 he had a nose for a hit he was a wonderful showman and a great believer in his producers and he backed us to the hilt
3185082 he had a pop at me before the last dive when we were sitting down
3185083 i saw my mum in the audience and i asked her to give me a call and tom went to me why are you on the phone were still in the competition and weve got another dive to do thats just thomas hes over nervous and thats how it was today thomas should not be worrying about what im doing but today he was worrying about everyone and everything and that to me is really the sole reason why he didnt perform today
3185084 when tom hears about this i dont suppose hell want to dive with him again
3185085 if you cant take it on the chin you shouldnt be there perhaps blakes got sour grapes its easy to blame a 14 year old but its not exactly team spirit
3185086 its a synchro team theres two of us and thats the hard thing about it
3185087 both of you have to be on your game at the same time and that just didnt happen today
3185088 thomas is 14 years old hes done phenomenally and for me to be a part of a partnership with him is a great thing i knew that we were capable of a medal but i also knew that it depended on how tom performed i wasnt on the top of my game but i out dived thomas today and thats not something that normally happens he was very nervous more so than ever before i think he really struggled to get through the competition and as his partner it was hard for me to get up there and try and ease him into it unfortunately for me it didnt work today
3185089 hes a great kid hes like a little brother to me
3185090 i was quite disappointed but it was a great experience and i really enjoyed myself i had so much fun out there we just had a bad day i tried to not make it feel different but there was lots of pressure on me and i was very nervous
3185091 it was there for the taking but it wasnt my day today now im looking at 2012 like ive always said
3185092 and i hope he takes a lot of experience from this and that it stands him in good stead unfortunately i dont have another chance
3185093 any person who enters the residential real property of an academic researcher for the purpose of chilling or interfering with the researchers academic freedom is guilty of trespass a misdemeanor
3185094 our building inspections department is not seeing as much request for their services coming in
3185095 obviously in the planning and zoning department theres not as much request for their services
3185096 weve looked both internally and weve looked within the other public sectors here in the county
3185097 weve got a few outside places where were combining our efforts with them just to make sure were giving folks adequate opportunity
3185098 were trying our best to avoid some type of large layoff or at the last minute next years budget time to say were going to have to lay off x amount of employees or cut so many dollars
3185099 the crowd did not relent and in order to disperse the unruly and violent mob the police was forced to open fire
3185100 the people of kashmir are not going to sit still at the death of a leader
3185101 i saw a toyota corolla car stopped on the side of road
3185102 then seconds later three military vehicles of foreign troops were about to pass the small car when a strong explosion with dark smoke blackened the area
3185103 i think durham has probably been a backrunner behind raleigh ever since raleigh durham existed but durham has come a long way
3185104 i intend on spending the next many weeks quite frankly doing a lot of listening and asking a lot of questions
3185105 im doing every thing i can to learn about this community learn whats working well learn what needs to work better
3185106 i firmly believe that neighborhoods strong neighborhoods in particular are building blocks of successful cities so were going to take a hard look at what neighborhood programs we have in place and what we can do to create some stronger neighborhoods
3185107 i did a five album deal and i dont think it would be right to be making streets albums after that
3185108 i always envisaged them as a box set and ive got a vision for each of the albums
3185109 the next one will bring it back to the start in a way
3185110 it will be a lot more futuristic in terms of production but a lot more train of thought
3185111 maybe when im 40 and broke i might come back but that all feels a bit pants
3185112 it was really hard to stop referencing modern technology i was even having conversations with my people at the darkest hour going can we not just write a song about mobile phones
3185113 i probably threw away more music than is on the album now
3185114 but the album is a product of all the stuff i threw away it was important to the album
3185115 i still intend on running but i sure enjoy my position with ocean view
3185116 maybe its because of the enormous penis that i have but i find no need to prove my masculinity
3185117 outdoor skills like making fire with two sticks arent easy
3185118 the choice is made more for content than language macin said
3185119 theyll see us coming in and have a press conference in english then say well take care of you when were done
3185120 but smart people does end smartly on a subtly lovely up note
3185121 this life is but a doomed journey of misery and loneliness punctuated by moments of suffering and ending in total annihilation
3185122 you know whatd be great for a guy like me just to be in a coma no phone calls coming in nobody dropping by unexpectedly
3185123 the bill of temporary privileges and every year the list gets shorter and shorter and shorter
3185124 we have lost not only an incredible talent but a wonderful leader to his community and a dear friend
3185125 honestly the involuntary patients require a lot more resources many times we need to have a lot more staff we need to have one staff member to one patient
3185126 if you go someplace far away where there is no support nearby and people cant come visit you easily
3185127 it limits the amount of facilities we have available to go to
3185128 our preference would be to have more were optimistic that the impact will be minimal
3185129 the study has a very pro exercise message if you had to pick one thing to make people healthier as they age it would be aerobic exercise
3185130 the health benefits of exercise are greater than we thought
3185131 this research re confirms the clear benefits of regular exercise for older people
3185132 exercise can help older people to stay mobile and independent ensure a healthy heart keep weight and stress levels under control and promote better sleep
3185133 ive been pregnant three times by way of bloggers ive never been pregnant in my life
3185134 and anything that happens in my personal life is personal i never actually put anything out there nobodys really known who ive dated
3185135 im not in a relationship right now but im 22 im dating people
3185136 i got my piercings before i got my results like positive energy i think its sexy im proud of them
3185137 im sitting there with my parents my moms sobbing after she finds out that i dont have the gene and im like guess what mom and dad i got my nipples pierced
3185138 it was nerve racking because i was like my moms going to kill me if i have this gene and i got these things
3185139 the name menomena comes from an italian soft porn movie but its also greek for what remains so there are a few different layers behind it
3185140 i get a little disappointed when journalists spoil the surprise a fun thing about the band is we want people to hear us and then a year later see the muppets on tv and realize how we got our name the muppets stole the name from porn and were stealing it back
3185141 theres always a negotiation between what people are eager to hear and the music musicians are eager to make and how those two get connected
3185142 that means theres now a strange homogenization and complication when it comes to music theres no clear channel that controls how music is distributed mainstream radio does try they have complicated algorithms that determine an average grade and a threshold percentage chance of a song being a radio hit there are pressures from when people listen to music in short increments that forces music to be dumbed down
3185143 most people are looking for music that is a kind of language with new ways of communicating new words and phrases and rhythms
3185144 bands like animal collective and califone are pushing and tugging on the perceived notions of what makes a song a song then there are bands like arcade fire who can somehow push deep into our music sensibility with something that resonates and is increasingly enjoyable on subsequent listens weve all heard music that we liked at first and then it becomes stale and we feel cheated like the music is a fraud the lyrics are pointless there is no redeeming value or maybe they dont even write their own songs the music i am most enamored with maintains an innocence despite the talents of the musician
3185145 no one else is going to do it for you you have to make your own context the best artists the music i love is always done by people who are totally committed to the craft of music not just getting attention they are very inventive in the process they use and the technology they use i like how the guy in tool makes his own guitar pedals or that tori amos uses these unique pianos and harpsichords in recording sound garden for a majority of their songs use alternate tunings they experimented with new sounds and new ways of making sounds
3185146 we have for the most part avoided the neurotic curse of measuring how this microphone sounds in a certain cabinet or which way it is pointing exactly or that we just cant record unless we get this new piece of gear some people get hung up on the idea that they cant record the great american record unless they have this 10 000 microphone or a certain pre amp theres an entire industry that makes a living convincing people that they dont have the gear they need but once you get a basic recording setup it is not that complicated we recorded a majority of our first record using the same microphone and borrowed a couple of others for other recordings
3185147 weve seen a sharp decline not only in attacks but in foreign fighters traversing the western nineveh deserts
3185148 the iraqi police and army are becoming more capable and the extremists are being pushed into the rural areas because of this
3185149 the future of the web may be its past an abandonment of open standards and services and a return to the gated communities
3185150 abandon their ability to kill any apps at any time for any reason
3185151 create and run powerful business applications in the cloud and that will change the economics of the software industry forever
3185152 retaining the right just in case they need it to kill any app they dont like and to control the flow of data
3185153 in this new environment the developers are at the mercy of the platform owners and while its not the end of the world i think this is a riskier environment to run a business
3185154 while the shift to the cloud is ongoing and will continue to move forward the relational logistics between businesses and platform owners still need to be worked through
3185155 thats pathetic for me to be missing tackles i dont give a dang if ive been out of football for two or three years a tackle is a tackle but ill get it together
3185156 i aint trying to say this but the first preseason game i always play like manure
3185157 we are starting to roll out a fix now and hope to have the problem resolved as quickly as possible
3185158 if we are training additional teachers and local authorities say they dont have enough money to employ them class sizes will not be reduced some local authorities have already admitted their class sizes wont be falling any time soon
3185159 the issue is probably going to drag on for a few weeks yet and it seems to be a lot worse than it has been for some time
3185160 there have been more teachers getting trained to bring down class sizes and to fill the posts of people who have retired but obviously somethings gone wrong somewhere
3185161 someone has got their sums wrong or there is posturing between the scottish government and councils
3185162 it does seem to be considerably worse than in previous years
3185163 it will be interesting to see what the national picture is when everyone goes back to school next week
3185164 it makes absolutely no sense to spend a considerable amount of time and money to train teachers if they cannot find posts
3185165 we support the governments urgency in moving swiftly on this
3185166 in the original selection process the airforce took nearly 10 months and botched the job to do what it now plans to do in three
3185167 now hes doing it full time and has an assistant
3185168 our attorneys are also involved on almost a daily basis as am i
3185169 what do you call 1000 black senators buried in sand to their shoulders
3185170 you gamey old motherfucker if you or anyone in your campaign ever dis my wife again i will pound that ugly black mole to the other side of your face
3185171 and when mccain finally regained consciousness and tried to speak dr
3185172 none of us know the answer and we have to find out
3185173 if somebody has gunshot wounds i think they need to be seen
3185174 im not sure i think theyve got their own reasons why they need to talk about things i just do my job and be quiet
3185175 to be honest thats the first time i ever heard that from either of those guys but any time anybody says something about guys on this team you take offense to it
3185176 bobby wade came here and developed got better and if he hadnt developed and gotten better the titans wouldnt have wanted him minnesota wouldnt have wanted him justin gage the same way if he hadnt have come here and gotten better he wouldnt have gone to tennessee and gotten 15 million or 16 million bernard berrian if he hadnt developed wouldnt have got 42 million with minnesota
3185177 i think one of the things that happened was the emergence of bernard he had to share some things there his role probably changed from what he was accustomed to
3185178 but we know we need to make a decision so we can start getting the timing and everything else going
3185179 video advertising network yume is bringing in a canadian to run the place
3185180 the second amendment conferred an individual right to keep and bear arms
3185181 nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms
3185182 we identify these presumptively lawful regulatory measures only as examples our list does not purport to be exhaustive

3185192 after the glasgow east byelection no one can doubt that labour is in a deep hole
3185193 this is much more serious than mid term blues which may be expected to evaporate as the general election approaches
3185194 first is the frantic search for some magic populist policy solution there is no single get out of jail card and it is foolish to believe that such simplistic solutions will do the trick indeed some are counter productive inviting the publics contempt by implying a desperation to buy support by ditching unpopular taxes or offering dubious incentives
3185195 dangling the carrot of home ownership in front of low income council tenants in current market conditions for example is a deeply suspect proposition
3185196 just as dubious is the siren call for more initiatives one of the greatest mistakes in government is to confuse activity with outcomes just because ministers feel busy devising 101 new ways of tackling a problem does not guarantee the problem gets solved
3185197 by 1995 the position had changed the electorate had decisively shifted their loyalty to tony blairs government in waiting and nothing could save john major we are not yet in that position today david cameron has still not secured the unequivocal support of the electorate
3185198 vemos con enorme preocupaci n que la criminalidad aumenta y sus redes se organizan y fortalecen en muchos de los casos en abierta complicidad con las autoridades policiacas en los tres niveles de gobierno

3185211 she was gripping onto the fence and she closed her eyes and leaned back and she was ready to let go thats when i grabbed hold of her fingertips
3185212 i came out hand over hand using the top of the fence and on the cement rung here and came out over the freeway and we grabbed her arm
3185213 i started to lose a little bit of grip because her feet were dangling
3185214 she was slipping out of our grip and it was a pretty hopeless feeling to be there and not being able to save her
3185215 and they go behind her and grabbed her just as her hands and fingers were starting to slip from my grip
3185216 ive seen some with worse outcomes so i was glad that this one came out good
3185217 the use of the r word perpetuates the dehumanizing and negative stereotypes of people with intellectual disabilities

3185234 ghost recon begins in august 2008 with civil unrest in russia ultra nationalists have seized power in russia with plans to rebuild the government their first step is clandestine support of rebel factions in georgia and the baltic states this is where the ghosts come in to silence the invasion armed with some of the most advanced weaponry in the world the soldiers of the ghost recon force are covertly inserted into area of operations and given specific missions to curtail the rebel actions and overthrow their benefactors
3185235 bush understands that its not really about georgia but in a certain sense its also an aggression against america the russians want the whole of georgia the russians need control over energy routes from central asia and the caspian sea in addition they want to get rid of us they want regime change every democratic movement in this neighbouring region must be got rid of
3185236 this underscores the limits of western influence over russia at a time when the rest of europe depends heavily on russia for natural gas and the united states needs moscows cooperation if it hopes to curtail what it believes is a nuclear weapons threat from iran
3185237 stop stop you bully or ill set my mate on you
3185238 i was impressed simply by the fact he was a quick study
3185239 he was able to step out there and step in the huddle spew the verbiage out get people lined up and actually get the ball around
3185240 any time you put on shoulder pads and helmets for the first day its always tough
3185241 i havent had a chance to put this stuff on since november when i got hurt so its good to be out here and good to be part of an organization like this
3185242 hes a very smart quarterback and hes got a strong arm
3185243 he understands we have an established starter here and hes just happy to do what we ask him to do
3185244 its going to be a little work but when its time ill be ready to go
3185245 he tweaked it a little bit in the game did something
3185246 i suppose theres a chance but we havent even talked about it yet
3185247 now look it if you ask matt hell give you the history of his back since he was 11
3185248 bobby is a very important part of what we do offensively
3185249 the young ins have to step up and play weve said that already and now they just have to do it for a while
3185250 no way did he think he was going to be in this position six months ago and now here you are
3185251 who knows he might be the starting centre on opening day
3185252 now even if i wanted to go a different way you cant mess around because we will have two receivers who are going to be on the roster who will not be playing

3185256 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3185257 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3185258 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3185259 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3185260 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3185261 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3185262 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3185263 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3185264 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century

3185273 hed been in contact before with the enemy so he knows what to expect
3185274 he knows how to get through it and that sort of experience is very valuable for young ncos
3185275 unfortunately he seemed to scare more kids than he cheered up but hes a great guy hes got a real sense of humour
3185276 remembered with the utmost gratitude and respect of this nation
3185277 he was an exceptional canadian and courageous soldier who died while bravely serving his country
3185278 their normal contact drill is that as soon as they get hit with something then its 360 open up on anything that moves
3185279 we want to make people aware of the need to preserve the old films
3185280 gradually people are going to realize that these films are that important when the classical scholars look back on the 20th century 1 000 years from now what are they going to find valuable

3185287 unless there are guarantees or some seller ratings like the ones ebay has accumulated over time there will always be some bad experiences
3185288 they lost focus all their money comes from sellers buyers are what drive the market but you need quality and protection for the sellers or else they dont even want to deal with the buyers

3185349 we are so proud of terry and are going to miss him terribly he was true to his art and respected by all the industry
3185350 he was a very powerful character actor able to play villains and nice roles with ease he was particularly good at playing pinter roles which were very difficult
3185351 he had weight on stage this strong dominating physical presence when he came on there was a sense of something dangerous
3185352 we are moving petrol prices down in order to ensure we offer the best price locally
3185353 cheapest prices in many southern towns are still two to three pence per litre above what drivers are paying in areas where competitive supermarkets are engaged in a dogfight

3185360 i could hardly breathe out when i turned on the radio to get the result shes done wonderfully she trains down the road in nottingham now but shes always been good to mansfield she knows that it all started here
3185361 i was impressed simply by the fact he was a quick study
3185362 he was able to step out there and step in the huddle spew the verbiage out get people lined up and actually get the ball around
3185363 any time you put on shoulder pads and helmets for the first day its always tough
3185364 i havent had a chance to put this stuff on since november when i got hurt so its good to be out here and good to be part of an organization like this
3185365 hes a very smart quarterback and hes got a strong arm
3185366 he understands we have an established starter here and hes just happy to do what we ask him to do
3185367 for someone to think just because he likes throwing a football around he isnt passionate about baseball its just so far from the truth
3185368 if you dont care about baseball you dont hit 40 home runs every year you just dont
3185369 this is a huge huge deal for me to play for a first place team in august
3185370 i think im under seans wing seans under everyones wing im still under vrabels wing still under adalius wing

3185372 i love football and i always have loved football theres nothing else in this world that i would rather do than play football where else are you going to be able to hit people everywhere else youre going to jail for it
3185373 so far im getting a pretty good grasp on it the system but i have to do it on the field
3185374 you cannot breathe the air is thick and there is smog
3185375 it feels like you are at 3 000 metres because of the air
3185376 if someone asked me if id put on a rain jacket in beijing i would have laughed at them
3185377 thats something thats definitely there for me to see and get me motivated and more excited
3185378 i like to have little quotes and goals stuck up around the house as a personal reminder of what im working towards
3185379 i have them stuck up in the bedroom and in the study so i can see them every day when i look at them i can go ok thats what im working towards and ive got to keep working towards those things
3185380 my favorite quote is they never said it would be easy they just said it would be worth it they are just little reminders so that if you are hurting a bit that day you can pick yourself up
3185381 i feel like im getting motivated by people my age telling me how im motivating them
3185382 im inspired by all the people calling me and telling me their stories im getting pumped up about it
3185383 i was surprised at my reaction they gave me motivation and energy to do well this year they took winning in front of our home crowd away from us and we want our revenge
3185384 my love for the sport and my determination to achieve my objectives kept me going
3185385 the guys who are here are working hard and doing a good job were just going to work the guys who are here well plug in the guys that we have available and keep rolling
3185386 we have a history around here that when things come up we dont blink
3185387 we fill the holes and move forward thats what well continue to do
3185388 he does some things naturally that you cant coach and he is willing to do some of the dirty work it takes to have an impact on the team
3185389 i wasnt nervous at first but i was nervous on the first pass play thats why i jumped offside i was so anxious to get to the quarterback
3185390 hes done a lot of the things we saw him doing in college hes doing the things weve seen him do in practice and hes done it all well
3185391 obviously ive got a lot still to work on but i do feel like ive done well
3185392 it was a blast getting a chance to make some plays
3185393 thats all you can hope for youve just got to keep building on it
3185394 in college i probably ran three routes here im running multiple routes its also a big jump as far as being as precise as you want to be understanding the game and to know exactly whats going on
3185395 when i was laying there on the field thats the most scared ive ever been
3185396 laying there for about a minute i couldnt feel my left side after the trainers came out about 30 seconds later i could start to get the feeling back its something i dont want to experience again
3185397 it was the first chance i had to do any contact since december of 06 so i was just real pumped up and i was the first one down there
3185398 i ran into the guy and the next thing i know im laying on my side and i couldnt move my left side thats basically it i hit him pretty hard i had to pick the biggest guy too
3185399 my mom was watching the arizona cardinals game and she saw my name go across the bottom line that i got carried off on a stretcher so she was freaking out
3185400 they taped it so im going to have to watch it when i get a chance to but it was kind of crazy
3185401 they said it scared them too they were just glad that i was all right
3185402 we have to win as many games as we can the way the division is its crucial for us to keep playing and keep plugging along
3185403 arizona is the team were trying to catch and were not doing a very good job of gaining ground so we have to sweep
3185404 the three game series is an opportunity for us to get things right
3185405 and if it gets away from us then well know where we are at the end of those three games
3185406 thats the best stuff i think hes had in four or five years

3185419 my immediate thought was where did that come from she was so far behind on that last length we might have expected it in the 800m but we didnt in this race
3185420 i wasnt sure if she had got it until that moment and then i came from behind my cushion and hit the roof

3185451 i have owned the trademark moneybag logo for over 25 years i have used it on my magazines book imprint record company and a few other areas until i met jason dussault i held off on really going out into the marketplace in the street wear line it has to do with finding a kindred spirit and jason is it he and i share a passion for only doing things in life that mean something as a teenager he was a huge kiss fan and spent a lot of time not only dressing like kiss but also drawing my character all over his fashion books so his teenage dream of meeting me not only became a reality but we hit it off with a great business idea together we intend on creating cutting edge in your face fashions the moneybag line at long last is becoming a reality

3185466 the key this time is there are a fair number of battleground states that are becoming more diverse and maybe diverse enough to make a difference
3185467 the diversity used to be mainly in pretty safe states like texas california and new york
3185468 but is he generating enough enthusiasm to excite people who lack a formal education and are disproportionately young and not likely to vote

3185480 hundreds of thousands are taking advantage of e learning this school year
3185481 this is a big step up for the lads from last seasons under 16 campaign but i couldnt have asked for a better attitude from them since we met up
3185482 we held a couple of training sessions on monday and the players were really tuned into what we wanted from them they are good listeners and now we have to see what they can do on the pitch in the games
3185483 i think we will get a lot out of these matches bulgaria will be strong they always are at underage level and the fact that both games are being played at league club grounds will give the lads good experience of playing abroad ahead of the competitive matches in september
3185484 these are the only two warm up matches we have with the squad before the qualifiers next month
3185485 we would have liked to arrange more friendlies before those qualifiers but there is no point because the players are unlikely to be released by their clubs

3185501 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
3185502 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
3185503 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
3185504 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
3185505 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health
3185506 patients keep telling us that contracting a healthcare associated infection is one of their biggest concerns it is crucial that we focus on bringing infection rates down even further and protecting patients staff and visitors from the risk of infection

3185508 nhs trusts are absolutely clear that they have a responsibility to maintain high standards of hygiene where there are problems they would hope that the cqc would work with them to resolve those difficulties fines should be a last resort

3185537 i think this was a tough move professionally and personally for ruud
3185538 i dont think it was working out for him and his family i have no issues with ruud i appreciate what hes done for us and we move on
3185539 with ruud moving on we believe that this is the right time to make more sweeping changes throughout the organization
3185540 our commitment continues to be focused on not only winning the mls cup this and every season but to build a club capable of competing at the international level this decision is the right one for the organization the right one for the players and the right one for our fans

3185542 they have developed ways to adapt to environmental opportunities around them for their livelihoods
3185543 young people can enrich the cultural knowledge that has been handed down to them through the generations by taking an interest in scientific research
3185544 they should make use of new technologies to actively participate in the formulation of political strategies that are adapted to the environmental conditions of their region and the needs of their own people
3185545 young people need to be aware that were entering a period of continuous change and they will have to learn how to adapt and capitalize on some of the changes
3185546 they will have to diversify their activities for producing food and income particularly if they currently rely on just a couple of commodities for their livelihoods
3185547 the advantage for young people is their readiness to adapt to change

3185553 prostitutes disproportionately face punitive action after arrest as compared to clients
3185554 governor spitzer ran on a platform of being a different kind of politician and then portrayed an inaccurate image of himself being involved with the services of sex workers is a very common thing if all forms of consensual sex work were decriminalized for adults involved in a consensual transaction sex workers could access the services they need
3185555 spitzer has stood up for workers rights in certain capacities but has not followed through with meeting the real needs of sex workers
3185556 it would be great if the government could use money towards services not punitive measures
3185557 the criminalization of prostitution breeds this type of hypocrisy and makes our politicians and other public figures vulnerable
3185558 this vulnerability exists until our society recognizes that consensual sexual behavior is private and these private acts should no longer be criminalized
3185559 many of our clients are politicians judges lawyers and even police
3185560 its odd that they spend so much effort putting us into jail but then turn around and give us their money in exchange for sex why do they think they wont get caught breaking the laws that they make
3185561 there is a god was the first thought on wall street

3185582 driving onto the tarmac with secret service to drop off barack at his place was pretty awesome
3185583 in a short time we caught hundreds of species 10 of which may be new to science it was unreal unbelievable

3185595 eine solche milit roffensive im 21 jahrhundert ist nicht hinnehmbar
3185596 sollten diese berichte zutreffen w rde das russische vorgehen eine dramatische und brutale eskalation des konflikts in georgien darstellen

3185631 for all the talk about the private sector taking off in iraq it didnt materialize
3185632 people would say well these people are poor we need to help them its true but we didnt create jobs i think this is a huge problem
3185633 i think that the government itself has been concerned about keeping a cap on the number of people that can join the public sector
3185634 when people see a sudden pay raise they will spend
3185635 to be frank we have not been fair to the poorer people or people without jobs or people not on the payroll of the government

3185641 when we questioned the gang members they admitted that they were coming back from chengalpattu where they had gone to carry out a contract killing the gang leader charles said that they were given a contract of rs 50 000 to kill a youth during a temple festival by an illegal liquor brewer in pulipakkam near chengalpattu they had gone in search of their target but could not find him and were returning home
3185642 charles has several cases including an attempt to murder pending against him the gang members used to work as contract killers so we are looking at the possibilities of their possible involvement in earlier murder cases we have produced the accused before a court and have remanded them

3185647 what is striking is not the cynicism of the politicians
3185648 saddam hussein of course needed to be hanged for destroying several shiite villages but not the current georgian leadership which in less than an hour drove tanks through children and old people burned people alive in their homes these leaders need to be protected
3185649 russia will bring its peacekeeping mission to its logical conclusion he said
3185650 what im seeing at the moment is an inexperienced team cracking under the olympic pressure
3185651 the body language was different i could see in the showers they werent a team after the third dive i can see these things and what i was reading is that this is a cauldron you put the five rings in front of them and something changes
3185652 blake made a phone call which i agree was unusual and the timing was strange that tells me that they were under stress and under pressure
3185653 i have seen them around the village and they have looked very calm but i am sure that can happen with the pressure of the event they will learn from this and that is the most important thing
3185654 tom is a remarkable kid no question but this was a good lesson because it puts things in perspective for them we have talked to tom and he has said yes he was nervous and blake when he missed the third dive picked up on that and his body language changed
3185655 hes just 14 so a little more space would be good and he needs to go back to school
3185656 we have not looked at the numbers but there was some funny judging going on out there we dont look at the individuals but there was one dive where tom had 5 5 and 7 5 from the two judges which is a big discrepancy
3185657 actually the synchronisation was really good it was the execution of the dives that let them down when that happens the synchronisation slips
3185658 our thinking is that life without possibility of parole rashad raleigh off our streets for sure for the rest of his life is a very good deal and we feel it very much serves the public interest
3185659 whatever route you have you better run it hard because the ball could be coming
3185660 if youre not looking you may get hit in the head
3185661 its starting to show the guy can still play football
3185662 as soon as you come out of your break the balls right here
3185663 you just have to have your hands up real quick
3185664 when you have a guy who can pressure the defense in many ways you know every routes available on the field
3185665 i wouldnt only say its just how fast the ball is coming
3185666 hes not going to wait for your eye contact he expects you to be ready for the ball
3185667 theres no such thing as a decoy route not as long as you have brett back there
3185668 like i tell the guys even when youre covered youre not really covered if you have two hands and two arms youre not covered because hes going to hit one of them so just find a way as long as you can see him he can see you
3185669 he just threw it up in the air and let him get it and youre like wow
3185670 laveranues couldve closed his eyes and it was right there in his hands
3185671 just growing up and watching him play and now him actually being my quarterback id be lying to you if i told you it wasnt way different
3185672 i didnt ever think it was going to be like that but im getting used to it every day
3185673 ive never played with a quarterback whos had a no look pass in their repertoire
3185674 you would think its a lot harder to catch because its coming so fast but his spiral is so tight that its actually a lot easier to catch
3185675 he does like to spread the ball around a lot
3185676 he gets the ball to the tight ends a lot i spoke to bubba and he said be ready hes right because at any time the ball can be coming your way it makes it a little more fun because you get out there and youre running routes and you know youre a live option on every play
3185677 thats something thats definitely there for me to see and get me motivated and more excited
3185678 obviously its a tough situation but this team has shown great perseverance all year and i expect it will continue
3185679 well continue to monitor the waiver wire but this underscores the emphasis that weve placed on depth we havent gotten to this point on the back of any one player its been a team effort all year and i expect that to continue
3185680 different things create opportunities you can reflect on the negative part or on the positive of giving these guys opportunities to help this team further our lead in the standings
3185681 thats the way were going to look at it it doesnt do any good to dwell on the other side

3185696 at 19 years 15 percent of runners had died compared with 34 percent of controls
3185697 both common sense and background science support the idea that there is nothing magical about running per se
3185698 it is the regular physical vigorous activity that is important
3185699 over time all groups decreased running activity but the runners groups continued to accumulate more minutes per week of vigorous activity of all kinds
3185700 members of the running groups had significantly lower mean disability levels at all time points
3185701 almost all of them did something else they continued their vigorous exercise
3185702 we really dont know as much about obesity as we think we do

3185724 we could not put the helicopter pilot at risk by making him try to follow the firework route

3185772 taking an interest in ones own soul requires a certain amount of space for reflection and appreciation ordinarily we are so identified with movements of the psyche that we cant stand back and take a good look at them a little distance allows us to see the dynamics among the many elements that make up the life of the soul by becoming interested in these phenomena we begin to see our own complexity usually we feel that complexity as it hits us unawares from outside in a multitude of problems and confusion if we knew the soul better we might be ready for the conflicts of life i often have the sense when someone tells me anxiously about some knot they find themselves in that what they perceive as an impossible and painful situation calling for professional intervention is simply the complexity of human life once again manifesting itself most of us bring to everyday life a somewhat na ve psychological attitude in our expectations that our lives and relationships will be simple love of the soul asks for some appreciation for its complexity

3185780 is this her first time to see food stands at a japanese festival
3185781 an irresponsible government has tried to divide jammu and kashmir by creating a barrier higher than the pir panjal range
3185782 the other thing is the kashmiri politician be it mainstream or separatist is far more savvy and articulate than his jammu counterpart there is a reason for it kashmiri politicians and kashmiri masses have been politicised for a long time they have had this history of agitation against the maharajas for very good reason they were protesting against the system which was iniquitous and as a result of this system you had a class which was fairly articulate and was politicised they were able to put across their views with a bit of articulation which jammu was not able to do so and this class always had its listeners in delhi
3185783 population at that time was equally balanced but when the state constitution was framed and state has its own commission they were given 42 seats and jammu was given 32 seats there was difference of 10 seats then we raised hue and cry and four seats were raised in the valley and five seats in jammu in the present population we have more than 32 lakh voters and kashmir has 29 lakh voters kashmir has three parliamentary seats jammu has two so political power is retained by them and by that they discriminated in the employment in the whole of the secretariat where more than 3 000 employees are there there are hardly 3 4 of the jammu regions including muslims in the medical colleges in the engineering colleges in employment in development every where there was a discrimination with the jammu people
3185784 see i have seen both the phases the pre militancy phase and the post militancy phase pre militancy phase yes i can say so the bonds which existed between the people of kashmir and the people of jammu they were intact people of kashmir used to come here doing the durbar move in winters and we had cordial ties but what happened after militancy during summers people of jammu used to go to the valley but this process stopped okay the secretariat employees had to go but the people in the summer holidays they used to go there to spend their holidays but that system that process stopped okay the youth that has grown up after 1990 okay they had no connection with the youth of kashmir so those bonds were fissured the state which was together pre 1989 no longer together emotionally psychologically
3185785 for the people of jammu a tragedy since the bjp initiative meant the movement would be stamped as communal
3185786 this is a peoples movement and so is not organised people have just got together the time of the protest is fixed so people just pour out on the streets
3185787 jammu needs a state assembly of its own and kashmir should have its state assembly there should be some concurrent subjects like a federal structure
3185788 it is true that the national conference government in 2000 had instituted panchayati raj bodies who had carried out elections but it was an insipid act not much funds were given to these bodies but the popular response to these bodies the turnouts was very encouraging which showed that people had faith in these bodies but it was an act and as it happens the next government that came the pdp congress government left no stones unturned to torpedo even these weak institutions so the problem is the following if the state accepted the 73rd and the 74th amendment then that would be a model act
3185789 now if you have a centralised governance a particular province in this case the province of kashmir is overly represented in the state legislature it is discrimination real and perceived discrimination is bound to take place and it has taken place now if it was a decentralised governance and this state is a mountainous state a multi ethnic state and a diverse state it cannot be in any way governed in a centralised manner you have to have a democratic devolution of power decentralisation in this state otherwise the state cannot run that unfortunately is completely missing in this particular state so you have various people various regions feeling alienated feeling disempowered blaming each other as well as the central government for this current state of affairs

3185828 saya akan terus meniti prestasi tertinggi yaitu pada piala dunia 2010 usia saya 28 tahun saat berada pada kondisi puncak itu akan luar biasa bagi brasil di piala dunia
3185829 setiap orang ingin brasil meraih emas olimpiade ini yang membesarkan motivasi para pemain tapi bagaimana saya bisa tampil di olimpiade bila tidak ada yang percaya
3185830 but youve given presentations before why do you think this time you wont do well
3185831 my little girl does not have american bank accounts she has swiss bank accounts
3185832 we owe the rest of the world 13 trillion rising at the rate of 1 trillion every 15 months
3185833 and the few people who know what is going on dont seem to care
3185834 their profit margins are the only profit margins in any group we look at anywhere that arent measurably above average at all
3185835 everything else the profit margins are way over average globally including emerging markets very vulnerable hugely mean reverting
3185836 theyve been left behind exactly the time you would need them
3185837 by the end of the third quarter the preferred stock in fannie and freddie will be issued the treasury will have bought it
3185838 well be on our way toward a joint treasury agency combination
3185839 were in a recession when has the fed ever raised rates in a recession
3185840 unemployment is headed toward 6 percent mortgage rates on home buyers are at 7 percent and these guys want to raise rates
3185841 were in an asset deflation of near historic proportions that calls for the use of the governments balance sheet and not for the federal reserve to raise interest rates
3185842 to the extent that the central banks now must prevent that deflation interest rates dont go up they go down
3185843 in the us 2 percent is pretty much the floor i think the fed made that clear
3185844 theyre going to provide liquidity in different forms and fashions
3185845 we want to stay under the umbrella to the extent that we have an umbrella that shelters large banks and to the extent that we have an umbrella that shelters the agencies fannie and freddie thats where you want to be
3185846 why mess with junk bonds lets stick to high quality and stay under that umbrella lets stay dry
3185847 swedia rusia dan yunani adalah lawan yang tangguh kami pernah melawan ketiga negara itu sebelum aragones diangkat sebagai pelatih spanyol
3185848 setiap tim yang berlaga pasti memasang target menjadi juara kami juga tak boleh lupa jika yunani adalah juara bertahan sedangkan rusia sukses membuktikan kapasitasnya dengan menyisihkan inggris di babak kualifikasi
3185849 semua yang telah terjadi biarlah menjadi kenangan anggapan publik yang mengatakan kami mendapat kutukan tidak bisa dijadikan acuan untuk menilai sukses atau tidaknya kami di euro 2008
3185850 tim ini masih dihuni para pemain yang tampil di piala dunia namun perlahan kami mulai menemukan bentuk permainan terbaik formasi 4 4 2 dan 4 1 4 1 yang diterapkan aragones juga berjalan dengan sangat baik kini kami bisa memenangkan pertandingan dengan satu atau dua striker
3185851 beberapa bulan lalu saya tak yakin kepadanya del piero namun kini saya akan memberikan satu kursi di pesawat yang akan membawa squad azzurri
3185852 pasalnya nedved membutuhkan waktu untuk memutuskannya dia ingin tahu apakah keutusannya ini menguntungkan buat skuad timnas ceko dan apakah dia masih memiliki kekuatan atau tidak
3185853 the experience theyve had in responsible government spending and balanced budgets is relatively short inflation was high
3185854 with oil prices beginning to soften there may be a chance for them to give a boost to the economy by lowering rates again
3185855 thats still in the cards but no one really knows
3185856 more and more people are beginning to see that these markets are very cheap
3185857 a well managed distressed fund will no doubt do very well and will have great opportunities
3185858 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3185859 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3185860 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim
3185861 the last thing you want is for people to think youre making fun of the victims in this who are having their lives turned into fodder for people to win oscar
3185862 plans are very hush hush but madonna is definitely going to celebrate her milestone in style unfortunately not everything has gone as expected as shes had many other things on her mind not least rehearsals for her sticky and sweet tour on top of all the stress of this she twisted her ankle over the weekend she views this as a sign that perhaps she should postpone the formal birthday bash and play it by ear instead madonna now reckons itll go ahead during a three day break in the tour towards the end of the month not next weekend
3185863 god grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change the courage to change the things i can and the wisdom to know the difference
3185864 you young people have in a special way the task of witnessing today to the faith the commitment to bring the gospel of christ into the third christian millennium to build a new civilization
3185865 love is always patient and kind love is never jealous love is not boastful or conceited it is never rude and never seeks its own advantage it does not take offence or store up grievances love does not rejoice at wrongdoing but finds its joy in the truth it is always ready to make allowances to trust to hope and to endure whatever comes love never comes to an end
3185866 is there anything else happening in the world other than the olympics
3185867 this things going to crest a half a billion soon
3185868 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3185869 phone differentiation used to be about radios and antennas and things like that
3185870 we think going forward the phone of the future will be differentiated by software
3185871 mining and other extractive industries threaten farm life coastal and marine resources access to water and spawn epidemics and pollution of all types
3185872 foreign mining firms have since the 1970s plundered as much as 30 billion worth of mineral resources from the philippines moreover some 2 billion is lost to environmental degradation every year
3185873 i was told by crew members that damage to the helicopter was pretty severe it will stay where it is until the caa are happy and have finished their investigations into the cause of the crash
3185874 however we are very grateful and fortunate that we arent dealing with anything more serious than a broken leg
3185875 what i was trying to say and again i hope you understand that this is my opinion solely that it is reasonable for mothers to want to have their daughters around good role models not necessarily you but anyone who has a dui drinks alot gave up on their marriage currently living with a surrogate spouse is not a good role model
3185876 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3185877 the russian government must reverse the course that it appears to be on
3185878 the georgian army is retreating to defend the capital the government is urgently seeking international intervention to prevent the fall of georgia and further loss of life
3185879 today the statehood of georgia is in great danger and thereby leaving existing world order in uncertainty
3185880 russia seems intent on overthrowing the democratically elected government of georgia and occupying the country
3185881 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several us diplomats it is a real shame
3185882 russian aggression must not go unanswered and its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3185883 people are in panic this road where the troops are is about 2km from the centre
3185884 hey look they never won a medal they might as well go home
3185885 i hope no foreigners are listening to lauer and costas dumbed down commentary because it would reflect so badly on what the media considers the typical americans intellectual level
3185886 for all you people complaining about the fact that a lot of the olympics arent live this is because of restrictions imposed by the chinese government not a decision made by nbc try picking up a newspaper every once in awhile
3185887 who cares about me man point your camera up at the amazing flying man with the torch
3185888 i asked the young folks where are they getting their cars and they say the car dealers i asked the older people where are they getting their cars and they say the car dealers
3185889 it would hurt my business tremendously not to be able to sell cars
3185890 and now this little girl she says will we make it at all 800 miles is a drive
3185891 d00d i cant tattoo you today my arm is on fire right now from the tattoo removal
3185892 is this the life i signed up for growing up is this what i envisioned for myself
3185893 im attracted to guys who are really athletic so its never a problem to be honest i absolutely hate working out i hate going to the gym i do it only cause its my job and i think about it like ok other peoples jobs are to go to the office nine to five and my job is to go the gym and look sexy thats the only thing that gets me through it
3185894 i love my smile my smile and my cleavage laughs i think they go really well together
3185895 it definitely makes it harder which is not really cool because i
3185896 because there are no vowel movements in the goth culture
3185897 wait a minute this conversation has nothing to do with leos
3185898 yeah so why are we involved in or even having this conversation
3185899 greeting losers it is i the worlds shrewdest man sleazy p martini manager of
3185900 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3185901 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3185902 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3185903 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3185904 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3185905 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3185906 rusia ha invadido un estado soberano vecino y amenaza un gobierno democr tico elegido por su pueblo tal acci n es inaceptable en el siglo xxi
3185907 estas acciones amenazan las relaciones con estados unidos y europa
3185908 a esta hora el ej rcito de invasi n de la federaci n de rusia ha entrado en territorio georgiano el ej rcito georgiano se retira para defender la capital
3185909 necesitamos un acuerdo por escrito firmado de un lado por georgia y del otro por osetia del sur y abjasia de que no volver n a hacer uso de la fuerza en el futuro

3185912 the visit was short however with a great political significance it was a historic visit in my opinion
3185913 whatever i wear i seem to get soaked in sweat and if i came on stage naked that wouldnt do
3185914 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3185915 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3185916 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3185917 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3185918 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3185919 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3185920 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3185921 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3185922 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3185923 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3185924 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3185925 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3185926 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3185927 we couldnt think of anyone better and we think we have chosen the perfect god mother for aliyah
3185928 es lamentable que se hayan llevado a cabo estos eventos porque la convocatoria s fue informada a la base magisterial y ten a como objetivo que el maestro que llegue a las aulas sea el mejor es una cuesti n de justicia y equidad social para que todos tengan acceso a poder competir
3185929 este es un compromiso tanto del gobierno federal y estatal y hoy se iba a dar un paso fundamental para empezar un nuevo esquema donde el que quisiera ingresar a las filas educativas fuera el de vocaci n y capacidad
3185930 to me its real important to understand what im doing
3185931 i really havent had the chance to tell him yet but he really doesnt know how good he has it
3185932 a lot of calls go to his side the weak side
3185933 i have to do something real special for him i hope it doesnt cost me too much though
3185934 a wise son brings joy to his father but a foolish son grief to his mother
3185935 he who conceals his hatred has lying lips and whoever spreads slander is a fool
3185936 what the wicked dreads will overtake him what the righteous desire will be granted
3185937 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3185938 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3185939 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3185940 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3185941 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3185942 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3185943 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3185944 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3185945 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3185946 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3185947 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3185948 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3185949 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3185950 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3185951 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3185952 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3185953 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3185954 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3185955 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3185956 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3185957 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3185958 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3185959 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3185960 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

3185963 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3185964 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

3185966 estamos interviniendo y haciendo lo que sea necesario para enderezar esto
3185967 hay dos buenas personas que por razones distintas no son hoy parte de esta organizaci n y es una pena
3185968 el hecho es que los jugadores deben hacer un examen de conciencia y entender que tienen que responsabilizarse por parte de esto
3185969 obviously its a tough situation but this team has shown great perseverance all year and i expect it will continue
3185970 well continue to monitor the waiver wire but this underscores the emphasis that weve placed on depth we havent gotten to this point on the back of any one player its been a team effort all year and i expect that to continue
3185971 different things create opportunities you can reflect on the negative part or on the positive of giving these guys opportunities to help this team further our lead in the standings
3185972 thats the way were going to look at it it doesnt do any good to dwell on the other side
3185973 y continuar as hasta agosto pero estamos considerando prolongar el mayor tiempo posible esta medida
3185974 es una decisi n de los asociados y depende de los costos de producci n de c mo est n impactados y c mo han logrado controlarlos
3185975 por diversas v as tratamos de bajar costos de producci n para repercutirle al consumidor esa baja y por otro lado eficientando los procesos
3185976 los incrementos en los precios de las oleaginosas han oscilado en 50 por ciento en lo que va del a o de lo que importa m xico la industria requiere 90 por ciento
3185977 aunque no como deber a ser porque entendemos que el mercado no podr a aguantar incrementos de esa naturaleza
3185978 otro de los compromisos que hicimos con la presidencia de la rep blica fue mantener abastecido al mercado
3185979 todav a no resentimos un efecto en la demanda de estados unidos por la recesi n que enfrenta

3185984 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3185985 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3185986 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3185987 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3185988 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3185989 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3185990 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3185991 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3185992 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3185993 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3185994 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3185995 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3185996 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3185997 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3185998 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3185999 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3186000 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3186001 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3186002 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

3186026 we dont believe we are in a position to wait much longer for resolution of this question
3186027 your concept would not only require stopping pay but also issuing minimum wage payments and determining the appropriate treatment of multiple deductions for each employee
3186028 then after the budget is passed we would need to restore full pay and again determine the appropriate level of deductions offsetting the prior adjustments
3186029 implementing system changes of the magnitude needed to accurately pay each employee should not be taken lightly
3186030 if they are not performed thoughtfully and accurately the system changes could subject the state to further litigation and unnecessary costs

3186034 i believe that president reagan can say these things only because he knows that the american people will never hold him accountable for what he says it is history that holds you accountable and ive already expressed my opinion that americans are not big on history how many of them remember their own recent history was twenty years ago so long ago for americans do they remember october 21 1967 fifty thousand antiwar demonstrators were in washington i was there that was the march on the pentagon remember and two years later in october of 69 there were fifty thousand people in washington again they were carrying flashlights they were asking for peace there were a hundred thousand asking for peace in boston common there were two hundred fifty thousand in new york ronald reagan had not yet numbed the united states but he had succeeded in putting california to sleep he described the vietnam protests as giving aid and comfort to the enemy as president he still didnt know who the enemy was
3186035 ive been through a lot other people only see me out there running and theyre jeering and criticising and saying a whole bunch of stuff but they dont know the real person or what im going through
3186036 i saw my mum running all over the place crying and i was trying to find out what had happened and she was just saying michaels dead michaels dead it was very disturbing
3186037 i was on my way to the national trials when i heard and i didnt know how to react because id never lost a brother there were just tears falling from my eyes
3186038 i told myself i wasnt going i put down my bag and took off my clothes my brother donovan was in texas and he phoned and told me to go out there and do it because thats what michael would have wanted he got me back out there but i was in tears i was torn apart i still made the team and i got to run the 100m at the commonwealth games but i wasnt focused on the race i was in front but i just stopped running and finished fourth it was very tough
3186039 i then lost my brother vaughan the next year he was in america playing football and he collapsed on the field and died there are times now when i sit in my room and remember them and i just start crying its not something you really get over
3186040 i can just imagine how my brothers would be if they were still here now they would probably be outside the door jumping and saying thats my brother thats my brother they were crazy crazy excited about their brother running
3186041 beaten a hundred times i just lost the one that counted
3186042 i was too confident i never lost a race for three years and so i just thought i have to go out and run a world record that was wrong because i lost focus when i saw tyson running alongside me i couldnt believe it because id been way ahead i was shocked and i didnt correct anything it was then too late
3186043 i definitely would have gone under 9 7 but i slowed down because it was a heat i was disappointed in a way because if i had run like that two weeks before i would have been world champion
3186044 its hard for me to be an underdog when i can run 9 7 i can break the world record and stuff like that but when usain goes out on the track hes the one people are expecting to win
3186045 who wouldnt be that was only the fourth 100m of his career so i was very surprised i was saying what is he going to run in the next one i sent him an sms but i had changed my number so he wasnt sure who it was so when he called he said who is this but when he heard it was me he was almost apologising for breaking the world record i said congratulations man keep up the good work that love between them is amazing
3186046 every day we have been together he called me the fast man and i called him sarge in jamaica we just mess around with names we have been friends a long time and nothing changes us maybe if he was from the us it might be different and there would be anger in our hearts but he looks up to me and so it feels good that ive always been helping him and hes such a nice person i still call him sarge and he still calls me fast man
3186047 im always confident i can run faster than the rest
3186048 there is always rivalry between the us and jamaica most people in the world have this thing about the united states everywhere i go people always say make sure you beat the us so were not friends and its not like im going to try to be friends just because were both running fast
3186049 if everybody approached the sport the way i do it would be clean it would draw a lot more people because they would say thats a normal human being running but im tired of it every day people ask drugs this drugs that its very annoying
3186050 you want to make them afraid you want them to think that if i do drugs ill go to jail but i cant do anything about it i can just say some harsh stuff
3186051 i can really only speak for myself i have no idea what anyone else is doing there are people out there who do drugs sometimes i see them go across the finish line and theyre making a cross and praying to god im saying why are they praying when theyre cheating why are they thanking god but some athletes dont have a heart they dont care but it gives me an extra boost when i run against guys i think are on drugs and i beat them
3186052 there has been pain and strife but this is my big chance and thats why it is a lot better that usain and tyson are racing against me if they didnt run in the 100m people would say if usain and tyson had been there i would never have got gold but now when i beat them in front of everyone they will see that i deserve to be the fastest man in the world

3186054 despite sanctions and threats made by certain global powers the iranian nation will continue on its path and such measures will not obstruct the countrys development
3186055 i have more iranian blood than german in my veins
3186056 irans nuclear stance is strong and transparent and this stance would not change through any sanction or threat
3186057 the islamic republic of iran will resist such moves and will not retreat from its rights
3186058 if you come to visit me tread softly lest you break the fragile shell of my loneliness

3186062 if you want to drink from a carafe you can grip its neck and press it to your lips but if you want to drink from a spring you have to get down on your knees and bow your head

3186064 we are not friends with the israeli people and iran has a logic which is what the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei has said

3186068 its a very essential process to be able to repair the dna
3186069 our study addresses one step of this very complicated process we figured out how a critical enzyme is regulated
3186070 solving one structure gives you just a snapshot but if you have several structures you can understand how they work
3186071 while many have thought that people wont be able to take medicines as well as they need to due to limited resources in poor countries our review of all studies on the topic strongly suggests that children in low income countries are able to maintain at least a comparable degree of art adherence if not better adherence than children in high income countries
3186072 healthcare systems need to carefully monitor how children with hiv take their medicines this kind of monitoring can be particularly difficult in low income countries so its very helpful for healthcare providers to understand how others do this monitoring and how well its working
3186073 we were not completely surprised to find the high rate of adherence to art in children in low income countries because it mirrors the results of adult studies but there is no question that it is reassuring to learn that even in settings where families face many challenges children are still able to adhere to a demanding yet essential medication regimen
3186074 our efforts to increase access to art must be coupled with research to inform strategies to deliver that therapy

3186078 the funding will support research into how brain cells create memories during these periods of acute stress at a time or situation of extreme stress it is important for your brain to work optimally and to find the best way to escape clarity of assessing the situation is therefore paramount it is also critically important to remember and learn from the situation if it recurs you can refer to the earlier experience and know how best to escape
3186079 professor lightman and i co founded bristol neuroscience five years ago to promote dialogue within bristols diverse neuroscience community i am delighted that one of the resulting collaborations is a joint project between our laboratories
3186080 we now know that hivcide i was clearly superior to the triple drug combo cocktail in all parameters we observed
3186081 the novel mechanism of action of hivcide i defines a new class of anti hiv drugs this enables that it can be combined with the existing cocktail in such a combination a much greater level of effectiveness could be achieved compared to what is possible today
3186082 if our preliminary results can be duplicated in humans it is quite possible that hivcide i either alone or in combination with the current combo cocktail may provide a functional cure for hiv aids
3186083 we expect that of the 200 to 300 program participants 25 percent will reduce their blood pressure cholesterol and cardiovascular risk levels and 85 percent will increase their commitment to a healthier lifestyle

3186098 how can it be a token tax if the excise on gas goes from 10 to 8 permanently
3186099 as ive explained our green shift plan doesnt include gas anyway since it is already taxed
3186100 stephane dion pees sitting down he is not a leader
3186101 to even suggest that we should just trust a politician is laughable
3186102 fixes hard caps and makes the carbon price float conversely a carbon tax sets a price and hopes for results
3186103 sorry i dont see much by way of herculean efforts get on the 401 or qew at rush hour and notice how many single occupant vehicles are still clogging the expressways walk down any suburban street and notice the preponderance of two car and three car families hang around a convenience store and notice how many customers drive up from a few short blocks away go out on any great lake or recreational waterway and watch the jet skis and power boats zip around spewing noise and pollution walk down any street on garbage day and notice the waste
3186104 i havent had much success urging the government to pass laws lately how about we just tax the electricity and natural gas to the point that the stores and shopping malls start to do what conservation minded canadians already do in their own homes
3186105 why not pass a law rationing electricity and making everyone get thermostats that cannot be set outside of some strict parameters
3186106 why not have rising prices subsets wherein normal use based on typical demand is charged one rate but this goes up incrementally the more glutious the usage
3186107 this already exists take a look at your hydro bill

3186110 the point being that without the one mccain 5 poll you would be seeing obama averaging about 4 which is pretty consistent with where things have been for the past two months
3186111 without ross perot bill clinton would never have been president
3186112 perot was primarily focused on bush which any fair observer would have to admit helped clinton
3186113 call me an unfair observer but it seems to me that when you have two people both attacking bush you give anti bush people two people to split their vote between
3186114 the new survey also suggests the trip carefully designed to burnish obamas foreign policy credentials did little to alter voters perceptions of how the illinois senator would handle national security issues watch more on summer polls bigcitylib said

3186120 we are extremely pleased to have mark join us as he brings with him a proven ability to address the execution challenges and processes which will face our business in this fast growth phase
3186121 we dont like their sound and guitar music is on the way out
3186122 we are pleased with our continued strong performance as evidenced by our second quarter core earnings
3186123 farmer macs net interest income and guarantee fee income were major drivers of the year over year increase in core earnings for second quarter 2008 this increase in core earnings was achieved notwithstanding the volatility of the capital markets during 2008 while it is not possible to predict how long farmer macs short term borrowing spreads will continue to be as favorable as they were during second quarter relative to yields on program and non program assets farmer macs guarantee fee income should continue to grow commensurate with outstanding business volume
3186124 much of farmer macs business volume in recent years resulted from our ongoing efforts to diversify farmer macs marketing focus to include large program transactions that emphasize high asset quality with greater protection against adverse credit performance and commensurately lower compensation for the assumption of credit risk and administrative costs resulting in projected risk adjusted marginal returns on equity approximately equal to those of other farmer mac program transactions

3186142 thats because angels a self obsessed jerk who doesnt have time to give a damn about anyone besides himself his hair and his current blonde
3186143 so not everyone loves the broodmaster at wolfram and hart
3186144 but i thought he was the brave new champion for the millennium
3186145 that campaign i hated that damn campaign lorne worked for six months to teach angel to smile like he didnt have gas and then the day before the big roll out of angels pr campaign harmony switched him to cow blood some accursed rogue peppered it with a magical herb that made him swell up like a blueberry we never did find out whom but oh that rogue got herself cursed roundly
3186146 so what he was the bloated new champion for the law firms millennium

3186149 i use my bad reputation to further the cause of course
3186150 honestly when he heard who i was and who i worked for the entire situation changed and now that maman marie understands that maryse isnt possessed by an unruly loa shes more than excited to let the slayers train her no need to get involved with the aztec pantheon at all which is quite a relief because their interest rates are ungodly and sometimes they eat their clients
3186151 still for two people with no training in drawing the loa it must have taken quite a spectacle to bring baron samedi himself and you behave as though

3186173 you got foul mouthed since i saw you last miss thing

3186178 people often reconsider over dinner and drinks or while theyre sleeping in the nicest hotel room in san francisco with a view what ive discovered in my line of work is that people like being persuaded it makes them feel wanted
3186179 i need to feel wanted what with buffy being gone and all
3186180 and i think offering you a job at wolfram and hart is a waste of time im here because i want to make you find god because youve never come so hard and this way i can make the assholes in corporate pay for it that what you wanted to hear
3186181 dont waste perfectly good food paper bags scrap paper whatever
3186182 issues like the illegal cutting of forest trees and recurring forest fires have been constant in some localities in tay nguyen the central highlands and south eastern regions many migrants have destroyed forests to grow cash crops including coffee pepper and cassava

3186191 second of all while im a woman preferring bisexual thank you very much this is an old school firm youre still a virgin until penis meets vagina which is the one kink i was saving for my twenty fifth birthday or the right boy whichever came first
3186192 do you know what a virgin goes for in los angeles
3186193 sixty five thousand dollars i can just see some brown noser on an efficiency kick letting it slip you know hey you know morgan and mcdonald hes a religious freako who sold out and shes a lesbian two for one
3186194 well if youre as fond as the cock as youre professing counselor
3186195 gee i dont know why youre a virgin at all mcdonald
3186196 at least i have the excuse of not being a virgin except by sexist pig standards when i think of the crash course i took in deviant sex from my gay theater friends at least you can imagine why im bitter
3186197 because the gay men were prettier and more convincing in heels than you were
3186198 youre the one who came up with the idea laugh with me were going to fuck on your desk not because were drunk and having an indiscreet moment not because we like each other but because were deathly afraid of the law firm we just sold our souls to

3186202 do lindsey the virgin a favor so he owes you one
3186203 let me guess lets turn off the lights and try missionary
3186204 if all were here for is to get it over with why not
3186205 theres a box of condoms over there hurry up loverboy i dont want to die a virgin
3186206 i bet the security guys at wolfram and hart are having a good laugh too
3186207 hell they probably knew before we even got recruited what our sex lives looked like
3186208 this firm is famous for winning on technicalities and now were very sure and its a good reminder of what were doing you know getting nice and comfortable with that nasty sheen of filth on our skins rolling in the muck
3186209 i just dont want to be the worker ant anymore i want to be somebody to be something no one would let me be otherwise
3186210 even for normal sized cities super computers are just not fast enough to compute all of the different options that exist for controlling traffic lights so the number of choices actually considered by the optimization program is significantly reduced
3186211 the variation in the number of vehicles that queue up at a traffic light at any minute of the day is huge
3186212 you are optimizing for a situation that basically is true on average but that is never true for any single day or minute essentially for a situation that never exists plus even adaptive traffic lights in modern control schemes are usually restricted to a variation of cycle based control
3186213 on its own this optimizing strategy was worse than traffic light controls already in place
3186214 it turns out that the two strategies properly combined perform better than todays traffic light controls at all traffic volumes so the combination of two inferior strategies can perform much better if we do it right
3186215 pain and pressure for change may still not be great enough
3186216 you have to decide whether it is necessary to force people to use their cars less or if the same goals can be achieved through coordinating traffic flows better if the answer is coordination then lets go for the better technology

3186219 this disgusting and shocking photo of mr castelli at the front door of town hall is symbolic of their hateful behavior against others
3186220 it is the very reason mr ball and i fight so hard for our community and against them
3186221 that type of behavior is unprofessional and its really demeaning to the public discourse if you disagree with someone you should debate about the issues not use vulgarity
3186222 this is the type of behavior that the degnan campaign is tolerating and i hope that they realize this kind of behavior is insulting and unacceptable
3186223 i dont think it was right because it was an impolite gesture
3186224 the people of the 99th assembly district deserve a clear and coherent discussion on the issues that we are facing
3186225 if the republican assembly campaign committee would choose to spend their time talking about a nonelected officials behavior thats fine but im focused on the issues property tax reform our economic security and an energy policy we can all live with

3186229 we cant continue to perform this way late in the game
3186230 we have to make some adjustments i have to figure out what i have and who is willing to step up in those roles
3186231 today was a big win for us a big win
3186232 we have to refocus and not allow this to cross over into this road trip
3186233 i didnt want to let the team down like i did previously
3186234 i got in there worked the count and got the pitch that i was waiting for
3186235 you just keep going out there and keep battling its all you can do
3186236 it was real big for these guys to really pull together and come back
3186237 especially 5 1 down and didnt look like anything was going our way at all
3186238 i just want to take it one start at a time for now and finish the year strong
3186239 whatever route you have you better run it hard because the ball could be coming
3186240 if youre not looking you may get hit in the head
3186241 its starting to show the guy can still play football
3186242 as soon as you come out of your break the balls right here
3186243 you just have to have your hands up real quick
3186244 when you have a guy who can pressure the defense in many ways you know every routes available on the field
3186245 i wouldnt only say its just how fast the ball is coming
3186246 hes not going to wait for your eye contact he expects you to be ready for the ball
3186247 theres no such thing as a decoy route not as long as you have brett back there
3186248 like i tell the guys even when youre covered youre not really covered if you have two hands and two arms youre not covered because hes going to hit one of them so just find a way as long as you can see him he can see you
3186249 he just threw it up in the air and let him get it and youre like wow
3186250 laveranues couldve closed his eyes and it was right there in his hands
3186251 just growing up and watching him play and now him actually being my quarterback id be lying to you if i told you it wasnt way different
3186252 i didnt ever think it was going to be like that but im getting used to it every day
3186253 ive never played with a quarterback whos had a no look pass in their repertoire
3186254 you would think its a lot harder to catch because its coming so fast but his spiral is so tight that its actually a lot easier to catch
3186255 he does like to spread the ball around a lot
3186256 he gets the ball to the tight ends a lot i spoke to bubba and he said be ready hes right because at any time the ball can be coming your way it makes it a little more fun because you get out there and youre running routes and you know youre a live option on every play
3186257 favre is not going to wait for your eye contact he expects you to be ready for the ball

3186273 the captain wanted the load to be reduced as he wanted to carry more fuel to delhi because of congestion there and hovering could take a while such decisions are taken on basis of weight that can be safely flown to a destination alongwith fuel
3186274 usually this problem happens in summer because of load penalty this implies that a plane has to be lighter to take off in the hot and light air that offers poor lift however such decisions are usually taken by airlines commercial and operational departments before hand so passengers are told at check in counters as to what they will not be able to take on the flight instances of such announcements being made in cabin for seated passengers are not common

3186282 denny theeves has given me the tools to help the pepsi generation come to christ and doesnt their salvation make up for their deteriorating tooth enamel and sugar induced hyperactivity
3186283 if not for trailblazers like denny working with retail chains like lifeway and mardel i would have never thought that you could make a decent living reducing our lord and savior to a novelty item
3186284 with dennys advice i made millions of dollars merchandising the heck out of christs crucifixion if the catholic church knew what denny knows they would have dropped indulgences centuries ago and went straight to retail
3186285 i havent read the book but what the heck ill endorse it anyway
3186286 ok this could just be me turning crazy but i swear this yellow paint smells like lemons

3186292 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3186293 the russian government must reverse the course that it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3186294 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world
3186295 and these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3186296 their accounting is so distorted it recalls the phrase the big lie
3186297 this appears to be a full invasion of georgia with an end result uncertain and an objective that is not clear but appears to be aggressive in nature
3186298 words like invasion should not be used lightly but this is an invasion
3186299 will find itself increasingly isolated in the world if it continues as it has
3186300 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3186301 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3186302 the russian government must reverse the course that it appears to be on
3186303 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several u s diplomats it is a real shame
3186304 the georgian army is retreating to defend the capital the government is urgently seeking international intervention to prevent the fall of georgia
3186305 we are working with an international community but all we got so far are just words statements moral support humanitarian aid
3186306 but we need more we want them to stop this barbaric aggressor
3186307 the situation in georgia is extremely difficult as russia is using all its resources to occupy the country
3186308 my grandson screamed uncle putin please help us help us so that the georgians dont kill me they were screaming and crying it was terrible a nightmare
3186309 thank god the russians have come it is getting better
3186310 they the americans of course had to hang saddam hussein for destroying several shiite villages
3186311 but the current georgian rulers who in one hour simply wiped 10 ossetian villages from the face of the earth the georgian rulers which used tanks to run over children and the elderly which threw civilians into cellars and burnt them they georgian leaders are players that have to be protected
3186312 no you wont youve never ever been gentle before im not going to school i hate my hair

3186314 the shorts are flooding the market with buyorders the past couple of weeks we have seen thesecond largest amount of buying by the short sellers ever
3186315 this rule change marked the bottom of the downward marketspiral and has single handedly changed the landscape of themarket
3186316 in fact the very day the rule wasreleased marked the beginning of the market trend higher
3186317 against its will metro has been forced to move out
3186318 the market remained pretty flat yesterday and just managedto close marginally up thanks to some last minute buying
3186319 we expect this flat market trend to continue today aswell while plantation stocks would probably face more sellingpressure
3186320 i think crude oil should rebound after hitting 110 abarrel and then we would see a recovery in palm oil as well till then we see the sector under pressure
3186321 there are many investors who still feel that the deal isexpensive so if it goes through finally it could be negativefor the share price
3186322 its the result of higher prices higher production and areduction in operating costs
3186323 we are starting to roll out a fix now and hope to have theproblem resolved as quickly as possible
3186324 its clearly a technical break its clearly the oil and its the dollar euro its a combination of things you could see some panic here in the gold market now
3186325 dont be surprised to see it keeps going down to the short side if we continue to see the dollar strength and the crude weakness its not oversold yet without russia i think we could go down to the high 700 levels

3186327 shares are likely to continue trading in an upwardmomentum on the back of u s gains and slowly improving marketenvironment

3186331 the leprechaun went missing many many months ago and i had forgotten about it
3186332 then i opened the door on thursday and saw he was back it was such a shock
3186333 i thought well its a bit of mischief but at least he hasnt been put through the window
3186334 murphy was quite badly damaged and there was a tightly wrapped parcel next to him my curiosity eventually overcame my alarm because i did wonder if it might explode
3186335 then i saw it was a beautifully bound photo album and opened it up
3186336 his feet were missing but thats no real surprise given that he was sent abseiling down a mountain
3186337 it was the strangest gift i have ever received i just keep thinking how funny it is it makes me smile to see all the people he met on his travels it was a wonderful surprise
3186338 hello first of all i feel i should explain my prolonged absence a gnomes life is full of time for reflection and whilst surveying your garden one summer morning i began to get itchy feet
3186339 i came to the conclusion that the world is a big place and there is more to life than watching the daily commuter traffic and allowing passing cats to urinate on you
3186340 so i decided to free myself from the doldrums of the shire and seek adventure my travels have taken me across three continents 12 countries and more time zones than i can possibly remember
3186341 there have been high points low points and positively terrifying points but i have survived small thanks to the companion with whom i have shared all these moments

3186361 the court has adopted an interpretation of the statute that is blatantly unconstitutional equating discussion in a public forum with computer intrusion
3186362 more importantly squelching research and scientific discussion wont stop the attackers it will just stop the public from knowing that these systems are vulnerable and from pressuring the companies that develop and implement them to fix security holes

3186382 one in five households in scotland is affected by asthma so the chances are there will always be someone in the pub who has the condition or at least knows someone who does
3186383 asthma is serious every 16 minutes a child is admitted to hospital due to an asthma attack and a person dies every seven hours as a result of asthma
3186384 through further research and education about asthma management we can help improve these figures and the lives of people with asthma
3186385 thats why we are hoping as many pubs as possible help us celebrate our birthday by supporting the 390 000 people in scotland with asthma and stake their claim for the title of scotlands brainiest pub

3186390 ghost recon begins in august 2008 with civil unrest in russia ultra nationalists have seized power in russia with plans to rebuild the government their first step is clandestine support of rebel factions in georgia and the baltic states this is where the ghosts come in to silence the invasion armed with some of the most advanced weaponry in the world the soldiers of the ghost recon force are covertly inserted into area of operations and given specific missions to curtail the rebel actions and overthrow their benefactors
3186391 bush understands that its not really about georgia but in a certain sense its also an aggression against america the russians want the whole of georgia the russians need control over energy routes from central asia and the caspian sea in addition they want to get rid of us they want regime change every democratic movement in this neighbouring region must be got rid of
3186392 this underscores the limits of western influence over russia at a time when the rest of europe depends heavily on russia for natural gas and the united states needs moscows cooperation if it hopes to curtail what it believes is a nuclear weapons threat from iran

3186446 we cant say whether or not the shark took a swimming young bear
3186447 we dont know how active these sharks are as predators
3186448 theres no possibility a greenland shark could predate a live adult white bear unless it was injured or seriously ill
3186449 greenland sharks do seem quite sluggish but they have been known to move very quickly when they are eating
3186450 both walruses and polar bears are powerful in the water both could handle most potential predators but not killer whales
3186451 the greenland shark simply cannot afford the risk of injury nor the expenditure of energy required to kill such a large and dangerous animal with or without the help of global warming

3186453 humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting
3186454 this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
3186455 its quite possible that they will use this was support for their case but one cant determine that because a species is under less threat from extinction that its automatically okay to start hunting them

3186467 the vessel stopped in athens then in the peloponnese peninsula
3186468 it sailed up the western coast of greece crossed the otranto channel coasted along italy and pointed to sicily

3186472 its hard enough to fight with a shark but when you are soaking wet for two days it just makes things more difficult
3186473 but its all worth it you got to do what it takes
3186474 this is such a wonderful chance to learn so much about these species

3186493 sadly trophy jaws and teeth from sharks are relatively commonplace whereas living sharks are becoming increasingly rare
3186494 this method allows information locked away within the teeth and jaws to be exploited to assist with conservation management
3186495 sharks have continual turnover of dentition throughout their lifespan and consequently teeth may be collected from the seafloor in areas where sharks aggregate without the need to use invasive sampling methods such as biopsy
3186496 these data support our hunch that low genetic variation in grey nurse shark is probably due to longer term processes than the recent human induced population crash
3186497 its not going to replace biopsy but it is going to be useful for looking at past specimens
3186498 we also have plans to use approaches like this to identify rogue individuals
3186499 we know very little about how these animals are using the oceans
3186500 and without knowing a bit more about the genetics of these animals we cant legislate properly for conservation

3186519 the georgian government has proposed a cease fire and the russian government should accept it
3186520 a necessary first step to resolving the crisis we cannot tolerate the unacceptable status quo that led to this escalation that means russian peacekeeping troops should be replaced by a genuine international peacekeeping force georgia should refrain from using force in south ossetia and abkhazia and a political settlement must be reached that addresses the status of these disputed regions

3186552 the foundation for our success will be our ability to create a culture at crown point national bank proposed that values and rewards seasoned bankers with demonstrated track records of successfully servicing the distinct needs of small and middle market businesses in our markets
3186553 the breadth and depth of management experience are among the strengths of this organization as a team we share experiences related to the central oregon and portland markets and the nature of our client base starting an institution from the ground up with bankers who are intimately familiar with the local markets allows us to offer clients and the marketplace the best of many worlds

3186564 following the slightly weaker first quarter and macro economic concerns silicon shipments grew more than 6 in q2 which is in line with normal seasonality for the quarter particularly with the start of a new fiscal year for most japanese companies
3186565 during the past 90 days weve focused our efforts on aligning revenues with expenses and have taken steps to significantly streamline our operations weve also begun to put in place a go to market strategy aimed at streamlining our product offering and growing our market share in the key industries we serve this market driven sales strategy should enable us to be more competitive by industry and ultimately more successful penetrating multiple markets such as business to employee business to business business to consumer and government to citizen
3186566 im also proud to say that we continue to assemble a truly world class management team with the recent addition of our new cfo coo mr jacques kerrest mr kerrest brings a wealth of financial and operating experience to the team and coupled with our board of directors who collectively have deep industry experience we are all focused and quite passionate about our prospects for success we also have a number of exciting initiatives underway that will enable us to capitalize on the growing market opportunity for identity assurance
3186567 obviously we are very pleased with the companys strong earnings thus far in 2008 and particularly in the second quarter
3186568 as was announced at the time the membership of usw local 11 0001 which represents union employees at the east boulder mine ratified a new four year labor agreement on july 8 2008 without experiencing any labor interruption
3186569 at june 30 2008 the last of our outstanding forward sales commitments covering a substantial portion of our mined platinum production finally settled out the company entered into these forward sales commitments several years ago in order to protect the company against a decline in platinum prices while we were spending heavily to re establish the developed state of the mines as the price of platinum continued to rise though they have cost us substantially over the past couple of years losses on these forward hedging transactions reduced our sales revenues by 5 8 million in the second quarter and 12 8 million in the first half of 2008 at present we have no plans for any further hedging of our mine production
3186570 mine production in this years second quarter at 126 200 ounces was a little below last years second quarter production
3186571 the companys total cash costs per pgm ounce produced 1 averaged 394 in the second quarter of 2008 quite a bit higher than the 320 per ounce in last years second quarter more than half of this increase was attributable to higher operating costs particularly for power and contractor services and the remainder to lower mine production in the second quarter of 2008 compared to last years second quarter our initial guidance for 2008 full year total cash costs was between 355 and 375 per ounce in view of our reduced production forecast for 2008 along with record high energy prices we have revised our earlier guidance for 2008 total cash costs we now believe total cash costs for 2008 will fall in the range of 380 to 395 per ounce
3186572 operationally progress continues on our mine transformation efforts safety and environmental performance continued strong during the quarter we have implemented recommendations from a third party safety audit conducted during the first quarter that are intended to help drive our incident rates toward zero construction is now under way on the second smelter furnace in columbus it should be fully operational by the end of 2008 or early in 2009 as noted last quarter we believe this furnace once in operation will increase our processing capacity and provide a strategically critical back up facility during scheduled or unscheduled furnace outages total production from selective mining methods at the stillwater mine was at 86 of the new mill feed while east boulder averaged only 56 at this time we do not expect any significant change in these levels due to the tight labor markets we are currently seeing in the mining industry along with these tight markets for seasoned miners we are renewing our focus on how we can improve and accelerate our existing miner training efforts
3186573 another of stillwaters corporate objectives is to foster new market demand for its primary products
3186574 we also are working toward diversifying the companys asset base
3186575 as i have commented before these investments in generative exploration projects are inherently long term and fairly speculative in nature but are intended to give us access to seasoned exploration teams and build a portfolio of attractive opportunities for the future we also actively track various later stage mineral development projects and operating properties to identify those that might offer good investment value and mesh with stillwaters corporate expertise we are proceeding deliberately in these growth and diversification efforts
3186576 although the 2008 financial results to date are very gratifying we still have a lot on our plate and remain focused on adding value to stillwater over the longer term
3186577 the only thing i can compare it to is expo 86 its going to be the most memorable event ive ever attended

3186580 there is no question that georgia started this conflict with an offensive against the separatists of south ossetia because its entry to nato required a resolution to the problem but the disproportiate and continuing military attacks by russia appears to have united the european union and the u s in a call for the removal of russian troops
3186581 the fighting has now created a major refugee crisis that is spilling over to regional states
3186582 and a political crisis with fears that russia is trying to overthrow the democratically elected pro western government of georgia
3186583 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that
3186584 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3186585 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed 10 ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3186586 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3186587 i deeply deeply apologize to the court and to all those ive affected by my conduct
3186588 even though the jury acquitted me of these charges in less than three hours my political opponents and some of the news media would likely spend the next several months vilifying me further

3186592 danny obrien on copying and attribution in a digital age
3186593 it is no surprise this is happening as returns on land are generally equal to or higher than returns on bricks and mortar and come with a much lower entry level price indeed land prices in natal are forecast to go up by 15 25 per annum based on current market trends
3186594 there is plenty of cheap land available in brazil some in the middle of nowhere that is being marketed as a good investment several of these plots are classed as rustic land not buildable at present and consequently do not have utilities power and water and infrastructure roads
3186595 purchases in such land should be considered as high risk and purely speculative on the basis that one day they might get urbanised and the promoter might actually implement the infrastructure required
3186596 which is why the land is marketed cheaply by european standards even with the very healthy margins build into the sales price
3186597 the location of plots and property is critical to maximising the investment potential
3186598 infrastructure services such as power and water have already been installed and the roads will be complete within the next three six months

3186622 saakashvili the great democrat is busy charging anyone who opposes him with being a pawn of the russians and therefore guilty of treason but the west is calling on him to restore civil liberties and in an apparent effort to propitiate his western benefactors he has lifted new elections widespread and growing opposition to his strong arm tactics even among many of his former supporters spells political trouble for saakashvili and his corrupt cohorts however and an appeal to georgian ultra nationalism which was always the real ideological motivation of the rose revolutionaries would bolster him in the polls and provide a much needed distraction at least from the ruling partys point of view
3186623 it seems to me that the georgians under estimated the ferocity of the russian reaction and over estimated the support they would get from the west
3186624 first let us disabuse ourselves from the notion that mr saakashvili is some glorious democrat the election he barely won in january included irregularities and there continues to be endemic corruption in tblisi second let us recall that many south ossetians and abkhazians are not particularly keen to live under tbilisis yoke indeed some prefer russian influence to predominate there for the time being third if there is any truth to russian allegations that there are some 1 500 fatalities in the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali and they were caused by a major initial over reach by the georgian military we will need to wait for more details to emerge expect many more brutish bombardments like the russians apparently have conducted in the georgian town of gori alas
3186625 watching and reading u s media coverage about the russian georgian conflict is almost comical u s media are just puzzled over russian arguments about its vital interests in its neighbor to the south the u s of course can go all the way to iraq and afghanistan and not feel the need to justify arguments about vital interests thousands of miles away from the homeland
3186626 its a very clear message to the insurgents that there will be no other chance
3186627 i came in the boot of a car georgian snipers were firing at us from the forest my brother stayed to fight our grandparents home was reduced to rubble we dont know where they are nothing is left of their village it was totally destroyed by rockets and tank fire

3186677 viread will be an important new treatment option and its approval represents a significant step forward in the fight against chronic hepatitis b
3186678 the approval of viread for hepatitis b represents more than a decade of work in both the fields of hiv and hepatitis b to develop a medication that offers significant viral suppression once daily dosing and a well established safety profile
3186679 we extend our thanks to the investigators and patients who participated in the clinical trials that support todays approval and we look forward to partnering with community members to increase disease awareness and expand access to treatment for those patients in need
3186680 although weve made great strides in reducing the overall incidence of chronic hepatitis b in the united states the disease still takes a devastating toll in asian american communities
3186681 greater public awareness and effective new treatment options are urgently needed to help reduce this significant health disparity
3186682 we continue to advance our goals to lower the relative cost of leverage over time for our funds and provide liquidity at par for preferred shareholders
3186683 while we are pleased to be making steady progress we share the sense of urgency felt by many investors and recognize that much work remains to be done one of the most encouraging developments to date has been the successful issuance of the first variable rate demand preferred shares as we announced early on we believe this new security will be a critical element for being able to address the industrys arps refinancing challenge
3186684 the initial launch of the vrdp initiative is a very significant milestone in arps refinancing as we forge ahead on behalf of investors
3186685 we look forward to building on this progress by expanding it to more municipal funds and potentially using vrdp to refinance arps issued by taxable funds
3186686 although under current market conditions the amount of tobs our funds can create are in many cases quite limited tobs can still play an important role in our plans to manage fund leverage costs and provide liquidity to arps shareholders
3186687 we expected the arps refinancing facility for these funds to be in place by mid july and the arps redemptions to be completed in august
3186688 we are disappointed that the refinancing process has taken longer than anticipated we now estimate the refinancing facility for these four funds to be in place later this month and the arps redemptions to be completed in september however the funds ability to finalize the refinancing facility is still not certain and this revised timetable is subject to further change due to market conditions and other factors including the completion of final documentation for the debt financing arranged by the funds
3186689 we continue to pursue financing options to address the remaining preferred shares for these funds
3186690 the hospitals fully respect the right of our employees to select union representation or to remain independent both the law and fairness requires this national labor relations board election
3186691 we remain committed to providing our formerly represented employees with factual information so that they can make the best informed decision about what is right for them

3186693 we encourage attendees to stop by our partner booths to experience the true performance of pcoip technology through a live demonstration seeing is believing
3186694 californias history can and has been written as successive battles over water waged both within the state and with surrounding states and mexico israel jordan and the palestinian authority are waging similar battles attempting to resolve their problems of scarcity drought and allocation in the middle of a politically tense region
3186695 in many ways these two regions that are on opposite ends of the planet have very similar problems yet it seems there are distinct differences in how california and the middle east attempt to find solutions our hope is that our experiences from the middle east may have relevance to similar issues in the western united states
3186696 we are all incredibly aware of the environmental issues facing southern california and the western states and how much more challenging the situation becomes when multiple municipalities states or even countries are involved
3186697 imagine then how difficult the situation must be in the middle east where environmental challenges demand cooperation not only from neighbors but from historic enemies
3186698 we are finding that time and time again the cooperation that emerges during our studies is a much more effective means to reduce tensions and secure meaningful environmental gains than are more formal approaches
3186699 bilateral agreements are most often used to resolve conflicts but the soft approach of compliance relies on good relations between the diverse parties and leads to more effective longer lasting resolutions
3186700 the arava institutes operating vision is that the environment knows no borders the institute realizes that one cant wait for peace in a region to deal with the many environmental challenges we face on the other hand our work in the environmental field also lays the groundwork for political and economic security and stability in our region
3186701 we hope our seminars and the sharing of lessons we have learned in the middle east can help the western united states
3186702 you make me feel like everythings normal even in this environment
3186703 i dont feel the need to see anyone except mia

3186707 his nails are even filthier than those of scee boss david reeves
3186708 if at first you dont succeed call it version 1 0
3186709 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3186710 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3186711 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3186712 our little sarah has gone from us but she will live in our hearts forever and will always be remembered as sarah our little princess
3186713 i cant think of words to say it was fantastic and a lovely turnout
3186714 contrary to published reports those impacted were distributed across our organization rather than focused on a single department also contrary to published reports the layoffs were unrelated to any ongoing discussions to divest a portion of our business that claim is irresponsible journalism and outright false
3186715 we never had such an agreement all we said in march was we were cooperating with bittorrent on doing tests on how we deliver peer to peer content on our network and to find out if there was a more efficient way to deliver those bits given that p2p hasnt always been as efficient running over networks as it could be
3186716 it does hurt them and they are still competing with what is largely a traditional distribution market cable satellite or dsl and we still live in a world of good enough if i can get through a set top box get most of what i want why set up a bittorrent hub
3186717 transformed a week before publication to make it sexier a classic was the 45 minutes
3186718 most people in intelligence werent happy with it because it didnt reflect the considered view they were putting forward
3186719 the story was a good piece of investigative journalism marred by flawed reporting our biggest millstone has been his andrew gilligans loose use of language and lack of judgement in some of the phraseology
3186720 todays happenings are abnormal it seems likely that somehow or other a master key has been obtained which allowed these people to effect a simple entry to the prison after scaling the wall
3186721 this is so abnormal that you just cannot cater for it
3186722 i dont see how you can make it stick without the poppy money and you wont find that
3186723 we do not know whether he was killed but we fear he may have been
3186724 this shows yet again that the situation is extremely dangerous and the iraqis are continuing to behave in a ruthless and barbarous way
3186725 people should keep their heads down and stay where they are
3186726 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3186727 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3186728 this is a great software it is however overloaded with features i can think of nobody who would ever use all of them recent versions have become somewhat bloated and slow
3186729 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3186730 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3186731 if you had to pick one thing to make people healthier as they age it would be aerobic exercise
3186732 the health benefits of exercise are greater than we thought
3186733 theyre scared you know they worry about that you know because no one wants the war because we want to live in friendship and peace
3186734 as far as geopolitics yea georgia is an outpost of pro western very pro american up until lately very pro american opinion
3186735 i think that is certainly true they remember the great days when there were 2 superpowers
3186736 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3186737 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3186738 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3186739 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3186740 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3186741 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3186742 any of the campaigns that would have tried to push that would have been burned by it
3186743 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3186744 i thought it was right at the time in hindsight given the 22 per cent swing it was obviously the wrong thing to do
3186745 i do believe in giving people another go but in terms of the public office that we hold and were entrusted i think the message from the electorate is they wont tolerate the sort of behaviour and if it happens again there will be a different decision from me as chief minister
3186746 lets look at the result ive got to get out there and work thats what the most important thing for me is being a good local member in parap fannie bay and stuart park nothing else you can take for granted youve just got to get out there and work
3186747 if im given the nod whether thats tomorrow or friday or next week ill get back out there and knock those doors
3186748 when there are any announcements that i am able to make about the way forward i will make them as soon as i am able
3186749 if it is intending to re purchase the assets of bell bay then we need to see the business case
3186750 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3186751 and sara sorry but this is strange to me if she has a condition such as ocd she has my sympathy but her habit of protecting the seat next and only relinquinshing it as a final resort and closing windowns that others want open has erased a lot of that sympathy from me
3186752 wow so you lose all pity for someone when their disorder reaches even more bizarre heights so only people with a small level of their disorder deserve your sympathy interesting
3186753 hey show up at this time and watch the strange woman

3186763 mccain has been able to score political points on energy issues in recent weeks particularly in swing states such as michigan
3186764 accusing john mccain of having a do nothing track record on energy
3186765 obama has offered clinton a prime time speech but she says her supporters want to place her name in nomination to let off steam
3186766 on a web chat today clinton was asked if she was truly supporting obama or just saying what she has to
3186767 i look at that and i see an angry resentful guy

3186774 nadie puede obligar a romero barcel a firmar relevos porque es un asunto dirigido a su intimidad

3186783 someone smashed one of the alarm call points after a big night out
3186784 we know exactly who it was and the guest has been charged 1500 for the call out fee and to fix the call point
3186785 it was a fairly big stuff up by the guest and when she was asked why she did it she said she had no idea and she was upset and disappointed with herself she left next day
3186786 we were about 75 per cent full so thats about 200 people and we aim to get everyone out in about three minutes

3186793 to be in prison for 18 years for something you didnt do and then know you are going to walk out of court a free man thats a lot to take in in one day
3186794 i believe that there are others in prison like me and then there are others in prison who are guilty youve got to give it a chance to work
3186795 somebody made that decision to not feed that child and my daughter had to follow instructions
3186796 of course if we feel the rule has been breached we will invoke it
3186797 we will not turn a blind eye to issues of a serious nature it is quite a complex matter and we cant just make a judgment on the spot but clearly we have a club owner who has not yet been found guilty of any offense
3186798 we are not experts in law in every country so it is wise to speak with the people who are
3186799 we would anticipate that he would be very strong for us toward the end of the year but a lot remains to be seen
3186800 he hasnt shown any indication of wilting and hes worked to stay strong all summer so thats a good sign
3186801 jose is gaining experience every day and doing a good job now and sometimes young talent without experience outplays veteran talent with experience just with stuff you have to be in tune with that also
3186802 jose doesnt have a lot of experience but his stuff is electric and in every situation hes done a good job
3186803 when i would get into a slump i think i tried too hard to get out of it instead of just trusting my stuff
3186804 that was definitely something i learned last year and it helped out in regaining my form pretty quick after that
3186805 you hit me ill hit you even if it doesnt look like hes eaten in a while
3186806 the experience against zone defense will prepare us for our upcoming games against greece and spain in pool play and even some of the teams in the other bracket down the road like lithuania i think in this tournament we are going to see zone a lot
3186807 but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3186808 getting a veteran that may slip through the waiver process may look good on paper create a buzz for the fans and make it look like were trying to fill the spot
3186809 if we dont really believe that that will translate into success in this ballpark and thats very key in this ballpark then it doesnt make sense to do it
3186810 youre better off bringing someone that has been trained specifically in our minor league system major league spring training has gotten experience in the ballpark

3186876 democratic limits on the power of the penal system reforms of public security and penal justice
3186877 counter reform is authoritarian it undermines human rights and is aimed at scaling back guarantees that were seen as excessive

3186981 for the majority on benefits it will be clear that state support should be only temporary those with drug problems will be offered places on treatment programmes but will have to attend them

3187016 practitioners feel trapped in a culture where measuring clinical activity is the priority

3187043 y no s lo estamos hablando de los antibi ticos sino de otros muchos agentes presentes en la poluci n qu mica del ambiente que son t xicos para cualquier organismo vivo y por tanto tambi n para los microorganismos que se ven forzados a ese proceso evolutivo

3187195 i know ill write one huge installer for all 4 application components including the database install in wix
3187196 oh yah i guess i missed that you know since i built the whole script and im really busy im going to need you to go fix those icon issues
3187197 wait until qa sees this theyre going to be mad enough when they realize they agreed to a few simple things like icon changes and they find out its wix but when they see how long this thing is hahahahahahahahahahaha
3187198 ok ive done this 100 times ill just start over from scratch
3187199 as barack obama has said this is not our convention this is americas convention
3187200 and now at a critical moment in our history americans will have their concerns addressed challenges listened to and their questions answered live by our countrys leaders we want americans to be at the center of this convention and americas town hall will allow us to do just that
3187201 with the four teams from the afc north providing the cross conference competition this year the eagles have about as balanced a schedule as you could have playing in the tough nfc east they never play two home games in a row they play consecutive games on the road only twice an afc north swing to cincinnati and baltimore just 90 minutes away in november there isnt a stretch on the schedule that scares you but theyd better be in good playoff position come december philly is at the giants home for a monday nighter with cleveland at washington and home with dallas to close the season
3187202 ill go back and take over command of all of iraq
3187203 im looking forward to it it will be a challenge but were making a lot of progress im encouraged by what general petraeus has done i hope to just take on what he has done and move forward with it
3187204 the general is on his way back to iraq in september and he is a great giants fan
3187205 he has been out on the field with us in the spring a couple of years ago he wrote a very nice inspirational letter which talked about team first as you would imagine back last summer when we first came into camp here i thought he had already gone back to iraq a call came in that he wanted to come up to camp one day and he got a chance to come we are honored to have him here he is very special
3187206 the only other thing that i would say to you is that i kind of thought a lot about this team being a big giants fan
3187207 im very proud of what you all accomplished last year about 18 months ago when i took over as commander in iraq nobody gave us a chance to do well there are still a lot of non believers out there who dont believe that weve done a good job over there and my guess is that there are still a lot of non believers about this team they dont think that youre worthy of what youve accomplished and i would just tell you to stick together work your butt off and shove it up their butt what makes this group so special is that youre a team first you care about each other first and if you do that you will always be successful so good luck to you god bless you it has been an honor to be out here with you today
3187208 he used the analogy of the soldiers for when our guys are struggling out here and think it is hot it is 120 degrees in iraq and they are wearing a hundred pounds worth of gear they are out there for four and five hours at a time im sure that analogy struck home with the guys you are talking about the end of that long first week of camp so the legs are a little heavy and weary but the troops are staying out there and hanging in there we make small gains every day and in football we need everybody to be on the same page we still have some mental errors that are going on that have got to be corrected that will come around
3187209 we have a little time off so i wanted to come up and have a chance to see training camp
3187210 we were up here two three years ago and its a really great time to come up
3187211 its always about teamwork always about being able to depend on each other the guys on either side of you
3187212 in a business like this its a physically tough game and youve got to depend on each other in order to be successful you cant do it by yourself
3187213 and i think that in a lot of the cases people dont always believe or quite understand what the giants did i think that whats happening in iraq people dont always quite believe whats happening over there and i think some people are not quite believers of the giants i think that this is a good year to prove them wrong
3187214 his words sat in my belly because ive lived that
3187215 these young kids start at 18 years old fighting for our freedoms here in our country
3187216 i felt much more attracted to women and just felt like a man but i knew i was not lesbian
3187217 if todays athletes say they want to take the risk they really dont know what risk they are taking
3187218 happily ever after is a visually inventive and engrossing comedy that makes you feel warm despite its depiction of a series of unluckiness and failures in life
3187219 this is not a story about an unhappy marriage but about a journey of reuniting twin souls overcoming successive hardships and problems with laughter we are very pleased to present this unconventional love story to theatrical audiences
3187220 what the obama campaign has lost sight of i think and what it needs to regain control of is the essential message of his candidacy after the last eight years we simply cannot risk a continuation of the same reckless belligerent argument losing ideological and deceptive foreign policy of the current crew the damage that neoconservatism has done to america to the middle east to democratic norms to israels security to civilized values and fiscal sanity is immense and deep from his knee jerk cold war posture over georgia to his rovian campaign tactics mccain is simply too close to this disastrous record to contemplate mccains trigger happy temperament shallow understanding of the complexities and passion for military force as the answer to everything is the bigger risk
3187221 she is unique shes a character shes colorful and shes not afraid to speak her mind i dont think wed have her any other way

3187223 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe
3187224 let me be clear we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people
3187225 we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century not regression to the conflicts of the past
3187226 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
3187227 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
3187228 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
3187229 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate cease fire
3187230 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
3187231 the group of eight highly industrialized states becomes again a club of leading market democracies
3187232 it is always in our interests to engage to listen to build alliances to understand what our interests are and to be fierce in protecting those interests
3187233 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3187234 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3187235 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3187236 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3187237 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3187238 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3187239 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3187240 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3187241 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3187242 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3187243 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3187244 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3187245 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3187246 i cant even walk without you holding my hand the mountains too high and the valleys too wide down on my knees thats where i learned to stand and i cant even walk without you holding my hand

3187274 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 ratificado por ley no 1257 y actualmente la declaraci n de las naciones unidas ratificada por ley no 3760 esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas

3187294 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones

3187303 the forest department has been dragging its feet ostensibly to secure local witnesses which is not possible as the project site is overrun with labourers and company employees none of whom are residents of sikkim
3187304 the veterinarian found a blood clot in the brain and concluded that the animal had eaten cardboard and plastic sheets lying around in the construction site and had died because of the resultant respiratory problems
3187305 the chief wildlife warden has convened a meeting on the issue tomorrow in any case the death of the animal was accidental as it ranges freely in the mountains
3187306 this is a figment of their imagination as the site falls within the buffer zone of the kanchenjunga biosphere reserve despite this the chief wildlife warden issued a no objection certificate to the company carrying out the work on the 1 200mw hydel plant
3187307 it is very surprising that no forest department official was present during the public hearing of the eia and the emp they were only interested in securing the money that the company had to pay for afforestation and plantation in some other area now we have a schedule i animal protected under the wildlife protection act dead in the project side and no one is held accountable

3187315 we had to refrain from holding any political activity apprehending further oppression the issue will be discussed at the meeting and we will seek the chief minister as well as the state governments intervention
3187316 we informed the administration and although there were some interventions we continue to face the same problem no steps were taken against morcha supporters and leaders for confining or threatening us and our families as the state government has taken the stance to remain silent and wait for the tripartite meeting on the hills
3187317 we will raise this point as well mentioning our plight
3187318 the acquisitions will come as a jolt to the party and can create confusion among hill people who are still with us the morcha is trying to employ the same tactics on us as they did on the gnlf they laid siege to gnlf offices and their homes prompting some prominent faces from subash ghisinghs party to leave for siliguri even ghisingh was forced to come down

3187337 the challenge for me is to be part of a team that wins the european cup
3187338 we did it again last season after nine years weve never won it two years on the trot so i think the most important thing for us now is to step up to the plate again this season
3187339 whether weve won two three four trophies or none weve always been able to wipe out whats happened the previous season
3187340 ive never felt that im never going to play again but i think i can understand why people would say that and question it
3187341 you have moments when you think when are these injuries going to clear up i just came back too late last season to be honest with you and the players were playing too well
3187342 the competition for places throughout the team is fantastic as there are probably two or three players who can play in each position
3187343 im not nervous at all about the new season im excited and looking forward to it at this club it is a continuous challenge but for me personally this year after being out so long there are a number of challenges in front of me
3187344 i want to thrive on the fact that ive obviously not got a great deal of time left in my career im coming to 34 years of age so im going to enjoy it as much as i can
3187345 i think the players interchanging and the way in which they do is different than united teams ive played in the past
3187346 but we also need a bigger squad to finish seventh sixth fifth in the league
3187347 if we sign a few more players we will be a stronger team then we will have no choice but to try to finish higher and i feel we can do that
3187348 when you see the top four you see not just the best players in england but also some of the best players in the world
3187349 one of the main reasons they can get them is money what they can spend in transfer fees and in wages
3187350 they also have the biggest squads you need to compete successfully in four competitions we have great players in the squad but we would welcome more
3187351 were a bit behind in bringing in players were finding it hard to get the people we want
3187352 weve got gaps that we need to fill with quality signings
3187353 however were not the sort of club who can go out and spend an absolute fortune on certain players only to find theyre not suited to us i cant then go back and ask for more money
3187354 and im not one to throw caution to the wind and sign 10 or 11 players i have to be careful with the chairmans money
3187355 id been warned by other managers that it would be very difficult and that players would shun us
3187356 but the transfer situation is getting a bit looser as we approach the window weve got money to spend its just finding the right ones
3187357 dave had the opportunity after wed spoken to him to go to a much bigger club and make more money but he kept his word to us which shows what type of lad he is
3187358 like derby weve just been promoted after being out of the top division for a long time
3187359 we wont have the strongest squad in the premier league either but i believe this team will have more resilience and character well be judged at the end of the season but for the now the sole priority is survival its a challenge and one we can overcome
3187360 the morale here last season was fantastic no cliques so you have to be careful who you bring in you dont want any bad eggs who disrupt everything because camaraderie is very important the players the manager has brought in are down to earth people that can only help us
3187361 being totally honest i thought promotion would probably be too good to be true
3187362 speaking to the manager and chairman peter coates i thought fantastic yes we can do it but part of me was saying these things just dont happen to stoke city
3187363 but more money was made available and that equals better players portsmouth one of my old clubs have been able to go up to another level because they can pay 7 million for a player and better wages
3187364 i dont see why portsmouth cant be a role model for stoke we can try to copy their pattern of stabilising themselves in the premier league
3187365 previous attempts to find better ways of encouraging skin cell growth have used chemical additives and other elaborate techniques to produce scaffolds but their success has been limited weve found that skin cells are actually very smart its in their dna to sort themselves into the right arrangement they just need a comparatively uncomplicated scaffold and each other to help them grow in a safe natural way
3187366 ultimately we can envisage treatment of burns victims and the undertaking of reconstructive surgery using the scaffold and the patients own skin to produce bespoke skin for that patient
3187367 as an accident prone mountain biker i find that prospect very attractive
3187368 weve shown the pronghorns know the benefit of selecting the best males
3187369 now were trying to show whether females can balance the cost benefits of selecting a strong male versus a closely related one will they accept mating with a relative if the projected cost of inbreeding is not too high or reject the male because the cost is way off the chart or will they breed without any regard to genealogy
3187370 i realized we were going to be in an incredibly interesting position
3187371 we now know females select males for their vigor with a real benefit in survival for their offspring but today about three years after the weather caused a bottleneck in the population theyre faced with a different set of choices
3187372 i think theyll be able to discern the best choice
3187373 but the gap between the married and never married is closing especially for men
3187374 politicians and scholars continue to debate the value of marriage for americans
3187375 with some going so far as to establish social programs and policies to encourage marriage among those socials groups less inclined to marry particularly the poor and minorities
3187376 encouraging marriage in order to promote health may be misguided
3187377 we are starting to roll out a fix now and hope to have the problem resolved as quickly as possible

3187379 anyone who saw the bbc2 programme must have been inspired by the enthusiasm and compassion of the two christian youth workers who pioneered the romance academy
3187380 basically they took a group of 12 young people and encouraged them and built up their self esteem while they looked at issues of what constitutes a good relationship they were encouraged to avoid having sex for the four months while they were on the academy
3187381 we believe it is an exciting opportunity to positively influence the lives of young people by challenging them to question the messages that society throws at them and helping them realise their value and worth

3187438 we aim to show that the protection mechanisms in windows vista are particularly ineffective for preventing the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities in browsers
3187439 since real world exploitation requires bypassing multiple memory protections we will present several ways in which these techniques can be combined to achieve remote code execution

3187441 we aim to show that the protection mechanisms in windows vista are particularly ineffective for preventing the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities in browsers
3187442 the design and implementation of the memory protection mechanisms in windows have a number of limitations that reduce their effectiveness
3187443 in this paper we demonstrated that the memory protection mechanisms available in the latest versions of windows are not always effective when it comes to preventing the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities in browsers they raise the bar but the attacker still has a good chance of being able to bypass them

3187458 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at his wife rhonda
3187459 she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
3187460 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
3187461 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
3187462 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3187463 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3187464 he represented a kind of hood attitude and cultural phenomenon that was under exploited in america but had great potential
3187465 he was always honest and that honesty was what he exuded and what made him so great
3187466 its a terrible loss i mean you need funny in your life at all times he was definitely one who brought it one of the best comedians ive ever really experienced and condolences go out to everyone in his family
3187467 bernie is just ridiculous with it or he was so god bless his family god bless his soul but bernie was that dude for real so rest in peace man
3187468 not like the writers and producers at motown or quincy jones but he was on that level in my opinion
3187469 he gave me my voice he taught me showed me and nurtured my voice he didnt teach me how to sing he taught me how to be a better singer that was isaac
3187470 he didnt have a choreographer he didnt have a show
3187471 isaac would just get up there and sit down and become one with the song he was doing and you would look out and the women would be hanging on every word it made me wish my voice was that deep
3187472 i met isaac hayes when i was on the road with james brown in the 70s
3187473 we played a few festivals together in my later years i got to know the man behind the music he was the first official black man to be known as a real rapper and he had nothing but praise for his queens and women of the world
3187474 hayes was so musically advanced and timeless in his compositions he was loved and appreciated by so many he was an enduring symbol of the struggle of the african american man and was a shining example of soul at its best
3187475 although he was under the weather he was still performing
3187476 he was the man he had the show must go on spirit in his absence he will be remembered through his great music he will forever be in our hearts and souls
3187477 i am deeply saddened by the loss of isaac hayes a true historic world music figure
3187478 isaac hayes was the first african american to win an oscar for a music score but never lost sight of his commitment to his community and the betterment of mankind he was more than an artist he was a trailblazer he was an innovator
3187479 i tried to be as real as i possibly could
3187480 and i keyed in on the character shaft the character himself
3187481 i think the songs out there today when the kids talk about romance i think theyre too blatant they dont leave enough for the imagination
3187482 i like to use metaphors thats right and take it slow and easy and then build its kind of like foreplay you dont want to get there too soon else its all over its like eating candy just gobbling it down and then i want some more and its gone you have to savor it

3187485 we do anything for our fans and we owe everything we have to them
3187486 we cant tell what were performing but it will be our second single
3187487 for the last three or four summers weve been going over to europe and doing all the festivals and it looks like we just totally ignored our fans in america but thats not the case as a consequence the american fans miss us and they want their metallica so this will be a good homecoming for them and us
3187488 we were talking to lars and he goes were going to take you guys on tour
3187489 warped tour was great but we cant wait to get back into venues that actually have roofs over our heads and arent 110 degrees

3187516 i think its very important for them to have a sense of belonging in a community its not just going and visiting a particular place its actually getting to know people
3187517 its not just going and visiting a particular place its actually getting to know people a good example is were doing a food drive and at the end of the month were going to be giving that donated food back to the food bank so they really see the benefit of what they do in the community
3187518 everybodys here to have fun so when theres a birthday or a special event like today we let people kind of pick out what they want to do

3187520 i think throughout the state of ohio there are many different types of programs i think people need to realize not all programs can cover everything that there is
3187521 its great when a private organization like goodwill easter seals steps up and covers some of these niche type needs in the community you see a smaller organization or smaller set up like we have here you can really see the good that it does
3187522 this population is one that has a difficult time getting high quality services as you saw today which was kind of exciting for me was how much fun they were having
3187523 part of it is respite care for their primary caregiver where they can have a place to go and have something to do during the day the other part of it is the quality of the interaction and quality of the care
3187524 since she started here theres just been so much good that has happened
3187525 she just gets to do so much and has such great interactions with people
3187526 its very enjoyable this whole program is a different activity every day like friday were going to the air force museum in dayton
3187527 those are the kind of activities we do some days we might be in house like today celebrating someones birthday its just different activities every day

3187672 im not sure i think theyve got their own reasons why they need to talk about things i just do my job and be quiet
3187673 to be honest thats the first time i ever heard that from either of those guys but any time anybody says something about guys on this team you take offense to it
3187674 bobby wade came here and developed got better and if he hadnt developed and gotten better the titans wouldnt have wanted him minnesota wouldnt have wanted him justin gage the same way if he hadnt have come here and gotten better he wouldnt have gone to tennessee and gotten 15 million or 16 million bernard berrian if he hadnt developed wouldnt have got 42 million with minnesota
3187675 i think one of the things that happened was the emergence of bernard he had to share some things there his role probably changed from what he was accustomed to
3187676 but we know we need to make a decision so we can start getting the timing and everything else going
3187677 we are meeting in the brewery in a few minutes
3187678 we tried everything we could think of to contact the city government through the communications and computer systems we have access to
3187679 what happened was we were warned not to make contact with the city and just to mind our own business the city will contact us when we are ready to become citizens we are not part of the city yet and have no legal rights until we complete our training and become citizens
3187680 these messages were prominently displayed on each air sled monitor screen and on the computers at home base no one even thought to come to us in person to explain or hear our concerns
3187681 this did not sit well with the council of elders especially since the arrest and questioning of the five of us that had been sent to the village we were released but the council of elders now realized someone thought they had the power to arrest clansmen anytime they wanted and hold them without cause they believed this same someone was responsible for the rogue attacks the council wants to know why these things are happening and if they are happening with the approval of the city
3187682 the final decision was that the same five delegates would journey on air sleds to sanctuary and then cross the wall into the city we would find a place with lots of people and set our sleds down and wait for the authorities we would probably be arrested but the city itself was populated with clansmen we were counting on that bond of kinsmanship to get a fair hearing
3187683 i was the first to go across the wall and land my air sleds in a central area the others followed me in even before we had landed a crowd of people appeared wondering what was going on i called out that there was an emergency and one of the citizens nodded and started talking on her cell phone several of the others were also on cell phones it was a matter of minutes before authorities arrived and put us on some type of air transport we were not arrested or treated as prisoners but we certainly were not given any choice about things either
3187684 they took us down to the police station where we gave our statements
3187685 it was obvious that the persons involved wanted no part of this and were way over their heads they passed us on to the mayor who listened and then called an emergency session of the city council this was against the strong opposition of someone wearing a federation military uniform i gathered this uniformed person was the representative of the mountain complex and the ones that had arrested us
3187686 and with grim determination i faced the city council and told our story of being arrested and questioned about the massacre at the lake and the mass grave how it was a forbidden area i told them about the rogue attacks that were centered around the lake itself and the attempt to make it seem the village was responsible for those attacks then i told them that was impossible because the rogues have some way of tracking anyone that has med alert bracelets and are able to hide in a way that the villagers cant i told them of the rumors the city was going to lead an attack on the village several members of the city council looked at each other quickly and at least a couple had red faces

3187719 we dont believe we are in a position to wait much longer for resolution of this question
3187720 your concept would not only require stopping pay but also issuing minimum wage payments and determining the appropriate treatment of multiple deductions for each employee
3187721 then after the budget is passed we would need to restore full pay and again determine the appropriate level of deductions offsetting the prior adjustments
3187722 implementing system changes of the magnitude needed to accurately pay each employee should not be taken lightly
3187723 if they are not performed thoughtfully and accurately the system changes could subject the state to further litigation and unnecessary costs

3187740 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3187741 you know the truth is that right after 9 11 i had a pin shortly after 9 11 particularly because as were talking about the iraq war that became a substitute for i think true patriotism which is speaking out on issues that are of importance to our national security i decided i wont wear that pin on my chest
3187742 sometimes i wear a tie sometimes i dont sometimes i wear a flag pin sometimes i dont
3187743 i have already condemned in unequivocal terms the statements of reverend wright that have caused such controversy but the truth is that isnt all that i know of the man the man i met more than twenty years ago is a man who helped introduce me to my christian faith a man who spoke to me about our obligations to love one another to care for the sick and lift up the poor i can no more disown him than i can disown the black community
3187744 i gave him the benefit of the doubt in my speech in philadelphia but when he states and then amplifies such ridiculous propositions as the u s government somehow being involved in aids when he suggests that minister farrakhan somehow represents one of the greatest voices of the 20th and 21st centuries when he equates the united states wartime efforts with terrorism then there are no excuses and i want to be very clear that moving forward reverend wright does not speak for me
3187745 i do not believe that setting a date certain for the total withdrawal of u s troops is the best approach what is needed is a blueprint for an expeditious yet responsible exit from iraq a hard and fast arbitrary deadline for withdrawal offers our commanders in the field and our diplomats in the region insufficient flexibility to implement that strategy
3187746 t oday im introducing the iraq war de escalation act of 2007 it would begin a phased redeployment of u s forces with the goal of removing of all u s combat forces from iraq by march 31st 2008 my plan allows for a limited number of u s troops to remain as basic force protection to engage in counter terrorism and to continue the training of iraqi security forces
3187747 as ive said many times we must be as careful getting out of iraq as we were careless getting in we can safely redeploy our combat brigades at a pace that would remove them in 16 months that would be the summer of 2010 two years from now and more than seven years after the war began after this redeployment a residual force in iraq would perform limited missions going after any remnants of al qaeda in mesopotamia protecting american service members and so long as the iraqis make political progress training iraqi security forces
3187748 throughout 2006 and early 2007 mr obama pledged to remove all u s troops even voting to immediately cut off funds for the troops while they were in combat

3187760 some of my colleagues are calling it revolutionary we have shown that mitochondrial disease is not rare
3187761 what this says to me is that many more than 1 in 4 000 people have mitochondrial disease
3187762 and it tells me that 1 in 200 could develop some type of mitochondria related disease over the course of their lifetime depending in part on environmental triggers
3187763 the core of many well known diseases and chronic illnesses such as alzheimers disease parkinsons disease and autism spectrum disorders
3187764 mitochondrial dysfunction represents a major unexplored area of human biology of vital importance to human health
3187765 while it cannot yet be said that mitochondrial dysfunction causes these problems it is clear that mitochondria are involved because their function is measurably disturbed
3187766 mitochondrial dysfunction is a major underlying risk factor for human disease
3187767 we have always advocated spreading the immunizations out as much as possible because every time you vaccinate you are creating a challenge for the system
3187768 and if a child has an impaired system that could in fact trigger further clinical problems
3187769 we do not know what is safe we do not know what is not safe we do not know the actual risk of a person with light mitochondrial disease has and being challenged either by vaccination or by a severe infection
3187770 is there a relationship between mitochondrial disease and vaccination and mitochondrial disease and autism
3187771 would a vaccination or infection initiate an incipient mitochondrial disease as has been suggested

3187780 hed rather come up and play every day but with the way lind has played in left field we cant give him that opportunity to play every day
3187781 under the circumstances knowing that he wasnt going to get a chance to play every day he just said that its probably better off to be released
3187782 ive had him around for a long time but certainly you always try to keep your best players and he hasnt played in what two months or so so im not sure how much he could do here anyway for the next month and a half
3187783 he was going to come up and not get a lot of playing time in the grand scheme of things this is probably better off for him and for us instead of having him sit around not getting a chance to play
3187784 we just kept testing it and putting myself in situations
3187785 its as good as we can test it its been two plus weeks and its time to see what i can do in a game
3187786 itd be nice if he doesnt have to dig out i have no problem if hes a little bit careful

3187809 its an honor to be a part of a program thats so significant now and to be the home program
3187810 its motivating and i think the kids respond to that it comes with the territory and it is what it is and we played through it
3187811 hes a competitor he goes right after people and has a great attitude and a great work ethic hes a coachs dream
3187812 the first two innings i was leaving the ball up but i adjusted and kept the ball down
3187813 its a play ive seen him make a thousand times
3187814 he was there but again there are no excuses you have to make plays in a championship game
3187815 the game was a little sloppy with a few errors
3187816 i dont know if we really took advantage of them they made the errors we just ran again it was just the baseball gods giving us some luck
3187817 it was a tough loss but i told the guys there are no excuses
3187818 you have to come out here and compete and get it done no matter what it takes and we didnt get it done but i told the guys not to walk out of here with your heads down
3187819 i thank rbi kpmg and everyone who participated and donated to the event so very much
3187820 the rbi program gives these kids opportunities they could probably never have when you get a chance to play at angel stadium or dodger stadium even to me im fired up it was very easy to get them to understand its a privilege to play today
3187821 sometimes you look at the schedule and you say well hes played nine in a row eight in a row 10 in a row and you give them a day off
3187822 other guys you say hey the bat looks a little tired give him a breather and i think doing that has worked for us throughout the course of the year
3187823 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3187824 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3187825 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3187826 it was one of those things where we didnt want to put him in a situation to try to hurry him up
3187827 he went to go see the doctor today and well let him come back at his own pace
3187828 early in the year he was our long guy picked up some innings for us just recently he became the seventh eighth inning guy and hes one of those guys that can throw a couple of innings hes not just a one inning pitcher
3187829 i think its better to be safe than sorry and not put the pressure on him to try to come back just see the doctor and our medical people dont think its anything major
3187830 the reports we got on kensing in the minor leagues were good
3187831 he deserves to get an opportunity to come back here and take a shot at it
3187832 id like to say straightaway that regime change is an american expression we do not use such expression
3187833 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3187834 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3187835 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3187836 if everything goes well i think in a couple days
3187837 i feel like ive been making good progress every day taking a good step forward each time
3187838 its a good situation that you can ask that question
3187839 i have probably been the leading player in europe for close to six years it is a big step now to move up and start competing on a different level ive got phil ive got tiger ahead of me i dont necessarily pay attention to what theyre doing i pay attention to more what im doing
3187840 many periods in my career ive had lulls where ive been in between things and come out stronger
3187841 im looking at this period as one of those that i am coming out stronger with experience and im putting a lot more things together im making things happen on the golf course
3187842 its a long way to catch tiger at the top
3187843 but i know that the only way of focusing on doing that is focusing on me controlling what i can do thats the only thing i can ask of myself
3187844 i obviously hold a lot of european players who i grew up watching in high esteem
3187845 to believe that i achieved something they hadnt is very special
3187846 i dodged a bullet because there was some more high profile losers that day
3187847 but i walked away from that tournament knowing i could win a major and youve got to lose them to know you can win them ive got to put myself in the position and learn from it and understand it before i actually go and do it
3187848 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3187851 dont or we will bomb the shit out of you
3187852 the russian government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty
3187853 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on
3187854 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intent in georgia and the region
3187855 these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize relations with the united states and europe
3187856 we left behind all the equipment in the hospital and 80 bodies in the morgue
3187857 the situation in georgia is very difficult because russia is doing everything possible to occupy the country
3187858 if tbilisi comes under threat i will inform the residents 12 hours in advance
3187859 we dont know what their goals are how can you be sure when tanks approach your city that they wont shoot
3187860 if the georgian troops dont take advantage of this opportunity then an operation to eliminate them will begin
3187861 that russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
3187862 to try to finalize all the steps we are taking around a document that has to be accepted by both sides
3187863 dear momma wherever you are if ever you hear the word nigger again remember they are advertising my book
3187864 well you cant neccessarily attribute global warming to it being hot out today
3187865 what is the difference between climate and weather because climate can be thought of as average weather the two are closely related however climate and weather are different the main distinction between the two is the timeframe weather describes short term atmospheric conditions in a specific place such as a sunny day in los angeles or a snowstorm in boston climate on the other hand refers to average atmospheric conditions over an extended period of time such as decades or centuries using the cities of los angeles and boston as examples again these two locations have very different climates even though their weather can possibly be similar on any one day
3187866 of course its only around ten million people so its possible to intervene because everything is smaller
3187867 maybe swedes are more used to this type of intervention and regulation

3187869 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3187870 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3187871 weve been actively building our capacity to ensure when the contract is awarded we were able to meet the contract demands straight away
3187872 weve put on additional personnel straight up now weve been carrying them at our expense
3187873 we need to reassess that position but i am hoping we can find ways to try and retain that skill
3187874 at this stage weve had about 20 people present to us as identified pilgrims indicating that theyre needing to seek protection in australia
3187875 any large event in australia is going to absolutely have in amongst the people who come here those who are seeking protection
3187876 its a very clear and known means for people to flee persecution in their country of origin
3187877 were seeing people from cameroon were seeing people from burundi were seeing people from kenya were seeing people from pakistan
3187878 relatively weak evidence base informing medical care in children compared with adults
3187879 russian forces came to the central route and cut off connections between western and eastern georgia
3187880 russian and georgian forces must immediately cease hostilities throughout georgia and return to their aug 6 positions
3187881 the only viable long term solution is international mediation and peacekeeping
3187882 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3187883 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed 10 ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3187884 extreme makeover was born from the deepest part of my heart and celebrates the magnificence spirit and success of womanhood
3187885 where have you two been i have been waiting for those herbs so i could
3187886 what in the nine levels of hell have you two been doing
3187887 we went to the herb garden to gather supplies and discovered wed been ransacked
3187888 i know we planned on setting up those prosperity mojo bags tonight for everyone for samhain gifts but i am afraid they will have to wait
3187889 i did a casting to see who would do such a thing and instead of pulling on energy used my own in case there was a trap spell
3187890 its easier to deal with a reaction headache than the possibility of being attacked ot the forest blowing up
3187891 looks like you did yourself a good one ill go get something for it you just lay there and rest adam you stay with him itll take me a bit to put stuff together and i dont want him left alone
3187892 i dont see why she feels the need to play match maker between us im here im not going anywhere
3187893 well i wont disagree but i know why you did it
3187894 now i think you need to take some of that vile concoction bliss is no doubt brewing up and get some rest
3187895 i cant afford to we have too much to get done especially now
3187896 besides think of all the fun we can have raising more energy with sex magick tonight
3187897 yes we do i am not about to let you attempt anything magickal until i am thoroughly convinced you arent going to collapse i havent invested eight years in you and not come out of it knowing how much you tend to push yourself beyond your limits
3187898 eight years since we met three since we were hand fasted i was so afraid you were going to say no when i asked you
3187899 what i told you that you really need to work on those doubts
3187900 sometimes i think she is a wee bit over protective of you at times
3187901 drink you need to rebuild your electrolytes and potassium i let you rest in the car but i do want to know who it was you felt
3187902 ill give you a guess and the first two dont count
3187903 you could have at leat put some honey in it
3187904 i figured the two of you were being sweet enough with each other and you wouldnt need it love disgusting
3187905 i dont know why she needs to take our herbs though she has a large enough garden of her own and where were the trolls certainly they would have felt or noticed something going on
3187906 i dont doubt she put up some sort of spell to prevent them from knowing anything out of the ordinary was happening still it is odd they didnt show up while we were there
3187907 exactly we should have ventured on to see if they were okay
3187908 yes because you were in such good shape to do that no your mom is perfectly capable of keeping check on them and if anything was wrong wed know for now why dont you get some rest youre ready to pass out and i have some designs i need to finish and get sent into the office before five
3187909 yes you could ill be right here at my desk no worries nothings going to harm you not while im around
3187910 then i shall be thankful this isnt one of your novels id be offed by some vampire or other such nonsense and the character youd base on yourself would throw himself into sucidal despair and it would be one big mess
3187911 dear gods i wish that man woulds realise how much he means to me i know it is all walls and insecurities if i were to ever meet the ex of his that abused him to this level of self doubt ah well best not to dwell ray does that enough for both of us at least it only comes in spurts now not like when we first started dating
3187912 not intentionally but when i heard that bitchs name mentioned i admit my pointed little ears perked up what is she up to now
3187913 the last time he fought her he lost his mother in the deal well you know that better than i
3187914 that i do the first time the two of you met in person after five years of being on line lovers and its to attend his moms funeral dont look at me like that its true it may have taken both of you some time to realise that you were soul mates but i knew it from the get go so did natalie you two share everything youve been there through other relationships with each other crisises break ups deaths a strong friendship bond that kindled into love those are rare adam so i say this out of love dont fuck it up
3187915 id die before i did anything to hurt him bliss you should know that you were the one that healed me back when i took that witchblade in the shoulder for him that was a nasty piece of work
3187916 oh dont i know he was practically keening over your body the entire time i know youd never leave him dolt i mean dont go getting yourself killed or taking on more than you can handle i know you youre the type to go fire bomb her house slash her tires ands gods know what else goes on in that demented british punk head of yours
3187917 the look the whole laid back punk look it suits you you dont dress it all the time which is good but you remain true to yourself and that is what is important you balance lord fauntleroy over there perfectly
3187918 i wish you would stop intercepting my thoughts it is rather unnerving at times
3187919 if hes not awake in an hour wake him and see if the headaches gone if not give him another dose of tea its in the kettle
3187920 its nearly seven boo ive been working for nearly five hours bliss hasnt returned and
3187921 ive been awake for about an hour now my turn to watch you
3187922 oh good we know what that gets us stuck knee deep in trouble
3187923 what diabolical scheme have you devised for us to rid the world of our mortal enemy once and for all
3187924 you know you talk like the dialogue that is written for comic books at times it is one of the things that attracted me to you its cute
3187925 being adorkable with me is not going to get you out of answering the question love what were you thinking about
3187926 fine i was trying to figure out a way to get around the obvious cloaking spell jolis has set around her it isnt that complex a spell i showed you in five minutes how to do it but it takes energy to keep it going constantly she has to be taking it from some where i havent felt any fissures in the ley lines though i know shes not tapping those
3187927 we should check missing persons and increases in calls to the hospitals for depression
3187928 its a good indication youve got something dark lurking in your neighborhood
3187929 who said you were my lone teacher i gathered quite a bit of knowledge growing up in cardiff thank you very much i do think we need to go look for bliss though shes been gone a lot longer than expected
3187930 about time you two showed up to help a lady in distress
3187931 the stores are maddening at this time of day dont let me do anything that foolish again
3187932 the petitioners theatrical movies are too valuable in this early distribution window to risk their exposure to unauthorized copying
3187933 distribution over insecure outputs would facilitate the illegal copying and redistribution of this high value content causing untold damage to the dvd and other downstream markets
3187934 what the mpaa is clearly trying to do here is start releasing movies on tv before theyre available on dvd
3187935 but wants to do so in a way that users wont be able to record on their dvrs though they hardly come out and say that
3187936 the use of soc by the studios would not deny consumers a right they presumptively have or a capability they currently enjoy
3187937 the issue for the studios is whether unprotected outputs could be used to record the early release content in ways that are not currently permitted and then use that recording as the source for additional unauthorized copies
3187938 cannot be left to the unfettered discretion of content owners and mvpds cable companies such unchecked authority places far too much power in the hands of content owners to the potential detriment of all other equally important stakeholders
3187939 consumer electronics manufacturers such as tivo have made significant investments and brought innovative devices to market in reliance on the standards created by cablelabs
3187940 for the new business model the waiver would make possible petitioners and mvpds should have the flexibility to use the technologies that are best suited to serve the needs of their mutual customers while balancing the need to protect their content
3187941 there is no compelling need to establish an arbitrary fixed window for the proposed new services
3187942 in fact there are compelling marketplace statistics that demonstrate such a regulatory limitation is unnecessary
3187943 evidence which the mpaa has relied on in the past to demonstrate the dangers of the analog hole is unreliable and inapposite
3187944 in the complete absence of evidence there is no reason to believe that additional costly restrictive technologies are needed
3187945 the fact that almost no movies are made available to mvpds pre dvd release is clear and convincing evidence that the analog hole is an impediment to the early window release of high value content
3187946 esa poca forma parte de mi vida y gracias a eso estoy como estoy y soy como soy lo recuerdo con much simo cari o con mucha ternura y bueno a esa persona la dej en su lugar en el momento oportuno y luego ya no me he aprovechado m s de eso ni he vivido de eso nunca m s porque me parec a deshonesto
3187947 hago una vida como cualquier madre de familia y ocupo mi tiempo en sacar para adelante a tres seres humanos de vez en cuando hago actividades que no tienen nada que ver con el cine y que son cosas personales a veces me voy por ah hasta por la ma ana a cantar flamenco que es lo que me gusta
3187948 with the olympics going on you see all these athletes carrying their flags their flags pinned on their bodies
3187949 the one flag you cant pull out is the tibetan flag because its illegal to possess one in china
3187950 at one point i looked back and there were eight of them behind us
3187951 we highlighted what the chinese government does to anyone who dissents they crush dissent immediately
3187952 those were all individuals that had nothing to do with students for a free tibet
3187953 the demonstrators felt that there was an injustice and decided to take it upon themselves to act
3187954 it would be unfair to consumers with accounts at other firms as well as to the firms that settled if our investigation were to slow down or stop
3187955 we are meeting with regulators in missouri and look forward to the discussions
3187956 getting investors their money back will continue to be a focus of the enforcement divisions investigative efforts
3187957 if you look at the history of how cities are developed in canada neighbourhoods are situated right next to industries
3187958 that happens across toronto and in most cities in canada you will have that nearby arrangement which is why the community has a right to know what chemicals are being stored and used in those facilities
3187959 we know that propane facilities within 1 6 kilometres is the danger zone which is why people were asked to evacuate their houses within 1 6 km
3187960 i think its a reasonable thing to work from that kind of distancing perhaps its less than that but i think its an entirely reasonable thing and thats what ive asked city staff to do
3187961 we need to have them located in remote locations where theyre not butted up against residential housing
3187962 ensure an incident such as the one we saw yesterday does not
3187963 i do want this missing link to add to the urban environment we share but not at the expense of a hidden treasure that is already here
3187964 we understand their concern and will continue to work with them
3187965 that would take out houses and or stable student housing
3187966 the kasota ponds still function ecologically but theres been steady and incremental degradation
3187967 a major issue with a new roadway is that it would cause an enormous amount of stormwater run off which would carry even more pollutants into the west pond
3187968 we were told that the exact missing link route was still to be determined and i had no idea at the time that it would come close to the st paul border
3187969 when i became aware of the district 12 concerns i set up a meeting to get all the players together around the same table my understanding is that there continues to be conversation between minneapolis and st paul by the time we consider the next major bonding bill two years from now i am hopeful both sides will have reached agreement
3187970 i think the missing link has the potential to be very beneficial and could for example provide a valuable connection to st pauls roads and bikeways
3187971 feel valued respected and feel as if theyre giving back to the community
3187972 my focus will be reaching out to the community i want to be culturally reconnected to meet the needs of the immigrants and the refugees
3187973 i know a lot of the community leaders i was a participant
3187974 it is critical that youth be connected to the community in some way
3187975 when they are connected they are less apt to cause damage when they are connected they take ownership that is so important nowadays as our community continues to change demographically
3187976 im passionate about this right now i hope to have a long tenure as president
3187977 our challenge is every day theres a team out there that can beat you a lineup that can score a lot of runs and a pitcher that can shut you down
3187978 our focus is on our game right now the standings are irrelevant we have a lot of areas that we need to keep moving forward with if were going to be the team that we want to be
3187979 but when youre used to winning that carries over a lot
3187980 these guys come to the park ready to go every day
3187981 you want to focus on things you can control and the only thing thats really in our hands is that game tonight pitch to pitch inning to inning thats where we need to be
3187982 you can think about that you have to just play the game
3187983 nobody is going to say well were winning a lot now were going to lose today because were winning too many games after struggling earlier in the year were just all playing well at the same time and having fun
3187984 not all of our fountains are working like they used to
3187985 but some of them are fairly artistic because theyre historic
3187986 why not put drinking fountains where people really need them
3187987 and it would be great if they had spigots to fill water bottles and for pets
3187988 you are going to be blind and for a time you will be unable to see the light of the sun
3187989 they are asking their supporters to go and disrupt the flow of the opposition
3187990 walter is a player with tremendous work ethic and showed last year that he is a player that can contribute to this team
3187991 tonight tina did a great job stepping up our team
3187992 tonight tina was on fire and we were able to get a lot of stops
3187993 and from those stops we were able to score i think the combination of those two things really got us going offensively
3187994 we took another step forward from a defensive perspective we moved the ball around and shared it i just thought it was an awesome performance by the whole team
3187995 different players are going to have solos but as long as were all playing our instruments on tune were going to be great
3187996 we havent had the practice time that a lot of teams have
3187997 and every minute that were on that court is practice time
3187998 tujuannya agar supaya rata antara posisi roda depan belakang dan mesin

3188009 today many are dead and georgia is in crisis yet the obama campaign has offered nothing more than cheap and petty political attacks that are echoed only by the kremlin
3188010 in the last decade these factors have accounted for virtually 100 of californias population growth
3188011 if we want to start healing our environment weve got to slow population growth more people mean more cars more sprawl higher energy demands more air pollution more demand for water and more paved over farmland
3188012 with americas population growing at its current rate every time we make an environmental gain our population increases and the gains are erased reducing immigration is the key to slowing future population growth and recapturing the momentum in the battle to save californias natural treasures its time for california to lead the rest of the country on this issue

3188015 as mb congregations are moving further away from a historical connection with their anabaptist heritage they may be hindering their ability to present the gospel to a postmodern world
3188016 why is the prayer labyrinth an ancient pagan practice entering into mb circles
3188017 we need to remember that menno simons wrote a renunciation of the roman catholic church
3188018 these new old practices you are advocating are dangerous and experiential of old forms of mysticism it sounds no different than promoting ophraism and her influences with new age gurus
3188019 all this makes me think that perhaps a practices origins in pagan culture or its absence from biblical text isnt the guiding principle for whether we reject or accept it but rather whether or not it reflects biblical truth and principles and either draws us to jesus and each other of not

3188026 si fuera por merecimientos ten amos que habar ganado pero el f tbol no es de merecimientos
3188027 tuvimos para ganar el partido es un empate que da un punto y se suma en la tabla dominamos el partido y tuvimos el control del bal n
3188028 es que el f tbol no es como el baloncesto por ejemplo viendo algunos partidos de los ol mpicos en basquetbol se presentan scorers resultados de 100 70 o 110 80 pero en el f tbol no todos los ataques llegan a feliz t rmino
3188029 lo m s dif cil en el f tbol es dejar de cara al gol a un delantero pero no supimos definir y de ah el empate
3188030 cuando el arquero de uno no es la figura del partido quiere decir que se mantuvo el peligro lejos del campo nuestro
3188031 it would be unfair to consumers with accounts at other firms as well as to the firms that settled if our
3188032 the day of the attack they had just taken the boat out to try the sail
3188033 were prodded in the chest with the machetes as the assailants demanded u s dollars and the access to either the sailboat or the dinghy
3188034 nancy was held in a separate compartment as dan grabbed his own machete and fought to his death
3188035 it is with gratitude and pride for your hard work and our collective accomplishments that i announce my plans to leave
3188036 in many ways the work of a critic is easy we risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment we thrive on negative criticism which is fun to write and to read but the bitter truth we critics must face is that in the grand scheme of things the average piece of junk is more meaningful than our criticism designating it so but there are times when a critic truly risks something and that is in the discovery and defense of the new the world is often unkind to new talent new creations the new needs friends last night i experienced something new an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source to say that both the meal and its maker have challenged my preconceptions about fine cooking is a gross understatement they have rocked me to my core in the past i have made no secret of my disdain for chef gusteaus famous motto anyone can cook but i realize only now do i truly understand what he meant not everyone can become a great artist but a great artist can come from anywhere

3188040 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3188041 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3188042 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3188043 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3188044 what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression

3188047 i know its probably odd but sometimes i feel like maddy was so pure and such light and she died i know its not really rational but sometimes i have this primal fear that ben with his sweet intuitive ways a purity of soul yet untarnished will be snapped away on account of it as if the world with all its problems were not a fit place for souls like his i sometimes wish he was just a bit more ornery or something be a little naughty or something but you know the world needs more people like him his gifts are needed here and besides the world we need him we cant live without his particular joy and the light he brings there would be such an eclipse a darkness so profound so i remind god from time to time that he will be a teenager someday and hell get ornery soon enough and i promise ill celebrate even that
3188048 could not allow georgian attacks on civilians and russian peacekeepers
3188049 georgias attempt to seize control of the secessionist south ossetia region has been a gamble too far reckless in its timing and founded on a fundamental misjudgement
3188050 thought he had the west on his side but he has been outsmarted by vladimir putin the russian prime minister who now holds all the cards
3188051 bush cheney increasingly critical of russia over aggression in georgia
3188052 we always told them dont do this because the russians do not have limited aims

3188058 the bamboo used in our paper is not genetically modified our bamboo is supplied by local farmers and is not harvested from areas where traditional or civil rights are violated nor does it come from natural forests that have been converted to plantations
3188059 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough
3188060 we think we have additional evidence to consider adding vitamin d deficiency as a distinct and separate risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease putting it alongside much better known and understood risk factors such as age gender family history smoking high blood cholesterol levels high blood pressure lack of exercise obesity and diabetes
3188061 now that we know vitamin d deficiency is a risk factor we can better assess how aggressively to treat people at risk of heart disease or those who are already ill and undergoing treatment

3188064 writing in the ieee spectrum james oberg analyzes whether there was in fact a significant risk to humans from the satellite which the us military shot down on 21 february purportedly to head off the possibility of its splashing a half ton of toxic hydrazine fuel somewhere on earth previous experts had scoffed at the rationale put forth pointing out that there was trivial possibility that any significant amount of toxic fuel would make it to the ground intact obergs analysis titled the inside story and claims that indeed its possible and even likely that there could be a danger to the ground unfortunately the analysis is full of flaws and lack of rigor indeed lacking any sort of numerical reasoning it seems to be too much repeating official spin and could have used a hefty dose of skepticism and could also use a little bit of actual analysis using numbers rather than handwaving
3188065 heres the first number that oberg should have quoted 32 megajoules per kilogram
3188066 analogy this to me seems like cheating on your wife and spreading gonorrhea all over town vs burying your wife after shes passed away
3188067 the hydrazine tank is a 1 meter sphere containing about 400 liters of hydrazine the stated hazard area is about 2 hectares something like 1 10 000 000 000 of the area under the orbit
3188068 yeah we could have shot it down but the odds were so small it wasnt worth the money our bad
3188069 james oberg is a veteran nasa mission control engineer living in houston he is now a news consultant lecturer author and occasional tour guide of russian space centers
3188070 32 megajoules per kilogram thats orbital energy which is how much energy has to be removed by ablation or otherwise dissipated for the hydrazine tank to enter the atmosphere and hit the ground undamaged
3188071 okay we understand you are militarizing space were going to counter it not by militarizing space we cant compete with you that way but by shooting down your satellites
3188072 is china trying it conquer the world by shooting down one of its own satellites
3188073 there is a conspiracy here trust no one were all being lied to
3188074 the outer layers are warmed by atmospheric friction and little bits flake away as they descend
3188075 their central regions remain cool even as the hot outer layers are ablated away
3188076 hell we have this satellite problem its going to reenter soon anyways so its a nice convenient test target we might as well try it while we have the chance
3188077 who wants to watch this crap anyway ive seen all these people before and when i want to jerk off to porn i just go online and find something on xtube
3188078 if you can play great defense and play great special teams and dont turn the ball over on offense youre going to win a lot of games
3188079 it was good to see the defense get some balls out today we really emphasized about the defense going after the ball at the beginning of practice because we didnt want our offense to feel great just because they had a perfect game the other night it was good to see our defense get it out and our offense needs to come back and not do it tonight
3188080 we dont just want a three and out we want to get the ball back for the offense the more opportunities we have to get the ball back the better chance we have to win
3188081 the coaches have always been telling us to strip the ball its what theyve been harping on from the defense
3188082 we do it every play but we also have certain drills for it a runner approaches you and youve got to try to strip it any way you can its a drill we do every day and you can only hope it carries over into the game

3188119 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3188120 the russian government must reverse the course that it appears to be on

3188171 elected officials such as myself have a chance to really understand the truth about our energy situation
3188172 energy crisis myths and realities working toward common sense solutions
3188173 right now there are a lot of myths and misconceptions about oil and oil prices
3188174 i think here in arizona we have the corner market when it comes to the sun we can lead in solar power
3188175 this is a principal reason why the dollar is so weak
3188176 wow that wasnt at all appropriate to talk about with a group of 4 6 year olds
3188177 but at students affairs we know that really the first three weeks are the most critical because students get in and get settled or they decide it isnt working out
3188178 it provides a welcoming environment for them so that they feel accepted into the universitys community
3188179 its also providing an opportunity for social interaction with other students
3188180 is also a way for them to get some freebies because it doesnt cost them to attend
3188181 if students are not happy being here theyre probably not going to do well academically
3188182 they stop going to class and dont look for the assistance when they need it so we know their out of class connection is very important
3188183 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3188184 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3188189 when the fed started to cut rates mortgage rates and other rates were actually lower than they are today
3188190 to say that things are easier in many areas of credit would be mistaken
3188191 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3188192 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3188193 i dont have a solution but i admire the problem

3188198 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe
3188199 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3188200 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3188201 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3188241 no one working from the first century evidence alone can fail to be struck by the disparity between the unanimous teaching of the church both east and west and the lack of any strictly historic proof that peter was ever in rome
3188242 peters death in rome back to front and upside down
3188243 if anywhere in our ancient sources we should expect a report concerning the end of peters life in the book of acts as a matter of fact however it does not contain even the slightest indirect allusion to a stay of this apostle in rome
3188244 ever since the excavations under st peters cathedral started in the 1940s and culminated in the official announcement of pope pius xii in 1953 that the true remains of st peter had been found many scholars have remained skeptical about the significance of the discoveries
3188245 even the strongest proponents of the authenticity of the discovery cannot deny that little if anything about the earliest graves shows any clear christian character the first and second century ce graves very much resemble contemporaneous simple interments of common people from the neighbouring quarters of rome
3188246 a simple monument that consisted of a niche and a courtyard the tropaion gaii
3188247 since memory of peters original burial place was lost by the time the tropaion was erected the existence of the tropaion did not result in the development of a christian burial site but was integrated into a middle class non christian burial street
3188248 the site was firmly and finally taken over by christians thereby obliterating all earlier traces of burial activity apart from the immediate space around the
3188249 for an inhabitant of the roman empire it was perfectly possible and indeed quite natural to compare the ancient babylonian empire with that of rome in terms of their respective size splendour and power and equally in a negative sense in relation to their decadence and declining morals
3188250 to pass from the examples of ancient days let us set before us the noble examples which belong to our generation by reason of jealousy and envy the greatest and most righteous pillars of the church were persecuted and contended even unto death let us set before our eyes the good apostles there was peter who by reason of unrighteous jealousy endured not one nor two but many labours and thus having borne his testimony went to his appointed place of glory by reason of jealousy and strife paul by his example pointed out the prize of patient endurance after that he had been seven times in bonds had been driven into exile had been stoned had preached in the east and in the west he won the noble renown which was the reward of his faith having taught righteousness unto the whole world and having reached the farthest bounds of the west and when he had borne his testimony before the rulers so he departed from the world and went unto the holy place having been found a notable pattern of patient endurance
3188251 peters death in rome back to front and upside down
3188252 10 books that screwed up the world and 5 others that didnt help
3188253 never have so few pages done so much damage the damage has for the most part already been accomplished and marxism itself outside china mainly stirs papers at academic conferences but communism offered one heck of a lesson on body count alone the communist manifesto could win the award for the most malicious book ever written perhaps upwards of 100 000 000 even the tenured marxists are a bit squeamish about tooting the manifesto as a horn of plenty
3188254 it was possible half a century ago and even 20 years ago among the academic elite to maintain that marxism was a positive force in history
3188255 only a fool could hold marx responsible for the gulag but there is alas a ready supply of fools should philosophers be blamed for any and every subsequent mutilation of their ideas
3188256 a specter is haunting europe the specter of communism it is high time that communists should openly in the face of the whole world publish their views their aims their tendencies and meet this nursery tale of the specter of communism with a manifesto of the party itself
3188257 the communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations no wonder that its development involves the most radical rupture with traditional ideas in place of the old bourgeois society with its classes and class antagonisms we shall have an association in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all
3188258 the two go together the denial of spiritual entities means the affirmation of all reality as purely material what then is a human being he is an animal that like every other animal must provide for his own material well being
3188259 the bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of course when its complement the proletarian family vanishes and both will vanish with the vanishing of capital the bourgeois claptrap about the family about the hallowed co relation of parent and child becomes all the more disgusting the more by the action of modern industry all family ties among the proletarians are torn asunder and their children transformed into simple articles of commerce and instruments of labor
3188260 according to marx the fulfillment of the communist dream requires the disappearance of an entirely corrupt class there is no moral blame attached to the revolutionaries who exterminate this class and there is certainly no god to keep accounts so its no surprise that communism advanced by epic brutality such is the danger of a bad idea

3188285 she doesnt appreciate how terrific she is shes slightly insecure and thinks shes not going to be able to do something well or that she needs extra takes to do it which isnt true at all
3188286 it was what happened with that movie it was seen around the world and by the american industry that brought me other opportunities like woodys movie movies that are in english and are very demanding emotionally
3188287 the first movies i did in english i was struggling more with english
3188288 id studied french before so in the beginning i was learning my dialogue almost phonetically but all of them come from me i would never make less of these experiences all of them mean a lot and taught me
3188289 he was very nice but there is no baloney with woody
3188290 hes very direct and honest and sometimes you cannot believe your ears theres no social veneer its a very new york thing but he has that more than anybody i know and i really respect and appreciate that he doesnt waste energy
3188291 shes the rolls royce of spanish actresses shes very sexy and beautiful shes got the look shes got everything you want for that character you believe her completely having those irrational mood swings you believe she could stick a knife in javier
3188292 she thinks she will not be as creative if shes not torturing herself and she cant get out of that pattern that felt to me like somebody in a lot of pain and i did not want to laugh at that pain when i saw the movie in cannes they were laughing and now every time i see the movie i laugh and relax and see the movie from the point of view of the audience
3188293 im happy that i did both movies back to back with characters that are so different
3188294 with consuela i was attached to the project for five years since i read the book i love philip roth and it was one of the best books ive ever read you read something and almost every day of your life you remember it it means something to you
3188295 penelope really admires people who know everything about culture and architecture and art shes a very passionate person and her passion is in consuela too
3188296 when penelope likes something she really likes something if its a song or a book or an author shes like wow totally flipping out
3188297 im very excited all the years i studied dance 17 years i get to use it here with the wonderful numbers rob marshall put together
3188298 theyre just very professional always running their lines and practicing and practicing something i never do
3188299 they didnt bother me theyd sit in their makeup chairs and run their lines and practice scenes all they did was work all the time
3188300 she loves karaoke shes really good at singing lenny kravitz songs and rap and hip hop shes really good at p diddy songs
3188301 she eats a lot shes really skinny but she eats a lot theres nothing dirty about her and thats dirty she doesnt even drink its horrible
3188302 i dont feel like people really care what i do in my time to relax
3188303 its true that i spend a lot of time working i was a workaholic but now i am more balanced
3188304 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a significant and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3188305 these actions would be inconsistent with assurance that we have received from russia that its objectives were limited to restoring the status quo in south ossetia that existed before fighting began
3188306 we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country
3188307 please wake up everybody and please make your position and speak with a united voice
3188308 select distinct category listing from member list order by category listing
3188309 the projects that are receiving support today will develop and bring new technologies to market boosting the states economy and creating and sustaining good jobs for maine people
3188310 these are smart investments in our states technology sectors to transition to a 21st century economy building on our strengths over the years these investments have generated new good paying jobs across our state and leveraged federal funding for path breaking centers of excellence
3188311 we aim to show that the protection mechanisms in windows vista are particularly ineffective for preventing the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities in browsers
3188312 since real world exploitation requires bypassing multiple memory protections we will present several ways in which these techniques can be combined to achieve remote code execution
3188313 if you read the authors actual words not the sensationalist and wildly inaccurate news accounts you get a completely different story
3188314 we aim to show that the protection mechanisms in windows vista are particularly ineffective for preventing the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities in browsers
3188315 the design and implementation of the memory protection mechanisms in windows have a number of limitations that reduce their effectiveness
3188316 in this paper we demonstrated that the memory protection mechanisms available in the latest versions of windows are not always effective when it comes to preventing the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities in browsers they raise the bar but the attacker still has a good chance of being able to bypass them
3188317 one of the biggest targets of the work by sotirov and dowd is address space layout randomization aslr
3188318 the idea that theyve been completely blindsided by the revelations in a single black hat paper and that theyll have to scrap the entire architecture of the windows platform is naive to put it charitably
3188319 its supposed to be a maximum year this year every third year and its breathtaking
3188320 we had a staff member here whod been here for nearly 12 months and was leaving us this morning and hadnt been and we took her out there yesterday and she couldnt believe it just magnificent
3188321 russia must reverse the course it appears to be on
3188322 if these reports are accurate these actions would be inconsistent with the assurances we received from russia that its objectives were limited to restoring the status quo in georgian breakaway region south ossetia that existed before the fighting began on august 6
3188323 these actions jeopardize russians relations with the united states and europe
3188324 there are no discussions about the u s getting involved militarily
3188325 michael beck has demonstrated the experience talents and judgment we have been looking for
3188326 he has a strategic vision and strong management skills and is highly respected for his participative management style he has established a strong presence in the riverside community as a good listener and an innovative problem solver consensus builder and a person who gets things done
3188327 on behalf of our entire community i offer gratitude and congratulations to interim city manager bernard melekian who has demonstrated during the last nine months his standing as one of californias finest public officials
3188328 adam is about the same size as bernie 194cm and 96kg
3188329 bernie was an outstanding midfielder and he became an outstanding full forward
3188330 im happy to have mick goodesy hally as well up forward
3188331 they complement each other its a bit like when mick and hally and henry playfair were there as well and obviously ryan okeefe
3188332 if you get mick back i dont think you can have too many forward options
3188333 look at geelong theyve got so many good forwards of different shapes and sizes
3188334 the fact that hes playing forward allows him to look very good and very sharp
3188335 hes certainly not 100 per cent but were happy for him to play in a forward role until things change with his body
3188336 you want to be playing well going into the finals regardless of whether you finish eighth or fourth
3188337 theres no point limping into the finals with poor form or a lot of injuries
3188338 the concern at the moment is we played some good footy on the weekend and weve got to play some more good footy against geelong
3188339 were certainly going out there with a bit more confidence than we did leading into last week
3188340 the clubs have too many vested and conflicting interests and are not equipped to deal with these issues consistently
3188341 sadly that is compromising the values and the brand of afl football
3188342 with acts which are offensive to society against the law and which may involve police laying charges the afl should assume control
3188343 they should be dealt with by an afl appointed tribunal chaired by a retired supreme court judge
3188344 what penalties can the afl tribunal impose financial incarceration the death penalty
3188345 it is incredulous that mr jackson thinks it acceptable that after legal process has taken place afl players should face further deliberation by an afl appointed tribunal
3188346 or worse before due legal process has taken place lets leave policing to the police adjudication to the courts and law making to parliament
3188347 ridiculous suggestions which fragment every citizens right to natural justice and constitutionally enshrined rights should be treated with the disdain they deserve
3188348 to implement a tribunal to deal with off field offences against society committed by its players
3188349 players averaging more than 200 000 a year cant expect to earn that without giving up some sort of rights
3188350 we are talking about a small number of players you would be hard pressed to find more than a dozen cases in recent years
3188351 hes showing enormous courage to get out there brownie he has got a lot of things that he is coping with
3188352 anyone who goes to training can see he just cant get out there he is barely getting on the field week to week and it is difficult when you do that because you de train a little bit
3188353 just playing weekends and getting up in time for the following weekend makes it very tough to play anywhere near the level you are capable
3188354 do you want to finish 12th or get a top three draft pick
3188355 were going to play three games as hard as we can and try to win them all
3188356 ive maintained that for a fair time now and that is what i am doing
3188357 it was fairly similar people can see what occurred we made similar decisions sending people off to surgery and we put a lot of young players in and gave them opportunity
3188358 it held us in good stead for the following year and thats exactly what we are doing now
3188359 a lot of people wont like it but it is the tough decisions that us at the leadership end of the club have to make for the good of the club
3188360 im really focused on what were doing at port adelaide
3188361 when you lose it is easy to kick a dog when its down
3188362 we did the right thing and the best thing for our club moving forward
3188363 as bad as it might seem the no 1 thing we have to consider is the good and the life and the continuity of the club you make decisions from the long term rather than short term
3188364 that is one of the greatest carrots in front of anyone
3188365 we have nothing to go on other than what he was last seen wearing his description and his vehicle which was a white mazda
3188366 that information doesnt have to be gee wiz i see him now it could be anywhere he may have been seen
3188367 quote from general vorgoth im writing a novel i hope to publish soon
3188368 she is showing a little bit of lethargy we think she may be coming down with parvo or distemper
3188369 right now we have about 30 applications on her that is a lot of people who have homes open for a dog
3188370 she locked him along with 12 other dachshunds in a shed in cages they were basically being starved luckily animal control went in and took the other dogs out
3188371 nasaaan na ang diyos na yan iharap mo sa akin at sesenelasin ko
3188372 anyone who reads its literature or debates its leaders finds that modern anti theism is fueled by such ignoble motives as bitterness rage and hatred its spokesmen manifest an angry spirit which rages first against god and then because they cannot confront god directly against those who dare believe in him
3188373 making sense of history and drawing warmth out of the cold
3188374 when the market is up assets rise and fees and earnings rise
3188375 investors are more willing to put money in the markets
3188376 in my view our poor performance is not the result of poor economic conditions
3188377 much of our operating shortfall i believe is the result of our own lack of execution as a company that began in the midst of the great depression we have a deep heritage from one of the great american brands and are fortunate to have attracted committed and passionate employees benefits that we believe will allow us once again to become a thriving chain
3188378 i mean havent you ever watched a horror film there are rules yes like in
3188379 and even though that particular storyline took place in a modern day american suburb i am pretty sure walking
3188380 though its slightly ironic how the character who originally narrates the rules in the first instalment of the scream trilogy was then later horribly killed in the second part only to be resurrected on screen in the last film via a video he apparently recorded prior to his gruesome murder in order to impart some more rule based wisdom which he obviously didnt follow very well seeing as he was speaking from beyond the grave
3188381 even so i think my original point was valid hey are you even listening to me hellooooo
3188382 trying times for a massive number of creative people whose footing has been destabilized in this era of instant zero cost distribution of digital content on the internet
3188383 si la capital se enfrenta a alg n peligro lo sabr is doce horas antes lo ideal ser a que todos nos qued semos en casa
3188384 puede que varios centenares de personas hayan abandonado ya la ciudad pero decidles que vuelvan es mucho m s seguro quedarse en casa
3188385 las fuerzas enemigas no tienen los recursos suficientes para ocupar la capital
3188386 separado la zona occidental del pa s de la oriental
3188387 esto es un intento de ocupaci n un intento de ocupar totalmente georgia un intento de destruir georgia
3188388 el objetivo de rusia es poner fin a la existencia del estado georgiano
3188389 pero necesitamos m s que eso queremos que pare a esos agresores b rbaros
3188390 nunca nos rendiremos nunca diremos no a la libertad ni a nuestro futuro nunca nos arrodillaremos
3188391 he is not able to offer these services he isnt in communion with the church
3188392 we had permission to bring every performance enhancing product we could envision to use we do it by the book we get everything authorized we seek only unique selling propositions and have no idea what that guy was talking about when he pitched us on identifying new special user effects as the underpinning to every great breakthrough
3188393 i have never injected or ingested any consumer information that i didnt already know and i have never engaged the services of calle amp companys consumer creative assays to audit something that i did already know or suspect i would never do that
3188394 you have to wait for one brand in one category to unexplainably make a significant leap forward overnight thats our first clue
3188395 are confident that rockefeller is christian gerhartsreiter and the person named christopher chichester who was living in the los angeles area in 1985
3188396 he was aspiring to be an actor out there he was trying to get into the acting business and he thought it was a more appropriate name
3188397 there is nothing wrong with using aliases as long as you dont use it to defraud
3188398 they can do what they want with it but he doesnt remember anything he remembers nothing before 1993 except for little bits and pieces
3188399 the positive impact on the development of this market has a growth and income
3188400 i think that if the government of moscow will annually build nearly 5 million square meters of housing per year then for
3188401 you must be the person with best fine motor skills i know
3188402 90210 about the students of west beverly hills high this guy really gets around
3188403 gossip whispering and an unfriendly environment are causing poor morale and interfering with the efficient performance of town business
3188404 when i was given my termination papers i just looked at the gentlemen that were present in the room and i said youve got to be kidding
3188405 we discussed it on a lunch break and then it ended
3188406 did you see that piercing that the johnsons daughter is parading around with
3188407 really dont tell me you think thats the proper outfit for a mother of two
3188408 a lot of good it does you to go to church
3188409 ele corre o perigo iminente de perder o prest gio que acumulou por ser pr ocidente e moderado

3188411 ele recebeu v rios avisos de que o ocidente n o faria sacrif cios por ele de forma que n o deve contar com a chegada da cavalaria
3188412 no final das contas os georgianos percebem que o tempo n o est a seu favor e que n o podem deixar que a situa o da oss tia do sul e da abkh zia torne se ainda mais complicada e que a influ ncia da r ssia aumente ainda mais

3188416 we dont believe we are in a position to wait much longer for resolution of this question
3188417 appreciates the outpouring of concern and good wishes during this difficult time
3188418 i could write a better book than the one i just bought
3188419 there used to be 60 automobile companies in the world 20 years ago but today there are only 12 left after merger exercises
3188420 if proton wants to compete in the world pac advises that it finds a strategic partner to expand in the industry
3188421 we feel very strongly that weve selected the right person
3188422 ive driven all three communities and i like durham better than any of them
3188423 the streets are in terrible shape im sure public works is not going to be happy i just said that
3188424 aku harus pergi ke kaabah untuk melakukan tawaf tujuh atau 70 kali lalu aku pun datang ke sana untuk melakukan tawaf aku melihat rasulullah saw sedang berdiri melakukan sembahyang saat itu baginda solat menghadap ke syam baitulmaqdis dan baginda menjadikan kaabah di antara dirinya dan negeri syam baginda berdiri di antara rukun hajarul aswad dan rukun yamani aku berkata dalam hati saat aku melihatnya demi allah jika malam ini aku mendengar apa yang dibaca oleh muhammad jika aku sudah mendekatinya dan mendengarkan apa yang dibaca pasti aku akan mengejutkannya aku pun menghampirinya dari balik al hajar dan masuk ke dalam kain kaabah tidak ada jarak antara diriku dan muhammad melainkan hanya dibatasi kain kaabah saja saat aku mendengar al quran hatiku mencair sehingga membuat aku menangis sejak saat itu aku beriman
3188425 dan bacakanlah kepada mereka berita orang yang kami berikan kepadanya ayat kami pengetahuan mengenai isi al quran kemudian dia melepaskan diri daripada ayat itu lalu dia diikuti oleh syaitan sampai dia tergoda maka jadilah dia termasuk orang yang sesat dan jika kami menghendaki sesungguhnya kami tinggikan darjatnya dengan ayat itu tetapi dia cenderung kepada dunia dan menurutkan hawa nafsunya yang rendah maka perumpamaan seperti anjing jika kamu menghalaunya dihulurkan lidahnya dan jika kamu membiarkannya dia menghulurkan lidahnya juga yang demikian itu adalah perumpamaan orang yang mendustakan ayat kami maka ceritakanlah kepada mereka kisah itu supaya mereka berfikir
3188426 ambillah al quran jika ia menguntungkan kamu jika tidak tinggalkan saja
3188427 i dont believe my sister in any way would deceive somebody like that at all
3188428 i feel shes been wronged if she was properly pregnant which i cant see her deceiving the system like that because she has gave them a valid adoption
3188429 i was going stephanie why are the cops here looking
3188430 if anything was done inappropriate i believe it would have been forced onto her
3188431 if the directors hadnt put in that money it would have been a very dire situation for us
3188432 looking at the squad it would have been extremely hard for us to raise 15m from player sales alone and also have a competitive team
3188433 there was a risk we could have gone into administration without that investment
3188434 i think this was a tough move professionally and personally for ruud
3188435 i dont think it was working out for him and his family i have no issues with ruud i appreciate what hes done for us and we move on
3188436 with ruud moving on we believe that this is the right time to make more sweeping changes throughout the organization
3188437 our commitment continues to be focused on not only winning the mls cup this and every season but to build a club capable of competing at the international level this decision is the right one for the organization the right one for the players and the right one for our fans
3188438 hujan rintik rintik turun rintik rintik di halaman di jalan hujan rintik rintik ambilkan payung untuk berlindung hujan turun hujan rintik rintik
3188439 hujan hujan di mana mana di jalan di halaman semua basah hujan hujan tak henti henti hujan hujan lebat sekali hujan hujan besar kepalang di sana dan di sini air tergenang
3188440 dia lah yang meniupkan angin sebagai pembawa kabar gembira yang dekat sebelum kedatangan rahmat nya hujan
3188441 bahkan seorang anak kecil pun mengerti bahwa hujan itu adalah rahmat dari rabbal alamin yang patut disyukuri dengan rasa bahagia
3188442 tidaklah kamu melihat bahwa allah mengarak awan kemudian mengumpulkan antara bagian bagian nya kemudian menjadikannya bertindih tindih maka kelihatanlah olehmu hujan keluar dari celah celahnya dan allah juga menurunkan butiran butiran es dari langit yaitu dari gumpalan gumpalan awan seperti gunung gunung maka ditimpakan nya butiran butiran es itu kepada siapa yang dikehendaki nya dan dipalingkan nya dari siapa yang dikehendaki nya hujan adalah keajaiban kawan
3188443 bungkus permen kemarin sudah kubuang ke tong sampah belum yah
3188444 dan dialah yang meniupkan angin sebagai pembawa berita gembira sebelum kedatangan rahmat nya hujan hingga apabila angin itu telah membawa awan mendung kami halau ke suatu daerah yang tandus lalu kami turunkan hujan di daerah itu maka kami keluarkan dengan sebab hujan itu pelbagai macam buah buahan
3188445 dentist branded a terrorist after taking pictures of landmark shopping centre
3188446 when i was laying there on the field thats the most scared ive ever been
3188447 laying there for about a minute i couldnt feel my left side after the trainers came out about 30 seconds later i could start to get the feeling back its something i dont want to experience again
3188448 it was the first chance i had to do any contact since december of 06 so i was just real pumped up and i was the first one down there
3188449 i ran into the guy and the next thing i know im laying on my side and i couldnt move my left side thats basically it i hit him pretty hard i had to pick the biggest guy too
3188450 my mom was watching the arizona cardinals game and she saw my name go across the bottom line that i got carried off on a stretcher so she was freaking out
3188451 they taped it so im going to have to watch it when i get a chance to but it was kind of crazy
3188452 they said it scared them too they were just glad that i was all right
3188453 whatever route you have you better run it hard because the ball could be coming
3188454 if youre not looking you may get hit in the head
3188455 its starting to show the guy can still play football
3188456 as soon as you come out of your break the balls right here
3188457 you just have to have your hands up real quick
3188458 when you have a guy who can pressure the defense in many ways you know every routes available on the field
3188459 i wouldnt only say its just how fast the ball is coming
3188460 hes not going to wait for your eye contact he expects you to be ready for the ball
3188461 theres no such thing as a decoy route not as long as you have brett back there
3188462 like i tell the guys even when youre covered youre not really covered if you have two hands and two arms youre not covered because hes going to hit one of them so just find a way as long as you can see him he can see you
3188463 he just threw it up in the air and let him get it and youre like wow
3188464 laveranues couldve closed his eyes and it was right there in his hands
3188465 just growing up and watching him play and now him actually being my quarterback id be lying to you if i told you it wasnt way different
3188466 i didnt ever think it was going to be like that but im getting used to it every day
3188467 ive never played with a quarterback whos had a no look pass in their repertoire
3188468 you would think its a lot harder to catch because its coming so fast but his spiral is so tight that its actually a lot easier to catch
3188469 obviously its a tough situation but this team has shown great perseverance all year and i expect it will continue
3188470 well continue to monitor the waiver wire but this underscores the emphasis that weve placed on depth we havent gotten to this point on the back of any one player its been a team effort all year and i expect that to continue
3188471 different things create opportunities you can reflect on the negative part or on the positive of giving these guys opportunities to help this team further our lead in the standings
3188472 thats the way were going to look at it it doesnt do any good to dwell on the other side
3188473 sophisticated optical devices that are mechanically robust yet fully biodegradable biocompatible and implantable dont exist today
3188474 such systems would greatly expand the use of current optical technologies in areas like human and livestock health environmental monitoring and food quality
3188475 i think after the 5 4 earthquake it was a wake up call that we all need to be better prepared just in case
3188476 they probably let her go up and give the leis
3188477 three young children got out and they were running around screaming and everything
3188478 whatever route you have you better run it hard because the ball could be coming
3188479 if youre not looking you may get hit in the head
3188480 its starting to show the guy can still play football
3188481 as soon as you come out of your break the balls right here
3188482 you just have to have your hands up real quick
3188483 when you have a guy who can pressure the defense in many ways you know every routes available on the field
3188484 i wouldnt only say its just how fast the ball is coming
3188485 hes not going to wait for your eye contact he expects you to be ready for the ball
3188486 theres no such thing as a decoy route not as long as you have brett back there
3188487 like i tell the guys even when youre covered youre not really covered if you have two hands and two arms youre not covered because hes going to hit one of them so just find a way as long as you can see him he can see you
3188488 he just threw it up in the air and let him get it and youre like wow
3188489 laveranues couldve closed his eyes and it was right there in his hands
3188490 just growing up and watching him play and now him actually being my quarterback id be lying to you if i told you it wasnt way different
3188491 i didnt ever think it was going to be like that but im getting used to it every day
3188492 ive never played with a quarterback whos had a no look pass in their repertoire
3188493 you would think its a lot harder to catch because its coming so fast but his spiral is so tight that its actually a lot easier to catch
3188494 he does like to spread the ball around a lot
3188495 he gets the ball to the tight ends a lot i spoke to bubba and he said be ready hes right because at any time the ball can be coming your way it makes it a little more fun because you get out there and youre running routes and you know youre a live option on every play
3188496 favre is not going to wait for your eye contact he expects you to be ready for the ball
3188497 its really cool its inspiring to know that we play on the same field
3188498 its just fun being able to know that she was a bulldog and with all of us here watching her
3188499 it was just fun seeing her shes really friendly and really good with the girls
3188500 im just kind of looking to her kind of as a role model trying to get back and play as well as i can hopefully one day ill be in her position id love to be in the olympics
3188501 there is currently no formal training or education to produce professionals most practitioners in the supply chain industry acquired their expertise from experience training simply being on the job and learning the ropes
3188502 we are delighted to launch sterilin limited into the market
3188503 the scott partnership is the only pr agency we spoke with and is ideally placed to deliver this new campaign
3188504 weve done the research and find social media marketingis really not ideal for business to business b2b operations such as ours
3188505 we focus our campaigns mostly on decision makers who are older
3188506 we are fulfilling our agreement with the georgian government that in an emergency we would assist them in redeploying their troops
3188507 we are honoring that commitment and we are following through with that
3188508 since we are not professionals in logistics and it is not our core business we decided to select a specialist global logistics company to handle our logistics operations
3188509 we hope our operating costs will improve from efficient logistics performance which will be assessed once a year
3188510 we got lunch supplies paper bags drinks some clothes some bookbags
3188511 and we bought shoes today too that was the big ticket item
3188512 tax free weekends are a golden opportunity for families to save money and balance out other rising costs in our daily routines such as food fuel medical care and groceries
3188513 screw our therapist we accomplish more by just sitting here and talking
3188514 larry can you be any more of a yankee apologist just look past your yankee myopia and try some objectivity
3188515 wow larry youve produced 25 of the comments on this thread and said nothing meaningful thats impressive even for you
3188516 after reading all your postings and daily weblog i believe you have truly become the phil pepe of this generation now this is not necessarily a good thing

3188530 300 were both wildly successful at the box office so expectations are high for this release as well
3188531 my twin brother and fellow actor shawn ashmore bobby drake iceman in the x men films and i were kids when we began acting but back then i never thought this is something i can eventually make a living at
3188532 i had a good time doing it but it was more like a hobby to me than anything else
3188533 after graduating high school i traveled around a bit and did a couple of jobs that i liked but then i began to wonder if i should pursue this other career acting so the whole dentist idea went out the window and i began to focus all my energies towards the acting and here i am today
3188534 i was getting more to do in front of the camera and it was just fun to be on set
3188535 i was in toronto visiting my family and friends when i heard about the audition for jimmy olsen
3188536 they the casting people wanted me to put my audition on tape and send it down to them in los angeles thats when i began to think theyll probably want to hire an actor they can see in the room and actually work with however i read the audition sides and loved the role so i knew i had to go for it i did an audition tape sent it to la and then didnt hear anything for almost ten days thats when i got a call asking if id like to fly to vancouver the next day and play jimmy olsen so it was one of those out of the blue type offers and i couldnt have been happier
3188537 that story is probably my favorite one so far on smallville just from the standpoint of we got to dress up and play these characters from the 1940s
3188538 i think everyone here really enjoyed themselves because it gave us all the opportunity to emulate those old humphrey bogart movies and do something completely out of the box and pretty cool
3188539 it was fun to be back but even more so to be like wow theyre making me part of the gang
3188540 i couldnt believe it having been away from the character for a few months i thought i might be a little rusty stepping back into jimmys shoes but it wasnt like that in fact i got right into the swing of things and just moved along with everyone else so it was all good
3188541 so far the writers have really developed the relationship between chloe and jimmy but there has only been a little bit of interaction with him and clark kent tom welling
3188542 however since we know that down the road the two of them are supposed to be best of friends there are still a lot of places they can go with that relationship
3188543 what im especially looking forward to and hoping for though is some further development with jimmy himself
3188544 jimmy is always going to have that goofy puppy dog side to him but i feel theres a great deal of room especially in a tv show like smallville to fill in this character and reveal other sides to him weve definitely begun to see that in earlier episodes and i think this year there will be opportunities to do more im ready to take what they give me and run with it so well see what happens
3188545 the interruption of the strong growth trends we have experienced over the past several years was disappointing but we remain extremely confident about our future growth
3188546 we are working closely with every one of the major wind turbine manufacturers to address their concerns about incorporating carbon fibers in their design and while we cannot predict the exact timing we expect to win new contracts leading to resumption of zolteks rapid sales growth
3188547 australians dont have much respect for the music press it runs counter to their culture australian rock is all about good on ya mate well done for getting up on stage and switching that amplifier on
3188548 the idea of anyone actually daring to criticise musicians for the sound they make is almost heresy everyone is treated equally which means no knocking anyone back however great the temptation thatll be why australian rock is best known to the outside world for such musical abominations as silverchair the vines and savage garden
3188549 its a really poor piece of journalism from a music writer who once had relevance and influence but now hes living in australia he doesnt really have the knowledge or experience of the local industry to back up his opinions
3188550 its just a shame he gets to hide under the masthead of the guardian which gives him credence where none is due
3188551 i think there are parts of the british press that seem to enjoy denigrating their subjects
3188552 but i certainly dont think it is something that happens all the time
3188553 american beers are often a surprise to the british palate they are so intensely flavored that most people either love them or hate them nothing like the insipid lagers we usually associate with america

3188559 charles has this great almost magical gift of melody an unending well of it
3188560 what he does seems very easy and most people think it is to write these simple melodies that stick in your head and never go away
3188561 charles works like a fiend he gets up in the morning and he goes to the piano and he works almost to the exclusion of everything else its the love of his life his work he adores barbara his wife and the kids but hes really obsessed with working
3188562 i started playing piano accompaniment for a lot of singers suddenly i was in nightclubs strip joints i used to play on 52nd street i always had a feeling for jazz even when i was writing more serious works
3188563 i would write a song and i would orchestrate it and copy the parts
3188564 and rehearsal was the next day at 9 so at 4 in the morning i am crossing the lake with the parts still wet i just loved it i never was happier
3188565 we never stopped giving auditions and people never gave money at all the idea of using rock n roll everybody was so turned off
3188566 his agents would not let him sign the contract until he approved every word and note that lee and i wrote
3188567 which meant that we had to at great expense to the producer follow sammy all over the world we spent three years of our lives a week or so each month out in las vegas playing songs for him
3188568 what i love about the score is that it is just good old fashioned tunes
3188569 they are hummable they are great to listen to and really evokes the era of the 1920s
3188570 he is like most really great composers quick to tear something up if somebody says it doesnt work
3188571 he will do it 40 times on one song which is sort of what you have to do but you would be amazed at how many people dont

3188575 the number of single mothers who are unemployed and who receive no welfare assistance has doubled from 16 percent in 1996 to nearly 33 percent in 2005 or one in three single parents
3188576 and only those families with a working wife have seen real improvement in their living standards
3188577 any type of increase in cost especially of this magnitude is just going to make life so precarious so difficult perhaps even unlivable unless we can subsidize those households so that they can make it
3188578 i cant even think about the next two winters its obviously a horror show in the making

3188580 the economy is so bad that summer jobs once designed for youth are now being taken up by unemployed adults who need them

3188606 at a time when scores of companies are freezing pensions for their workers some are quietly converting those pension plans into resources to finance their executives retirement benefit and pay
3188607 in recent years companies from intel corp to centurytel inc collectively have moved hundreds of millions of dollars of obligations for executive benefits into rank and file pension plans this lets companies capture tax breaks intended for pensions of regular workers and use them to pay for executives supplemental benefits and compensation

3188613 while we disagree with china on a number of policy fronts from their human rights record to the lack of transparency of their military buildup the olympic games allows athletes of all nations to come together to compete peacefully in a world wide time honored tradition
3188614 the olympic games do however present a unique opportunity for china to continue to grow into a respectable member on the world stage not only by hosting a first rate olympics but also in conducting itself as a first rate government that ensures its citizens enjoy the freedoms and protections they deserve
3188615 we have understand that we can have a candid and constructive relationship its really important for future presidents to understand the relationship between china and the region and its important to make sure that america is engaged with china though we may have some disagreements
3188616 i think you ought to look at the relationship as one of constructive engagement you can find common areas like north korea iran and be in a position where they can listen to your views like religious freedom and liberty

3188823 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister vladimir putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe

3188828 like i said im shocked because this caught me totally off guard before his oblique injury when we put him on the dl he played 39 out of 51 games and about seven other games he couldnt go to the post because his shoulder was clicking so that wouldve been about 46 out of 51 games he wouldve been in post dl hes played 36 out of 43 games which means he hasnt played seven which means that you have a couple long games night games day games or something and you protect him a little bit well that to me is the farthest thing from a platoon as ive ever heard of in my life so im totally flabbergasted by it
3188829 nobodys a voice leader you lead by example by playing the game right thats how you lead and im not talking about gary sheffield im talking about anybody thats how you lead you dont lead by yelling you lead by example you lead by playing hard and showing other people how you play the game thats how you lead so im befuddled by this article
3188830 ive never considered gary sheffield a platoon player in my life hes never been a platoon player since hes been here and he was made aware of the fact that when he accepted the trade here that he was going to be the dh period so i dont understand why that all of a sudden is a big point that was decided before the trade was ever made whats the point hes not going to be the outfielder here hes going to be the dh which is what he was told when he accepted the trade i tried the outfield thing with him i think i tried to respond in any way i could to try to get him going obviously because we need him and im not mad at him im just saying im totally surprised by all this
3188831 ive always been an admirer of garys because he speaks what he feels and i think hes an admirer of me because i speak what i feel and thats the way i feel about it im reading this article and its blindsided me totally blindsided me i dont really know where its coming from or why the article was ever done

3188834 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
3188835 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
3188836 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
3188837 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
3188838 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
3188839 im shocked amp saddened hes a brilliantly talented entertainer whom ive admired for a long time its truly our loss
3188840 we are heartbroken he will be deeply missed he was a wonderful kind and gentle man
3188841 its a tremendous loss because of his age and the fact that he was such a vital original human being when i use the word original i really mean it he was like no other person i knew he lived his life to the fullest even when we were on the set of oceans he had his own little apartment and he cooked and invited people to lunch every day and he had food that was for everybody he made very exotic things his conversations were always different than any conversations i had with anyone else they were very family oriented he talked about his wife and children with such love and its very hard to believe that hes not with us anymore
3188842 his passing is such a major loss to the acting and comedy communities bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all the time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
3188843 bernie mac was a gifted talent whose comedy came from an authentic and highly personal place he was a tremendous live performer and a wonderful actor fox was proud to be the home of the bernie mac show and all of us at fox and 20th century fox television extend our deepest sympathies to his wife rhonda and daughter jeniece
3188844 bernies style of comedy was bold courageous and revolutionary i never knew anyone who loved to be funny as much as bernie he will most definitely be very missed
3188845 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally costarred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
3188846 bernie mac was a brilliant performer whose legacy will bring laughter to all of us for many years to come the thoughts of everyone at the weinstein company and dimension films are with bernies family

3188860 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3188861 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several u s diplomats it is a real shame
3188862 we are working with an international community but all we got so far are just words statements moral support humanitarian aid
3188863 but we need more we want them to stop this barbaric aggressor
3188864 this appears to be a full invasion of georgia with an end result uncertain and an objective that is not clear but appears to be aggressive in nature
3188865 words like invasion should not be used lightly but this is an invasion
3188866 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia

3188875 a notification scheme gives individuals the information and opportunity to protect themselves against fraud and identity theft
3188876 it also will provide a strong incentive for agencies and organisations to ensure that they secure their databases
3188877 we dont want a situation where all unauthorised access of information will result in a requirement to notify
3188878 instead in our view where the breach can cause a serious harm to an individual is when there should be disclosure serious harm might be information such as a tax file number which can result in identity theft
3188879 we have moved the bar up so that were not looking at trivial breaches

3188928 i find it a bit difficult to believe personally but libbys like that when she gets obsessive about something
3188929 shes put everything into place that shes trained so hard for to see it come true for her is just surreal he said
3188930 if she was susceptible to being influenced by her success it would have happened long ago
3188931 shes very down to earth very humble but she might feel more secure now shes finally won an olympic gold medal but ultimately libbys very very satisfied within herself
3188932 there was no disappointment at all shes a 200m butterfly swimmer so anything she could do in the 100 is just a bonus im just so proud shes a tough little thing

3188971 you create accounts like ekom for what particular reason none at all
3188972 a merry christmas and a happy new year to you

3188975 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister vladimir putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe
3188976 its not bad im working to get down some more i havent been this light since freshman year i feel a lot better im not as tired as usual me being here the entire summer walking this stadium four days a week really helped wed walk up down over and across back and forth at 6 30 in the morning
3188977 yeah you saw that right theyve got us split out wide and some in the slot weve got a lot to handle as a tight end group since were pretty much the most experienced out here
3188978 im very excited about it this is giving me an opportunity to show what they brought me here to do what i did in high school this is my time to prove myself in college weve got a lot of opportunities to make plays since we dont have any receivers with experience we get to be more the focal point
3188979 im going to try to get about five carries a game im going to ask him for it but i dont know if he can do it id be happy with two whatever i can get ill take it itll be pretty exciting to hear my name get called a few more times this year
3188980 in the spring i ran between a 4 6 and 4 7
3188981 i feel much more comfortable having two years under my belt as a tight end im glad i made the switch from quarterback because at quarterback theres too much on your shoulders if something goes wrong the crowds going to hassle you yeah im glad i made the move
3188982 go to the national championship i dont have any personal goals really just to be the best player i can and help my team win
3188983 it feels good you hope for something like that you hope to get better each day you work to be that consistent player theyre looking for
3188984 you try to soak in everything the veterans can teach you while theyre here then once theyre gone you try to use their techniques whatever they taught you you have to step up and make it be your time
3188985 i tried to take notes on justin harper a lot the good thing about him is he was willing to give me a lot of information and let me know when i was doing things wrong it helped guide me it helped fix my flaws i learned how to run routes film study he was there helping me transition
3188986 you try to be as good as you can in every aspect of the game hopefully consistency once you have that it lets you play faster get a little more confidence and things take care of themselves
3188987 im sure there will be growing pains in football youre always going to have some inexperience but if you work hard every day maybe you can come out and surprise some people
3188988 i think everybody hopes to be known as a playmaker being that guy you can count on
3188989 it is a little strange one year in the program and im already a veteran but it just makes you elevate your game one more step knowing youre the older one and you have to come out and perform football is definitely a waiting game some people have to wait longer for their turn fortunately for me my turn came quicker than others now i need to take advantage of it
3188990 thats a hard bet any one of these guys could come out were in the first week so well see but the future is bright for them all of them have their moments
3188991 youve seen him in the backfield hes a pretty big freak hes an intimidating guy
3188992 it just shows the athleticism he possesses he has what it takes to go deep and thats a very good thing for us hell be a big factor along with all our tight ends theyll get their hands on a lot of balls
3188993 no we keep hearing it we keep hearing that were young and inexperienced but we dont buy it we come out like weve played before
3188994 ive been adjusting as a wide receiver i came to camp to focus on the little aspects of the game i do have the physical tools but the little things are what i needed keeping your eyes on the ball before you turn and run up the field getting in and out of my routes knowing the defense better
3188995 yeah i guess i was so excited to be out there that i was trying to make those plays but now im just having to slow my game down and focus now i feel like im well prepared
3188996 i have no idea who coach shermans going to pick but actually all the freshmen came in more experienced than i was they all look really good physically theyve got all the tools some are strong some are fast they just look good
3188997 ive seen dyrell make a couple plays on some deep balls marcus davis too jarrett and randall theyve actually all made plays in practice its kind of surprising for such young guys but theyre getting it done
3188998 just a quick lesson in the difference between emotion and intensity emotion can be fleeting intensity never leaves you you can ride emotion in times of momentum when things are going good and you feel good about yourself but when it gets a little sluggish out there thats when intensity wont allow you to back off what youre doing i thought for the first time in any period since weve been in camp i didnt feel like we moved with a high energy level i didnt think we went through that period with the level of intensity that we need to play with so it was just a lesson in the difference in emotion and intensity we didnt get it done that period so we went back out and made sure we didnt leave anything on the field so we got that period back
3188999 i think guessing is a pretty good word for it

3189021 many of georgias internet servers were under external control from late thursday
3189022 use caution with any websites that appear of a georgia official source but are without any recent news i e sat sun aug 9 10 as these may be fraudulent
3189023 we are now seeing new attacks against ge sites ge is the top level domain for georgia ed www parliament ge and president gov ge are currently being hit with http floods
3189024 are well known to be under the control of rbn and influenced by the russian government
3189025 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3189026 with a little dns spoofing i fed my own list into the iphone and effectively killed by name applications that attempt to use the gps it looks like thats all its set to do right now but i may just not have found the vaporize switch
3189027 either it is an anti malware solution and the iphone has a switch somewhere to vaporize any app or its not an anti malware solution and is really designed to kill applications that interfere with apples business model such as unsanctioned traffic navigation software
3189028 unless for some reason they decided to build two separate mechanisms into the iphone to do this of which the other one is invisible this one likely feeds a master kill switch perhaps there is a special setting in the configuration file which can vaporize the app all together
3189029 you should never have been in that situation to begin with and again brings up the question is the iphone really an enterprise device
3189030 on the other hand how did the i am rich app get through
3189031 it allows attackers to do anything malicious on any mobile device
3189032 by combining the vulnerabilities with the series 40 issues one could develop malware which could be simply deployed and that malware wont be visible to the user
3189033 at least one from each major family in the series
3189034 there are six long months of work in this research
3189035 some will be against this and some will be for it
3189036 they have a choice whether they want to sign up for our security research or whether they want to devote research engineers of their own to investigate the vulnerabilities
3189037 this is the first time that such a widespread and critical attack has been demonstrated against nokias series 40 devices
3189038 we have proved that these devices can be hacked and infected with malware in a very similar way pc computers are
3189039 but in time people will be able to judge on their own whether we got it right
3189040 we currently believe this is more likely a 2010 event rather we believe a smaller version of the 13 inch macbook air is likely in the 2009 timeframe

3189065 i would definitely say that people arent as excited about going to as they were about going to new york city
3189066 minneapolis is a nice city but it doesnt quite have the environment and reputation of a new york city and i think 2004 was a unique convention and a lot of it had to do with where it was

3189075 saying our 50th state is somehow foreign does a great disservice to the hard working patriotic americans who call hawaii home for months people have been asking me when is sen obama going to come home im so glad he found time to visit his sister and his grandmother show his daughters more of his home state and relax a little hawaii is a great u s destination just ask the 5 5 million americans who visited last year for business and pleasure
3189076 i deeply deeply apologize to the court and to all those ive affected by my conduct
3189077 whatever route you have you better run it hard because the ball could be coming
3189078 if youre not looking you may get hit in the head
3189079 its starting to show the guy can still play football
3189080 as soon as you come out of your break the balls right here
3189081 you just have to have your hands up real quick
3189082 when you have a guy who can pressure the defense in many ways you know every routes available on the field
3189083 i wouldnt only say its just how fast the ball is coming
3189084 hes not going to wait for your eye contact he expects you to be ready for the ball
3189085 theres no such thing as a decoy route not as long as you have brett back there
3189086 like i tell the guys even when youre covered youre not really covered if you have two hands and two arms youre not covered because hes going to hit one of them so just find a way as long as you can see him he can see you
3189087 he just threw it up in the air and let him get it and youre like wow
3189088 laveranues couldve closed his eyes and it was right there in his hands
3189089 just growing up and watching him play and now him actually being my quarterback id be lying to you if i told you it wasnt way different
3189090 i didnt ever think it was going to be like that but im getting used to it every day
3189091 ive never played with a quarterback whos had a no look pass in their repertoire
3189092 you would think its a lot harder to catch because its coming so fast but his spiral is so tight that its actually a lot easier to catch
3189093 he does like to spread the ball around a lot
3189094 he gets the ball to the tight ends a lot i spoke to bubba and he said be ready hes right because at any time the ball can be coming your way it makes it a little more fun because you get out there and youre running routes and you know youre a live option on every play
3189095 when i was laying there on the field thats the most scared ive ever been
3189096 laying there for about a minute i couldnt feel my left side after the trainers came out about 30 seconds later i could start to get the feeling back its something i dont want to experience again
3189097 it was the first chance i had to do any contact since december of 06 so i was just real pumped up and i was the first one down there
3189098 i ran into the guy and the next thing i know im laying on my side and i couldnt move my left side thats basically it i hit him pretty hard i had to pick the biggest guy too
3189099 my mom was watching the arizona cardinals game and she saw my name go across the bottom line that i got carried off on a stretcher so she was freaking out

3189101 they said it scared them too they were just glad that i was all right
3189102 the necks just a little stiff but other than that it feels pretty good to finally get out here

3189128 ghost recon begins in august 2008 with civil unrest in russia ultra nationalists have seized power in russia with plans to rebuild the government their first step is clandestine support of rebel factions in georgia and the baltic states this is where the ghosts come in to silence the invasion armed with some of the most advanced weaponry in the world the soldiers of the ghost recon force are covertly inserted into area of operations and given specific missions to curtail the rebel actions and overthrow their benefactors
3189129 bush understands that its not really about georgia but in a certain sense its also an aggression against america the russians want the whole of georgia the russians need control over energy routes from central asia and the caspian sea in addition they want to get rid of us they want regime change every democratic movement in this neighbouring region must be got rid of
3189130 this underscores the limits of western influence over russia at a time when the rest of europe depends heavily on russia for natural gas and the united states needs moscows cooperation if it hopes to curtail what it believes is a nuclear weapons threat from iran
3189131 stop stop you bully or ill set my mate on you

3189136 the results of this study suggest that pre operative radiotherapy in patients with a resectable proximal bile duct tumour who have undergone pre operative drainage decreases the risk of implantation metastases to be certain about the role of pre operative radiotherapy a randomized study is required until then we advocate standard low dose radiotherapy preceding resection in all patients with lesions suggestive of a proximal bile duct tumour who have undergone biliary drainage
3189137 these results suggest that preoperative chemoradiation for extrahepatic bile duct cancer can be performed safely produces significant antitumor response and may improve the ability to achieve tumor free resection margins
3189138 pre and postoperative irradiation may contribute to the success of the treatment of the resectable klatskin tumour
3189139 our data clearly suggest the improved prognosis of patients with locally advanced klatskin tumor by integrated adjuvant radiotherapy with iort and port to complete gross tumor resection with acceptable treatment mortality and morbidity
3189140 intraoperative radiotherapy increased the effectiveness and length of palliation for the unresectable lesion
3189141 the combination of iort and ebrt is useful for patients with bile duct cancer who undergo noncurative resection or who have lymph node metastasis
3189142 this aggressive approach in the therapy for advanced disease has an acceptable level of morbidity and may warrant the use of iort as part of the management of biliary tract cancer
3189143 favorable overall survival of pcc patients undergoing surgical treatment depends on early tumor stage presence of mucobilia papillary tumor type hepatic resection and post operative chemotherapy
3189144 these data suggest that 1 approximately one third of patients with biliary malignancies have resectable disease and 2 surgery in carefully selected patients with adjuvant chemoradiation has improved survival in resected patients we suspect that a combination of improved staging active biliary stenting safe but extensive surgery to obtain negative margins and newer techniques for chemoradiation have resulted in improved outcomes for patients with biliary malignancies
3189145 long term survival can be expected in patients with extrahepatic bile duct cancer who undergo radical surgery and postoperative chemoradiation regional lymph node metastasis is a poor prognostic factor for these patients
3189146 adjuvant chemoradiation improves survival after resection for cholangiocarcinoma p 0 07 particularly in patients undergoing resection for distal tumors p 0 04
3189147 combined modality therapy that includes complete surgical resection with or without transplantation can be curative in the majority of patients with biliary duct carcinoma further study is needed to better define the roles of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in cholangiocarcinoma
3189148 concurrent radiation with protracted 5 fu infusion at 250 mg m2 d is well tolerated and shows evidence of activity against tumors of the pancreas and biliary system
3189149 our data continue to show that this approach is feasible and may result in an improvement in survival

3189157 about 65 percent of domestic banks up notably from about 30 percent in the april survey indicated that they had tightened their lending standards on credit card loans over the past three months and about the same fraction of respondents up from roughly 45 percent in the april survey reported having tightened standards on consumer loans other than credit card loans
3189158 large net fractions of banks noted that they had lowered credit limits on credit card accounts over the past three months and increased interest rate spreads on consumer loans other than credit card loans on balance about 35 percent of domestic banks up from roughly 25 percent in the april survey expressed a diminished willingness to make consumer installment loans relative to three months earlier
3189159 regarding credit card loans about 60 percent of domestic respondents indicated that they expected their banks to tighten standards on these loans in the second half of 2008 and about 35 percent on balance thought that their banks would tighten such standards on these loans in the first half of 2009

3189179 democratic party is a party of inclusion we respect the individual conscience of each american on this difficult issue and we welcome all our members to participate at every level of our party
3189180 so what are they saying that because we want to protect the rights of the unborn our own party says were automatically republicans this has to be one reason that our party is having trouble appealing to many people in churches
3189181 we decided not to offer an amendment because we are working with the party to try to solve this issue
3189182 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
3189183 strongly and unequivocally regardless of ability to pay oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine
3189184 you dont have to take a different stance about a womans right to choose but you begin with the need for reducing abortion dramatically
3189185 taking abortion seriously as a moral issue would help democrats a great deal with a constituency that is already leaning in their direction on poverty and the environment there are literally millions of votes at stake

3189188 im not going to be able to accept this piece as currently written let me suggest an approach
3189189 the obama piece worked for me because it offered new information he went into detail about his own plans it would be terrific to have an article from senator mccain that mirrors senator obamas piece
3189190 articulate in concrete terms how senator mccain defines victory in iraq lay out a clear plan for achieving victory with troop levels timetables and measures for compelling the iraqis to cooperate

3189204 americans are sharply divided by race heading into the first election in which an african american will be a major party presidential nominee with blacks and whites holding vastly different views of senator barack obama the state of race relations and how black americans are treated by society according to the poll
3189205 more than 80 percent of black voters said they had a favorable opinion of mr obama about 30 percent of white voters said they had a favorable opinion of him
3189206 elected the first african american president of the united states
3189207 basically its the same old problem the desire for power people get so obsessed with power and dont want to share it there are people who are not used to blacks being on top

3189211 we must also engage however in the more difficult task of understanding the sources of such madness the essence of this tragedy it seems to me derives from a fundamental absence of empathy on the part of the attackers an inability to imagine or connect with the humanity and suffering of others such a failure of empathy most often grows out of a climate of poverty and ignorance helplessness and despair

3189220 look children conclusive proof that your father did absolutely fuck all with his life other than bitch and whine and make smart arsed comments on the web at least he had the foresight to put it all in one place huh now which of you can lend me a tenner for some booze
3189221 the truth is that in national security terms hes largely untested and untried
3189222 hes never been responsible for policy formulation hes never had leadership in a crisis or in anything larger than his own element on an aircraft carrier or in managing his own congressional staff its not clear that this is going to be the strong suit that he thinks it is mccains weakness is that hes always been for the use of force force and more force in my experience the only time to use force is as a last resort when he talks about throwing russia out of the g8 and makes ditties about bombing iran he betrays a disrespect for the office of the presidency

3189303 in the past when mexicos foreign policy was based on a principle of nonintervention it was a taboo for mexican leaders to talk about internal affairs of other countries especially the united states

3189354 we believe these people were executed by those who are part of a cuban american mafia
3189355 they probably hired people to execute them we dont know if the cuban americans themselves killed them
3189356 moreover mexicans have historical sympathies for cubans cubans can probably find more support and solidarity here than guatemalan and salvadoran migrants
3189357 highly hypocritical that the united states admits migrants as peasants but does not accept them as citizens a state that sends troops to the middle east to try to implant democracy and respect for human rights does not practice such supreme values in its own territory
3189358 generate worse conditions and insecurity on both sides of the border the migration problem cannot be resolved simply with speeches it requires concrete resolutions
3189359 here this is a hothouse issue for a few in the media and policy wonks but everyone else will do what they have to do to get across the border
3189360 i lament what happened in the senate i hope that the senators consider this well because there are 12 million people in the united states who are undocumented

3189366 i think that everybody felt like it was a breakout year for him
3189367 we dont believe we are in a position to wait much longer for resolution of this question
3189368 finally starting to sort of feel good from the first hand injury then having the hand hurt again and being able to rehab through that and finally get to the point after six long weeks to be able to come through that
3189369 i was looking forward to him coming back as much as he was
3189370 its disappointing for me too i thought he was going to be our deadline deal getting him back healthy in the middle of the order
3189371 that leaves us three weeks for the season to be able to help in some type of capacity
3189372 i dont think anyone wants to play more than michael cuddyer its been a tough year and this is just another one of those things
3189373 appreciates the outpouring of concern and good wishes during this difficult time
3189374 we decided the best and most expeditious course of action was to publicize the artwork to the general public
3189375 whether he was a thief or a good faith purchaser we couldnt come to a conclusion on that
3189376 all we know is he ended up with this stuff
3189377 when i was laying there on the field thats the most scared ive ever been
3189378 laying there for about a minute i couldnt feel my left side after the trainers came out about 30 seconds later i could start to get the feeling back its something i dont want to experience again
3189379 it was the first chance i had to do any contact since december of 06 so i was just real pumped up and i was the first one down there
3189380 i ran into the guy and the next thing i know im laying on my side and i couldnt move my left side thats basically it i hit him pretty hard i had to pick the biggest guy too
3189381 my mom was watching the arizona cardinals game and she saw my name go across the bottom line that i got carried off on a stretcher so she was freaking out
3189382 they taped it so im going to have to watch it when i get a chance to but it was kind of crazy
3189383 they said it scared them too they were just glad that i was all right
3189384 the necks just a little stiff but other than that it feels pretty good to finally get out here
3189385 we practiced on dry trails well before the race so when the rain came it changed everything
3189386 you had to pick new lines and just go for it
3189387 this was not an easy track to begin with and the weather made it even tougher i had a crash in the middle of the course and one of my shoes came off i had to stay strong and keep motivated to make up the time
3189388 this course is like three times as long as what im use to on the world cup
3189389 you really need to stay focused on such a long hard course
3189390 there was more good singletrack in this than in any other trans race by far maybe a factor of 10 or more if you are fond of singletrack as i am that is a big deal

3189465 nearly all of business education even at postgraduate level may be misguided even misleading in my experience business education is faithfully based on a false premise that the problem of business is growth when in fact the problem of business is survival most business leaders may be spending their time and energy on solving the wrong problem yes of course growth is critical in business but the main problem is that most businesses fail to survive long enough to grow

3189474 conservatively we are looking at about a 10 loss in spending over a full year for some eating out channels
3189475 our tracking of the supermarket promotional activity shows that the two major chains have increased the emphasis on
3189476 households are trading down in their spending on food which is showing up in a variety of ways
3189477 consumers are certainly looking for cheaper products and weve observed grocers private label products increasing their share discount retailers such as aldi are boasting a greater share of sales all at the expense of higher priced supplier brands
3189478 our findings prove that aldi is enjoying a market share disproportionate to their expanding 170 odd store footprint in australia
3189479 our panel shows healthy percentages of cost conscious families and retirees choosing aldi where its available whats more surprising is that an unexpectedly large proportion of higher income families also frequent the discount supermarket chain this is further eroding into the sales of supplier branded grocery lines and therefore the retail sales of the major supermarkets
3189480 for lower income households you would expect convenience to lose priority against more pressing demands
3189481 at the moment lifestyle choices and habits seem to prevail our analysis is showing that low income segments continue to eat out but as with grocery shopping they are trading down where people are eating out they are increasingly choosing the less expensive option such as fast food restaurants
3189482 last year breakfast was the leading growth occasion in eating out
3189483 the latest trends show that more than a third of respondents intend to reduce the number of breakfasts they have out of the home but again this varies across segments of the consuming households there will be an opportunity for some players to pick up this market share but whether this drifts to drive thru fast food or to cereal and toast at home remains to be seen

3189561 so here is my question are these bikers taking anything they can get their hands on without regard to whether the drug is effective at improving performance
3189562 what shocks me about people who indulge in sports doping is not that they would dare it is that they seem to be going about it in a shockingly stupid way ignoring both the methods of testing and the likely actions of the drug
3189563 our analyses show greater male variability although the discrepancy in variances is not large

3189569 these items have not been paid for in a standard way
3189570 all these things exist and im drawing the connections between them and in a way thats what im asking people to do
3189571 i love the concept that this is a business and that ive got very important business things to do at the end of the day thats a fallacy even when youre working in a tower on park avenue its not like you cant just walk outside and end the illusion that youve got your suit on and youre very important
3189572 i dont have a lot of ability to be pleasant on a superficial level and for first impressions the wardrobe cuts through that

3189574 readily sacrificed his populism on the altar of deficit reduction he contracted out he got rough with the federal work force he even considered privatizing social security in his own centrist way

3189583 we were scared for our lives we only knew that someone on the other boat had a means to kill us we didnt know if they were rational or trusting that we would not push the button being threatened with the possibility of a horrible death we decided that we had to defend ourselves against possible harm
3189584 2 if they get to midnight with know exploded boats the joker will detonate both
3189585 instead of pulling over for this cop im going to keep driving and hope he has a heart attack before he catches me or reports my license go go go

3189587 they refused to participate in a contrived moral delima that forced them to act with brutality

3189601 the baptist state convention of north carolina bscnc and the international mission board of the southern baptist convention imb announced today a joint commissioning service for southern baptist missionaries on nov 11 2008 at the 178th annual session of the convention the imb commissioning service is a time when missionaries and the churches from which they come gather for worship prayer the reading of holy scripture and preaching in preparation for their deployment to the field of service rarely are they convened outside of local churches but at the request of north carolina baptist leadership the imb approved the appointment service to coincide with the state conventions annual meeting
3189602 the sacred trust given us by the churches of the southern baptist convention
3189603 we are about making sure that those who are called of god for service with us are prepared and carefully deployed in ways which would be the best for them and their family as they work to win people to the lord
3189604 and we do not allow or any sort of magical thinking to enter our work especially in muslim countries where becoming a christian could easily result in death
3189605 anyone who listens to this podcast will come away with not only a better understanding of the mission and day to day operations of the international mission board but a greater understanding of missiology in general and how the imb is working to saturate the world with the gospel of the lord jesus christ
3189606 the vital work of the imb and the partnerships of local churches to pray give and encourage cannot be overstated and these imb leaders represent some of southern baptists finest statesmen
3189607 this is a hard problem all the people who are smaller than them are telling them how to fix it and all the people bigger than them are staying quiet because theyve been there before
3189608 those who use hadoop in practice dont write about it why because theyre adults who dont care about getting on the front page of digg
3189609 there are over 15 000 high school dropouts between the ages of 15 25 in our area
3189610 they all run the risk of having fewer opportunities in life one of the best things we can do to improve their future and in doing so to improve hamilton county is to be successful in obtaining their life affirming commitment to get their high school degree
3189611 dropping out is a crisis that has long term impact on the individual and on their community
3189612 when a young person turns their back on education we all pay getting them re engaged with education will not only make them stronger it will make this community stronger
3189613 it is good to see that tea workers have united under the banner of the morcha affiliated trade union and are participating in todays strike
3189614 such a united movement is essential to ensure that tea estate owners meet their demand
3189615 all the tea gardens in the hills were closed today
3189616 however we are not in league with any of the apex committees and are working on our own unlike the other trade unions in the industry we have lined up a number of programmes
3189617 from that date we will also start demonstrations and fasts unto death in front of the garden offices
3189618 the existing wage of workers is rs 53 90 a day in the last meeting the owners offered a hike of rs 11 10 spread over three years and another re 1 in the six months after that we did not agree to it
3189619 if the stalemate continues for the next seven days we will call an indefinite strike across the brew belt as we had done in 2005
3189620 we too want tea industry to flourish that it why we settled for less in 2005 when the industry was recuperating from a slump
3189621 but the industry is in much better position now and our demand for wage revision is practical and affordable
3189622 trade union leaders must understand that going on a strike to mount pressure on us will only make the situation more complex
3189623 we are ideologically committed to non violence and that is the reason why the movement in the hills has by and large remained non violent barring some stray incidents here and there
3189624 the party leadership is branding us as anti nationals day in and day out and goading several radical organisations to assault the hill people residing in the plains we are opposed to all kinds of retaliation from our side yet reactions happen sometimes
3189625 the people of darjeeling would be satisfied with nothing short of a separate state and this is clear to all
3189626 the initiative for the tripartite dialogue is a wise move and we would get a scope to project our view on the tangle
3189627 our signature campaign for gorkhaland received support from ministers and intellectuals of different states but sikkims half hearted response upset us as we have good relations with it this was not expected at all
3189628 the road block by our supporters was a spontaneous reaction and not under gjmm central committees directives we will definitely take disciplinary action against those responsible but sikkims response to our effort is hurting
3189629 we could have amicably solved the dispute but they chose to move the court first with due respect to the supreme court we cannot let off the nh31 stretch from future blockades because it falls within the ambit of our territory however this is notdictatorship and we still welcome them if they want to hold talks on the issue
3189630 sikkim has maintained that it wants to see darjeeling flourishing but they should understand that we give our identity more precedence over wealth yet they turned a deaf ear to our delegations requesting them to back the gorkhaland demand in their assembly
3189631 only when we elect the new chairman will we need a government representative
3189632 it is a shame that kumai had to go in this manner it would have been an honourable exit for him if he realised the writing on the wall earlier and put in his papers instead of playing hide and seek with us for all these months
3189633 little girl goes to the shopping mall with her mom
3189634 fuck you im waiting until its all clear for me to go and if you cant wait for at least 5 to 10 seconds then the hell with you youll have to just be patient and wait if you cant go in another lane
3189635 if this doesnt work then the customer can usually get better results if they request that they wish to close their account the bank will usually then transfer the call to a retention unit which will close the account if the customer insists but will often play lets make a deal to keep their business
3189636 mid to high risk customers are on a very short leash
3189637 if you do anything that even hints at being indicative of risk theyre going to do something nasty to you
3189638 if you have the ability or you have excellent credit scores and are not in a lot of debt now may be a time to open up one or two cards so you have other options
3189639 people will find us when its time to find us
3189640 green or sustainable oriented thinking has really grown in the last few years
3189641 i thought i was going to die and i wanted to die
3189642 the military is committing excesses and that is a reminder of the dirty war
3189643 now i just dont want to grow it its not a consistent crop
3189644 drug traffickers are waging a terror campaign the security of the nation is at stake
3189645 we feel a gap in our security because all of our neighbors to east and west are in some sort of security arrangement
3189646 only we participate in neither we dont want to return back to the russian security system
3189647 the last page of the cold war is not turned
3189648 membership to nato will in no way contribute to stability in the country to the contrary it will lead to additional tension
3189649 we think its very very very important that georgia and ukraine that we welcome their aspirations to be part of nato
3189650 and the president has made clear we think the best way to do that is to offer the map at bucharest and thats what the president is pushing hard for
3189651 but we shall speak out firmly against any tendencies that are damaging to our interests
3189652 were leading the protest to demonstrate to the world and to ukraine that not everybody is happy about the idea of joining nato
3189653 the nato issue creates a big problem for us with russia thats the main worry
3189654 you cant put those in the ground there its against city policy
3189655 its illegal unless youre putting up a sign for clinton
3189656 we came in with a huge disadvantage and weve introduced him more and more with pretty steady progress
3189657 if we were down here for 10 months instead of one and obama could make multiple visits im sure wed do very very well but it just came down to a matter of time and familiarity and im not sure if people got to know him well enough
3189658 an insulated bubble that nobody cared about before this campaign
3189659 its like every week somebody else is coming in to speak
3189660 i wanted to make sure we basically outsupported the clinton people
3189661 the u s dollar is getting weaker and weaker and many medium to small u s companies are in economic crisis so they need investments from china it is very good timing
3189662 pennsylvania has very good hardwood resources and the aboriginal people in the north pennsylvania woods are good workers
3189663 this is not the robert gates we have come to know
3189664 its also not the manner in which you treat each other when you have to cooperate with each other in the south of afghanistan
3189665 one of these sort of finger wagging sessions and that it got emotional
3189666 the secretary is not backing off his fundamental criticism that nato needs to do a better job in training for counterinsurgency but he is not nor has he ever criticized any particular nation for their service in afghanistan
3189667 the article was wrong in suggesting that he criticized individual countries
3189668 in fact he has routinely praised the canadians the brits the dutch and the australians who are in the fight in southern afghanistan he appreciates their service hes sympathetic for the losses they have suffered
3189669 i realize i made a serious error of judgment in receiving a payment in cash for this assignment even though it was decidedly not illegal to do so
3189670 that mistake in judgment was mine alone i apologize and i accept full responsibility for it
3189671 was ever agreeing to be introduced to karlheinz schreiber in the first place
3189672 its an unfair attempt to stain the legacy of a conservative leader
3189673 mulroney took millions in taxpayer money because he said he was libeled in the 1990s by the mere suggestion from investigators that he might have had murky financial dealings with schreiber
3189674 rap faster right here rap slow go hard right here

3189676 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3189677 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3189678 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3189679 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3189680 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3189681 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3189682 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3189683 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3189684 the countrys still pretty divided people may want a divided government they want change but im not sure that the democratic agenda has the support of a majority of americans

3189738 it gives them pride to wear their jerseys or their cheerleading uniforms or the band to wear their stuff on game day because they want to be part of something bigger than themselves so were trying to play off of that and take that same thing to the academic classroom

3189748 there is no question that georgia started this conflict with an offensive against the separatists of south ossetia because its entry to nato required a resolution to the problem but the disproportiate and continuing military attacks by russia appears to have united the european union and the u s in a call for the removal of russian troops
3189749 the fighting has now created a major refugee crisis that is spilling over to regional states
3189750 and a political crisis with fears that russia is trying to overthrow the democratically elected pro western government of georgia
3189751 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that
3189752 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3189753 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed 10 ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3189754 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3189755 might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia
3189756 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia
3189757 should coordinate with our partners in germany france and britain to seek an emergency meeting of the g 7 foreign ministers to discuss the current crisis
3189758 we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world
3189759 the u n must stand up for the sovereignty of its members and peace in the world
3189760 thats a lot of orbits and that represents a lot of miles and a lot of time
3189761 its been just a fabulous long journey of scientific discoveries with more to come
3189762 its explored entirely new grounds in terms of the ability to see things in detail and what has resulted from that is just marvelous
3189763 something like the hubble deep field which has penetrated far back in time is the kind of thing that wed always hoped to be able to do
3189764 for me its special because i used this to discover the farthest planet that has ever been discovered
3189765 my own program was to discover extrasolar planets at the farthest ranges we can see hst is the only one which can do that
3189766 personally my work in black holes would not have been possible without hst showing that nearly all galaxies contain a massive black hole in their center and that the black hole is an essential component for why galaxies look the way they do
3189767 were still doing good science with it and what appears to threaten its lifetime is not the spacecraft itself but rather our ability to send vehicles up for maintenance
3189768 what is arguably the most important contribution has been the inclusion of the public in the science from hst
3189769 the real contribution from hst has yet to be realized as it has hopefully inspired a generation of scientists to be leaders for the u s and the world

3189773 there should be plenty of meteors perhaps one or two every minute
3189774 these changes are designed to reduce the number of unnecessary consultations under the esa so that more time and resources can be devoted to the protection of the most vulnerable species
3189775 the proposed regulations will continue to protect species while focusing the consultation process on those federal actions where potential impacts can be linked to the action and the risks are reasonably certain to occur the result should be a process that is less time consuming and a more effective use of our resources
3189776 draw a direct causal link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts affecting species
3189777 as a result it is inappropriate to consult on a remote agency action involving the contribution of emissions to global warming because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3189778 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3189779 the new rules take decision making on endangered species listings out of the hands of scientists and wildlife professionals at agencies such as the u s fish and wildlife services and instead put those decisions in the hands of agencies working on projects that may be adversely affected by a listing
3189780 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3189781 we are trying to be more efficient which means not do consultations that result in a difference for the species
3189782 when we pursue consultation in situations where the potential effects to a species are either unlikely incapable of being meaningfully evaluated wholly beneficial or pose only a remote risk of causing jeopardy to the species or its habitat
3189783 sienna is being portrayed as a femme fatale and fears for her career because hollywood hates a home wrecker she hopes balthazar can get rosetta to put out a statement saying their marriage was already over they have already got friends to speak out saying he was sleeping on their sofas
3189784 its nonsense that the marriage was already over when balthazar went away in may rosetta thought it was to see his sick mum in germany but she now knows that it was to cavort with sienna in prague
3189785 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
3189786 the study shows how dopamine shapes the two main circuits of the brain that control how we choose to act and what happens in these disease states
3189787 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed it is the only thing that ever has
3189788 theres nothing wrong with the pd community that cant be fixed by whats right with the pd community
3189789 ive been running a lot i might as well do it for a reason
3189790 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3189791 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3189792 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3189793 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3189794 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3189795 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3189796 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3189797 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3189798 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3189799 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3189800 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3189801 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3189802 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3189803 60 000 japanese people watching us let alicia keys always play with us
3189804 it is a reminder to all that taking out comprehensive travel insurance is a crucial part of your holiday planning and not something that should be sacrificed to save a few pounds
3189805 our message is stay safe and have a great holiday
3189806 the lack of mortgage finance has brought the housing market to a virtual standstill with first time buyers rapidly becoming an endangered species
3189807 going forward there are signs that sales activity might pick up a little as sellers start to re evaluate unrealistic asking prices however the current confused messages from the government regarding stamp duty risks damaging any returning confidence and may discourage mobility
3189808 with less spending money than ever higher petrol prices and busier lifestyles it makes perfect sense for consumers to turn to the internet to fulfill their shopping needs
3189809 the new figures show that consumers have wholeheartedly embraced online shopping and this trend is set to continue
3189810 with 15 million households having access to broadband connections shoppers have instant access to the global online high street
3189811 you know you go through times where you feel it might not happen but you never ever give up hope
3189812 you dont ever use the word never happen its not healthy
3189813 to be in prison for 18 years for something you didnt do and then know you are going to walk out of court a free man thats a lot to take in in one day
3189814 i believe that there are others in prison like me and then there are others in prison who are guilty youve got to give it a chance to work
3189815 somebody made that decision to not feed that child and my daughter had to follow instructions
3189816 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3189817 the russian government must reverse the course that it appears to be on
3189818 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3189819 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3189820 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3189821 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government
3189822 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3189823 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3189824 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3189825 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3189826 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3189827 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3189828 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3189829 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3189830 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3189831 ghost recon begins in august 2008 with civil unrest in russia ultra nationalists have seized power in russia with plans to rebuild the government their first step is clandestine support of rebel factions in georgia and the baltic states this is where the ghosts come in to silence the invasion armed with some of the most advanced weaponry in the world the soldiers of the ghost recon force are covertly inserted into area of operations and given specific missions to curtail the rebel actions and overthrow their benefactors
3189832 bush understands that its not really about georgia but in a certain sense its also an aggression against america the russians want the whole of georgia the russians need control over energy routes from central asia and the caspian sea in addition they want to get rid of us they want regime change every democratic movement in this neighbouring region must be got rid of
3189833 this underscores the limits of western influence over russia at a time when the rest of europe depends heavily on russia for natural gas and the united states needs moscows cooperation if it hopes to curtail what it believes is a nuclear weapons threat from iran
3189834 stop stop you bully or ill set my mate on you
3189835 however simply wanting your own country isnt enough reason to get it if your region is part of georgia then its part of georgia otherwise well see a world with 100 000 different countries do you think that will lead to more or less peace hmmmmmmmmmm
3189836 voi propune pentru functia de sef dna pe doamna procuror doctor monica serbanescu intentionez sa l propun pe actualul sef al dna in functia de inalt reprezentat al ministerului justitiei pe probleme speciale de mecanism de cooperare si verificare reforma justitiei si lupta anticoruptie sau pentru functia de adjunct al procurorului sef al dna dupa ce voi avea o discutie cu acesta
3189837 aceasta este cutuma atunci cind expira mandatul procurorului sef se poate delega un interimar 90 de zile sau mai mult pina este ales un nou sef daca nici in aceasta perioada nu este numit noul sef atunci interimatul mai poate fi prelungit inca 90 de zile
3189838 din punctul meu de vedere presedintele trebuie sa respecte constitutia articolul 134 alineatul 1 propunerea de numire in functie a procurorului se ia de catre csm si nu de ministrul justitiei
3189839 nu e vorba despre o modificare a legii ci despre o punere de acord a legii cu principiile constitutionale

3189869 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3189870 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3189871 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3189872 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi theres evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city
3189873 it now appears that an effort may be under way to depose georgias duly elected government
3189874 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3189875 it is a very grim situation and a dangerous one this russian invasion recalls variously the invasion of afghanistan 1978 the invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 and soviet invasion of georgia in 1922
3189876 we dont see anything that supports they are in gori

3189886 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us

3189888 a news and media blog in the libertarian tenor with limited government overtones facilitating the flow of ideas information e commerce and inspiration within the internet freedom of net neutrality
3189889 my reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government
3189890 commerce with all nations alliance with none should be our motto
3189891 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
3189892 the happy union of these states is a wonder their constitution a miracle their example the hope of liberty throughout the world
3189893 the constitution is the guide which i never will abandon

3189896 i couldnt be happier with the horse he was a little bit green in a couple of places but this was a tough course and he proved he is a world class horse at no point did i think oh my god
3189897 it is good to get a second race out of the way it was much tougher this time especially with a hard hit out at the start
3189898 im happy with my progess and im looking forward to the semi on wednesday tomorrow today im just going to take it easy and relax
3189899 hacker is looking in good form which he hasnt been in since 2006 but all the times are looking pretty good and it is going to be a pretty tight final
3189900 i wouldnt say that i was completely happy with that race but you take a helluva lot more from races like that than if i had beaten frida comfortably but im still confident i can get a place in the final
3189901 my start was pretty slow so i had to put in a few big ones at the 1000m but i didnt get the response from my boat so that is something i have to work on and kicking on in that last 500m so i come home with a bit of a sprint
3189902 sophie balmary marie is up and down and the serbian iva obradovic was right up there in the heats so it is who wants it the most
3189903 cruz your request for an additional week to trace the disruption is denied the intel tracker has become an embarrassment get it under control or terminate it
3189904 poor misguided children of marx and coca cola you started making fun of society but now youre making fun for it
3189905 designer done live work loft all the space of a loft with the intimacy and comfort of a well appointed home
3189906 we needed this fall as part of rebalancing the economy for growth but the fall is because the global picture doesnt look too flash
3189907 the big driver is the global fall in commodity prices oil industrials metals and minerals are the main ones
3189908 but we havent really seen it reach us in terms of what commodities new zealand produces yet
3189909 the japanese housewives still seem loaded up to the hilt
3189910 thats led to a sharp fall in the aussie dollar
3189911 is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
3189912 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3189913 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3189914 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3189915 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3189916 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3189917 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3189918 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3189919 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3189920 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3189921 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3189922 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3189923 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
3189924 americas three great national challenges our economy national security and climate change can all be addressed by switching to renewable energy
3189925 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together choosing the right path and repowering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3189926 we all know our country faces tough challenges a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3189927 we can switch to smarter cleaner forms of power and take advantage of free energy sources like the wind and sun the answer is simple power our country with 100 percent clean electricity within ten years
3189928 we are taking this message to a national audience because this goal is both ambitious and attainable
3189929 meeting the challenge to repower america will deliver the affordability stability and confidence our economy needs as well as a healthy environment and it will generate millions of good american jobs that cant be outsourced
3189930 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3189931 before john mccains tour of duty in vietnam he married carol shepp a model from philadelphia on his 23rd bombing mission over north vietnam in 1967 mccain was shot down and captured
3189932 left her 4 inches shorter and on crutches and she had gained a good deal of weight
3189933 in 1979 at a military reception in honolulu mccain met cindy hensley an attractive 25 year old woman from a very wealthy politically connected arizona family cindys father jim founded the hensley and company the nations third largest anheuser busch distributor
3189934 she was lovely intelligent and charming 17 years my junior but poised and confident i monopolized her attention the entire time taking care to prevent anyone else from intruding on our conversation when it came time to leave the party i persuaded her to join me for drinks at the royal hawaiian hotel by the evenings end i was in love
3189935 hillary clinton should take on obama in denver on the convention floor whats she got to lose nada
3189936 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3189937 we are never going to say anything about his background we have to show the value of ours
3189938 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3189939 letting up to twenty thousand drug dealers out of jail
3189940 wont a single tape of wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender
3189941 if you believe that serious issues need to be raised then we have to raise them without continual hesitation and we should be pushing the envelope
3189942 hrc is the power candidate she is perceived as the favored nominee if she runs and so she has to take this position and drive it to an inevitable reality
3189943 theres no question that americans are desperately looking for change and new ways to conduct business in this country they want a new direction they want to know that their government has not forgotten them and their lives we felt that the democratic convention was a great way to kick off the momentum for change
3189944 anything you can do to change and modernize the convention is positive one of the biggest challenges is putting up something television will cover and people will want to watch
3189945 speak softly and carry a big stick and you will go far
3189946 he had a strong belief that judges should not be in the public eye
3189947 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3189948 obamas campaign has hit a soft patch this summer with november just three months off it still appears an obama outcome in massachusetts is not in question but the margin certainly is
3189949 in presidential politics color new york state blue and throw away the crayons
3189950 oklahomans have their minds made up and they arent going to change come hell or high water no matter what
3189951 alaskans for obama a rare democratic push on the last frontier
3189952 obama and mccain are doing equally well in raiding the other partys base ten percent of 2004 kerry voters favor mccain while 13 percent of 2004 bush backers are with obama in order to close the gap mccain needs to do a little bit better winning back the democrats who voted for ronald reagan and their children
3189953 it would take an exceptional turnout from young voters and black voters as well as a lot of disaffected conservatives voting for bob barr
3189954 could ralph naders entrance and exit have helped al gore the impact of decoy dynamics on consumer choice
3189955 we found that the entrance and exit of a third option the nader effect can profoundly impact consumers preference
3189956 the presence of the third alternative shifts the focus of the customer if you have two automobiles extolling their fuel efficiency while a third promotes style purchasers pay more attention to the fuel efficiency criterion then when one of the high fuel efficiency cars leaves the market the other fuel efficient car draws consumers in the case of automobiles it might be fuel efficiency and in the case of political candidates it might be health care when the third choice exits the remaining candidate with the most similar attributes becomes the favorite even if they werent before
3189957 we also call this effect the phantom decoy effect because like pre announced software that is never released these desirable options that become unavailable may never actually exist
3189958 the increase in affinity that a product may receive when a decoy option real or not is removed can mark a significant change in consumer choice
3189959 in terms of elections even a 5 percent increase in preference makes a huge difference at the ballot box
3189960 a sudden feeling of fear or anxiety that comes on suddenly is overwhelming appears to be uncontrollable and may seem to be unfounded
3189961 the wall street journal gets a gigantic miss for taking at face value the recent actions of moqtada al sadr rather than a surrender i think his recent actions are the start of hezbollah south with strong support from iran the real nature of transformation will become apparent once the united states troops are withdrawn
3189962 this will be a very interesting experiment that can never happen again
3189963 it doesnt matter if global warming is true or not we all want cleaner air
3189964 our actions over the coming few decades could create risks of major disruption to economic and social activity later in this century and in the next on a scale similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic depression of the first half of the 20th century
3189965 it doesnt matter if global warming is true or not we all want cleaner air
3189966 it doesnt matter if iraq had weapons of mass destruction saddam was a cruel and ruthless dictator who oppressed and murdered his people
3189967 once they are gone youll go back to sucking down the equivalent of a cigarette drag every time you breathe outdoors
3189968 it is all just mist does anybody think that china would ever consider cooking the books on aug 10 ap measured 604 micrograms m 3 the bbc measured 278 in another location and beijings air quality index which is supposed to be the highest of many different readings measured 82
3189969 it is our choices harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities
3189970 im thirsty can you point me to the soda pop aisle
3189971 people want choices people want the opportunity to make their own decisions
3189972 they come in and they look and they go were overwhelmed
3189973 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
3189974 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
3189975 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
3189976 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around
3189977 the era of choice the ability to choose and its transformation of contemporary life
3189978 follow me unless you have something more interesting going on
3189979 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together
3189980 we are fellow americans and that shared distinction means more to me than any other association
3189981 theres no way were going back to the times of zachary taylor
3189982 its not is too much information bad its how do you manage within an environment that does provide all information and will continue to provide all information
