1970156 purgatorio marc heinrichs blog is only a few months old and today he got more hits than i did
1970157 marc we usually read your post daily for some great laughs
1970158 if youve never visited purgatorio its time the guys got a sense of humor that wont stop
1970159 i just added purgatorio to my blogroll for good reason marc heinrich is a witty christian hedonist from minnesota surprisingly who blogs entirely through the medium of pictures more importantly he also likes radiohead go check it out its not the usual fare in biblio blogging and its worth your time express enough interest and maybe hell invite you to stay at his house
1970160 marc you are an instigator arent you that is one reason why purgatorio is great
1970161 usually pot shot takers arent ecumenical enough for my taste or funny enough but this site is exceptionally funny and not so mean spirited
1970162 there are very few christian bloggers that are consistently able to write funny posts marc heinrich is not one of them he is able to be consistently funny while writing almost nothing and that is why his blog is one of my favorites
1970163 im chocking over here i will just come right out and say it what i visited and that blob site is garbage my soul within me is burning are you guys serious cmon what is this blog im disgusted
1970164 my favorite place for funny or weird photos that say more about people than words can
1970165 one of the truly unique efforts in the christian blogosphere
1970166 be perjoritive if you like i beleive you will see that my readers will discern which of us is a kook im not the fundie here your comments prove my point big time
1970167 i really should rule 40 this blog but these kinds of posts cant be found elsewhere
1970168 id like to point out that marc is somewhat delusional from searching the internet for images that he thinks are related its kinda like the episode of voyager where seven links her alcove into the ships sensor logs and becomes hyper paranoid about the intentions of the crew and ultimately pits janeway against chakotay even though both conspiracy theories cannot be true

1970188 in the case of the encounter between european and islamic countries i believe there is a preliminary point to make which is that one should not identify the behaviour of hundreds of millions of people or even more than a billion people with their religion so i do not think that there is such a thing as the encounter between the west and islam to me this is a already a way of formulating the encounter that vitiates and perverts the nature of the encounter muslims are not a special subspecies of the human race entirely determined by their religion compared to the chinese indians and europeans who behave according to all sorts of impulses and determinations
1970189 there is no such a thing as the encounter between the west and islam

1970194 after falling almost entirely under ottoman rule in the end of the 14th century the bulgarian state ceased to exist as an independent entity and remained part of the ottoman empire for nearly five centuries until 1878 the period is widely regarded as a time of cultural and national decline as contrasted to the best years of the medieval bulgarian empire mainly owing to the foreign character of the dominant empire as well as its stagnation and decline in the later years

1970244 tough luck guys youre on your own in this one
1970245 we are talking about a huge strain being put on our welfare services in a very short period of time and this will cause problems it is one thing receiving x amount of money per asylum seeker from the udi but its a totally different thing having to expand the welfare services hire qualified staff and find suitable premises where these services can be conducted
1970246 its easy for the staff of the udi to sit in their offices in oslo and come up with rough estimates of how much it is going to cost to find new accommodation for these people but money alone cant solve this problem when the capacity in the affected communities has reached the breaking point
1970247 some municipalities have contacted us and expressed their concerns but others have told us that they have the capacity to take on more asylum seekers the influx of asylum seekers to norway is at the moment at an all time high and it is a national responsibility for us to accept them and look after them we do inform the municipalities on a regular basis about the need to build new asylum centers but we realize that this information may in some cases have been unsatisfactory
1970248 as of today there are no such guarantees a more suitable solution would be to allow for extra funding for those police departments which simply cant cope with the increased work load that new asylum centers represent
1970249 an asylum center may take up a lot of the local police departments resources and this puts a huge pressure on the police
1970250 it is only natural that the establishment of a new asylum center like the one proposed in and ya will lead to an increase in resources for the police but in the end its up to the local chief of police to manage his staff in such a way that the local security is not compromised and that the current status quo is maintained even with the distances were dealing with in this case
1970251 again if this had happened in the usa the number of accommodations beds for these asylum seekers would be almost 710 000

1970310 the north korean leader has yet to fully verify the extent to which he has had a highly enriched uranium program theres still more steps to be done on the plutonium program so in order to get off the list the axis of evil list then the north korean leader is going to have to make certain decisions
1970311 regardless of what north korea has in mind i believe its important for the rest of the members of the six party talks to continue pursuing our objective and at times we might have to wait at times we might be difficult but we will be consistent

1970344 crude oil has been dropping for a month now and the gop actually credited themselves and their protest for that fact rather than you know the democratic crackdown on speculators or this the economists idea that hey guess what this is an illustration that consumers will eventually stop buying anything that costs too much
1970345 and whatever the actual answer is are they still helping the drilling cause by saying this when all the evidence suggests its some other reason or are they underscoring the holes in drilling by bringing attention to it
1970346 clearly nobodys going to believe that their protests brought down oil prices i think if youre going to believe anybody believe the numbers i mean demand is down and if you believe that the that the price is set at the margins then that had the impact or whatever but i dont think anybodys going to take that seriously
1970347 the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
1970348 i think the market realizes that this kind of pressure may in fact lead to a change in policy
1970349 there was another issue here that the republicans actually brought in newt gingrich yesterday some sort of day at congress to threaten a possible government shutdown if nancy pelosi does not let them vote on the offshore drilling
1970350 but part one here does the bush government actually do anything more that could be shut down or we need to worry about shutting down and part two what happened to the gop the last time that newt gingrich came in and shut down the government
1970351 well in answer to a i think the president has pretty much taken care of shutting down the government
1970352 hes had you know seven years to do it and hes done a pretty good job of it in terms of of b that didnt workout so well for them so i think they ought to go back and look at the videotape of that game it wasnt one of old timer newts better outings so i think they might want to review the film

1970366 in the process of waterboarding a person believes they are being killed and as such it really amounts to a mock execution which is illegal under international law
1970367 humor has long been a strategy for speaking the unspeakable and it is vital that we as a nation begin a dialogue about the implications of waterboarding there has been a critical shift in american ideology where previously it was unthinkable that the united states would condone the practice of torture
1970368 its about time that this uniquely american ritual of intense water horror a practice long reserved for new england witches and al qaida brass was made available to the people this project will give some everyday new yorkers the chance to experience for a few brief bone chilling seconds all the thrills of being a prisoner under interrogation at guantanamo bay and the installation is fun for the whole family

1970392 when we honestly ask ourselves which people in our lives mean the most to us we often find that it is those who instead of giving advice solutions or cures have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand the friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion who can stay with us in an hour of grief and bereavement who can tolerate not knowing not curing not healing and face with us the reality of our powerlessness that is a friend who cares

1970442 he says housing far away from job centers wont survive
1970443 weve put so much of our national wealth and even our identity into the idea of suburbia that we cant imagine having to let go of it or substantially change it
1970444 but sir when john mccain picks up this tire gauge issue and you know throws it about back and forth doesnt he just perpetuate the problem
1970445 i mean if you were advising him wouldnt you say can you leave it alone or does it work for him
1970446 no i think that the air gauge thing emphasizes how actually frivolous the obama you know proposals are with regard to energy
1970447 sure and everybody says inflate your tires more turn your thermostat up a little bit more but is that going to solve the problem sure we want conservation we should give people tax incentives to insulate their homes better and do other things to conserve energy thats not enough you cant solve this problem just by shrinking your usage youve got to produce more
1970448 the other thing is they are making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by three to four percent
1970449 its like these guys take pride in being ignorant they think its funny that theyre making fun of something that is actually true
1970450 apparently as more and more homes are passing into foreclosure and there are many and many of those homes have backdoor pools these are being neglected
1970451 theyre not being maintained and this can become a ripe feeding ground and breeding ground for these mosquito populations
1970452 most people who are infected by the virus do not become ill but 1 in 5 people develop flu like symptoms
1970453 but when gms troubles keep him up at night he can remind himself at least for now buick is chinese for success
1970454 theres plenty of talk about high gas prices but still no clear path to energy independence
1970455 so it might surprise you that mike jackson ceo of autonation the biggest car dealer in the country is happy to see 4 gas
1970456 s o were going to have to think about how do you charge for transportation in the future when cars arent going to be are increasingly not going to be fueled by gasoline
1970457 the use of gasoline is plateauing and declining thats going to accelerate as we move to plug in electrics as we move to more hybrid cars as we move to more fuel efficient cars and other forms of transportation
1970458 and so the gasoline tax as a workhorse for transportation funding i think is going to dissipate and were going to have to be more creative
1970459 s got a pilot project up and running i dont know what to think of it yet cause the results arent in but theyre charging by miles driven without regard to fuel source using some gps or electronic odometer readings and you can preferentially price if you want to encourage more hybrid or fuel efficient vehicles you can offer a preferential price for that per mile as compared to something thats bigger heavier or a truck
1970460 so the idea that were going to ride the gas tax first of all is politically untenable and its as a matter of policy its diminishing in relative and i think absolute terms
1970461 are taxpayers ready to spend the billions maybe trillions it would take to fix all the pipelines tunnels and bridges
1970462 we dont seem to have the funds or the wherewithal to repair our bridges
1970463 nobody is able to constantly solve problems in the best possible way to please every single person
1970464 ive learned that things are better left private until youre actually planning the wedding its so hard for me because im so open to hold back i could really just go on forever about this stuff

1970466 team a scores touchdown with 27 seconds remaining to pull within five and fails to recover the onside kick

1970469 i basically want to make music that is fun and that parents and kids can jump around to and have a good time to i will be singing and im learning drums and playing electric guitar
1970470 not necessary and not useful to write computer viruses to learn how to protect against them

1970472 chase was shot while running away from sheriffs deputies calvo said
1970473 he was hunted down and shot in the back while he fled

1970493 gus was emaciated when he arrived and we didnt think he was going to survive in fact as he hung out at the back door i was shocked to see that some other animal didnt take him out
1970494 we staged some tremendous demonstrations but there was no real struggle because we did not allow ourselves to win the spiritual and political leadership of the struggle set its goals on convincing and not on winning
1970495 it wanted demonstrations the youth and adults who came to save gush katif were dedicated and willing to sacrifice a lot but the settler leadership was bound to an ideology that placed the state on a pedestal above all other values many rabbis did not even support conscientious objection
1970496 whoever thinks that the state is the supreme value edges uncomfortably close to fascism
1970497 this tragedy came about because the state is sick and in a type of auto immune reaction it attacked the public most loyal to it
1970498 vandals have thrown eggs at the espresso stand and although opponents dont support the vandalism theyre glad to hear the county wont be letting the stand reopen until its baristas cover up

1970607 it can embarrass the kids and their friends and create resentment
1970608 totally wired what teens and tweens are really doing online
1970609 where it gets tricky is whats happening on social networking sites is really conversations between teens and their friends youre not just listening in on your own teen suddenly you are hearing what all their friends are doing as well
1970610 i really cant recommend that parents get accounts for the sole purpose of monitoring their children i think whats more important is parents need to engage their kids in dialogue about what is and what isnt appropriate to be posted online

1970630 the main advantage for teachers in producing their own web is that it provides a large filing cabinet of web based resources that can easily be added to and edited over time so that it gradually becomes a tailor made resource for your own students its worth noting also that there is a vast amount of free material on the web and because it is web based teachers are not dependant on the size and efficiency of the school network all that a teacher needs is an internet link and projector to make use of these resources in the classroom additionally by publishing part or all of the intranet externally these resources become available to students and teachers outside college hours and premises
1970631 there is little doubt that the internet can bring access to a much wider range of information and resources than are currently available in most classrooms

1970648 they came up with an agreed upon price to complete that work that price just happened to be under the ten thousand dollar threshold
1970649 ok im not gonna buy that mr kroma because you cant have 13 different contracts under ten grand and tell me youre not trying to circumvent this council and the state of ohio

1970672 there is no doubt that we should aim to limit changes in the global mean surface temperature to 2c above pre industrial
1970673 but given this is an ambitious target and we dont know in detail how to limit greenhouse gas emissions to realise a 2 degree target we should be prepared to adapt to 4c
1970674 i have supervised climate scientists working in the area of climate change and have followed the area closely over the years our researchers have served as authors of key ipcc report chapters i would like to share some perspectives with you
1970675 i retired four years ago and at the time of my retirement i was well convinced as were most technically trained people that the ipccs case for anthropogenic global warming agw is very tight
1970676 at this point there is little doubt that the ipcc position is seriously flawed in its central position that humanity is responsible for most of the observed warming of the last third of the 20th century and in its projections for effects in the 21st century
1970677 the case for immediate draconian measures that will have the effect or restricting world economic growth is poor
1970678 the way to a solution lies with new technology for both energy supply and for directly controlling net emissions in this regard the role of governments is not to enact restrictive economic measures via market interventions or to choose the winners in a technology race its proper role is to encourage the development and deployment of new technology through direct funding of r amp d and through tax incentives for industries that research develop and deploy such technology

1970695 i was there opening weekend for sex and the city with a group of friends in a packed theater its great to remind hollywood that not everything has to be iron man and batman
1970696 what it says to me is if you have the goods they will come
1970697 they are well known titles that became events if you satisfy the commercial potential of the brands the audience is there in droves
1970698 when you have at least one woman in a position of power such as an executive producer or director you not only get more female characters but more dimensional and powerful female characters
1970699 there are no little boys who have to compare sizes
1970700 it is really easy to be misled by a few high profile cases
1970701 go see a movie about women on the opening weekend that is what matters to hollywood
1970702 we need to build our economic power and prove were a market
1970703 the only thing that makes anyone pay attention is money
1970704 something simple enough for the athletes to put together yet stylish enough to elevate us as a country
1970705 very sharp very graphic on tv very aspirational and very statesmen like
1970706 appropriately formal for the occasion we want our young ambassadors in the best possible light as they step out onto the world stage
1970707 you really associate ralph lauren with america at this point
1970708 they have drawn so much from american heritage that it represents the country
1970709 with that usa team patch on your chest with those white rings underneath its a pretty powerful symbol
1970710 its not an easy task fitting clothes on someone whos 5 feet tall or less and someone whos over 7 feet tall
1970711 i am not sure why kelsey was even named in this suit
1970712 he was an actor who signed on to the project after the script was written
1970713 essentially except for the character names and the relationship developed between the main characters played by defendant kevin costner and his daughter the entire concept of swing vote was taken from the copyrighted work
1970714 from the church organ intro to the hip shaking beats to the final sizzling guitar solo this song is the complete package
1970715 its power chords are enough to send shockwaves through your spine
1970716 nailing this track is as rewarding as taking down an enemy fighter in a dogfight
1970717 by the sounds of it this session guitarist could have backed up jimmy page or angus young
1970718 just full of tasty licks add in a couple of signature zz top guitar pinwheel spins for an authentic take
1970719 my mom likes to say that the kicks she felt in her stomach were really me doing windmill strums
1970720 theres a big debate in air guitar circles about whether its better to actually know how to play guitar or not
1970721 i think knowing the instrument makes you overly concerned with technical elements
1970722 the judges at the world championships tend to reward technique over theatrics
1970723 its a completely atavistic response to hearing music much like dancing is
1970724 i think its what we would call studied casual which is the hardest thing to create
1970725 to flaunt their wealth but their family and their beliefs in adoption and diversity
1970726 i really look at it as the reality of the benetton campaigns
1970727 its such a nice reflection of the idea of multicultures and its evidence that hollywoods royal family is a diverse one
1970728 you cant control four children no matter how many millions youre getting paid
1970729 yes they have the maids and the nannies and the security and all of these things that go with who they are but the message is that hey were pretty regular people
1970730 its a new age of parenting where children get to do what they want
1970731 no child in my time growing up would have had blue hair
1970732 i dont think they are trying to look as wealthy as they are its about accessibility
1970733 right now theres definitely been this idea of not looking the part wealthwise the line is so blurred that fashion no longer tells people who you really are it tells them who you want to be
1970734 the soft focus colors its pure good simple and clean its absent of the frills that take the focus off the humanity
1970735 the implication of having this desire to save these children from strife and poverty implies not that you want to control them but that you want them to have the freedom to express themselves
1970736 biggest word in marketing is authenticity if they try and look too fancy people might not buy it when people are trying to be who theyre not other people can tell
1970737 but i dont mind its not a bad thing to be called
1970738 if you do too many interviews you start to believe your own press and eventually youre in danger of becoming a caricature of yourself
1970739 when youre always talking about yourself in interviews its hard to find a balance between your public image and yourself
1970740 at a certain point being around a lot of people and playing shows isnt healthy for me
1970741 i need to get off of the tour periodically i cant be away from home for long periods of time a lot of the songs get written while im in the ocean because i have time to think out there theres a connection to nature and for me its not a struggle to write the music when im surfing
1970742 we wanted to more than just lessen our impact but actually make a positive one
1970743 keith and i are both appealing to the press just to give us a little space so we can walk around sydney and show the baby our town
1970744 he appears to be cognizant of his surrounding and acknowledged his partner spencer
1970745 in one skinny mini monstrosity after another pouty posh can really wreck em
1970746 my husband works for a computer company and sometimes he gets sent out of town for six or eight weeks at a time i usually go with him we went to jacksonville florida and stayed in this cool condo one day i was super horny so when he got home i told him i wanted to screw out on the balcony we decided that if we were going to screw on the balcony in the daylight it would be an ideal spot for me to pose for nn as well
1970747 seeing the islands on tv makes me want to go there even more its so beautiful there all i need is two weeks to travel to maui waikiki oahu and maybe the big island just two weeks but dressing up like a hula dancer was fun in a way it satisfied a daydream i had it made me feel in a way that i was taking part in a hawaiian show at a hotel in waikiki if i ever get to hawaii and they pull me up on stage during a hotel show im going to wiggle better than one of their own girls can a girl can still fantasize cant she
1970748 i wouldnt be that surprised i like the way the guy carries himself hes not intimidated

1970781 the american consumer is no more prone to save than the american marine is to retreat however with joblessness rising house prices falling gasoline prices orbiting and credit contracting even americas iron wallets must adapt hovering near the zero percent marker the savings rate has little farther to fall it takes no great predictive courage to suggest that it may begin to rise which we hereby do if the savings rate returned to just half its level in 1992 it would reach 3 9 of disposable income up from 0 6 at present disposable personal income is jogging along at the rate of 10 5 trillion a year an increase in savings of 3 3 percentage points would amount to 346 5 billion of deferred spending

1970812 when you have to stand on a stage with your opponent as ive done in other campaigns you obviously have a tendency to improve the relationship when you have to spend time with somebody i think it changes the equation

1970826 from what i gather the major objection to mccains points for blogging scheme is that people actually receive something of some monetary value in exchange for their hard work whereas obamas volunteers simply bask in the glow of their smug self satisfaction

1970829 the federal communications commission formally voted friday to uphold the complaint against comcast the nations largest cable company saying that it had illegally inhibited users of its high speed internet service from using popular file sharing software the decision which imposes no fine requires comcast to end such blocking this year kevin j martin the commissions chairman said the order was meant to set a precedent that internet providers and indeed all communications companies could not keep customers from using their networks the way they see fit unless there is a good reason the case also highlights the broader issue of whether new legislation is needed to force internet providers to treat all uses of their networks equally a concept called network neutrality
1970830 the decision by the federal communications commission fcc to punish comcast for limiting web traffic to its consumers is likely to reignite a torrid battle between americas tech giants and cable providers next congress the agencys move was the first time it waded into the complex net neutrality debate the push for open unrestricted access to broadband networks by directly acting against a cable provider it could set a precedent for future penalties and provide the legal framework for legislation from capitol hill

1970885 the pope said i used to be more strict about this but the example of christ led me to become more welcoming in cases in which perhaps there is not a mature and solid faith but there is a glimmer a desire of communion with the church

1970893 this case proves once again that the military judicial system views harming innocent citizens as a public image problem and not as a moral issue
1970894 harming a bound and helpless person is a shameful and cruel act and calls for an appropriately severe response
1970895 on a daily basis against palestinian kids who throw stones
1970896 of course they dont get that but they are frequently jailed for months
1970897 we elected him and now we will support him to defeat this move
1970898 this decision was taken in haste they are playing with fire
1970899 impeachment is a device to distract attention from the restoration of the judges
1970900 i need no proof no documentation from anyone the voice of the parliament is the demand of the people
1970901 we must look at the substantial successes we have been able to achieve but also reflect on how far we have to go
1970902 governments in the past have been complicit in genocides land seizures massive environmental degradation and many other human rights abuses because indigenous peoples were denied their fundamental rights and freedoms
1970903 this shows how far we still have to go to make sure that states acknowledge and protect indigenous peoples rights for if they continue not to we have many examples of the grave results
1970904 appropriate legislative or administrative measures to prevent the acts of transnational corporations on indigenous territories
1970905 reconciliation between indigenous peoples and states can take many forms that differ from country to country
1970906 generally it involves recognition for past injustices justice for victims and the healing of relationships
1970907 the result of more than two decades of negotiations the declaration provides a momentous opportunity for states and indigenous peoples to strengthen their relationships promote reconciliation and ensure that the past is not repeated
1970908 a manifestation of reconciliation between indigenous peoples and states and a mechanism for carrying that reconciliation forward
1970909 the wider public must understand indigenous peoples rights and concerns
1970910 they must act to protect them because as the most marginalised group in this world it spells out how the rest of us will be treated and is also the surest way to protect our last remaining ecosystems
1970911 the department is not aware of karl rove playing any role in the decision to appoint mr griffin
1970912 not aware of anyone lobbying either inside or outside of the administration for mr griffins appointment
1970913 it will be as much about the cover up as about the firings
1970914 are going to tell a narrative and they have taken their investigation right into the white house
1970915 i knew that then white house political director sara taylor and taylors then deputy scott jennings had expressed interest in promoting mr griffin for appointment to be u s attorney and i assumed because they reported to karl rove that he was interested in that
1970916 in february when i participated in the drafting of that february 23 letter i did not remember then ever having talked directly to mr rove about it i dont remember now ever having talked to mr rove about it im not sure whether mr rove was supportive of mr griffins appointment
1970917 kyle didnt want to traffic in assumptions so he circulated the letter to the white house for confirmation whether what he believed to be true was accurate or not he drafted the letter according to his understanding of the facts and he circulated it beforehand to other people for clearance to assure that it accorded with their understanding of the facts
1970918 chris did not recall karls interest when he reviewed the letter
1970919 we have no record of that letter even leaving the white house counsels office
1970920 im concerned we imply that well pull down griffins nomination should pryor object
1970921 i think we should gum this to death ask the senators to give tim a chance meet with him give him some time in office to see how he performs etc they ultimately say no never and the longer they forestall the better then we can tell them well look for other candidates and otherwise run out the clock all of this should be done in good faith of course
1970922 the only thing really at work here is a repeal of the ags appointment authority there is some risk that well lose that authority but if we dont ever exercise it then whats the point of having it
1970923 im not 100 percent sure that tim was the guy on which to test drive this authority but know that getting him appointed was important to harriet karl etc
1970924 the principals never adopted it and it was never done
1970925 and i would like to thank you for what you have done for me
1970926 i think that will be a much easier phone call
1970927 some folks will have to make to washington d c
1970928 i wish you godspeed mr hamdan i hope the day comes when you return to your wife and your daughters and your country
1970929 and i hope that you are able to be a father and a provider and a husband in the best sense of the word
1970930 we feel theres a serious intention by the american forces for a withdrawal timetable at the very least
1970931 it should not be considered an end to the mehdi army but its a halfway step to dissolving the mehdi army if the u s began to implement a withdrawal timetable we shall complete the path to dissolution
1970932 it is a good step to repair our mistakes especially sectarianism and sectarian killings we are very sorry about these sectarian killings because some parties supported this violence for their own advantage
1970933 to renounce violence and participate peacefully in the iraqi political process
1970934 as of last night the schedule was one of the issues being discussed between the two sides there is no agreement yet but this is what the iraqis are asking for
1970935 if we find this does not happen and the u s forces change their stance over the timetable we can change direction also
1970936 this will not mean ending the ceasefire it will depend on whats going on on the ground
1970937 the u s is looking to streamline the command and control by making mckiernan essentially in charge of all u s forces in afghanistan so that one person can deploy them in support of the overall mission
1970938 theres little doubt that the available data shows that global average temperatures have increased rather sharply over the last 30 years

1970962 the biblical texts remain the same but verses from the vedas and upanishads ancient hindu religious texts have been used to interpret christian teachings
1970963 we are merely adapting them to christian teachings wherever we feel there are points of harmony

1970973 the georgian leadership has resorted to very aggressive actions he said
1970974 there are casualties including among russian peacekeepers this is very sad and this will incur a response

1970980 international law cannot bind a state against its will simply because we dont have a world government a world legislature or a world judicial system
1970981 the will of the international community cannot be imposed on states just like that
1970982 the court cannot order a state to change its systems
1970983 if for no other reason governments need to respect the judgments of the icj out of long term self interest
1970984 even if a state does not like a ruling of the icj it is in everybodys long term interest that we have an international system governed by the rule of law
1970985 most countries are sensitive to negative international judgments they dont want to be shamed
1970986 because it is apolitical and a relatively cheap alternative to international arbitration
1970987 i dont think this would ever have happened without the icj judgment
1970988 8 8 88 democracy uprising with the loss of an estimated 3 000 lives an opposition official said
1970989 they were all picked up and are being questioned at the moment
1970990 nobody is happy with the present situation but most people know from experience that protests will not change their lives
1970991 this anniversary is testament to the burmese peoples enduring demand for freedom and to the worlds failure to end repressive military rule
1970992 and china more than any other country has enabled the survival of the brutal burmese regime
1970993 china will continue to follow a good neighborly policy towards myanmar and work with the international community to help myanmar overcome difficulties
1970994 the american people care deeply about the people of burma and dream for the day the people will be free
1970995 australia sees the pacific as potential or actual failed states a potential source of terror and or transnational crime and or drug trafficking and or pandemics not to mention a corrosive china taiwan rivalry and accordingly fashions an iraq style fixit response
1970996 bound to fail because it fails to see the island societies economies and governments in their totality new zealanders perhaps unjustly would urge a more subtle analysis
1970997 no movements in the pacific like al qaeda or the red brigades of the 1970s which retreat into committing bloody terrorist atrocities against perceived opponents
1970998 when the australian strategic policy institute aspi warned of a developing post modern badlands in the pacific islands and politicians began talking seriously of the need for urgent pre emptive action you had to wonder whether their perceptions of the pacific were being coloured by the type of images conveyed in futuristic movies such as minority report
1970999 in that film tomorrows murderers can be identified arrested and convicted using a psychic machine before they are even conscious of having decided to commit crimes
1971000 to anyone familiar with pacific politics these images of postmodern security threats were outlandish scaremongering
1971001 stop the killing in tibet stop the killing in east turkestan
1971002 the beijing games is supposed to reflect peace and human rights but the chinese government is continuing its crackdown on our innocent people detaining and executing them
1971003 the human rights abuses of north korean refugees must stop
1971004 the plethora of different groups here represents a plethora of different causes each of them a category of human rights abuses in china
1971005 dear sexiest man alive editors note i put that in he he
1971006 the five rings of the olympic logo are known throughout the world i wish china would attach the same importance to the five interconnected principles of democracy human rights the state of law justice and peace
1971007 ive always appreciated the olympic games this year im proud of the fact that my country is hosting them for me it is an honour to receive an invitation from the government to participate in the opening ceremony
1971008 suffering for our catholic faith and for fidelity to our holy father
1971009 the authorities still dont trust chinese catholics and feel threatened when we practice our faith
1971010 the holy spirit may lead all who participate in these games to a happy conclusion
1971011 yeah these are the guys i want to party with
1971012 but they need the money and thats what we are here for
1971013 when they take the ring off their finger they get all choked up its just something you got to deal with thats just the way the economy is its trash
1971014 it is easier for them to pull a ring off their finger than to bring in a lawn mower
1971015 everything from musical equipment to the gold teeth from their mouths
1971016 i get the guy who drives up in the bentley and the people who walk in no one has cash
1971017 before the economy was booming the stock market was ok and people could spend now nothing is the same a lot more people are struggling there are more lower class than middle class
1971018 do you know how many foreclosures there are every day my aunt sells real estate and every day she has new foreclosures by banks people just dont have enough money
1971019 i dont think the country is going to go bankrupt but if the next president cant get the economy going im moving to spain
1971020 the banks have properties that are listed at 240 000 123 000 but now they are dumping them for 89 000 46 000 that seems to be their favourite price now 89 000 and we are talking a three bedroom four bath home in a nice area the banks are dropping the prices like crazy
1971021 i had a client hes a banker and he said
1971022 at one point in 2006 i was walking around with 57 cheques for 100 000 each in my pocketbook for two weeks
1971023 i had a couple of associates who were sleeping out in a tent waiting to get into the sales office to buy a condo and i saw people fighting over units hitting each other over who was going to get the last one
1971024 we cant keep that kind of book in stock as soon as they come in they go out
1971025 people are just upping and leaving for the middle class on down it is going to be a heartache
1971026 george bush spent a trillion dollars on this war in iraq what is that going to do to our grandchildren hes going to cause another great depression
1971027 i never thought that americans could do this to americans
1971028 this country is no longer an industrial power we dont even manufacture steel the saudis own 30 of wall street and dubai had to bail out citibank
1971029 these people are so clueless about what is happening beyond their compact little world they are absolutely clueless as to what the potential for economic meltdown could be you shut down the grocery store for a day and they panic look at what happens when we have a hurricane people go to stores and fight over a loaf of bread
1971030 we sold homes to young couples four years ago for 400 000 now they could only sell for 275 000 so they are walking out and losing it all this is happening in great numbers you wont see that in the newspapers
1971031 their mortgage payments may be 4 000 a month they can rent a place for 1 700 they are cutting their payments in half the only thing that can be done to them for defaulting is that their credit rating will be bad they cant arrest you it is not a crime this is happening by the thousands i have two close friends who have done this
1971032 the foreigners are coming in droves 80 of the people coming into our office are from england france germany italy between the falling prices and falling dollar they can buy here for practically nothing who wouldnt be here
1971033 if this was all reversed america would be eating up europe
1971034 your debt to land rover capital group is still unpaid
1971035 people come in here and want money they are not spending anything
1971036 our sales are completely down except for one thing golf stuff is selling its crazy the stuff you think people will not want to go out and do obviously they are not working so they go out to the range
1971037 this is going to be an explosion of economic development here as more people come down and buy their supplies and equipment down this road from the market area
1971038 it might seem silly that one road could mean that much but it does
1971039 and this part of the piedmont has turned a bright blue
1971040 growth is helping to fuel this political change in albemarle county
1971041 there are a lot of folks from new york and new jersey heading to florida
1971042 when we bought this building we had to tear it apart because cigarette smoke had turned the whole place yellow and made it stink
1971043 you pour that much money into a building and you dont want it to get ruined
1971044 people are happy to go outside and have a cigarette and come back in or just eat on the patio
1971045 we like having a bar atmosphere but we just never wanted to be associated with the smoky ones
1971046 the karin are a race of people who were targeted for genocide by the burmese government
1971047 they started fleeing 20 years ago when the democratic movement got started but it was only three years ago that the united states began to accept them now were resettling quite a few of them
1971048 has to do with a variety of cultures and ethnicities coexisting
1971049 there seems to be little of the discomfort that comes from wildly variant classes rubbing up against one another
1971050 no were not an urban center but what a great alternative we are
1971051 can we not be content being a little town with all of these wildly wonderful amenities why do we have to model ourselves on new york why cant we be a village with an atittude thats not metropolitan but cosmopolitan
1971052 lets not look to the cities for a model lets look to the world as a model
1971053 some of the samples contained toxic metals including lead in quantities as much as 100 times above levels found in uncontaminated soil and sediment samples
1971054 the nature and extent of chemical contamination found at these sites in ghana is similar to that previously exposed by greenpeace for e waste open burning sites in china and india
1971055 unless companies eliminate all hazardous chemicals from their electronic products and take responsibility for the entire lifecycle of their products this poisonous dumping will continue
1971056 electronics companies must not allow their products to end up poisoning the poor around the world
1971057 i am very confident that this will go on appeal to the court of appeals for the district of columbia if nothing else to challenge many aspects of this system
1971058 as an extraordinarily fair open and just process that produces a reliable result
1971059 we will press forward with litigating the cases already charged and to charge additional cases as soon as they are ready
1971060 we do not think that the amount of leakage would have any impact on humans or the environment
1971061 the united states assures strict procedures and prevention systems for nuclear powered warships coming into port and japan is also checking the radiation levels 24 hours a day
1971062 this area was once a safe haven for terrorists and the people here have been isolated treated badly and sometimes tortured
1971063 many citizens are jobless and uneducated meaning they could have been easily persuaded by terrorist a while back but with the help of the coalition forces and the jscc weve succeeded to be able to control our areas on our own
1971064 a reason that this area is quieter now is because of a joint effort between coalition forces ia soi and ip beating down doors to find the bad guys in yethrib
1971065 when you have bad guys who are willing to turn themselves in and take a chance at facing the death penalty in the judicial system than to continue running that represents a huge success
1971066 thank the coalition forces for helping the bad guys change their ways
1971067 i would like to see all of iraq follow the example set here in yethrib
1971068 our country would be a lot safer if other areas did the same
1971069 was the seventh instalment of the new human rights dialogue series a 12 part monthly series in commemoration of the sixtieth anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights
1971070 dont piss down my back and tell me its raining
1971071 the lieutenant colonel who was on the plane asked me if id like to ride up front and i said sure nix said
1971072 when i got to the cockpit he explained that i was the 200 000th passenger i thought he was just messing with me just joking around a little
1971073 we knew our 200 000th passenger would be aug 5 we presented him a flag that wed flown all day along with a squadron coin and a certificate
1971074 i thought it was cool i wasnt expecting all that on a regular flight
1971075 they let me see everything they do on the flight deck there are so many checks they have to do before they can fly but it was a lot more comfortable in the cockpit than in the belly of the aircraft
1971076 you couldnt ask for much more not too many other jobs give you a housing allowance or full medical insurance i feel lucky for that
1971077 so in 2 years weve moved the equivalent of every man woman and child in little rock
1971078 this is one of the places where you really feel like youre doing the mission
1971079 nuclear weapons were created by humans and it is our responsibility to eliminate them before they eliminate us
1971080 there is much we still dont know about the candidates positions
1971081 both state in general terms that they favor the goal of a nuclear weapons free world neither of them however has discussed seeking to achieve a nuclear weapons convention a treaty that would set forth a roadmap for the phased verifiable irreversible and transparent elimination of nuclear weapons
1971082 between the two candidates senator mccains positions seem more cautious and sketchy
1971083 obama has come out in favor of removing u s nuclear weapons from hair trigger alert not developing new nuclear weapons ratifying the comprehensive test ban treaty and achieving a verifiable global ban on the production of new nuclear weapons material
1971084 well have major progress on nuclear issues no matter who is elected
1971085 it debunks the common view that obama is the most liberal democratic senator and it debunks the view that mccain is really the third bush term
1971086 adds significantly to the complications of controlling nuclear materials and preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons
1971087 obama also focuses much more on securing loose unsafe nuclear materials
1971088 both mccain and obama represent a departure from the status quo
1971089 acknowledges the unacceptable risks nuclear weapons pose merely by their existence
1971090 at the end of the day what really matters is how each one would respond to a crisis situation
1971091 while both candidates appear to take nuclear proliferation seriously the difference in their worldview is of utmost importance
1971092 the only sure way to prevent nuclear terrorism is to rid the world of nuclear weapons
1971093 in the seventh decade of the nuclear age there is a glimmer of hope that new leadership in the united states may pave the way forward toward a world free of nuclear weapons
1971094 what is incompatible with p is what is incompatible with everything compatible with something compatible with p
1971095 we are planning to conduct a full and thorough investigation
1971096 dont piss down my back and tell me its raining
1971097 cheneys been very effective in setting up his deniability and always being the failsafe for bush unless they start waterboarding the vice president which it not too likely he is the man the trail ends right there
1971098 dont piss down my back and tell me its raining
1971099 when i was a kid i used to pray every night for a new bicycle then i realized that the lord doesnt work that way so i stole one and asked him to forgive me
1971100 there was an agreement that negotiations will continue between the representatives between political blocs
1971101 this is normal to reach to common points and then theres another entity that rejects them
1971102 dont piss down my back and tell me its raining
1971103 so what caused that and what caused that and what is the root cause and are we treating the root cause
1971104 dont piss down my back and tell me its raining
1971105 i think it is important to remember why we are here
1971106 there were many people at the scene to help assess damages care for the wounded and pick up the pieces
1971107 three of our comrades perished that day and no one there felt it harder than spc harvey who was one of the first to respond only to find that it was his brother in law who was among the fallen
1971108 his brother was carrying a bible at the time of his demise and small pieces lay strewn about the area
1971109 he did not ask for help or sympathy while gathering the pieces or while escorting his brother in laws remains i watched in amazement how determined he was in finding every scrap
1971110 my job here is to provide good benefits and low prices to facilitate the life of the soldiers here in iraq we hope that they are going to help us rebuild iraq and to establish a new country after what happened in 2003 you are welcome in iraq and we are helping you as much as you are helping us
1971111 i like it because it is closer to where we are at and we can get more people over here i like the people its a real good opportunity because the others are so far away and its hot out there no one wants to go out this one is closer and makes it a lot easier on the soldiers
1971112 i think its great a good opportunity to get some of the cultural gifts
1971113 asvab is well known as an aptitude screen for military enlistment
1971114 feel that the test is a recruiting tool they and their families are hesitant about taking it
1971115 students werent coming to school on the day of the asvab they were uncomfortable taking the test
1971116 the program is most important to students to give them choices to let them see what kind of opportunities are out there what their skills and abilities are
1971117 provide the military services with access to the high school market and recruiters with prequalified recruiting leads
1971118 im strong in a hands on job not really good for like medical services im good in science like in chemistry or biology but not as doctor or dentist or nurse
1971119 they told me that my score was really good and they went on to explain the benefits of their branch
1971120 you were assigned by your last names to certain rooms they didnt even tell us what we were doing
1971121 it was take the asvab just like take the pssas just like all the standardized tests
1971122 if a kid is interested in the military they find a way to contact a recruiter
1971123 a lot of career advisers see the value of the asvab but a lot of kids didnt want the information released to the military
1971124 if you go to the asvab career exploration web site they dont mention even what the acronym stands for
1971125 we havent changed the name or disguised the name of the program
1971126 taking the sats or acts for college prep kids this is a similar test for a trade union or an apprenticeship program
1971127 kids are afraid to take the test because they are afraid they might have to go into the military and thats not the case at all
1971128 we warn them that the recruiters may be calling them we say if youre not interested ignore them
1971129 dont piss down my back and tell me its raining
1971130 it affects not only the people involved in it but the people who have to live around it as well
1971131 dont piss down my back and tell me its raining
1971132 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
1971133 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
1971134 no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the dnc and with the obama campaign
1971135 maksudnya adalah tak peduli seberapa padat jadwal kita bila kita mau berusaha sekuat tenaga maka pasti kita bisa mengerjakannya

1971144 guantanamo bay has become a global symbol of impunity and inhumanity

1971146 guards then cuffed and chained him and took him to an interrogation room where he was left for several hours writhing in pain his clothes soaked while air conditioning blasted in the room and his body burning from the pepper spray
1971147 there is no doubt that we should aim to limit changes in the global mean surface temperature to 2c above pre industrial
1971148 but given this is an ambitious target and we dont know in detail how to limit greenhouse gas emissions to realise a 2 degree target we should be prepared to adapt to 4c
1971149 so even if we get the best possible global agreement to reduce greenhouse gasses on any rational basis you should be preparing for a 20 risk so i think bob watson is quite right to put up the figure of 4 degrees
1971150 my own feeling is that if we get to a 4 degree rise it is quite possible that we would begin to see a runaway increase
1971151 no other single factor focussed the minds of the cabinet more than the analysis that i produced through that we begin to have to talk about ordered retreat from some areas of britain because it becomes impossible to defend
1971152 theres no choice here between adaptation and mitigation we have to do both
1971153 at 4 degrees we are basically into a different climate regime
1971154 i think that is a dangerous mindset to be in thinking through the implications of 4 degrees of warming shows that the impacts are so significant that the only real adaptation strategy is to avoid that at all cost because of the pain and suffering that is going to cost
1971155 there is no science on how we are going to adapt to 4 degrees warming it is actually pretty alarming
1971156 this would allow coal fired power plants that are currently being built to be modular and capable of having carbon capture retrofitted and would show the world that we take the issue of climate change seriously thus demonstrating real leadership without this technology we have a real problem
1971157 this offsetting effect which is equivalent to about 100 parts per million of carbon dioxide will largely disappear if china and india follow the lead of the us and europe in limiting sulphur emissions the cause of acid deposition

1971191 our findings suggest that local fat deposits rather than total body fat are most related to calcified coronary plaque inflammatory mediators released from pericardial fat may promote inflammation in local coronary arteries and lead to coronary atherosclerosis
1971192 because coronary heart disease kills so many people it is imperative to find new treatments and prevention strategies
1971193 this study suggests that rofecoxib and valdecoxib were associated with higher stoke risk than other nsaids
1971194 because of this and other studies their withdrawal from the market is appropriate and these medications should not be re introduced especially since safer alternatives are available
1971195 since all nsaids including coxibs can raise blood pressure and increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding we believe that caution is warranted especially with long term use of these medicines
1971196 the primates council of gafcon will wish to study the outcome of the lambeth conference carefully and consult with those they are leading they are meeting towards the end of august and will make their response following that meeting
1971197 we have been praying for the lambeth conference and now that it has ended we look forward to talking with those who were there it seems it has fulfilled the desires of the archbishop of canterbury and we also look forward to hearing from him
1971198 our absence focused minds on the problems within the communion and spoke louder than our presence would have however the issues which have caused such division are still before us and require decisive action so that the mission of the church will not be further impaired
1971199 in fear and trembling expecting either a distasteful encounter between those of vastly different opinions or the cold shoulder from those who disagree the overwhelming reality has been just the opposite
1971200 one of the problems is that a lot of people dont realize that they are having a stroke
1971201 there still needs to be a lot of education in the community for people to recognize these symptoms and when you recognize them call 911
1971202 there is also delay time among people who get to the hospital quickly so there is room for the medical community to act
1971203 once you get there you need to be diagnosed theres a very narrow window in which you can get treatment
1971204 we found that women were less likely to get timely treatment
1971205 also treatment was faster in hospitals that were certified stroke centers which have a formal plan for diagnosis and treatment
1971206 children with simple febrile seizures had a risk of death similar to the background population whereas those with complex febrile seizures febrile seizures triggered by a temperature below 39 degrees c and febrile seizures occurring before 12 months of age had a twofold higher mortality lasting for about two years the excess mortality was at least partly due to pre existing neurological abnormalities and subsequent epilepsy parents should be reassured that death after febrile seizures is very rare even in high risk children
1971207 our results suggest that the beauty shop is a potentially excellent educational setting for stroke and other health issues for black women and should be used in future studies

1971225 he says its not about democracy its about profits the american public and policy makers have to decide whether journalism is produced purely for the reaping of profit or if its a central component to a functioning participatory democracy
1971226 you make policy accordingly there is no such thing as a deregulated media policy system the only question is will the media be regulated for the largest media corporations or regulated on behalf of the american public thats what all of our anticonsolidation efforts are about

1971250 we have to get each cow to his or her feet and they have to move out a bit so we can check them over in a day i typically look at 5 000 head on the weekends itll be 10 000 my horses learn that each and every cow has to get up and they actively cooperate getting the job done if the calves are little and spooky we will try to calm them down by the way that we walk thru the pen if they are fat and lazy well trot thru the pen to stir up energy which transfers to the cattle
1971251 sometimes itll just be 2 or 3 pens and sometimes we have 6 or 7 to ship how long shipping takes doesnt actually depend on how many pens we have to ship but where they are located in the yard if they are at all 4 corners of the yard then itll take longer than if we have 6 in the same alley
1971252 we have to take them out of the pens now at this yard it is fairly easy cause we actually spend time training our cattle to respond to being moved by our horses it typically takes us 2 minutes to shoot 300 head out of a pen and into the alley
1971253 these cows are fat so moving the cows down the alley towards the shipping pens is a tricky business we dont wanna run them or stress them cause it heats the fat cattle up too much and when they get butchered the meat will have a bad flavor and sometimes even a darker appearance so we try to move them towards the shipping pens as calmly and easily as possible
1971254 vaccinating for example is one of those situations where it gets tuff
1971255 we all work together pretty good each at the spot where we are the best im often in the spot to push cattle into the tub using my horse ill use a stick with a plastic bag on the end to spook the cattle into motion if you handle that plastic bag just right you can usually get the cows to file into the snake fairly easy it dont take the horses long to figure out that the plastic bag makes their job easier even tho its flying by their head all the time

1971260 i was in the westbound lane on detroit road coming up towards quaker steak when a car coming flying by me on my left side the car got into the left turn lane then cut me off before crossing the intersection and hitting the motorcycles
1971261 if the driver had been going at a normal speed i believe the driver would have been able to stop in time but she had to be going 50mph and it just didnt seem like she was paying attention
1971262 when we arrived on scene the car had already fled and we found one motorcycle down and two victims on the road both victims were wearing their helmets we transported both of the victims because of the mechanism of the crash being struck by a car and we had assistance from avon fire paramedics in treating and transporting the victims
1971263 right now we are looking for an older model ford escort white in color and it will have front end damage witnesses also tell us that it was a female driver
1971264 i first saw the motorcycle go by then the van and then for whatever reason the woman in the van just crashed right into the back of the bike
1971265 as soon as i heard the crash i looked up and saw the man go flying up in the air and he landed on top of the van and then rolled off and onto the road it was a very scary sight i thought he was going to be dead
1971266 i was worried that he was dead we sent the kids back into the house because we didnt want them seeing that but the man started talking to us although he was very confused he kept saying that he was under the van

1971276 bill clinton says that barack obama may not be ready to be president
1971277 y ou could argue that no one is ever ready to be president
1971278 i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in my first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different
1971279 hes shown a keen strategic sense in his ability to run an effective campaign he clearly can inspire and motivate people and energize them which is a very important part of being a president and hes smart as a whip so theres nothing he cant learn
1971280 i think saying that you are the a citizen of the world talking to 200 000 germans is very dangerous because the average american does not want to elect a president of the world

1971282 i think saying that you are the a citizen of the world talking to 200 000 germans is very dangerous because the average american does not want to elect a president of the world to use up america in order to make the rest of the world feel good

1971291 mccains 95 percent support for bush score for last year was the highest in the chamber
1971292 in that campaign ad and were gonna play it for you tonight on television when obama says that mccain voted uses the sound bite that mccain says i voted with bush 90 percent of the time
1971293 the mccain people could go back and get obama statements that are five years old and turn them around and club him with them
1971294 now you may have noticed the mccain statement about bush was made more than five years ago when the country was a far different place
1971295 now obama tax cuts for millionaires thats just bunk tax cuts for millionaires its just bull so everybody knows thats bull
1971296 in contrast to obamas proposed tax plan the mccain plan would provide virtually no benefit to households in the bottom quintile and very modest benefits to those in the next three quintiles the top quintile would receive a tax cut of more than 3 percent of after tax income within the top quintile the richest 1 percent of households would receive an average tax cut of 3 7 percent that figure rises to almost 4 7 percent for the top 0 1 percent of the income distribution

1971299 the completely browser based ways of looking into the virtual world do not provide very much in the experientially and so its difficult you kind of have to look at use model to use model there are people today who have used the second life open source code and theyve actually written um for example chat based clients

1971319 i think that the google partnership was something that was important to us because we had a partnership with google for quite a while and enhancing that partnership with this deal was really key to the overall startegy that we have to really get into the advertising market in a big way and really help to sort of offset the decline in subscription revenues that were getting

1971342 t he white house had concocted a fake letter from iraqi intelligence chief tahir jahil habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohamed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda
1971343 the idea was to take the letter to habbush who had been
1971344 the use of armed force against iraq is consistent with the united states and other countries continuing to take the necessary actions against international terrorists and terrorist organizations including those nations organizations or persons who planned authorized committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on september 11 2001
1971345 still believe s there is no evidence that iraq was involved in september 11
1971346 story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1971347 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge
1971348 was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1971349 an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq
1971350 dont have sex until youre married and then once you get married have sex
1971351 thats an answer that obviously doesnt work for queer christians when premarital sex has been declared while at the same time disallowing us the right to marry leaving us no church sanctioned option but to remain celibate which last i read in the scriptures was for a gift of divine calling rather than a condition for divine acceptance
1971352 how can my sexuality and sexual behavior be lived out within the framework of my faith and love for god can i be sexual in a way thats both sexually satisfying and spiritually life giving can i stand before god unashamed in my wholeness as a spiritual sexual being
1971353 obama cant point to a single instance in which sean hannity or talk radio
1971354 cant point to a single instance in which president bush or mccain or karl rove or sean hannity or talk radio or any other major republican has made an issue of obamas race
1971355 as more is learned about barack obamas positions his past and his affiliations it seems that the change candidate has all the same problems with race as those before him
1971356 its only fair to ask do the obamas have a race problem of their own
1971357 said that sen barack obama is not patriotic or that hes got a funny name
1971358 cant point to a single instance in which president bush or sen john mccain or former white house senior adviser karl rove or sean hannity or talk radio or any other major republican has made an issue of obamas race
1971359 as more is learned about barack obamas positions his past and his affiliations it seems that the change candidate has all the same problems with race as those before him
1971360 its only fair to ask do the obamas have a race problem of their own
1971361 because of the belief that blacks must join in solidarity to combat a white oppressor
1971362 go ing with a veritable rookie whose only chance of winning is that hes black
1971363 so its just they just forgot that one thing affirmative action for black guys and if they had remembered to oppose that then they wouldnt face the situation they face today
1971364 i f barack obama were caucasian they would have taken this guy out on the basis of pure ignorance long ago
1971365 barack obama has picked up another endorsement halfrican american actress halle berry
1971366 as a halfrican american i am honored to have ms berrys support as well as the support of other halfrican americans obama said
1971367 not really african american hes arab forty three percent arab 6 percent african negro and half white and that is the biggest fraud being perpetrated on us all
1971368 according to this genealogy and again because i havent done the research i cant verify this but according to this guy kenneth lamb barack obama is not black african he is arab african
1971369 and yet this guy is campaigning as black and painting anybody who dares to criticize him as a racist i mean that is it is the biggest con i think ive ever seen
1971370 in my opinion cause my opinion is your average white guy
1971371 is not allowed to wear the african american badge because his family are not the descendants of slaves ok he cant identify with the discrimination and the slavery and all of that thats gone into these black families for generations
1971372 i get offended and i know i have many black friends who get offended when he obama stands in front of that black audience talking like hes from the hood born and raised and can identify with all of their issues he cant
1971373 you dont know what barack obama stands for you just like him because hes hes hes like you and you want to see one of you up there and you dont care what he stands for
1971374 h es not one of me hes not one of me just because hes a black guy or something like that that doesnt make him one of me hes standing for him not me
1971375 y ou are the third or fourth caller in a row who is has identified yourself to associate producer christine as african american and when i talk to you you obviously are smart well educated well read and all that and i think that your loyalty to obama here is an issue that goes beyond the issues
1971376 it is a racial solidarity bond you have with obama tell me i dare you to deny that
1971377 he is lying to your face but he knows you are so you so identify with him on the basis of race you will not even see the lies
1971378 the mainstream media has dubbed obama to be african american
1971379 if you start to you know delve around the edges say wait a minute isnt he mixed race werent we told that last year or whatever biracial not allowed to say that anymore
1971380 as a white guy y ou dont notice that he is black so he might as well be white you know what i mean
1971381 i guarantee you there will be blogs today that will have me being a racist because i say that
1971382 i f sen hillary clinton wants to be consistent i believe affirmative action she should give barack obama an additional five percentage points just for the years of oppression
1971383 house leadership aides pushed back against interpretations of this comment as self aggrandizing
1971384 o ne leadership aide said the full quote put it into a different context
1971385 indeed as noted the leadership aides version of the quote is entirely consistent with numerous other statements obama has made over the last two years
1971386 my colleague jonathan weisman and i believe the quote was correct as written and that this supposed context is a recreation after the fact by democratic aides who were worried about how the quote looked
1971387 t his is the same candidate who had said former clinton white house special counsel lanny davis this is the moment that the world has been waiting for ive become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions you know im not dismissing the fact he is an enlivening engaging candidate but the messianic thing is getting a little over the top is it not
1971388 i n fact it may be because that ad suggested sen barack obama is going to raise taxes
1971389 maybe thats the real obama vulnerability if they start talking about how hell raise your taxes
1971390 senator mccains tax cuts would primarily benefit those with very high incomes
1971391 senator obama offers much larger tax breaks to low and middle income taxpayers and would increase taxes on high income taxpayers
1971392 in a browser you cant render a 3d environment with sound lighting shadows the actual sort of world of warcraft like you know uh most people have seen that the real 3d rendered experience
1971393 theyre going to figure out that they dont need to control this from the top down these companies will still get put together but theyre only going to be connected at the balance sheet and at the level of finance information technology levels the playing field
1971394 we are still very early in the functionality and adoption of virtual environments in general the majority of people who try out virtual worlds and second life is definitely the leader in that overall category dont stay
1971395 i guarantee you that you would remember the content of this conversation better than you would driving in your car and talking on the phone i guarantee you would have laughed once or twice when i put on a funny hat or changed clothes with my avatar
1971396 we have to do a tremendous amount of innovation and product work and technology work to grow beyond where we are now i think its best for the company if i reserve a large amount of my time to contribute there
1971397 the first thing i would say about any true educational system is that it is not founded on the notion that we are preparing a child for life the theory we are preparing the child for life or for the future is a terrible travesty which betrays every facet of the human being we dont prepare for life we equip the child with the means to live fully at whatever stage they are in the idea were going to train a child at seven to get a good job at age twenty seven is a travesty of profound dimension it makes for a world where every 78 seconds a child is attempting suicide as is true today it is this kind of terrible despair we breed in our children when we dont see the difference between preparing and equipping our children to be present to life
1971398 mutations in the metaphoric fabric of our semantic word built universe
1971399 we have attempted to show all known claims agreed boundaries and one thing that has not appeared on any other maps which is the number of areas that could be claimed by canada denmark and the us
1971400 ive been out throwing footballs and its still the same routine
1971401 i was like im satisfied this is awesome either way
1971402 ive been in this business for about 10 years and i cannot remember ever hearing about a student athlete winning a portion of the lottery
1971403 barack obamas campaign credits small donors as the big reason for their big fundraising numbers so how much has obama raised from people who gave at least 1 000 one hundred and twelve million dollars
1971404 thats one third of obamas total haul 112 million thats more than john mccain
1971405 barack obamas campaign credits small donors as the big reason for their big fundraising numbers but according to todays new york times obamas not hurting for money from the fat cats the rich people so how much has obama raised from people who gave at least 1 000 one hundred and twelve million dollars
1971406 thats one third of obamas total haul 112 million thats more than john mccain even more than hillary clinton managed to raise in her campaign obamas 112 million from big time donors
1971407 of going to a gym rather than visiting wounded troops
1971408 accused him obama of going to a gym rather than visiting wounded troops
1971409 i can attest to the fact that he did visit troops in iraq only four or five days earlier that there was no notice of it that i confirmed that it happened but they had no video of any type and no reporters and that hes been to walter reed so lets at least get that off the table
1971410 sixteen years ago the democratic party refused to allow robert p casey sr then the governor of pennsylvania to speak at its national convention because his anti abortion views stemming from his roman catholic faith clashed with the partys platform and powerful constituencies
1971411 have always said that had casey not declined to endorse mr bill clinton in 1992 he would have been allowed to speak to the
1971412 sen john mccain opposes tax increases and sen barack obama favors them
1971413 sen john mccain opposes tax increases and sen barack obama favors them
1971414 barack obamas plan will provide 80 85 billion in tax relief to americas workers seniors and homeowners
1971415 a new making work pay tax credit of up to 500 per person or 1 000 per working family
1971416 will provide the average recipient with approximately 500 per year in tax savings
1971417 all income taxation of seniors making less than 50 000 per year
1971418 you already know the old argument republicans cut taxes democrats raise them
1971419 scherer further reported that when taking into account obamas proposal to roll back the bush tax cuts for the wealthiest americans and the
1971420 t he net effect according to experts in both campaigns and independent analysts would be a reduction in government revenue over 10 years in other words a tax cut
1971421 there is nothing thats off the table i have my positions and ill articulate them but nothings off the table
1971422 meeting with us last december before the primaries mccain declared that i will not agree to any tax increase repeating the phrase for emphasis he did not say any tax increase with the exception of social security
1971423 drew a strong response monday from the club for growth a washington anti tax group
1971424 shocking because you have been adamant in your opposition to raising taxes under any circumstances
1971425 john mccain is claiming that he is also getting money from big oil the question here is sen barack obamas getting that same money so isnt he a bit of a liar claiming mccain is the man guilty of getting big oil money
1971426 john mccain is claiming that he obama is also getting money from big oil the question here is obamas getting that same money so isnt he a bit of a liar claiming mccain is the man guilty of getting big oil money
1971427 another day brings a dishonest attack from john mccain while senator obama has proposed cutting taxes for 95 percent of american families what hes not telling us is that he wants to give 4 billion in tax credits to the oil companies and continue giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas and provide no direct tax relief
1971428 t he fervor inspired by mr barack obamas history making candidacy poses challenges just as it partially obscured mrs hillary clintons own assault on the glass ceiling limiting women in politics it has overshadowed mr john mccains war hero biography and reputation as a maverick
1971429 mr mccains maverick stances could strengthen his brand of republicanism by distinguishing it from that of a president with an approval rating around 30 percent moreover race based resistance to mr obamas bid to become the first black president will prove greater with the general electorate than inside the left leaning universe of democratic primary voters
1971430 a ny campaign has to have message discipline to try to succeed the problem is that john mccains message is not inherently coherent because of who he is yes he is a maverick yes hes also a conservative republican
1971431 well i think with john mccain he doesnt fit the our political types quite as neatly as some other potential nominees might have i think they see somebody who sort of shines through as a maverick a hero the whole vietnam war hero thing
1971432 a way for john mccain who has been such a maverick to try to unify the republican party
1971433 y oure going to see a lot more of that maverick status beginning tomorrow night david when he gives that speech on tuesday night in louisiana even more forcefully distancing himself from president bush and were going to see some of that john mccain we saw in 2000
1971434 and in this election who rose to the top but not the establishment candidates not the off the rack republican mitt romney or the establishment candidate hillary clinton its john mccain maverick at odds with bush on some things
1971435 energy is where the divide gets fuzzier clinton favors a cap and trade system to regulate carbon emissions obama favors the same thing but so does john mccain so often a maverick republican
1971436 you know john mccains brand chris has been pretty well established since 2000 hes likable hes a maverick hes a war hero all of that redounds to his benefit
1971437 yeah but he obama is really a liberal democrat and thats his program
1971438 o ne main point in this book is that barack obama is much more liberal than people think and the national journal reported back in january that obama voted liberally in 65 out of 66 votes that were posed to him they say that is proof that he is the most liberal senator in the country is that a problem
1971439 well there are a lot of national journal did it and in fact depending on how you do the calculation thats not necessarily the case
1971440 why say youre for a new tomorrow then do old style chicago politics to remove legitimate candidates
1971441 he talks about honor and democracy but what honor is there in getting rid of every other candidate so you can run scot free why not let the people decide
1971442 no its found money found money goes to fun things
1971443 please just throw it away she wears that bra every day take her shopping
1971444 no i dont im an a ive always been an a ill always be an a
1971445 offering 4 billion more in tax breaks to the biggest oil companies in america including 1 2 billion to exxon mobil a company that last quarter made the same amount of money in 30 seconds that a typical ohio worker makes in a year
1971446 is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second
1971447 through june exxon employees have given obama 42 100 to mccains 35 166 chevron favors obama 35 157 to 28 500 and obama edges out mccain with bp 16 046 vs 11 500
1971448 i spoke up against the administration and congress and sen obama when they gave us an energy bill with more than giveaways to big oil and really no solution to our energy problems
1971449 i want to take a minute here on this issue cause i think sen
1971450 the one word i read several times in your book is the word faith and you wrote growing up catholic had an enormous impact on me greater i am certain than growing up in a political family why
1971451 the u s would not oppose the gradual disbursement of the loans
1971452 while this is not a bullet proof way to stop idb disbursements it certainly will put a few more large rocks in the road
1971453 after several years of investigating the withholding of these loans we now have clear and detailed evidence of egregious intervention by the u s government and the idb to stop life saving funds to haiti
1971454 with their transgressions now public they must heed the call for monitoring and transparency we urge them to implement the necessary oversight mechanisms to prevent a reoccurrence of behind the scenes malfeasance and above all to fulfill their obligations to the haitian people
1971455 woch nan soley the denial of the right to water in haiti
1971456 functionally incapable of meeting the basic water requirements of the population
1971457 we are seeking assurances that such actions will not be repeated and that the idb finally fulfills its commitments to the haitian people it is time to move forward so that these communities will finally having their human rights to water health and education realized
1971458 woch nan soley the denial of the right to water in haiti
1971459 canadians for the most part place importance on education skill modesty and politeness
1971460 on being introduced the customary greetings are firm handshake customary hello or bonjour in quebec
1971461 as you may know not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
1971462 seems to be actively seeking to undermine marriage by consistently painting it in a negative light
1971463 one man asked me if i was prepared for a hostile takeover
1971464 es tut mir leid wenn es zu solchen emotionen gekommen ist
1971465 i am pleased to report solid operating results for the quarter despite the difficult industry environment created by unrelentingly high fuel prices
1971466 the more resilient domestic canada market drove sustained revenue growth in the quarter despite the introduction of a number of fare increases and fuel surcharges
1971467 the unemployment rate edged down 0 1 percentage points to 6 1 per cent as many people particularly youth left the labour force
1971468 the downwards trend is no surprise anyone reading the newspapers has been well aware of the flurry of plant closings and downsizing announcements
1971469 days would pass before i would shower shave or eat
1971470 canada has an unprecedented opportunity to enhance our global competitiveness by bringing broadband internet services to hundreds of communities
1971471 methane gas is made in real time every day and the alberta government was only given legal ownership of non renewable resources
1971472 we have got the challenge registered in the court and the only way we can proceed is to get membership and funding behind us
1971473 the process relies on coal as a feed stock and the feed stock
1971474 they can take an area that is already producing and without my authority or say so start producing coalbed methane
1971475 we have had issue in the past here with pipeline rupture that sort of thing contaminating some of the soil
1971476 i want to have the right to say no to a cbm coalbed methane well but i also want the right to be able to if i want to develop a cbm well i can develop it
1971477 will investors begin to get cold feet about whether the oilsands will provide enough of a return
1971478 if the currency fluctuation doesnt go in its favour its going to be in even deeper trouble
1971479 productivity should continue strong as companies slash costs to deal with the current environment
1971480 the economy is limping along and businesses are doing whatever they can to remain competitive
1971481 so we had fewer people working shorter hours and producing more
1971482 the dark knight appears to be nothing short of a cultural phenomenon and we are delighted to be a part of it
1971483 looking ahead we believe the combination of having approximately 50 digital systems in operation by year end and the strength of our second half film slate led by the dark knight should drive improved second half financial performance we continue to expect profitability in 2009
1971484 we will convert our five conventional banners over a 15 month period to the metro name following this conversion the metro banner will be a 376 store strong national network that will contribute to the companys future growth
1971485 retail sales while positive during the quarter were impacted by the unseasonable spring weather and continuing economic headwinds
1971486 earnings are expected to improve in the second half of the year as investments in the credit card relaunch and various productivity initiatives begin to positively impact results
1971487 thought id share with you this picture of a very well thumbed paperback copy of the no asshole rule i found in the main english language bookstore in beijing note the sheer amount of dirt and grime there were a few other much cleaner copies but everyone seemed to be using this one to browse through
1971488 please remind everybody that ronnie and i are actually really good friends
1971489 were taking existing resources that are already available and then providing more training and organization and expertise for those individuals coming home
1971490 it is a good fit because our military personnel are already pretty physically active also the idea of representing their country is very important to them
1971491 for a long time i went through a lot of depression
1971492 one of our biggest supporters is the u s paralympics team
1971493 i cant tell you how important sport is in rehabilitation not just in the physical side but the mental side
1971494 it gives you something else to do something to focus on because when you are sitting in the hospital you are depressed and thinking oh my life is over now
1971495 we now have a student who is disabled who needs special education services
1971496 but i feel like i am getting the content i feel like i am really not missing a whole lot
1971497 the coursework has taught me different ways to deal with people who are different
1971498 but being different that puts a whole new light on it
1971499 were going to drag her across the stage if we have to
1971500 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
1971501 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions

1971505 ufc 81 breaking point drew a live gate of 2 4 million and a reported 600 000 pay per view orders many of those willing to pay 39 95 for the telecast were pro wrestling fans curious about how lesnar would fare in a real life fight
1971506 i really rushed that fight and i made a foolish mistake
1971507 i had frank in a dominant position and stood up and fed him ive just got to be a more controlled fighter and a little more relaxed in there
1971508 theres always pressure to win in any circumstance as an athlete
1971509 like i said from day one i didnt want any easy fights
1971510 basically it allows you to use it with just one hand
1971511 the wave is easily the most popular seller its a big hit with military personnel and emergency personnel like ems and firemen

1971513 meine kinder haben vom urlaub bei der oma die l use mitgebracht

1971516 klasse plan wegen deiner tochter bringen dann die 30 anderen kinder kopfgetier als andenken mit heim das finde ich aber nicht so prickelnd
1971517 weve improved so much since the beginning of the year
1971518 there are so many things but patience is so important ive learned you have to be so smooth in qualifying you can be tough on the car and drive it pretty hard but once you go racing you can drive it hard but you have to be really really smooth and let the car do the work
1971519 last year watkins glen was the first race we had led some laps we had a good race i went off track a couple of times but the car was fast
1971520 the last five or six races dodge has given me a really good engine weve had some good power coming out of the corners and ive really been happy with the engines performance
1971521 there are so many tricks you have to learn in these cup cars
1971522 at loudon i gained four tenths per lap by just driving differently and using different race lines in the nationwide race and it actually worked during the sprint cup race in the cup race at loudon we actually stayed with the leaders until we had a brake problem
1971523 i just wish the conditions would have been a little bit better because i know that ron fellows the winner didnt have enough fuel to go all the way to the end of the race
1971524 and hopefully well get a better result than we did in sonoma
1971525 i sit beside my driver and just watch the road and relax i like being on the road so its not too bad but nascar has been tougher than i thought it would be with these cars and the schedule and the traveling its tough but im getting used to it
1971526 nascar is the most fun ive ever had racing i just appreciate the moment we race in front of crowds that are unbelievable i feel like a pretty fortunate guy
1971527 you know as well as i do what sort of censure we are always up against and how careful we must be
1971528 the situation is serious enough to warrant your doing some real worrying
1971529 this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move

1971553 everybody uses that shop not just people on this site but its a rat run and we do get a lot of youngsters vandalising but we have always had those problems
1971554 if the shop shuts they wont need to come on site but they still will
1971555 we feel very deeply that the shop shouldnt go theres so many people on this site who are all my age and older people in their 70s and 80s and many dont drive where else can we go now
1971556 theres been no end of trouble with the kids here theres no reason for them to come here the only reason they come here is to create havoc
1971557 its an awful shame for it to go especially for the older people im upset that we have not had any voice in this in any village youre going to get children about but the policemen need to be around here a lot more
1971558 antisocial behaviour in the garston park area has been identified by the community as its second main priority through the rollout of neighbourhood policing the tilehurst west neighbourhood policing team and partner agencies are actively working on solutions to the problem
1971559 we arent looking for anyone else and we believe he was part of a team raiding in the south
1971560 they were also very violent in their approach both towards the police and any of the public who got in their way in some cases the results of their gratuitous violence and threats inflicted on vulnerable people in their own homes has had an impact that the victims will never recover from
1971561 it is these people who have my utmost sympathy and i hope in some way the achievements of the investigation team will go a little way to ease their suffering
1971562 this has been a long and arduous investigation involving a unique collaboration of five forces from across three regions over two years
1971563 senior investigators from the five forces worked together to tackle a long standing organised crime network that needed to be dealt with once and for all
1971564 the convictions and results speak for themselves with main gang members and associates in prison for long custodial sentences

1971570 the closure is necessitated by our landlord reading borough council requiring vacant possession of the site
1971571 we will cease to operate racing after the greyhound meeting on wednesday october 22 at the latest
1971572 the company strategy since taking over the business in 2002 has been to procure a new stadium on adjoining land and to provide for an almost seamless transfer of business
1971573 planning permission has been granted for a new combined racetrack and casino or racino a unique and innovative project
1971574 having made steady if not lengthy progress to securing planning permission and a casino licence the project has been set back due to a combination of the withdrawal of our casino operator stanley and the credit crunch
1971575 determined and convinced that the racino had much to recommend it we have pursued other casino operators and have moved forward with negotiations and detailed planning with another casino operator who share our enthusiasm for the racino concept in this excellent location
1971576 this has necessitated a period of rapid re evaluation of both strategy and planning the depth and scale of which will not enable us to start construction in time for any speedway or greyhound racing to take place on the new site until 2010 although a start to construction is projected for the first half of 2009
1971577 speedway racing will miss one season we have evaluated the possibilities of the use of a temporary track and customer facilities and have concluded that it is not financially feasible or practical as it would seriously delay the construction of the new stadium
1971578 discussions and planning is ongoing with racers promoter mark legg for the style and format of the racing and the return of the team to the new stadium in 2010
1971579 reading are a template for every team in the division they are a team who won promotion from the championship and progressed through the leagues by recruiting good players in the championship
1971580 they are the leading lights in the division for me in terms of the way we want to take this club forwards
1971581 alcohol fuelled disorder was the most prevalent problem with an increase from 305 to 337 incidents
1971582 we also had 25 police officers assaulted during the season the highest number ever recorded by btp
1971583 we did however get a better grip on organised hooligan elements through increased use of football banning orders on known troublemakers
1971584 consequently we had a reduction in serious incidents from 83 in the 2006 07 season to 63 last season
1971585 i need to get back to playing the best football i can the gaffer will judge if and when i will be in the team i am not worried
1971586 if i get back quickly then good but if im not and the team is doing well then thats the main thing
1971587 i would say i am close to getting back to my best i think in a few more games i will be there senegal in the summer did me good and this pre season will help
1971588 before christmas i know i will be at my very best
1971589 my confidence wasnt affected but you do have doubts and do things you normally wouldnt do
1971590 but it was a learning point and i now have more experience
1971591 it has made me stronger i am so hungry for victory every time im on the pitch i am ready for anything and i cant wait to start the season
1971592 i am looking forward to the championship it is a good league
1971593 we have been there and done it and i am sure if we stay focused and motivated then we can do something again this season
1971594 last season is behind me it was a season where nothing worked for me fair play to the boys no one is upset or annoyed with me
1971595 the gaffer does not have a problem with me he is very professional it happened but what is done is done the future is more important now and that is what i will focus on
1971596 i am happy here i have always been happy here
1971597 everyone was saying that sonks will be leaving all the players want to play in the premier league and the best way is to go up with your team the easiest way is for someone to buy you so either way my aim in the next two seasons is to go back up
1971598 but need to help catalogers move from the marc environment to the non marc environment
1971599 deny it slander those who tell it ye admit it for your factious purposes and make it worse and abide the end
1971600 who needs a gps when you have mapquest or yahoo maps
1971601 i dont need a gps system i can look up my destination before i leave
1971602 my understanding is that the project has been given a very high priority by the government of canada and is moving along at a fairly rapid pace
1971603 why are we traveling away from home during august when it is the most beautiful time of year right here
1971604 in many ways i am very sorry to see nicky go but he had made his intentions clear for almost a year we wish him well
1971605 the injury to freddie has left a gaping hole on the left he had a wonderful season for us last year and this wasnt necessarily a priority for us before the injury
1971606 but nicky shorey is more than a back up hes a quality player on the ball and is up for the challenge
1971607 i do not want them around me i want nothing to do with them
1971608 i have not seen a firearm i do not know what you mean
1971609 as far as he lewis is concerned guns are not very nice
1971610 unfortunately with the redevelopment of crown house the loss of parking facilities for our customers under our store and the anticipated development of the area opposite our store it would have created huge operational problems for our business
1971611 customers collecting bulky orders currently park in the paintball car park and we could foresee a downturn in trade as a result
1971612 we also carry out frequent daily deliveries to our customers in a large transit van which we obviously need to park close to the store we also park the transit van in the paintball store car park
1971613 while the current store has been great for the last 10 years these problems mean that the time is right for us to move on and the richfield avenue site is ideal for our purposes
1971614 the search for alternative locations which was limited in its size identified numerous sites that were suitable for the operations of the applicant albeit at a higher cost
1971615 unfortunately price is not a material consideration in such tests
1971616 in essence what is being said is that despite being a small local business as opposed to a national multiple we are expected to compete and afford rents and business rates three to four times higher than we are currently paying and that rent and business rate values are not a planning issue and therefore cannot be considered in support of a planning application
1971617 if our appeal fails and we cannot find suitable premises it could lead to the demise of yet another small independent retailer in reading despite the much publicised campaign to support local businesses by the federation of small businesses fsb and the evening post
1971618 obviously small businesses cannot afford the rent and rates of many locations including town centre and out of town shopping centres and therefore their choice is limited
1971619 planning officers are currently discussing the planning issues relating to the application with the applicants agents and have raised a number of concerns with regard to the information submitted in relation to national and local planning policies for the location of retail development and the protection of employment uses in employment areas
1971620 the specific circumstances of fun n frolics use will also be taken into account in line with national planning policy for retailing and town centres
1971621 we have been using the 17s for over a year and they have been perfect but the new buses have got little space for a disabled wheelchair if there are already two pushchairs on there
1971622 on the old buses one side was for wheelchairs and the other side you could get both now there is only room for one or the other
1971623 the other week we had to get into town to catch a coach and we couldnt get on the bus so we had to ring a taxi and it cost me about 5 when it could have been free
1971624 they say they comply with the dda disability discrimination act but in that case they need to go back to the dda and tell them that if you are in a wheelchair you cannot get into the allocated wheelchair space on your own
1971625 a friend of mine used to get the number 17 to see a friend in tilehurst he cant go on his own anymore and the other week he had to wait for three buses as there were buggies in the space on the other two
1971626 this is the main route around reading we have spoken to reading buses and they say they are looking into it but that was in june and it is august now and they are still on the route
1971627 the old 17s were very large 12 metre buses which held a lot more passengers and consequently more buggies and wheelchairs
1971628 the new premier route 17 vehicles are shorter in length because these bio ethanol buses are not yet available in a 12 metre long version
1971629 to show its a trading shop rather than a disused shop
1971630 i would have thought the council would prefer licensed adult centre it a sound a little bit more up market
1971631 i believe the council decided about 15 years ago that it would accept the wording licensed sex shop at a time when some of these shops were wanting much more explicit things in the shop window
1971632 i believe the intention at the time was not to offend people that were passing by or schoolchildren
1971633 how can a mark begin with clam and not evoke clammy im sorry it just sounds like something on an saturday night live skit
1971634 i have a lot of arab business partners i do a lot of business in the middle east ive got a lot of friends
1971635 i ask my friends to support candidates that i think are worthy of supporting they usually come through for me
1971636 a local person but i would like not to talk about it anymore
1971637 im involved in the restaurant business my brother faisal recommended john mccain whenever he makes a recommendation we do it
1971638 why does it matter who im telling you we made the contribution we funneled it through the channel in florida because thats the contact we had i was responsible for collecting it
1971639 if it is not illegal for a foreign national to bundle checks it ought to be since its illegal for a foreign national to make contributions in the first place
1971640 mccain spokesman brian rogers said mustafa abu nabaa is not a bundler for the campaign although sargeant is he wasnt registered and he hasnt contributed
1971641 former associate mohammad anwar farid al saleh who happens to be the brother in law of the king of jordan offer ing a glimpse into the business relationship between mr abu nabaa and mr sargeant and the nature of their lucrative work the suit which was reported on by msnbc earlier this year in this piece alleges that mr sargeant and mr abu nabaa cut mr al saleh out of his rightful one third share of their company international oil trading company iotc
1971642 it also highlights the apparent close ties that iotc was able to forge with the jordanian government as part of a lucrative contract it eventually landed with the pentagon to transport aviation fuel to the military in iraq
1971643 everything we have done on this contract has been in the best interest of the military and the u s taxpayers
1971644 you know what its like growing up every single day and having people ask to touch your hair because theyve never seen hair like that
1971645 to have the entire class laugh and giggle when somebody pronounces niger as nigger the constant bombardment of that kind of thing really affects your spirit and its every single day like when people want to come back from a vacation and compare their tan to yours and joke about being black
1971646 i am so not religious i cant stand this stuff
1971647 design innovation combined with amds fastest quad core amd opteron processors
1971648 i was having a heart attack for a number of hours but i did not realise i was not aware of the symptoms so i just brushed it off and thought it was indigestion
1971649 i was out shopping at the time but i came home and cooked lunch we ate it and then sat down to watch a film
1971650 it was only then that i thought my chest was feeling really tight and i went to lie down then my vision went i called my husband and he said my face was grey and my lips were blue so he called an ambulance and they rushed me into hospital
1971651 i was told i was very near death when i arrived and i just remember the ambulance zooming down the bath road like something out of casualty
1971652 it is silly really because if my husband told me he was having chest pains that were shooting down his arms i would have him rushed into hospital before his feet could even touch the ground
1971653 but because it was me i just thought my bra was too tight or something and that i would be fine i think it is really important that people listen to the advice of the british heart foundation because like me you might not even be aware what the symptoms of a heart attack are
1971654 it is all about raising awareness i was lucky and got to the hospital in time i almost died just because i did not know the symptoms of a heart attack so i think it is so important to teach people and that is exactly what the british heart foundation are trying to do
1971655 we believe our plans for new homes in the shinfield parish are both ambitious and sustainable
1971656 wokingham borough has to meet sizable targets for new housing over the next few years we believe our plans would contribute to these targets and help address the housing need in the area
1971657 at first we didnt realise how big the show was until we saw the adverts on tv
1971658 we had no other competition to measure up against and we hadnt seen any of the other choirs perform until we watched the show
1971659 in a way im nervous about tomorrow because its going to be up to the public if the public dont think youre that good then you dont get through
1971660 but in a way its good because we get to see what the public thinks of us
1971661 its been amazing ive been working at debenhams for a few years but no ones really recognised me yet
1971662 im loving going through this experience with so many close friends its like one big family going through it by yourself would be hard its also been great getting to know the other choirs in the competition as they are really nice
1971663 getting into the live finals is another great achievement and one that will live on for a very long time
1971664 i am so proud of the choirs achievements so far and i am certain that they will continue to go from strength to strength and win this competition
1971665 yes i think there was enough there to show that imitations were being converted
1971666 i have no doubt these premises have been used for the conversion of imitation firearms
1971667 offenders have caused damage to three windows by firing what appears to be a ball bearing gun at them
1971668 we the business are forced to bear the brunt of the cost and to try to put other things in place to alleviate the problem
1971669 we have been on these premises for 11 years and we have never had this there are many problems but it seems to have built up rapidly over the last 12 months
1971670 there is a gang of 16 to 20 year olds that seem to congregate here who come from slightly further afield we dont feel its the local youngsters but people are reluctant to come forward with any information
1971671 unfortunately this just seems to be our society at the moment in which people want to vandalise whatever they can get their hands on
1971672 i think its quite a severe situation because of the weapon thats been used
1971673 its very much a lethal weapon the shots have penetrated the first layer of glass on our windows which are apparently an inch and a half thick so you can imagine that hitting someone
1971674 there are often children playing in and around our site if one of those ball bearings had hit those children or another person they would be dead
1971675 although initially the number of visits may sound like a large amount a large amount of these are precautionary and preventative visits to ensure that a problem with vermin does not develop
1971676 there are parts of the hospital that are housed in very old buildings and these are susceptible to infestations but by ensuring regular visits by pest control officers we are able to keep these down to a minimum
1971677 where sometimes you might have a problem with ants at home this is also the case at the hospital as it is a large and in some parts old building
1971678 we have only ever had insects within the hospital and in some clinical areas and these have been dealt with immediately there have been sightings of rats on the premises that have been dealt with and we are constantly thinking of new ways to try to keep the pigeons away
1971679 i am not quite sure why the media has been so interested in this today wednesday i think it has become a political argument more than anything
1971680 our contractors make routine site visits to ensure that we are using the most effective precautionary measures and often make follow up visits to help maintain preventative equipment such as electronic fly killers
1971681 the trusts nominated officers for pest control work with a contractor to adopt procedures to eradicate pests or achieve the best level of control that is technically and practicably possible and proactively work to maintain this position
1971682 additional site inspections are precautionary as all sightings of pests or evidence of their existence are reported and acted upon
1971683 sightings do not always result in capture eradication or removal but it is important that we take all potential sightings seriously and act immediately
1971684 during 2006 we had 36 visits regarding suspected sightings during 2007 there were 49 visits of this nature and so far this year there have been 28
1971685 it was only by pure coincidence that the woman was placed at the scene
1971686 she had flown into and out of heathrow airport within the day and got the train into reading train station
1971687 it was there that she was spotted by mr brooks son who did not approach her or think anything particularly odd about it
1971688 neighbours had seen a woman dressed as a tradeswoman at the address moments before the fire and when police asked if there was any woman in his life that could possibly be a suspect he explained that he was seeing the german lady but said it could not possibly have been her because she lived in munich
1971689 it was only then that the son realised he had seen her on the same day
1971690 she believed setting fire to this gentlemans house would bring him closer to her it seems as though she believed he would move out and possibly move in with her in germany
1971691 it was at the time when she had just lost her mother in fairly traumatic circumstances
1971692 one part of her life had been taken from her and the possible break up of her relationship with mr brooks was perhaps a little too much for her to bear
1971693 a professional woman of impeccable character who would ordinarily not come within a million miles of a crown court
1971694 to her credit she contacted the police to confess her guilt
1971695 the fact that we have a smart show with nothing that caustic or harsh is a miracle to talk about what i want to do to condoleezza rice sexually without saying something really really anatomical that takes a lot of doing
1971696 its just going to get funnier and funnier as the evening goes on
1971697 lets just try this once more and if its the last one thats hard lines
1971698 dont let anyone tell you that you cant do something
1971699 pam gets lost and sits in on the wrong class but eventually she finds her way ooh metaphor
1971700 against newcastle the lads produced just about their best team performance of the season so far with solid points throughout the side
1971701 we really must keep that kind of showing firmly in mind if we are to repel what will be a very strong challenge from somerset on sunday evening
1971702 they have a set of riders who go very well at smallmead especially their flying no 1 jason doyle
1971703 obviously somerset will want to maintain their challenge near the head of the standings but we are still ambitious and want to get back into a top four position
1971704 it is going to be another thrilling meeting and we must try to ensure that its the racers who come out on top so im hoping our supporters will really get behind the lads and give them every encouragement
1971705 we can make ohio a more attractive place to do business
1971706 why wont the national media fly their helicopters over the west bank where my home is and let us know how the west bank fared
1971707 it encourages if not creates lawsuits our countrys courts are clogged with unnecessary and frivolous lawsuits which delay if not obstruct the access to courts of people that really need to get there that have serious legal grievances
1971708 after being promoted by michael corleone to don of new york players expand to new cities as they build up their families through extorting businesses monopolizing illegal crime rings and defeating new families in an effort to become the most powerful mob family in america
1971709 we found the hierarchical culture of organized crime intriguing running an organized crime family in a world defined by family loyalty is something that we felt could introduce a new strategic element to the genre that is what the dons view is all about laying out a strategy to pick off the competition one by one the dons view is so unique it could fundamentally change the rules of open world games by blending action and strategy to create something entirely new
1971710 the design of the network was to isolate it from the rest of the public network its not designed to isolate it from one computer in the press room to another computer in the press room they took advantage of that
1971711 while google has the cash to write off the loss it is jolly cross about having to do so
1971712 our prepay mobile broadband offers have opened up broadband to people who have never had good access before
1971713 were pleased 3s prepay mobile broadband offering which gives the same in bundle pricing as our equivalent contract offering is connecting such people
1971714 whatever else may be thought about hitlers exploits they are among the most remarkable in the whole history of the world
1971715 eighty six percent of chinese people surveyed said they were content with the countrys direction up from 48 percent in 2002 and 82 percent of chinese were satisfied with their national economy up from 52 percent
1971716 russians were the third most satisfied people with their countrys direction at 54 percent despite western concerns about authoritarian trends
1971717 according to the industry tracking npd group the pc edition of the game sold more than 40 000 copies at us retailers through june
1971718 it was great to play well against aston villa but it means nothing if we get cocky and get carried away and not be ready for sunday
1971719 we played like we know we can play and like we should have done for last season
1971720 it makes it a bit more frustrating but hopefully we can create that again for next season
1971721 they are a good team and having come up they will be extra motivated
1971722 it will be on tv and they will probably want to show what they can do
1971723 if we play like we did on saturday or we know we can then we will fancy our chances
1971724 every team you play you could come up with a reason for not wanting to play them
1971725 you have to play them at some time so were looking forward to it
1971726 with bryn injured and marek injured early on i was expecting to get a little sniff i have done that now got some good game time under my belt and hopefully ive proved to the gaffer what i can do
1971727 going to sweden was a big boost that was my target when i first came back to get on the plane there and i did it
1971728 im not sure how far away from the first team i am but hopefully ive shown the gaffer what i can do
1971729 i went to bournemouth first with the other lads and then millwall both were really good im from south london anyway and some of my family support them so it was nice to play there
1971730 i know it can be hard to play there but i really enjoyed it if the fans get on your back its good because it puts you under pressure and that is good to have to deal with it
1971731 it helped my development i needed games and i got 20 odd under my belt and really enjoyed every single one hopefully that can push me on for this season
1971732 if im not playing at reading im sure i might goon loan depending on the gaffer
1971733 but my main aim is to get into the side this season and hopefully play week in week out here
1971734 its not nearly as funny as it used to be
1971735 i am satisfied that the cause of death was heroin toxicity suzie had ingested it deliberately but not with the intention of taking her own life
1971736 rather than an accident that takes us into the realms of misadventure
1971737 ive had a really good year and part of that is down to the money
1971738 at the start of the season i was coming off the bench but by november i was keeping my place in the team and id made the position mine
1971739 the money from lloyds came at a great time for me because i was under a lot of pressure it was a busy point in the season and i was doing my university exams so it was a great boost to receive the money
1971740 ive used it for travelling a new pair of basketball trainers and also for some books for my studies and it helped to ease off the pressure which is maybe why i had such a good end to the season
1971741 id love to get into the gb team next year and then into the seniors and it would be fantastic to be part of a squad heading to an olympics especially 2012 in london
1971742 there is a lot of money in sport now through the lottery but daniel is not quite good enough just yet to take advantage
1971743 he still makes a huge commitment in time and money in order to do what he does and he doesnt get a lot back this relieves a bit of pressure and gives him a boost
1971744 sport can be lonely so when someone comes along and believes in you enough to give you 1 000 it makes you realise you will make it after all
1971745 you dont realise but its quite a lot of responsibility for two girls but its been great to raise all that money
1971746 ive been at this club for a large chunk of my life and had two fantastic promotions
1971747 getting into the premier league with record points has to be the best memory
1971748 theyve set the bar very high which is part of the reason i wanted the royal families involved this year and theyve done so well for the area and local charities
1971749 sadly im not allowed to do anything to help thats all down to my committee and sian cook at swings and smiles what she says goes when she says jump i say how high
1971750 two of the most brilliant dancers ever on this show

1971753 apple might be able wipe your iphone apps at will
1971754 you are not good enough until i deemed that your fruity possessions are up to date
1971755 i am sure there is one more step theyl ask me again i still need to tell them my visa number and the other one and my name damnnnn my other me just activated the iclick account
1971756 but i agree that it should be illegal for anyone to do this and post such a bogus application in the app store in the first place
1971757 under the separation of powers the president not have any authority over any court to tell them what to do and the highest court in texas recently ruled in all respect to the president that he has no jurisdiction in this matter at all
1971758 but gov perry remains resolute spokesman robert black admits the federal government has a big sort of dilemma because the united states as a whole is obligated to abide by
1971759 still the governor isnt feeling any pressure on this simply because he is here to uphold the laws of the state of texas and not some foreign court in europe he said and murdered and the governor is not willing to say that any foreign national is going to get any additional protection under the law than a texas citizen would mr black said
1971760 the medell n case has become about more than whether a mexican national is executed
1971761 the world court has never before this case tried to interfere with an individual criminal case going on within some country around the world and theres no reason under united states law to make this the first case
1971762 subsequent boastful statements of medellin and other gang members revealed that what ensued was a brutal
1971763 he has never shown any remorse he has proudly confessed i used to be opposed to the death penalty until i met jos
1971764 execute him already the girls along with their families deserve justice

1971859 my caddie said remember we played with tiger in the u s open and i think he took 6 down the first hole pretty much every day so you can shoot a good round from here as well
1971860 this is one of the clubs that prides itself on how hard it is i dont think anyone expected it to be easy it wouldnt be a monster if it was
1971861 if you had rees jones redo scrabble hed leave out the vowels

1971865 for us the most important thing is that our client is properly represented and we understand that with time everything will be solved
1971866 he still came into the gym and practiced his shot
1971867 its killing us because he gets a lot of open shots
1971868 if he makes just one or two more shots every night were probably winning some close games instead of losing them
1971869 im not going to say there was no way in the world they could have done that
1971870 but i dont think so i didnt see anything like that
1971871 it was one of the last names i would have expected to see

1971896 historically russia was and will remain the guarantor of security for the peoples of the caucasus
1971897 this is not a minor confrontation an all out war has been going on in south ossetia for the past week
1971898 only the political leadership can order troop redeployment or the use of arms
1971899 as soon as the troops receive such an order they will advance to the conflict zone to protect russian citizens
1971900 a resumption of hostilities would only encourage russia to recognize the republics though this may provoke an outbreak of emotions russia must recognize them so that georgia would stop hoping that south ossetia will surrender in this or future confrontations
1971901 heu leu was signed using a pricing formula which is disadvantageous for russia
1971902 they have saved just enough on russian uranium during the past 14 years the heu leu was in effect further scrimping could have made tenex the state owned russian company which trades uranium fuel and services to halt deliveries or russia could have changed the amount of the fuel delivered without even breaking the contract the u s wouldnt have been happy about it

1971916 we are not against trams as such but the project that was before
1971917 the advice which edinburgh city council and transport initiatives edinburgh tie have made to me which i can see the logic of is that when you have invested in the infrastructure it is cheaper to make extensions
1971918 the scottish government was against the trams project but we respected the will of the parliament to allow the scheme to continue

1971955 well in that case i may have to ask for a raise
1971956 one would hope that at least there is a proper field investigation going on
1971957 detecting information concerning terrorism narcotics smuggling contraband including child pornography and other import or export control laws
1971958 ive been really pleased and happy about the way our team has progressed
1971959 this is kind of the dog days of two a days its hot everywhere everybody is sore and tired everywhere in the sec and everybody we have to play the teams that manage that the best and continue to persevere and improve in difficult circumstances are the ones that have the chance to make the most significant improvement
1971960 i think the hard work that the players did this summer relative to their conditioning is probably helping them a little bit
1971961 some of them are making progress and some of them struggle a little more in the difficult circumstances but we are pleased and happy with where those guys are and we want to work with them everyday so we can take them from where they are and continue to get better and improve
1971962 we are really pleased and happy that we have three players that are going to graduate on saturday
1971963 john parker drew davis and rashad johnson are guys who have certainly impacted this team in a positive way i want to congratulate them and their families and i know they are extremely happy this is what we want guys to do when they come to the university of alabama this is what affects the quality of their life forever
1971964 this is a big accomplishment it was my main focus when i came here as a walk on my education was definitely a big issue in deciding to come to the university of alabama i knew i would get a great education just being able to put the university of alabama graduate on my resume is a big thing to me its a big accomplishment for me and my family my mom and dad went to college but neither one finished with a college degree so having a college degree is important to me
1971965 i think its a huge deal to come in here four years later and get a degree its an exciting time for me and my family to be able to accomplish this after so much work has been put into this is exciting to me
1971966 this accomplishment is the end to a lot of hard work like coach saban says really impact the quality of your life i plan on looking at a second degree or masters degree i am talking to advisors now to see what best suits me
1971967 we must look at the substantial successes we have been able to achieve but also reflect on how far we have to go
1971968 governments in the past have been complicit in genocides land seizures massive environmental degradation and many other human rights abuses because indigenous peoples were denied their fundamental rights and freedoms
1971969 this shows how far we still have to go to make sure that states acknowledge and protect indigenous peoples rights for if they continue not to we have many examples of the grave results
1971970 appropriate legislative or administrative measures to prevent the acts of transnational corporations on indigenous territories
1971971 reconciliation between indigenous peoples and states can take many forms that differ from country to country
1971972 generally it involves recognition for past injustices justice for victims and the healing of relationships
1971973 the result of more than two decades of negotiations the declaration provides a momentous opportunity for states and indigenous peoples to strengthen their relationships promote reconciliation and ensure that the past is not repeated
1971974 a manifestation of reconciliation between indigenous peoples and states and a mechanism for carrying that reconciliation forward
1971975 the wider public must understand indigenous peoples rights and concerns
1971976 they must act to protect them because as the most marginalised group in this world it spells out how the rest of us will be treated and is also the surest way to protect our last remaining ecosystems
1971977 must be a loser to be a college football analyst
1971978 a cheap unwarranted shot at an innocent bystander boo on the sporting news
1971979 for the period we examined 1987 to 2004 there was a clear relationship between warm el ni o events and increased occurrence of heavy precipitation
1971980 events will certainly become more frequent in a warmer climate
1971981 we use satellite observations and model simulations to examine the response of tropical precipitation events to naturally driven changes in surface temperature and atmospheric moisture content
1971982 a warmer atmosphere contains larger amounts of moisture which boosts the intensity of heavy downpours
1971983 comparing observations with results from computer models improves understanding of how rainfall responds to a warming world
1971984 differences can relate to deficiencies in the measurements or the models used to predict future climatic change
1971985 my research strives to better understand the role of atmospheric hydrologic processes in governing climate and climate change through the use of satellite observations and mathematical models of earths climate
1971986 this research is motivated by the need to better understand how human activities are altering earths climate
1971987 you owe it to yourself set the world on fire
1971988 all that soil out there are plants that grew 6 000 years ago and didnt decompose completely
1971989 thats what peat is so were just making the same thing happen that happened here for millennia
1971990 we were capturing a lot of carbon dioxide at levels much greater than other systems marshes and forests grasslands
1971991 they can just sit back and watch the tules grow and they should be making money
1971992 thats what the vision is its not to do it just on twitchell island its to see if we can do it throughout the delta on subsided land
1971993 when oxygen is limited the bugs the microbes have to eat and breathe somehow
1971994 they will use sulfate iron or some other compound instead of producing carbon dioxide at the end of the pathway they end up producing methane
1971995 the river is choking with filth effluents from all the cities and industries drain into the river unchecked and it affects the lives of nearly 500 million people
1971996 if the government refuses to concede our demands then we will launch a mass movement from september 18
1971997 at current trends the world will fall short of the millennium sanitation target by more than 700 million people
1971998 would suddenly end one of the most productive programs and would let go of one of the most productive scientists within the institute
1971999 dr glantzs science was among the best being cutting edge and cost effective yet influencing the world he also ensured that science was used for humanity and by humanity
1972000 knowledge related to the societal dimensions of global environmental problems is fundamental to efforts to arrive at practical and effective solutions
1972001 if anything we need to expand attention in these areas
1972002 when we first looked we saw that the warm periods were associated with the periods of heaviest rainfall but when we looked more carefully we found the models underestimated what the satellite data showed by a factor of two to three
1972003 as of last night that was one of the issues being discussed between the two sides there is no agreement yet but this is what the iraqis are asking for
1972004 emergency action is necessary to prevent the morally unacceptable situation that certain populations of coho may go extinct
1972005 what were asking of landowners is a huge financial hardship
1972006 do you honestly feel its an issue of in stream carrying capacity
1972007 we believe action by the board at this time will help coho salmon
1972008 we have never seen the lake as shallow as this
1972009 its an extreme solution but unless global hydrology changes tomorrow this project is the last hope for the lake
1972010 if rain would ever come we might have a chance
1972011 i feel like everybody wants to do better this year
1972012 distinct link between tropical rainfall extremes and temperature with heavy rain events increasing during warm periods and decreasing during cold periods
1972013 a warmer atmosphere contains larger amounts of moisture which boosts the intensity of heavy downpours
1972014 comparing observations with results from computer models improves understanding of how rainfall responds to a warming world
1972015 differences can relate to deficiencies in the measurements or the models used to predict future climatic change
1972016 heavy rain in the tropics is often associated with thunderstorms and the same processes will also apply in the uk particularly in summer where intense downpours are fueled by the additional moisture carried by warm humid air
1972017 one of the most serious challenges that humanity will face in response to climate change is adapting to changes inextreme weather events
1972018 right now we are managing but it is a very difficult situation
1972019 ive never experienced anything like this weve drilled our mountains full of holes looking for water this situation will have a long term impact on our flora and fauna
1972020 given this is an ambitious target and we dont know in detail how to limit greenhouse gas emissions to realise a 2 degree target we should be prepared to adapt to 4c
1972021 even if we get the best possible global agreement to reduce greenhouse gasses on any rational basis you should be preparing for a 20 risk of temperatures increasing by more than 3 5c so i think bob watson is quite right
1972022 weve been fighting oak creeks expansion for more than seven years and despite our best efforts it is under construction
1972023 its time to put this one behind us and focus on the other ones that are in the pipeline
1972024 a warmer atmosphere contains larger amounts of moisture which boosts the intensity of heavy downpours
1972025 ultimately the cities hardest hit by climate change will be the ones least prepared
1972026 we have seen events like the 2004 tsunami and recently cyclone nargis in myanmar and a typhoon in the philippines
1972027 the last 10 to 15 years have seen particularly dangerous declines in rainfall in sensitive ecosystems in east africa such as somalia and eastern ethiopia
1972028 we wanted to know if the trend would continue or if it would start getting wetter
1972029 we can be quite certain that the decline in rainfall has been substantial and will continue to be
1972030 this 15 percent decrease every 20 25 years is likely to continue
1972031 with all the injuries and suspensions to the crimson tide is really fair to judge this team that has been forced by outside circumstances to play such inexperienced players
1972032 all the mangrove forests are gone and coastal erosion keeps getting worse especially during the monsoon season
1972033 im not sure how long my family and i can live here
1972034 we desperately need help before we lose the whole district to the sea
1972035 the authorities need to listen to the particular plight of each community and adopt solutions that are best suited for individual coastal areas
1972036 if mangrove forest encroachment continues the land will sooner or later be washed into the sea
1972037 maybe if you visited auburn websites you might know other auburn fans who dont like petrino
1972038 surely they can be considered representative of the au nation right
1972039 these environmental protections help ensure lake michigan is a healthy natural resource for generations to come
1972040 ultimately the cities hardest hit by climate change will be the ones least prepared
1972041 ninety percent of disasters are already weather related and more intense and frequent hurricanes and floods are predicted by the intergovernmental panel on climate change says salvano brice o director of the international strategy for disaster reduction
1972042 we cannot wait we already have the tools to reduce the impact of climate related hazards and we need to use them now
1972043 we have seen events like the 2004 tsunami and recently cyclone nargis in myanmar and a typhoon in the philippines
1972044 there is no cookie cutter solution to climate change impacts its important that you are able to anticipate the likely impacts on your city and make the decision to deal with that
1972045 the brown tree snake has often been used as a textbook example for the negative impacts of invasive species but after the loss of birds no one has looked at the snakes indirect effects
1972046 it has been 25 years since the birds disappeared it seems to me the consequences are going to keep reverberating throughout the community if birds are fundamental components of the forest
1972047 these findings could have global implications since forests in areas that have had a decline in bird populations instead of outright extinction might show effects similar to those in the forests of guam
1972048 it seems logical that if there are no birds then seeds are not able to get away from their parent trees and that is exactly what our research shows
1972049 the magnitude of difference between seed dispersal on guam and saipan is alarming because of its implications for guams forests and for forests worldwide experiencing a decline or complete loss of birds
1972050 a warmer atmosphere contains larger amounts of moisture which boosts the intensity of heavy downpours
1972051 i was definitely passionate and very assertive verbally in saying it was a raping of the earth and ruining of the wetlands i said i want to see whats under the tarp i wanted to tell the three guys they were killing animals and plants so i did
1972052 ballona institutes activities have been determined to be incompatible with the departments management goals and objectives
1972053 deprives the plants underneath of sunlight so no photosynthesis or reproduction occurs
1972054 we want people to change their behavior and use more water efficient products for landscaping
1972055 it never occurred to me that in a state that has an extreme water shortage every city wouldnt do everything they possibly could to save water
1972056 ill go ahead and take the state and national level i know some people on the city council here
1972057 turf or acceptable dry climate ground cover is allowed in the frontyard
1972058 people who write exciting stuff which i could imagine hollywood picking up
1972059 theres been a huge groundswell in green building leadership at state and local levels its remarkable
1972060 it requires a mandate in order to get people to do whats in their best interests sometimes
1972061 were dealing with a realm of planning where there is no defined box
1972062 as the climate change occurs as the drought continues for australia the next step will be for farmers to look at means of minimising other losses on their farms and hence the heat stress and sunburn will become far more topical
1972063 i think its time to move forward to take decisive action
1972064 complete emancipation of black people from white oppression by whatever means black people deem necessary
1972065 malcolm x was not far wrong when he called the white man the devil
1972066 this is the moment that the world is waiting for
1972067 i have become a symbol of possibility of america returning to its best traditions
1972068 i know my country has not perfected itself at times weve struggled to keep the promise of liberty and equality for all of our people weve made our share of mistakes and there are times when our actions around the world have not lived up to our best intentions
1972069 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
1972070 barack obama will demand that you shed your cynicism that you come out of your isolation that you move out of your comfort zone that you push yourself to be better and that you engage barack will never allow you to go back to your lives as usual

1972072 for your father knows what you need before you ask him
1972073 you shall not be afraid of the terrors of the night nor of the arrow the evil plots and slanders of the wicked that flies by day nor of the pestilence that stalks in darkness nor of the destruction and sudden death that surprise and lay waste at noonday
1972074 because you have made the lord your refuge and the most high your dwelling place
1972075 do not therefore fling away your fearless confidence for it carries a great and glorious compensation of reward
1972076 for i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which ive committed unto him against that day
1972077 for this reason we also from the day we heard of it have not ceased to pray and make special request for you asking that you may be filled with the full deep and clear knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom in comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of god and in understanding and discernment of spiritual things that you may walk live and conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the lord fully pleasing to him and desiring to please him in all things bearing fruit in every good work and steadily growing and increasing in and by the knowledge of god with fuller deeper and clearer insight acquaintance and recognition we pray that you may be invigorated and strengthened with all power according to the might of his glory to exercise every kind of endurance and patience perseverance and forbearance with joy giving thanks to the father
1972078 i have been waiting patiently to find an appropriate location for my first emporio armani store in moscow so i am excited that it is becoming a reality
1972079 this city is not only the capital but one of the most important business social and international hubs in europe with a quickly rising reputation for being style conscious
1972080 moscow is a fascinating city that has an indisputable energy and beauty with its mixture of east meets west tradition with modernity and antiquity with futurism that has created a one of a kind atmosphere

1972086 ive arrested millions and all i got was stronger pot
1972087 it feels like they have used inflammatory framing to get attention around the issue
1972088 its not mostly white in no way is it a strategic racist plan to keep chinatown from being rezoned
1972089 we support chinatown being rezoned if that is what stakeholders in chinatown want to do
1972090 can you imagine what is going to happen in two years in two years time we are going to have more hotels and luxury buildings
1972091 chinatown should have its own rezoning process and planning process
1972092 a three judge panel overturned a lower court order in february that had created an uproar among home schooling parents when it required the credentialing an estimated 166 000 california children are home schooled the second district appellate court in los angeles ruled that individual parents like private schools are exempt from the requirement that those who teach children be credentialed by the state

1972293 the story of the questions the real story of zapata
1972294 that zapata appeared here in the mountains he wasnt born they say he just appeared just like that they say he is ikal and votan who came all the way over here in their long journey and so as not to frighten good people they became one because after being together for so long ikal and votan learned they were the same and could become zapata and zapata said he had finally learned where the long road went and that at times it would be light and at times darkness but that it was the same votan zapata and ikal zapata the black zapata and the white zapata they were both the same road for the true men and women

1972455 across income levels region and political affiliation adults want presidential candi dates to focus on health reforms in each of these areas
1972456 about nine of 10 adults say it is important for presidential candidates to have reform proposals that would improve the quality of care 90 ensure care and insurance are affordable 93 and decrease the number of uninsured 88 in fact a majority think these policy priorities are very important
1972457 see the system as not well organized and not well coordinated
1972458 strong public support for the use of health information technology stands in stark contrast to actual practice in the united states
1972459 even though its a non randomized trial it confirms that if you use three potent active drugs in the appropriate patients you get very good results even in a fairly advanced population

1972461 tell their patients that feeling listless is an expected part of aging but there are reasons people are tired and they need to be investigated
1972462 these factors could be the initial candidates for clinical investigation of anergia of undetermined origin
1972463 these findings would suggest that anergia warrants consideration as a geriatric syndrome
1972464 in clinical settings anergia being recognizable as a chief complaint or concern is a more readily identifiable condition than frailty is
1972465 further investigations for potentially effective interventions targeted at anergia in older persons appear warranted
1972466 self reported lack of energy anergia among elders in a multiethnic community
1972467 we have seen first hand what the lack of tummy time can mean for a baby developmental cognitive and organizational skills delays eye tracking problems and behavioral issues to name just some complications
1972468 amass and quantify the observations of early motor delays as well as identify causal factors
1972469 new parents are told of the importance of babies sleeping on their backs to avoid sids but they are not always informed about the importance of tummy time
1972470 since the early 1990s we have seen a significant decrease in sids cases while simultaneously witnessing an alarming increase in skull deformation
1972471 the survey does not definitively identify lack of tummy time as the cause of the increase in early motor delays rather the survey quantifies experienced observations by qualified professionals which may serve as a hypothesis for a future scientifically controlled study on the rate of increase and causes of early motor delays
1972472 in addition to back sleeping and lack of tummy time
1972473 the increase may also be caused by factors such as a higher survival rate of preterm babies increased numbers of twins and triplets who may be crowded in the uterus and increased survival of children with cardiac neurological and genetic disorders

1972506 that the overwhelming factor predictive of risk in patients with differing severities of comorbidities is the anatomic extent of the aortic disease
1972507 more commonly used to treat aneurysms limited to supradiaphragmatic and infradiaphragmatic aorta types 0 and iv whereas open repair was more frequently used to treat type ii and iii thoracoabdominal aneurysms
1972508 vast majority of endovascular devices used in the present study were not commercially available in the united states but were used in the context of a physician sponsored investigational device exemption study
1972509 a marked decrease in the amount of intra arterial contrast and radiation exposure

1972515 again seems to refute for infants and children who have simple febrile seizures the idea of a shared cause between febrile seizures and sudden death

1972565 the findings suggest that phenotypes related to subjective experiences upon smoking experimentation may mediate the development of nicotine dependence
1972566 no other initial smoking experience was associated significantly with the rs16969968 genotype

1972648 michelle is speaking out about the john mccain campaign ad that likened her husband barack to a celebrity on the order of paris hilton
1972649 its funny to have anybody characterize barack as an elitist you know this is the kid who was raised by a single mother who didnt have access to many resources who you know has walked away his entire life from lucrative careers to work in the community this guy you know he personifies all of what you know we hope that our kids can be

1972779 its going to change what singaporean shoppers are already complaining about same old same old same sort of stores just more available in more places
1972780 thats going to come not necessarily from existing retailers for a very simple reason they have vested interests they have an existing infrastructure in place an existing business model in place what they really want to do is make more money from their existing investments
1972781 but as a business we have to be prepared for the slower growth especially the government highlighted the inflation pressure
1972782 going forward i think it is inevitable that oil prices will keep rising and inflation and business cost will not stay down for the moment
1972783 so especially for small and medium size businesses they really need to prepare for the worst and try to cut costs and increase the volume of production increase productivity in order to combat this inflation

1972792 either admit that you are attempting to use good in a way that has nothing to do with reasons for action or admit that your use of the term good in this instance is flawed since it claims the existence of reasons for action that do not in fact exist
1972793 you cant prove that your definition of good is any better than any others

1972800 we may see reflected in this liturgy the reenactment of the victory of yahweh in the primordial battle and his enthronement in the divine council or better in his newly built cosmic temple such an interpretation assumes a canaanite myth and ritual pattern standing behind the israelite rite reflected in the psalm yamm deified sea claimed kingship among the gods the council of the gods assembled and told of yamms intentions to size the kingship and take bal captive made no protest they were cowed and despairing sitting with heads bowed to their knees bal rases and rebukes the divine assembly and goes forth to war in the cosmogonic battle he is victorious and he returns to take up kingship cta 2 amp 4 presumably he returned to the assembled gods and appeared in glory and the divine assembly rejoiced in a later text cta 4 bals temple symbolic of his new sovereignty is completed and the gods sit at banquet celebrating bal is king similarly in tablet vi of the babylonian creation epic marduk after battling the primordial ocean tiamat and creating the universe out of her carcass receives from the gods a newly constructed temple where the gods sit at banquet celebrating his kingship the babylonian account of creation in the enuma elis is not too remote a parallel since there is some evidence collected by thorkild jacobsen the battle between marduk and tiamat
1972801 now the people became like those who complain of adversity in the hearing of yahweh and when yahweh heard it his anger was kindled and the fire of yahweh burned among them and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp
1972802 now moses heard the people weeping throughout their families each man at the doorway of his tent and the anger of yahweh was kindled greatly and moses was displeased so if you are going to deal thus with me please kill me at once if i have found favor in your sight and do not let me see my wretchedness
1972803 yahweh said to moses take all the leaders of the people and execute them in broad daylight before the yahweh so that the fierce anger of the yahweh may turn away from israel

1972808 it shall be when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees then you shall act promptly for then the lord yahweh will have gone out before you to strike the army of the philistines
1972809 for the lord will pass through to smite the egyptians and when he sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts the lord will pass over the door and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite you
1972810 also seven priests shall carry seven trumpets of rams horns before the ark then on the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times and the priests shall blow the trumpets
1972811 it shall be that when they make a long blast with the rams horn and when you hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall shout with a great shout and the wall of the city will fall down flat and the people will go up every man straight ahead
1972812 they utterly destroyed everything in the city both man and woman young and old and ox and sheep and donkey with the edge of the sword they burned the city with fire and all that was in it
1972813 then joshua made them take an oath at that time saying
1972814 so about three thousand men from the people went up there but they fled from the men of ai the men of ai struck down about thirty six of their men and pursued them from the gate as far as shebarim and struck them down on the descent so the hearts of the people melted and became as water
1972815 israel has sinned and they have also transgressed my covenant which i commanded them and they have even taken some of the things under the ban and have both stolen and deceived moreover they have also put them among their own things
1972816 it shall be that the one who is taken with the things under the ban harem shall be burned with fire he and all that belongs to him because he has transgressed the covenant of the lord and because he has committed a disgraceful thing in israel
1972817 they raised over him a great heap of stones that stands to this day and the lord turned from the fierceness of his anger therefore the name of that place has been called the valley of achor to this day
1972818 then all israel returned to ai and struck it with the edge of the sword all who fell that day both men and women were 12 000 all the people of ai for joshua did not withdraw his hand with which he stretched out the javelin until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of ai so joshua burned ai and made it a heap forever a desolation until this day
1972819 for the message about the cross is nonsense to those who are being destroyed but it is gods power to us who are being saved for since in the wisdom of god the world through its wisdom did not know god god was pleased to save those who believe through the nonsense of our preaching

1972830 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
1972831 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
1972832 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
1972833 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
1972834 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
1972835 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
1972836 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
1972837 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
1972838 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
1972839 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
1972840 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
1972841 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
1972842 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
1972843 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
1972844 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
1972845 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
1972846 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
1972847 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
1972848 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
1972849 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
1972850 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
1972851 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
1972852 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
1972853 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
1972854 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
1972855 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
1972856 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
1972857 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
1972858 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
1972859 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
1972860 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that

1973133 monies garnered from the taxes paid from the private sector
1973134 i can point you to a number of teachers for example that are certainly not being paid for the work that they need to do and the crap they need to put up with from parents
1973135 typical conservative tripe and truly proof that conservatives are greedy selfish and want everything for nothing

1973148 on the other hand you keep harping about fred walsers 365 day jail sentence and dont say much about how the 365 days is suspended and that he wont actually serve any time in jail either
1973149 yeah i am already in china but if you dont let our olympians come then i will just go home myself

1973152 actually pudge part of the rules which applied to those who wanted to compete in the modern olympics was that they were amateur athletes in every sense of the word
1973153 perhaps you fail to remember that there was an investigation into mark spitz having his sneekers in his hands and when he raised his arms in victory
1973154 the soviets et all were breaking the rules what is the
1973155 you did not see the amateur only rule as being part and parcel of the spirit and intent of the modern olympics and i did
1973156 i really dont give them any more relevence than i do professional wressling

1973222 they run you ragged they test your limits they eat your life up and then they do it again the following day

1973224 god gives you the strength to do what you have to do to care for them
1973225 on the evening of january 18th at around 8 pm my first child cordelia krizsan vogel entered the world

1973227 please do not pick a fight with me over the joys of natural childbirth
1973228 on the bright side once the drugs arrived the labor was while tiring surprisingly pleasant we chatted with the nurses hung out and occasionally napped on the down side at the end of it well while the mother doesnt want me to go into too much detail lets just say that her private area looked like the first 30 minutes of saving private ryan
1973229 i stand on the other side of the divide and i cannot understand the constant focus on self
1973230 contrary to shouting thomass assertions i dont need someone to pray that their god will enlighten me about fatherhood i understand perfectly well that there are joys as well as burdens that come with being a parent but the charge that someone who chooses not to be a parent is selfish is nonsense for example i am not nearly enough money to raise children and to give them the opportunities that i think they would deserve in addition western society as a whole is well on the way to self destruction an assertion that i believe shouting thomas himself has made before as well to bring a child into this world regardless of these considerations simply because i desired a child might be well selfish
1973231 i find it easy i have never understood the woe is me stories of parenthood surely there are individual points of time where any parent needs a break but as far as day to day life i never got more reading done than the first 18 months of my first child they sleep 12 14 hours out of 24 youre the adult dictator in charge and have complete control of their environment and schedule you can choose to make your life easy or hard i choose easy
1973232 the world of the hip individual always focused on his own needs always spending his money on himself alone always free to do as he pleases it bores and depresses me
1973233 poverty and hard work improve the moral nature of people affluence and leisure does the opposite
1973234 yes i do believe that you are being selfish because you are opting out of the moral battle in order to secure your own personal peace have children and take up the challenge to rear them in the traditional ways that to me is the better response to a society gone mad with affluence and selfishness
1973235 and the larger issue is one i havent even mentioned have children to fulfill your responsibility to your mother and father i guarantee you that no matter what they say your mother and father are praying for grandchildren they want their line to live on into the future they want a stake in the future the world will be a better place if you honor your obligation to your mother and father
1973236 have children to fulfill your responsibility to god god will provide
1973237 of course my parents would like me to have children so what
1973238 no having children does not fulfill you you are responsible for that but they do certainly make you experience love in ways youd never expected and you get to have a second childhood through them

1973249 we certainly dont want to take anything off the table but lets focus on the availability and the benefits that delaware has for our energy future today which is a wind farm which is the ge solar plant in new castle county which is the university of delawares participation in the darpa solar research project which is the 150 researches looking into hydrogen futures and so those are the areas we really ought to be focusing on in delaware and let the oil and gas industry figure that out over the next decade or so

1973262 mengapa kamu tidak mau berperang di jalan allah dan membela orang orang yang lemah ditindas dari kalangan lelaki wanita maupun anak anak mereka merayu serta merintih

1973497 many coal beds in the united states are saturated with natural gas methane but the gas is difficult to produce because methane typically binds to coal however co2 shares the same tendency injecting it into the coal bed essentially displaces the methane and makes the gas easier to produce
1973498 due to the tendency of coal to swell when in contact with co2 high initial coal permeability is required to maintain co2 injection rates high injectivity over time doe has established high injectivity as a sequestration program goal for large scale low cost sequestration in coal
1973499 resulting vegetation growth should induce additional co2 uptake another form of carbon sequestration

1973535 wherefore my brethren let us do the will of the father who called us that we may live and let us earnestly follow after virtue but forsake every wicked tendency which would lead us into transgression and flee from ungodliness lest evils overtake us for if we are diligent in doing good peace will follow us
1973536 it is more important to guard against good works than against sin
1973537 a person that is baptized cannot though he would lose his salvation by any sins however grievous unless he refuses to believe for no sins can damn him but unbelief alone
1973538 be a sinner and let your sins be strong but let your trust in christ be stronger and rejoice in christ who is the victor over sin death and the world we will commit sins while we are here for this life is not a place where justice resides no sin can separate us from him even if we were to kill or commit adultery thousands of times each day
1973539 wherefore brethren by doing the will of the father and keeping the flesh holy and observing the commandments of the lord we shall obtain eternal life
1973540 thou shalt not covet is a commandment which proves us all to be sinners since it is not in mans power not to covet and the same is the drift of all the commandments for they are all equally impossible to us
1973541 if we allow them the commandments any influence in our conscience they become the cloak of all evil heresies and blasphemies
1973542 for he is faithful who has promised that he will bestow on every one a reward according to his
1973543 ear has not heard nor eye seen neither have entered into the heart of man
1973544 if we are not found to have holy and righteous works
1973545 those are my brethren who do the will of my father
1973546 let us therefore work righteousness that we may be saved to the end blessed are they who obey these commandments even if for a brief space they suffer in this world and they will gather the imperishable fruit of the resurrection
1973547 but by whom is god sanctified since he himself sanctifies
1973548 what dearest brethren will be that glory of those who labour charitably how great and high the joy when the lord begins to number his people and distributing to our merits and good works the promised rewards to give heavenly things for earthly eternal things for temporal great things for small to present us to the father to whom he has restored us by his sanctification to bestow upon us immortality and eternity to which he has renewed us by the quickening of his blood to bring us anew to paradise to open the kingdom of heaven in the faith and truth of his promise
1973549 for this palm of works of salvation let us gladly and readily strive let us all in the struggle of righteousness run with god and christ looking on and let us who have already begun to be greater than this life and the world slacken our course by no desire of this life and of this world if the day shall find us whether it be the day of reward or of persecution furnished if swift if running in this contest of charity the lord will never fail of giving a reward for our merits in peace he will give to us who conquer a white crown for our labours in persecution he will accompany it with a purple one for our passion
1973550 moreover in another place the same apostle instructs the righteous and the doers of good works and them who lay up for themselves treasures in heaven with the increase of the divine usury that they also should be patient and teaches them saying
1973551 it is the wholesome precept of our lord and master
1973552 in my word you shall be truly my disciples and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free
1973553 let the inspired scriptures then be our umpire and the vote of truth will be given to those whose dogmas are found to agree with the divine words
1973554 now they charge us with innovation and frame their complaint against us in this way they allege that while we confess three persons we say that there is one goodness and one power and one godhead and in this assertion they do not go beyond the truth for we do say so but the ground of their complaint is that their custom does not admit this and scripture does not support it what then is our reply we do not think that it is right to make their prevailing custom the law and rule of sound doctrine for if custom is to avail for proof of soundness we too surely may advance our prevailing custom and if they reject this we are surely not bound to follow theirs let the inspired scripture then be our umpire and the vote of truth will surely be given to those whose dogmas are found to agree with the divine words
1973555 it is enough for proof of our statement that the tradition has come down to us from our fathers handed on like some inheritance by succession from the apostles and the saints who came after them they on the other hand who change their doctrines to this novelty would need the support of arguments in abundance if they were about to bring over to their views not men light as dust and unstable but men of weight and steadiness but so long as their statement is advanced without being established and without being proved who is so foolish and so brutish as to account the teaching of the evangelists and apostles and of those who have successively shone like lights in the churches of less force than this undemonstrated nonsense
1973556 the question is as i said very difficult to deal with yet if we should be able to find anything that may give support to the uncertainty of our mind so that it may no longer totter and waver in this monstrous dilemma it would be well on the other hand even if our reasoning be found unequal to the problem we must keep for ever firm and unmoved the tradition which we received by succession from the fathers and seek from the lord the reason which is the advocate of our faith and if this be found by any of those endowed with grace we must give thanks to him who bestowed the grace but if not we shall none the less on those points which have been determined hold our faith unchangeably
1973557 but inasmuch as since we composed that written defence of our conduct again some of the brethren who are of one mind with us begged us to make separately with our own lips
1973558 we have learned from none others the plan of our salvation than from those through whom the gospel has come down to us which they did at one time proclaim in public and at a later period by the will of god handed down to us in the scriptures to be the ground and pillar of our faith
1973559 we have learned from none others the plan of our salvation than from those through whom the gospel
1973560 when however they are confuted from the scriptures they turn round and accuse these same scriptures as if they were not correct nor of authority and assert that they are ambiguous and that the truth cannot be extracted from them by those who are ignorant of tradition for every one of these men being altogether of a perverse disposition depraving the system of truth is not ashamed to preach himself
1973561 all those who in whatever manner whether by an evil self pleasing by vainglory or by blindness and perverse opinion assemble in unauthorized meetings we do this i say by indicating that tradition derived from the apostles of the very great the very ancient and universally known church founded and organized at rome by the two most glorious apostles peter and paul as also by pointing out the faith preached to men which comes down to our time by means of the successions of the bishops for it is a matter of necessity that every church should agree with this church on account of its pre eminent authority that is the faithful everywhere inasmuch as the apostolical tradition has been preserved continuously by those faithful men who exist everywhere the blessed apostles then having founded and built up the church committed into the hands of linus the office of the episcopate of this linus paul makes mention in the epistles to timothy to him succeeded anacletus and after him in the third place from the apostles clement was allotted the bishopric this man as he had seen the blessed apostles and had been conversant with them might be said to have the preaching of the apostles still echoing in his ears and their traditions before his eyes nor was he alone in this for there were many still remaining who had received instructions from the apostles
1973562 to this clement there succeeded evaristus alexander followed evaristus then sixth from the apostles sixtus was appointed after him telephorus who was gloriously martyred then hyginus after him pius then after him anicetus soter having succeeded anicetus eleutherius does now in the twelfth place from the apostles hold the inheritance of the episcopate in this order and by this succession the ecclesiastical tradition from the apostles and the preaching of the truth have come down to us and this is most abundant proof that there is one and the same vivifying faith which has been preserved in the church from the apostles until now and handed down in truth
1973563 but polycarp also was not only instructed by apostles and conversed with many who had seen christ but was also by apostles in asia appointed bishop of the church in smyrna whom i also saw in my early youth for he tarried on earth a very long time and when a very old man gloriously and most nobly suffering martyrdom departed this life having always taught the things which he had learned from the apostles and which the church has handed down and which alone are true
1973564 all those whose soundness of character leads them to hold
1973565 but we do not rest only on the fact that such is the tradition of the fathers for they too followed the sense of scripture and started from the evidence which a few sentences back i deduced from scripture and laid before you
1973566 let us now investigate what are our common conceptions concerning the spirit as well those which have been gathered by us from
1973567 can i then perverted by these mens seductive words abandon the tradition which guided me to the light which bestowed on me the boon of the knowledge of god whereby i so long a foe by reason of sin was made a child of god but for myself i pray that with this confession i may depart hence to the lord and them i charge to preserve the faith secure until the day of christ and to keep the spirit undivided from the father and the son preserving both in the confession of faith and in the doxology the doctrine taught them at their baptism
1973568 that you remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as i delivered them to you
1973569 hold fast the traditions which you have been taught whether by word or our epistle
1973570 the institutions of the gospel have now everywhere been thrown into confusion by want of discipline there is an indescribable pushing for the chief places while every self advertisertries to force himself into high office
1973571 wherefore we too are undismayed at the cloud of our enemies and resting our hope on the aid of the spirit have with all boldness proclaimed the truth
1973572 the faith will totter if the authority of the holy scripture loses its hold on men we must surrender ourselves to the authority of holy scripture for it can neither mislead nor be misled
1973573 now faith will totter if the authority of scripture begin to shake and then if faith totter love itself will grow cold for if a man has fallen from faith he must necessarily also fall from love for he cannot love what he does not believe to exist but if he both believes and loves then through good works and through diligent attention to the precepts of morality he comes to hope also that he shall attain the object of his love and so these are the three things to which all knowledge and all prophecy are subservient faith hope love
1973574 whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away
1973575 he has given therefore the keys to his church that whatsoever it should bind on earth might be bound in heaven and whatsoever it should loose on earth might be loosed in heaven that is to say that whosoever in the church should not believe that his sins are remitted they should not be remitted to him but that whosoever should believe and should repent and turn from his sins should be saved by the same faith and repentance on the ground of which he is received into the bosom of the church for he who does not believe that his sins can be pardoned falls into despair and becomes worse as if no greater good remained for him than to be evil when he has ceased to have faith in the results of his own repentance
1973576 whether the lord and ruler of the world did indeed fill the womb of a virgin did his mother endure the protracted fatigues of ten months and being yet a virgin in due season bring forth her child and continue even after that with her virginity intact was he whom the universe is supposed to be scarcely able to contain concealed within the small body of a crying infant
1973577 the body of the infant jesus was brought forth from the womb of his mother still a virgin by the same power which afterwards introduced his body when he was a man through the closed door into the upper chamber john 20 26 here if the reason of the event is sought out it will no longer be a miracle if an example of a precisely similar event is demanded it will no longer be unique let us grant that god can do something which we must admit to be beyond our comprehension in such wonders the whole explanation of the work is the power of him by whom it is wrought
1973578 because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before him for by the law is the knowledge of sin
1973579 but knowing that man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of jesus christ we also believe in christ jesus that we may be justified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified
1973580 thou believest that there is one god thou dost well the devils also believe and tremble
1973581 what advantage then hath the jew or what is the profit of circumcision
1973582 the holy roman church firmly believes professes and teaches that the matter pertaining to the law of the old testament of the mosaic law which are divided into ceremonies sacred rites sacrifices and sacraments because they were established to signify something in the future although they were suited to divine worship at that time after our lords coming had been signified by them ceased and the sacraments of the new testament began and that whoever even after the passion placed hope in these matters of the law and submitted himself to them as necessary for salvation as if faith in christ could not save without them sinned mortally yet it does not deny that after the passion of christ up to the promulgation of the gospel they could have been observed until they were believed to be in no way necessary for salvation but after the promulgation of the gospel it asserts that they cannot be observed without the loss of eternal salvation all therefore who after that time the promulgation of the gospel observe circumcision and the sabbath and the other requirements of the law it declares alien to the christian faith and not in the least fit to participate in eternal salvation unless someday they recover from these errors
1973583 matter pertaining to the law of the old testament of the mosaic law which are divided into ceremonies sacred rites sacrifices and sacraments
1973584 but knowing that man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of jesus christ we also believe in christ jesus that we may be justified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified
1973585 that whoever even after the passion placed hope in these matters of the law and submitted himself to them as necessary for salvation as if faith in christ could not save without them sinned mortally
1973586 but knowing that man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of jesus christ we also believe in christ jesus that we may be justified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified
1973587 what is the profit of circumcision because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before him
1973588 the matter pertaining to the law of the old testament of the mosaic law all therefore who after that time the promulgation of the gospel observe circumcision and the sabbath and the other requirements of the law it declares alien to the christian faith and not in the least fit to participate in eternal salvation
1973589 for by grace you are saved through faith and that not of yourselves for it is the gift of god not of works that no man may glory

1973603 russian tanks are moving towards the capital of georgias separatist region of south ossetia which has been under heavy bombardment from georgian forces
1973604 all day today theyve been bombing georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population and we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all around the country
1973605 my country is in self defense against russian aggression russian troops invaded georgia
1973606 i must protect the life and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are we will not allow their deaths to go unpunished those responsible will receive a deserved punishment
1973607 you see that by works a man is justified and not by faith alone
1973608 every tree that brings forth not good fruits shall be cut down and shall be cast into the fire
1973609 matt 7 19 because it is important for the faithful to understand that they must yield good fruit in order to be numbered among the elect our lord is here giving warning to the faithful that faith without works is not enough to be saved and therefore he adds
1973610 not every one that saith to me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doth the will of my father who is in heaven he shall enter into the kingdom of heaven
1973611 and so he first bestows on us a gift by baptism and afterwards gives more abundantly to those who serve him faithfully so then the benefits of christ are rewards of virtue
1973612 so we see that he only gives to those who serve him and
1973613 do not therefore lose your confidence which hath a great reward for patience is necessary for you that doing the will of god you may receive the promise
1973614 heb 10 35 36 and still more he exhorts us to do good works in these words
1973615 i tim 6 12 and encourages st timothy which applies to all of us
1973616 to do good to be rich in good work to give easily to communicate to others
1973617 i tim 6 18 that we may attain eternal life
1973618 what shall it profit my brethren if a man say he hath faith but hath not works shall faith be able to save him
1973619 james 2 14 17 this clearly shows how faith without works is not sufficient for salvation he goes on to say
1973620 thou believest that there is one god thou dost well the devils also believe and tremble but wilt thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead
1973621 do you see that by works a man is justified and not by faith only for even as the body without the spirit is dead so also faith without works is dead
1973622 therefore brethren stand fast and hold the traditions which you have learned whether by word or by our epistle exhort your hearts and confirm you in every good work and word
1973623 but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves for if a man be a hearer of the word and not a doer he shall be compared to a man beholding his own countenance in a glass
1973624 if any one saith that it is necessary for every one for the obtaining the remission of sins that he believe for certain and without any wavering arising from his own infirmity and disposition that his sins are forgiven him let him be anathema
1973625 if any one saith that man is truly absolved from his sins and justified because that he assuredly believed himself absolved and justified or that no one is truly justified but he who believes himself justified and that by this faith alone absolution and justification are effected let him be anathema
1973626 but thanks be to god that you have obeyed from the heart unto that form of doctrine into which you have been delivered
1973627 meaning that we must hold the faith that means live the faith and believe it inviolately and not simply believe
1973628 if any one saith that man may be justified before god by his own works whether done through the teaching of human nature or that of the law without the grace of god through jesus christ let him be anathema
1973629 if any one saith that the man who is justified and how perfect soever is not bound to observe the commandments of god and of the church but only to believe as if indeed the gospel were a bare and absolute promise of eternal life without the condition of observing the commandments let him be anathema
1973630 for even as the body without the spirit is dead so also faith without works is dead
1973631 james 2 26 as st irenaeus one of the most illustrious of the early church fathers says
1973632 for these two faith and good works rejoice in each others company and agree together and fight side by side to set man in the presence of god

1973660 for years the darkest of the night has been beckoning and you have felt her waiting for you she the changing one who works in insistent silence a silence of foreverness a silence that you hunger for and fear will drive you mad for madness is her truth and her home and to enter that darkness all that makes you human could be lost or finally remembered it is in her home that the shadows of all the truths and lies of who you are have gathered and await your attendance the day will come when her silence like death will call your name then without any reason and beyond any understanding you will enter her realm
1973661 birth is the death of the life we have known death the birth of life we have yet to live
1973662 the death scene has been depicted countless times but none as memorably as in the flashbacks in frank millers graphic comic batman the dark knight returns and year one the most startling change in director christopher nolans 2005 batman begins is that the family emerges from the opera before being killed in the comics it has been a movie though the particulars have changed the film tends to be a zorro film in the first chapter of year one it was the mark of zorro in the silent flashback version in the dark knight returns only zorro is visible on the movie theatres marquis though the elderly wayne seeing the mark of zorro on television triggers the memory
1973663 in the dc comics continuity it is established that the mark of zorro was the film which the young bruce wayne had seen with his parents at the cinema moments before they were killed in front of his eyes by an armed thug zorro is often portrayed as bruces childhood hero and an influence on his batman persona there are discrepancies regarding which version bruce saw the dark knight returns claims it was the tyrone power 1940 version whereas a story by alan grant claimed it to be the silent 1920 douglas fairbanks original in the animated series justice league unlimited a flashback of the fateful night establishes that for dcau continuity the young bruce and his parents also were attending the mark of zorro though there is nothing to indicate which version

1973669 i have never supported the brutal expulsion of all palestinians i have said repeatedly that the expulsion of the palestinians is immoral and impracticable
1973670 under some circumstances expulsion is not a war crime i dont think that the expulsions of 1948 of nearly a million palestinians were war crimes you cant make an omelet without breaking eggs you have to dirty your hands moreover if he israeli prime minister ben gurion was already engaged in expulsion maybe he should have done a complete job i know that this stuns the arabs and the liberals and the politically correct types but my feeling is that this place would be quieter and know less suffering if the matter had been resolved once and for all if ben gurion had carried out a large expulsion and cleaned the whole country the whole land of israel as far as the jordan river it may yet turn out that this was his fatal mistake if he carried out a full expulsion rather than a partial one he would have stabilized the state of israel for generations

1973675 every intelligence agency in the world believes the iranian program is geared to making weapons not to the peaceful application of nuclear power
1973676 everyone knows that such measures economic sanctions have so far led nowhere and are unlikely to be applied
1973677 never advocated a genocidal attack on iran with the aim of killing 70 million iranians
1973678 irans leaders would do well to re think their gamble and suspend their nuclear program barring this the best they could hope for is that israels conventional air assault will destroy their nuclear facilities to be sure this would mean thousands of iranian casualties and international humiliation but the alternative is an iran turned into a nuclear wasteland

1973697 through this blessed jihad in yunnan this time the turkestan islamic party warns china one more time our aim is to target the most critical points related to the olympics we will try to attack chinese central cities severely using the tactics that have never been employed we warn china and the international community for the last time that those spectators athletes particularly the muslims who are planning to attend the olympics please change your intention from going to china please do not stand together with the faithless people the turkistan islamic party volunteers will conduct violent military actions against individuals departments venues and activities that are related to the olympics in china

1973699 china reportedly said that east turkestan uyghur islamic terrorists are operating on pakistans soil and trained in special camps in its territory this is the first time beijing administration charged pakistan for harboring anti china elements in its soil the revelation came in a court document in the trial of jailed canadian celil in which it was mentioned that celil joined the east turkistan liberation organisation etlo way back in 1997 and acted as a senior instructor in kyrgyzstan as per the document celil allegedly recruited people and sent them to various training camps on the pamir plateau in pakistan territory etlos prime objective is to carve an independent east turkestan by uniting parts of china and kyrgyzstan

1973709 our findings might also be helpful for research in parkinsons disease
1973710 people suffering from parkinsons typically experience episodes of freezing where they want to move but cannot because of impaired processing in certain parts of the brain by introducing a loud sound during a freezing episode we might be able to startle patients into moving as we know that faster reaction times induced by a startle response are due in part to bypassing the cortical circuits that are damaged in parkinsons disease

1973720 we believe that some of the most compelling areas of future application involve the intimate integration of electronics with the human body
1973721 the advantages of curved detector surface imaging have been understood by optics designers for a long time and by biologists for an even longer time
1973722 thats how the human eye works using the curved surface at the back of the eye to capture an image
1973723 much better suited for use as retinal implants than flat detectors
1973724 the ability to wrap high quality silicon devices onto complex surfaces and biological tissues adds very interesting and powerful capabilities to electronic and optoelectronic device design with many new application possibilities

1973727 we were studying little graphene trampolines and by complete accident we made a graphene sheet over a hole then we started studying it and saw that it was trapping gas inside
1973728 its amazing that something only an atom thick can be an impenetrable barrier you can have gas on one side and vacuum or liquid on the other and with a wall only one atom thick nothing would go through it
1973729 you could have instruments on one side of the membrane in vacuum or air and on the other side you would have dna or proteins suspended in liquid
1973730 and then you could get right up close to image the molecules within a few angstroms
1973731 once you have a membrane that wont let anything past the most interesting thing is to then poke a hole in it then you can detect what leaks through that hole with high sensitivity or make sure only what you want leaks through that hole
1973732 we need to build a better base thats more impenetrable such as single crystal silicon im confident we can make a leakproof version

1973761 why conservatives work harder feel happier have closer families take fewer drugs give more generously value honesty more are less materialistic and envious whine less and even hug their children more than liberals
1973762 do as i say not as i do profiles in liberal hypocrisy
1973763 these do as i say liberals dont actually trust their ideas enough to apply them at home
1973764 instead when it comes to the things that matter most in their personal lives they tend to behave ironically more like conservatives than liberals which can only make one wonder if their liberal prescriptions dont really work for them as individuals how can they work for the rest of us
1973765 it is my contention that liberalism and conservatism are not simply political ideologies but represent divergent ways of life
1973766 for those on both sides their political views are just the tip of an encompassing worldview that addresses the biggest questions about life this worldview influences the decisions they make about family work community and life
1973767 looking at data gathered by the most authoritative and reliable academic research centers in the country as well as academic studies published in refereed journals a pattern emerged that has until now been completely ignored when compared to conservatives on a long list of personality and moral traits modern liberals consistently come up short
1973768 liberalism not only leads to social decay but can also lead to personal decay
1973769 liberalism promotes a way of thinking a way of life and a pattern of living that are destructive on many levels

1973785 a principal advantage of linspire its codec licensing agreement with microsoft no longer applies
1973786 with the linspire acquisition we had three desktop brands and two distinct code bases from joint discussions with our respective engineering teams it made eminent sense to combine our efforts with a single code base and two brands
1973787 freespire is returning to debian because we need to build all of our desktop products upon a single code base
1973788 xandros has always worked closely with the debian community where the emphasis is stability and consistency over the bleeding edge besides its not that big a switch since ubuntu is based on debian as well

1973790 we installed slackware on this old computer i had in my office that was my introduction to open source a student id work with knew about linux and he helped set it up i learned how to admin the box then he graduated and went off so i was the person holding the bag it was a great experience to find out theres this easier and cheaper way an organization could get online
1973791 i had been doing c programming for some research folks when i graduated i was either going to become a programmer or go to graduate school
1973792 i work with my clients to help them figure out the best way to implement technology i help them write bid requests hire web design vendors do project management
1973793 i work with clients who are using various types of open source software
1973794 it was quite serendipitous some colleagues of mine had mentioned me as a possible person to help them out
1973795 i got into open source primarily because i saw it as a way to level the playing field
1973796 i had been working with nonprofit organizations for a very long time and one of the things thats been a real issue for me is that many of these organizations dont have a lot of resources and they want to spend their resources on helping people as opposed to spending them on it its been troubling that in order to get good software theyre forced to spend a lot of money that should be spent on helping people so for me its a lot about putting software in the hands of everybody
1973797 for me thats the primary benefit of open source i dont have anything against proprietary software its fine if you want to pay for it but for me its a crime that organizations that really need good software and do amazing work in the world are often constrained in their ability to get it i value very much the other ideals of open source that you can get at the code and modify and change it if you want to but the way in for me was the level the playing field thing
1973798 this is true over the long term and for all types of different software
1973799 it ebbs and flows i was using drupal and it was atrocious and now its great wordpress was really hard to use and now its like amazing all of this stuff goes through those phases the linux desktop i end up always giving up theres a lot of reasons why that happens but its gotten much better compared to what it was even three years ago
1973800 i would like to see more people of various types and varied levels of expertise involved id like it to be less totally geek driven and more reflective of the wide range of people in the world im not sure how that would happen its not necessarily the open source communitys fault but i think that there would be a lot of interesting benefits if there were more people like designers involved and users who could actually find ways to contribute that are not programming
1973801 i really value the open source community i value the linux community and the incredible amount of work that has gone into making it it takes a lot to make an operating system and to make all the tools in the end when things all shake out down the road i think that linux and other open source operating systems in general will actually triumph i remember that huge pile of floppies in 1995 and how much work it took to get slackware up and now it takes five minutes to get a server up its sort of trivial having watched that its been really amazing even though ive had my own struggles with it i still understand how amazing it has been in the end its going to be linux and thats really cool to me
1973802 gives you the details you need to get your program running on a particular distribution
1973803 this is a beta program and theres no guarantee but yes if appchecker says your program should work with say ubuntu 7
1973804 programs c c symbols mostly functions with some global variables and libraries required by an application that are satisfied by dynamically linked libraries provided by a distribution
1973805 type information expected by the application matches the type of the object provided by the distributions libraries for example the layout of a data structure might have changed or the function parameter that had previously been a 32 bit integer may have been changed to a 64 bit integer another problem that cannot be detected by the appchecker is if the details of a functions behavior changes from one version to another

1973854 abbiamo constatato e ripreso con foto e video la presenza fuori orario dufficio di oltre 70 auto gi parcheggiate quando siamo arrivati ed altre se ne sono aggiunte durante il nostro sopralluogo dichiarano i due esponenti del sole che ride una volta riempito il parcheggio della soprintendenza da poco realizzato le auto hanno proseguito oltre il cancello della villa cercando il posto per parcheggiare allinterno del giardino inferiore che sfocia su porta romana
1973855 a questo punto evidente che ci sono molte contraddizioni emerse in questi mesi sulluso del parcheggio affermano i verdi ufficialmente al momento della costruzione il comune ha dichiarato che il parcheggio era esclusivamente per i dipendenti della soprintendenza e quindi utilizzabile soltanto negli orari di ufficio mentre grazie al sopralluogo fatto ieri e soprattutto grazie alle testimonianze di cittadini residenti nella zona abbiamo accertato che il parcheggio utilizzato anche dopo lorario di ufficio come spazio per gli addetti ai lavori che operano presso larena estiva di boboli quindi anche con mezzi pesanti come tir
1973856 altre difformit rispetto a quanto dichiarato ufficialmente dalla soprintendenza e dal comune riguardano il numero massimo di macchine che avrebbero potuto sostare nella nuova area di parcheggio dichiarano gli esponenti verdi 70 dovevano essere al massimo i veicoli in sosta purtroppo prassi vedere allinterno ben pi di 70 macchine giornalmente parcheggiate durante lorario dufficio ma soprattutto fuori
1973857 avevamo gi constatato che il parcheggio imposto dalla soprintendenza ai cittadini del bobolino aveva privato la zona di unarea verde fruibile creando un un traffico veicolare non per niente conforme al contesto di viabilit della zona dichiarano rispettivamente ragazzo e grassi il comportamento e le dichiarazioni del comune e della soprintendenza riguardo il parcheggio sono frutto di un metodo contraddittorio poco chiaro nei confronti dei cittadini prima viene detto ai cittadini che il parcheggio fatto per i funzionari della soprintendenza da utilizzare solo negli orari di ufficio nel numero di 70 posti chiudendo il parco nella parte inferiore e nei fatti il parcheggio usato per le iniziative estive del comune a boboli ben oltre gli orari di ufficio ben oltre il numero di 70 posti auto e utilizzando comunque lingresso inferiore del parco per arrivare al parcheggio della soprintendenza

1973859 w e spent most of last night working on a fix for a worm which was targeting people on facebook and placing messages on walls urging users to view a video that pretends to be hosted on a google or youtube web site
1973860 weve identified and blocked the ability to link to the malicious web sites from anywhere on facebook less than 002 of people on facebook have been affected all of whom we notified and suggested steps to remove the malware
1973861 i think i know what i want to do after racing now i think i found a new hobby
1973862 its something id never thought about doing and cherie was a great instructor im just glad i didnt chop the thing in half
1973863 waar gladde pr jongens en zaakwaarnemers er alles aan doen om het voetbal mannenbolwerk af te schermen dringt roethof zelfs door tot in de kleedkamers verrassend openhartig en eerlijk geven de drie talenten een inkijk in hun wereld
1973864 aan de hand van de overlevingsstrategie van de groene amsterdammer wil ik een film maken over wat kwaliteitsjournalistiek precies is
1973865 een mooi nieuw begin ik vind het heel dapper dat xandra wil meewerken en waardeer het enorm
1973866 de financiering is rond maar het plan staat nog in de kinderschoenen
1973867 bij vertrek was de inschatting dat het met de wind wel meeviel maar halverwege kwam de ploeg in problemen
1973868 niettemin gingen de opnames van het programma gewoon door door de niet geplande reddingsactie liepen de kandidaten hun diner mis noodgedwongen sliepen de deelnemers van het programma zonder eten in een schip waar met tafels en stoelen slaapplaatsen werden gecre erd
1973869 the online auction marketplace for high value assets like real estate jewelry and rare collectibles
1973870 there are a lot of specialized services that go along with buying real property so we thought it made sense to have a site that focuses just on the needs of the real estate buyer and seller
1973871 one of the examples of a function thats important to a real estate buyer but not a personal property buyer is being able to search for properties in particular location we also have a robust resource center that has access to information on sites like zillow and realtytrac and allows us to integrate listings from realtytrac onto our site
1973872 an auction is fastest way to get property onto the market
1973873 having the auction first you can get the property up on the website very quickly and host the auction and generate a lot more exposure on the property than you might be able to otherwise with a traditional sale
1973874 so rather than what people have done in the past where they typically will list the property with an agent and then if it doesnt sell give it to a ballroom auctioneer it seemed like there was a place now with technology to bring a property to market very quickly and test the price in a very short amount of time
1973875 als aandeelhouders praten wij overigens al geruime tijd over eventuele stappen in deze richting
1973876 ook de mededeling waarin wegener melding maakt van gesprekken over een mogelijke overname van pcm lokale media van pcm uitgevers kunnen we bevestigen ook hiervoor geldt nadrukkelijk dat het ori nterende gesprekken betreft tussen pcm en wegener maar er nog geen sprake is van overeenstemming
1973877 gelet op het grote belang van adequate informatievoorziening aan journalisten en de media is met deze traagheid de vrijheid van nieuwsgaring in het gedrang gekomen
1973878 i am looking forward to seeing brett favre in a new york jets uniform

1973883 ik kan sowieso pas wat bekend maken als de omroepen zijn ge nformeerd over de schemas van 2009 dat is nog niet het geval dus tot die tijd my lips are sealed
1973884 wij geven alleen de criteria aan en nemen de uiteindelijke beslissingen wij gaan niet over het ontwikkelen van programmas
1973885 als je geen criteria aangeeft wordt het los zand bovendien herbergt de publieke omroep alle genres en binnen die genres is er nog genoeg ruimte voor experiment en vernieuwing
1973886 all too often our veterans come home from fighting a war to face another war of keeping their homes veterans injured on the battlefield deserve to come home and focus on healing not on fighting to keep their families in their homes
1973887 we saw this two years ago with payday lenders charging service members high interest rates if they missed a payment its the same thing with these subprime loans
1973888 they targeted these people for nice easy cheap loans and as soon as they missed a payment theyre just going after them
1973889 the current va home loan program is irrelevant because the loan amount often does not cover todays home prices and as a result veterans are forced to turn to the commercial mortgage market which is risky and volatile this approved loan increase will allow more veterans to purchase their homes with a funding guarantee from the va
1973890 each foreclosure of a conventional mortgage within an eighth of a mile essentially a city block of a single family home results a decline in property value between 0 9 and 1 136 percent

1973900 thanks to everyone who came to our show at splendour in the grass and thanks to all the people who looked after us always a fun festival to play and a good excuse to take the weekend off up the coast didnt expect to sell out of merch so quick so to those who missed out you can order online or just come to one of the shows on our album tour starting end of august
1973901 shouldnt be allowed to own a computer let alone have a blog
1973902 but then again i suppose details like that count for nothing if you start with the idea that the eu is necessarily evil
1973903 all the rules for products exported from switzerland to the eu have to respect eu rules for their manufacture safety etc and switzerland has no seat at the table to negotiate those rules
1973904 congratulations to the chinese on staging a spectacular opening ceremony for the olympics i have rarely seen anything so colourful london 2012 will have to go some to beat it
1973905 what they needed was a big bucket of directness i told them i had no doubt that if we just continued down the same path we were heading for another loss
1973906 it was pretty obvious there was a steam train coming down the tracks
1973907 what milburn didnt know was that this was probably the first time we had talked about strategy and it was only because milburn as an outsider could force it he could get away with a lot kim ignored it and ignored it but the thing that eventually turned that conversation around was that then treasury spokesman wayne swan eventually bought into it until then i think swan had held himself out of strategy discussions because he thought anything he said would be construed as critical of beazley and he didnt want to risk people thinking that but milburn kept pushing and pushing and once he swan engaged it almost gave everyone else permission to engage and then kim engaged and it actually became a much better calibre discussion than those wed had in the past

1973911 were going to try our hardest not to be violent
1973912 organizers feel that listening to concerns of the community that youre going into is something that we need to do because one of our biggest problems with the government is that they dont listen to us
1973913 so for us to not listen to what other people are saying would be completely hypocritical in light of that and in light of other events that have happened we have decided to move to a different permanent area
1973914 were going to try our hardest not to be violent
1973915 we have felt that the citys stance on this issue was based on their desire to suppress the demonstrations and any message that exposes the democratic partys refusal to end the war
1973916 each night demonstrators will take the freedom cage and transform it into the freedomville shantytown
1973917 security considerations and the need to ensure everyones right to free expression
1973918 to see protestors that want to have peaceful demonstrations be shamed by the city i live in i think
1973919 maybe well sleep during the day i have a feeling most of our organizers will be on red bull
1973920 humor is a powerful weapon and you have to have a sense of humor when you are dealing with the city of denver
1973921 it does not sound accommodating to his people if i were one of his tent state folks i would find myself a place to sleep or consider not going
1973922 if all these young people are going to leave city park and walk somewhere every night then i want the city to tell me how they are going to manage that activity
1973923 were going to try our hardest not to be violent
1973924 it was a very adverse decision where the federal courts are willing to throw away peoples civil liberties in the name of security
1973925 overall the regrettable thing is courts are deferring to security planners who base their plans many times on risks that are extremely speculative and the result is all of our first amendment rights are diminished
1973926 we intend to march and we still intend to go to the pepsi center
1973927 we were waiting to make any statements until we had a conference meeting with our attorneys today

1973934 to move america toward energy independence we need a comprehensive and strategic plan that increases the supply security and diversity of american energy promotes conservation and puts real alternative fuel sources in the hands of consumers to lower costs
1973935 we must lift the moratorium on drilling along the outer continental shelf and open the arctic national wildlife refuge for drilling potentially producing nearly a million barrels of oil a day we must diversify our energy supplies with alternative sources including renewable fuels and wind solar and hydrogen power and we should encourage the production of more nuclear power which provides co2 emission free energy

1973942 was unable to give assurances that something like the hmrc loss would never happen again
1973943 was unable to give assurances that something like the hmrc loss would never happen again

1973946 people aged 65 and over represent around 13 percent of the australian population and by 2051 they will represent more than a quarter of our population
1973947 that is why i am pleased to be opening of feros cares new 5 9 million extension of 19 high care places
1973948 six of these new 19 places came on line in june and a further 13 places will become operational next week
1973949 the facility will then have a total of 64 care places including 16 extra service status places
1973950 two cottages provide general high level care including six places for veterans and two respite rooms another cottage has a secure dementia area and the fourth cottage provides a range of extra services which residents can choose to have at an additional cost
1973951 feros village is to be congratulated for the work it has done in creating this magnificent facility
1973952 in addition feros is part of the greater far north coast community as it provides community care and respite care for employed carers in this region through a pilot model
1973953 the australian government provided feros village bangalow with almost 2 04 million in recurrent funding to assist with the cost of caring for residents
1973954 the tribunals decision is testament to the commitment of departmental staff and the need to put the care and safety of residents first
1973955 i am pleased this sorry situation has come to an end

1973972 most pr people professionals still favour offline media coverage over digital despite recent consumer research identifying online as the more influential medium
1973973 more than half or 53 see it as more valuable but the real story is that its their clients who are still deeply attached to print apparently nearly two thirds or 64 of prs believe their stakeholders prefer print coverage more than online television or radio and more than half or 53 believe their stakeholders are more influenced by print coverage than television online or radio
1973974 i mean dont they ask apparently not according to the parker wayne amp kent survey it seems to be all about the permanence of print the fact you can hold it in your hand and turn the page maybe they never heard to the printer
1973975 over the last few years as i speak to more clients and hear their stories it has led me to believe that 80 of the business is scam
1973976 by that i mean that 80 of people in the business doing seo consultancy are either running an outright scam or they thought it was good to get into seo because its a hot area but they dont really know what theyre doing
1973977 i have never met a web design company or web design consultant who understands seo
1973978 dont trust web designers as far as search engine optimization goes even if they tell you they understand it they dont i used to say that a few understand it but im still waiting for them

1973986 5 by allowing any old stupid vote for a single issue or nut case cause it infantilises politics the two party system has evolved a highly responsive ability to incorporate interest into a manifesto by gathering its constituency the party forms these groups into a government and each voter then has to make a grown up choice about which one it dislikes least
1973987 the answer to the failure of parliamentary politics is to replace it with rule by referendum let the politicians enact the results or just the civil service
1973988 the benefit of the fptp system is that its relatively easy to remove a government it only takes a small amount of voters to change their mind and they are out

1973992 disappointed stv does not retain an element of fptp ams contains a fptp element though the proportionality depends on the balance between the number of constituencies and additional members stv is a multi member system
1973993 ireland provides the only evidence we have of stv in a western european nation in terms of the experience of scandinavia it does not deliver accountable systems and can create notable problems in terms of mis match between elites and voters
1973994 the only thing they all have in common is that parlaiment proportionately represents what we voted for no it delivers a government that absolutely no one voted for
1973995 the majority of the electorate end up with a government they didnt vote for the same criticism that is constantly and incorrectly levelled at pr

1974004 the defendants have shown that the restrictions are content neutral that they are narrowly tailored to serve important governmental interests and that there are adequate alternative channels by which the plaintiffs can communicate their messages
1974005 thus the plaintiffs have not shown that their first amendment rights will be infringed nor that they are entitled to any injunctive relief judgment will enter in favor of the defendants as to claims with regard to the pepsi center

1974091 thus says the lord stand in the court of the lords house and
1974092 god expects those of us who have been called to preach to preach all of his word
1974093 but there shall by no means enter it anything that defiles abomination or a lie but only those who are written in the lambs book of life
1974094 you shall not lie with a male as with a woman
1974095 if a man lies with a male as he lies with a woman both of them
1974096 a woman shall not wear anything that pertains to a man nor shall a man put on a abomination to the lord your god
1974097 you shall not bring the wages of a harlot or the price of a dog to the house of the lord your god for any vowed offering for both of these are an abomination to the lord your god
1974098 you shall burn the carved images of their gods with fire you shall not covet the silver
1974099 nor shall you bring an abomination into your house lest you be doomed to destruction like it you shall utterly detest it and utterly abhor it for it is an accursed thing
1974100 when you come into the land which the lord your god is giving you you shall not of those nations there shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire or one who practices witchcraft or a soothsayer or one who interprets omens or a sorcerer or one who conjures spells or a medium or a spiritist or one who calls up the dead for all who do these things are an the lord your god drives them out from before you

1974113 hes now won two of his stanley cups single handedly
1974114 so how is it that this woman would be rejected by pretty much every sbc church that i have ever been associated with by membership or staff in my 25 years of sb life
1974115 it is an act of obedience symbolizing the believers faith in a crucified buried and risen saviour the believers death to sin the burial of the old life and the resurrection to walk in newness of life in christ jesus
1974116 the believer has been baptized into christ and that means to have been baptized into christs death as well christs death for sin becomes our death to sin burial certifies the reality of death baptism is the ritual act that portrays this burial he was using the ritual act of baptism as a symbol of the complete redemptive event that finds its effectual cause in the death of christ and its completion in the faith of those who believe in gods redemptive plan burial is followed by resurrection as he was raised victor over death so also are we set free from the bondage of sin
1974117 baptism sets forth the death burial and resurrection of christ and our participation therein
1974118 we think baptism is also to the believer a testimony of his faith he does in baptism tell the world what he believes
1974119 and when i came to you brethren i did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom proclaiming to you the testimony of god 2 for i determined to know nothing among you except jesus christ and him crucified 3 i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling 4 and my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power 5 so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of men but on the power of god
1974120 but now god has placed the members each one of them in the body just as he desired
1974121 for through the grace given to me i say to everyone among you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think but to think so as to have sound judgment as god has allotted to each a measure of faith 4 for just as we have many members in one body and all the members do not have the same function 5 so we who are many are one body in christ and individually members one of another
1974122 i will also raise up shepherds over them and they will tend them and they will not be afraid any longer nor be terrified nor will any be missing declares the lord
1974123 do we want people like the bi guys to be in the sbc
1974124 would spurgeon have asked believers baptized in a general baptist church to be baptized again before joining the metropolitan tabernacle church
1974125 the arminianism of that day was a cold dry heartless thing and many who took that name proved that they were already on the down grade towards socinianism as is usual with people on an incline some who got on the down grade went further than they intended showing that it is easier to get on than to get off and that where there is no brake it is very difficult to stop these who turned from calvinism may not have dreamed of denying the proper deity of the son of god renouncing faith in his atoning death and justifying righteousness and denouncing the doctrine of human depravity the need of divine renewal and the necessity for the holy spirits gracious work in order that men might become new creatures but dreaming or not dreaming this result became a reality this down grade course was we have said more rapid more general and more fatal among the presbyterians than among the independents and general baptists we say general baptists for the deadening doctrines of socinianism had made little inroad upon the particular baptists we could not point to a single case of perversion to socinianism during more than two centuries though other and less vital errors have dealt much mischief among the churches of that order
1974126 that doctrine is so precious to me now that i do think if anybody could possibly convince me that final perseverance is not a truth of the bible i should never preach again for i feel i should have nothing worth preaching
1974127 what is the heresy of arminianism but the addition of something to the work of the redeemer every heresy if brought to the touchstone will discover itself here i have my own private opinion that there is no such thing as preaching christ and him crucified unless we preach what nowadays is called calvinism it is a nickname to call it calvinism calvinism is the gospel and nothing else i do not believe we can preach the gospel if we do not preach justification by faith without works nor unless we preach the sovereignty of god in his dispensation of grace nor unless we exalt the electing unchangeable eternal immutable conquering love of jehovah nor do i think we can preach the gospel unless we base it upon the special and particular redemption of his elect and chosen people which christ wrought out upon the cross nor can i comprehend a gospel which lets saints fall away after they are called and suffers the children of god to be burned in the fires of damnation after having once believed in jesus such a gospel i abhor if ever it should come to pass that sheep of christ might fall away my fickle feeble soul alas would fall a thousand times a day if one dear saint of god had perished so might all if one of the covenant ones be lost so may all be and then there is no gospel promise true but the bible is a lie and there is nothing in it worth my acceptance i will be an infidel at once when i can believe that a saint of god can ever fall finally
1974128 god does not let anyone go easily see romans 10 21 where paul was speaking of israel but the principle applies but a believer can be lost if he disregards the continuing checks of the holy spirit and reaches the point where he rejects jesus as his saviour
1974129 i believe that you are a christian because you have been converted by god and i know that you were baptized by immersion but you cant be a member of my church because you werent baptized by someone who believes in eternal security in other words i dont believe that the person who baptized you was even a christian because if they were i would have to accept your baptism
1974130 my problem comes when we say i believe that you are a christian because you have been converted by god and i know that you were baptized by immersion but you cant be a member of my church because you werent baptized by someone who believes in eternal security
1974131 the believers faith in a crucified buried and risen saviour the believers death to sin the burial of the old life and the resurrection to walk in newness of life in christ jesus
1974132 i think this thread has revealed the landmarkian leanings of one preacher in the holler does this mean that baptist identity landmarkism i cant believe volfie said that aog is not a valid church but they are christian huh that makes no sense whatsoever if theyre christian and theyre gathered together thats a church am i missing something here is this the type of baptist we want to be identified with
1974133 point of dialog for all christians provid ing information and christian fellowship within a wholesome god honoring environment in the blogosphere
1974134 is this the type of baptist we want to be identified with
1974135 im not the one saying christians arent real churches you are
1974136 that doesnt mean that i dont count the aog as christians
1974137 your arguments are weak and contradictory and your landmarkism is showing its not a pretty picture
1974138 why would i be bitter about indy thats one of the most ignorant things youve said yet im tired of the bi guys trying to kick everybody out of the sbc and trying to tell southern baptists to raise their baptism numbers by rebaptizing every christian that joins their church
1974139 tell s southern baptists to raise their baptism numbers by rebaptizing every christian that joins their church
1974140 raise their baptism numbers by rebaptizing every christian that joins their church

1974142 spurgeons attitude towards these questions has very often been misunderstood he did not absolutely agree with the practice of the american baptists regarding the communion but he did very nearly and it is an abuse of terms to call him an open communionist he did not advocate or practise the promiscuous invitation of all christians to the table of the lord the communion service was held on sunday afternoon in the tabernacle and admission was by ticket only members of the church of course were furnished with tickets any person not a member desiring to attend and partake of the supper must satisfy the pastor or deacons that he was a member in good standing of an evangelical church when he would receive a ticket at the end of three months he would be quietly told that he had had an opportunity to become acquainted with the church and they would be glad to have him present himself as a candidate for membership otherwise he would do well to go elsewhere where he could conscientiously unite this is a more restricted communion than is practised by most baptist churches in america for in large numbers of our churches pedobaptists occasionally partake of the communion without any such careful safeguards spurgeon did not believe in mixed membership he abhorred it no one could be a member of the metropolitan tabernacle church unless he was a baptized believer credibly a believer and certainly baptized from our point of view it was very unfortunate that he gave the approval of his example to even occasional communion with those whom he believed unbaptized his practice was to this extent illogical and inconsistent and somewhat weakened the general healthfulness of his influence he frankly admitted this in private conversations on many occasions and explicitly said that were he a pastor in america he should conform to the practice of american baptists compared however with the open communion baptists of england he was strongly orthodox and rigidly conservative
1974143 after the down grade controversy baptists in america muted their criticisms of his open communion practices in 1907 g w gardner quoted john a broadus to enforce a claim that his open communion sentiment was an anomaly i heard dr broadus remark once that the statement made by spurgeon to the effect that he had never given the communion question serious consideration was unworthy of spurgeon others argued that he hardly qualified as an open communionist j t christian professor of church history at new orleans baptist bible institute now new orleans baptist theological seminary made spurgeon an honorary member of the close communion club in his 1892 book defending close communion after he proved that spurgeon was wrong to invite unbaptized persons to the lords table he proceeded to enlist him as a close communionist he quoted william e hatcher who in 1892 visited spurgeon spurgeon confessed to hatcher that if i were to come to america to live i would join a close communion church and conform myself to its practices on the communion question he quoted cleveland baptist minister w a perrins a recent graduate of spurgeons college who claimed that spurgeon was at heart a close communionist spurgeon confessed to perrins that if i had to begin my ministry again i should certainly commence with a close communion church i am led to believe the american baptists are right but cannot alter the usages of my church which have been of so long standing 25 25 g w gardner the lords supper baptist courier 15 aug 1907 5 john t christian close communion or baptism as a prerequisite to the lords supper louisville kentucky baptist book concern 1892 243 44

1974150 the discomfort of some progressives with any hint of religiosity has often inhibited us from effectively addressing issues in moral terms
1974151 some of the problem is rhetorical scrub language of all religious content and we forfeit the imagery and terminology through which millions of americans understand both their own personal morality and social justice

1974188 mr obamas years at the law school are also another chapter in which he seemed as intently focused on his own political rise as on the institution itself
1974189 embarking on five political races during his 12 years at the school
1974190 mr obama in turn could play the star in what even some fans saw as self absorption mr obamas hypothetical cases occasionally featured himself take barack obama theres a good looking guy he would introduce a twisty legal case
1974191 he was wary of noble theories students say instead they call mr obama a contextualist willing to look past legal niceties to get results
1974192 nor could his views be gleaned from scholarship mr obama has never published any
1974193 he was unwilling to put his name to anything that could haunt him politically
1974194 all of which may explain why as disturbed as i might have been by ronald reagans election in 1980 i understood his appeal reagan spoke to americas longing for order our need to believe that we are not simply subject to blind impersonal forces but that we can shape our individual and collective destinies so long as we rediscover the traditional virtues of hard work patriotism personal responsibility optimism and faith

1974197 obama finished his second year at harvard law school this spring and has been elected to lead the harvard law review a prestigious position traditionally reserved for a top student
1974198 its a great time to be a young black law school graduate if youre from harvard and in the top quarter of your class said obama
1974199 obama uses his ethnicity as a kind of unspoken metaphor for his political approach here is a man the message is intended to convey who is white and black liberal and conservative foreign and american a man above party ideology and the petty bickering of partisan politics
1974200 i was never lacking in confidence that my particular background would not be a barrier to me running
1974201 im not sure if this is a new lesson but it reinforced my belief that were not as divided as our politics would indicate americans are not particularly ideological

1974209 as unlikely as it would have seemed twenty years ago i am even more hostile to socialism egalitarianism and romanticism far more critical of the british classical and modern neoclassical tradition and even more appreciative of misess great insights than ever before

1974213 if you could do anything tomorrow what would it be
1974214 franke james likes doing the hard things first which is why when it came to reducing her carbon footprint she skipped right past the programmable thermostat and coffee thermos business and headed straight for the real green challenge selling her suv and replacing the driveway with a garden
1974215 if more people did this it would save the city money when you look 25 years down the road at how many people will be living here how many more hard surfaces will be built therell be a lot more stormwater runoff and well have to build more water filtration plants but if we start using permeable materials for our driveways thatll at least be a start
1974216 the don and inner harbour have some 50 points where combined storm water and sanitary sewers can overflow during heavy rains discharging polluted runoff directly into the waterway underground storage tanks would catch runoff and later send it to upgraded sewage treatment plants a project that carries a price tag of roughly 400 million to 500 million
1974217 frankes story made me want to buy a house just to turn the driveway into a garden
1974218 if its not war then we are very close to it
1974219 the russians have invaded georgia and we are under attack
1974220 the blood shed in south ossetia will remain on the conscience of these people and their entourage we will not allow anyone to do harm to our peacekeepers and citizens of the russian federation
1974221 some of the soldiers guns seized up because they expelled so many rounds so quickly
1974222 risk having their homes demolished and a heavy fine imposed
1974223 not only taliban they were pakistan based lashkar e taiba hezb i islami taliban and those people who are dissatisfied with the karzai government
1974224 receiving reports of ethnic cleansing in villages of south ossetia
1974225 no one was wounded but some buildings have been destroyed
1974226 my country is in self defense against russian aggression russian troops invaded georgia
1974227 all day today theyve been bombing georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population and we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all around the country this is the worst nightmare one can encounter
1974228 its not about georgia anymore its about america its values we are a freedom loving nation that is right now under attack
1974229 i left the hospital today just after 12 noon memphis time
1974230 im doing very well i feel real good i just really i thank the staff at elvis presley hospital and many many thanks to my many well wishers its great to know people care about you
1974231 hes recovering nicely at home and his career will continue as planned
1974232 in a world of busy lives we all long for the feeling of a casual afternoon without schedules and the peace and calm that can often exist only in dreams from special vacation escapes and romantic weekends our new mattress lets you bring the special feeling of a romantic bed amp breakfast escape to your own home
1974233 more resources to making sure these are safe olympics than any other country has ever before
1974234 nigerians are fighting corruption through which many of our leaders mostly men have stolen fortunes for their personal use they build colossal homes in london rome and new york because they have to spend money on women and have to hide them in these big homes
1974235 we have been given three months to clean up the area
1974236 we will revive the swat peace agreement when the militants accept our terms
1974237 muslims are an integral part of this great nation and obama and mccain cannot undo that
1974238 if mazen ashabi cannot serve a presidential campaign no one can
1974239 symptomatic of the efforts of a vocal minority to exclude muslims from the political process
1974240 they use smear tactics to attack muslims who want to take part in the political process
1974241 people have to be exposed to the truth they dont believe us when we talk about islamophobia they say were whining or into self victimisation things like this prove thats not true
1974242 y la nica forma de lograrlo es que en el terreno de juego todas tengan las mismas condiciones competitivas y abiertas y que no se recarguen algunas empresas sobre los pagos que le deben al gobierno federal porque si no pagan sus deudas es como un subsidio porque unos los pagan y otros no
1974243 people always look towards the west of iran but we need to look east as well
1974244 there are plenty of u s interests and international troops stationed in afghanistan which can be targeted from the east of the country
1974245 our governments policy is that our troops paramilitary forces and our regular forces are deployed in sufficient numbers
1974246 they are capable of taking action there and any foreign intrusion would be counterproductive people will not accept it questions of sovereignty come in
1974247 as we approach almost seven years after sept 11 im really concerned about the complacency setting in amongst the american people
1974248 let there be no mistake al qaeda or other like minded individuals are still focused on attacking the homeland
1974249 if we go back to the aviation plot it is very clear that was going to be as big if not bigger than 9 11
1974250 in case the united states and israel dare to shoot a bullet iran will target the heart of israel and 32 u s bases in the region imminently
1974251 he said he was not going to face the death penalty but instead planned to kill co workers and other individuals who had wronged him
1974252 he said he had a bullet proof vest and a list of co workers and added that he was going to obtain a glock firearm from his son within the next day because he knew federal agents are watching him and he could not obtain a weapon on his own
1974253 following an attack iran could quickly rebuild its centrifuge program in small easily hidden facilities focused on making weapon grade uranium for nuclear weapons
1974254 no one really knows yet if and when iran will get the system
1974255 no country will want to buy the system if it is proven to be ineffective for this reason russia may not deliver it in the end to iran
1974256 terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals not holy warriors
1974257 al qaedas probability of success in actually overthrowing any government is close to zero
1974258 weakening public support for nation building even though few actively support the taliban
1974259 the problem from our perspective has not been an absence of information going into the pakistani government
1974260 like the israelis we see the iranians racing to build a ballistic missile capability and so we are working to help the israelis fortify their defenses as quickly as possible
1974261 the amount of missiles possessed by hizbullah was doubled and even tripled and their range was extended significantly
1974262 its fairer to say that we are keen to build the sort of traction needed for things to move in the right direction so that the next administration gets a situation thats as manageable and productive as possible
1974263 is continuing with the negotiations in good faith with the intent of giving syria a genuine alternative so that it may make the right decision the peace negotiations depend on syria there is no place solely for overtures but there must also be action syria must decide between iran the axis of evil and international isolation or peace and prosperity
1974264 the attack on sunday was a carefully planned one with upward of 200 insurgents to give it weight of force
1974265 nobody is getting sued for supporting terrorist organizations on the web there is an urgent need for an international internet police
1974266 just highlights how hellbent he is on looking at iraq through a political lens
1974267 its a pain in the neck and significantly interferes with my travel arrangements
1974268 hizbullah is continuing to ignore the resolution with the ongoing intimate assistance of the syrians
1974269 the maneuvers helped the islamic republic to go to the negotiating table with a full hand
1974270 the israelis have said theyd take up to 100 aircraft the singaporeans have said basically the same thing
1974271 israel and the peace process are awaiting the post ehud olmert era
1974272 most of the arab countries are now setting conditions for providing us with financial aid some are saying that they will give us the money only after we end our differences with hamas while others are suddenly talking about the need for reforms and transparency
1974273 he mofaz urged the americans to set firm conditions such as a refusal to allow the iranians to enrich uranium on their turf and to be clear that the deadline must be preserved the iranians are simply looking for cracks to exploit
1974274 all options against iran should not only be on the table but prepared
1974275 the united states and israel share deep concern about irans nuclear program and the two delegations discussed steps to strengthen diplomatic efforts and financial measures to prevent iran from developing a nuclear weapons capability we also reaffirmed our strong mutual determination to counter irans support for terrorism
1974276 equating islam with other religions is a betrayal of islam
1974277 not alleged to have been involved in any of these attacks
1974278 we have heard this type of thing from the syrian ambassadors before in places like washington and london
1974279 but why doesnt syrias ambassador in cairo say the same thing why do we not hear it from others from damascus they are speaking to their audience in the west giving them what they want to hear they are not speaking to us
1974280 playing a double game they are interested in a breakthrough with washington not with us they want the process not peace
1974281 you have a worsening security situation especially localized in three areas the kabul area in the regional command east where the americans are and in the south where we are with the british forces and the dutch
1974282 one of the shells landed near a quranic school killing three children from the same family
1974283 we have intelligence indicating terror activities are possible both on the northern and southern fronts hizbullah may choose to use one of their still disputed subjects such as the shaaba farms or imad mugniyahs assassination
1974284 escaping its international isolation despite assisting hizbullah damascus is taking several steps in order to get closer to the west but is still very much a part of the axis of terror
1974285 i think they should be recalled and be sent back to whichever country they came from they are there as peacekeepers with a very clear mandate to disarm hizbullah theyre not there to honor terrorists
1974286 iran has a choice to make negotiation or further isolation
1974287 they can take this message away with them to iran
1974288 if they dont agree to our proposals we will have to start imposing sanctions
1974289 we have not gotten all the answers to the questions
1974290 wanted to ensure that their interests are catered for in any agreement reached
1974291 the population of somalia is facing serious food shortages the un world food programme has indicated that all current food stocks in somalia will be depleted by mid august

1974295 we have to ask ourselves was karzai right on this point
1974296 if the olympics are not safe there is nothing else worth speaking of
1974297 preliminary results show that the cpp is leading and we expect to win the election
1974298 heavy earth moving vehicles four trucks a tractor several land cruiser jeeps and a number of motor cycles
1974299 we call this a sea borne aircraft carrier system that will be based on the northern and pacific fleets
1974300 since the cease fire began four tons of explosives have been transferred into gaza for hamas as well as 50 anti tank missiles light arms and materials for kassam rocket manufacture metal rods and gunpowder
1974301 neither we nor the palestinians want a deadline that cant be met that will only hurt the talks and the good progress that has been achieved so far
1974302 announcements like this whatever the true number is are not productive and will only serve to further isolate iran from the international community

1974315 we have received credible intelligence reports indicating that insurgents are trying to demolish the naghlu power dam
1974316 we still have to look into the accusations it will be resolved
1974317 boasted of being involved in the transport of wmd warheads to syria
1974318 iraq and afghanistan remain the central fronts in the struggle but we cannot lose sight of the implications of fighting a long term episodic multi front and multi dimensional conflict more complex and diverse than the cold war confrontation with communism
1974319 success in iraq and afghanistan is crucial to winning this conflict but it alone will not bring victory
1974320 southern afghan istan is the flashpoint in this mission its the most vulnerable the most volatile part of the country were not going to let up or relent on our request for other nato countries to come to the south
1974321 mi 24 helicopter gun ships attacked a tamil tiger position offering resistance to the ground troops in mannar
1974322 with the laser there is no need to send troops across the border to destroy the bomb
1974323 spreading false information which weakens the morale of the nation and national sentiment joining a secret organization with the aim of modifying the nations political and economic status inciting racial and sectarian dissent and harming the state
1974324 its one of these bills that only happens every one or two decades and really sets the stage for the future of the college
1974325 its an opportunity for us to deal with the increased numbers coming to the college it will be a chance for us to really be sure the college is in a good place for the next decade
1974326 our public higher education institutions are the linchpin of our states ongoing effort to ensure that the benefits of economic development extend to all citizens of the commonwealth
1974327 we must provide the support they need to be successful in that effort
1974328 the fact is we havent built a new academic building in more than 30 years and this investment has to be made if we are to make umass lowell or any of the states public universities world class institutions

1974342 hij stond in de hoek van de kamer hield zijn hoofd naar achter en slikte al die dingen n voor n in wij gingen er van uit dat het allemaal bij de show hoorde en dat hij al die spullen weldra uit zijn zakken zou tevoorschijn toveren
1974343 ongelooflijk hij moet zelfs te zat geweest zijn om over te geven

1974346 eva im sorry but you will never have me to me youre just some faggy girl and i need a lover with soul power
1974347 notions of anticommercial authenticity are inseperable from anxieties about mass culture and consumerism which echo oedipal fears of castration and male uneasiness about stereotypically feminine attributes such as passivity and vanity
1974348 lets go outback tonight life will still be there tomorrow

1974356 the taliban regrouped after its fall from power and have coalesced into a resilient insurgency
1974357 the objectives are for the commission to identify the culprits perpetrators organizers and financiers of the assassination
1974358 the frequency and level of violence directed at seafarers is cause for alarm the abduction of crew and the increasing use of automatic weapons remain unacceptable
1974359 so small he said he had to double up his limbs in the fetal position
1974360 the dark side the inside story of how the war on terror turned into a war on american ideals
1974361 being disingenuous and exploiting the plight of the zimbabwean people for political gain
1974362 it is an isolated case of imported marburg people should not think about amending their travel plans to uganda but should not go into caves with bats
1974363 currently we are negotiating with a man who is asking for 20 000 euros 31 400 for the location of a mass grave that may contain 1 100 bodies
1974364 can only be found through an end to provocations and the immediate signing of documents on renouncing the use of force
1974365 must be accompanied by the complete withdrawal of georgian troops from the upper kodori gorge
1974366 israel is the strongest country in the region and we have proven in the past that we are not deterred from acting when our vital interests are at stake
1974367 the shebaa farms are of vital strategic importance for israel and therefore have security significance handing the land over to the un means that hizbullah will be there
1974368 the fact is theyve just tested a missile that has a pretty extended range
1974369 from what i saw this is an old version of the shihab 3 and contrary to their claims it is not capable of reaching 2 000 kilometers rather 1 300 kilometers
1974370 the 2 000 kilometer range shihab 3 missiles were tested to demonstrate irans capability in hitting its enemies accurately at the early stages of their probable attacks against the islamic republic
1974371 i had for many years been doing research in how the recording process alters music and the reputation of the universitys sound recording technology program and my research and publication brought us the opportunity to host this year
1974372 we were invited to submit a proposal to host as were several other school in the u s that we were selected is really gratifying
1974373 hard core recording professionals record producers and academics who study music and how the recording process works
1974374 the average person probably isnt going to get a lot out of it
1974375 a seminal event in the intersection of art scholarship and technology

1974393 results not rhetoric drive gordon smith she said his independent minded bipartisan leadership cuts through the partisan gridlock in dc thats what oregonians expect
1974394 as long as were hostage to oil sheiks overseas were mortgaging our future merkley said standing with wyden at the portland gas station
1974395 indeed the smith and the bush energy policy has been a disaster eight years of that policy and what did we get four dollar gas and 600 billion in profits for the oil companies he said
1974396 on issue after issue we have seen filibusters in the united states senate and one of the reasons i wanted to come today is i want you to help send jeff merkley to the united states senate so we can get a new energy policy
1974397 weve got a lot of tough fights ahead and were going to have to take on the biggest lobbies some of the most powerful interests in the country to bring about change wyden said
1974398 unfortunately we tend to mistreat it we tend to undervalue it we tend to not respect it
1974399 if you look at a lot of old urban waterfronts its so disrespectful for the treasure that it is to treat it like weve treated it
1974400 a lot of people are starting to realize waterfront is much more precious than that
1974401 it deserves to be dealt with in a much more environmentally sensitive and public access kind of way
1974402 anybody thats got an urban face on water is trying to figure out how to get better at it
1974403 they keep wanting to do the big master plan the big umbrella and thats just not practical
1974404 start one project at a time one piece of property becomes available you buy it you redevelop it in a way that makes sense that sets a new standard for the next opportunity you take the next opportunity the next opportunity eventually youve acquired the property you need and youve begun to change the whole ambience and the feeling of the place you start that momentum
1974405 the outward signs of arousal in many women that seems to have little effect on a womans willingness or desire to have sex
1974406 baby boomers who were raised with misconceptions about the disease may be at risk
1974407 in this day and age i still get patients who believe that they developed diabetes from eating too much sugar
1974408 bad eating habits such as too much refined sugars empty carbohydrates and fructose does not cause diabetes
1974409 baby boomers who were raised with misconceptions about the disease may be at risk
1974410 the better the patient controls his or her blood sugar the less likely the more serious complications associated with diabetes will progress anyone already experiencing the side effects of diabetes needs to achieve and maintain the most stringent possible control in order to minimize their further progression
1974411 type 2 diabetes even pre diabetes is serious even if your blood sugar isnt that high
1974412 keep in mind you can have your cake and eat it too but if you want to eat something rich in carbs you will need to balance it out by cutting an equivalent amount of carbs or sugar from somewhere else in your diet
1974413 patients have a good deal more flexibility in their diets than they might suspect the rest is just a matter of care and moderation
1974414 this myth is dangerous because you can wind up in the hospital if you ignore symptoms of hyperglycemia which is hard to detect by the way you feel
1974415 making do without a regular blood glucose tests is like flying without a parachute or crossing the street with your eyes closed youre guessing learn your bodys signals when you get into trouble but be certain to use your glucose monitor to be sure
1974416 i still get patients who believe their lives are over once complications set it
1974417 the reality is that with the development of proper skills and mindset and the possession of monitoring equipment patients with diabetes can continue to live full lives even with severe complications many diabetics even insulin dependent live well into old age
1974418 pay attention to your body keep ahead of what your diabetes is doing for baby boomers this is no time for surprises consult with your doctor or your diabetes educator discuss exercise plans and any adjustment in medications with your doctor first
1974419 this is a very complex issue and our understanding of it continues to grow
1974420 both dental and medical professionals need to maintain open lines of communication with each other to ensure the best care for their patients who are taking bisphosphonates
1974421 if a patient needs dental surgery the dentist and treating physicians need to decide whether other treatment options including systemic antibiotics or antimicrobial mouth rinses can help reduce the risk of osteonecrosis
1974422 when you are 50 you may injure your body more easily than when you were 20
1974423 joints tissues and muscles may not be as flexible as they used to be so as you get older you need to take extra steps to protect yourself from injuries when you exercise
1974424 joint replacements used to be limited to the elderly but not anymore
1974425 the bottom line is boomers are more active and were seeing more of these high impact injuries that are otherwise more common in a younger population
1974426 it was very uncommon to see so many people become avid runners into their 60s and 70s a generation ago
1974427 but its very common now to have middle aged people take up such a high endurance sport and run at a much later age
1974428 anyway my point is i would never use my body in that way im just not that kind of girl
1974429 it appears that for people who have a certain genetic makeup the initial physical reaction to smoking can play a significant role in determining what happens next
1974430 if cigarette smoking is sustained nicotine addiction can occur in a few days to a few months
1974431 the finding of a genetic association with pleasurable early smoking experiences may help explain how people get addicted and of course once addicted many will keep smoking for the rest of their lives
1974432 understanding the genetics of complex disorders such as nicotine addiction will require much more research on key traits
1974433 these interventions which have been in use for many years are unlikely to be more effective than no treatment these results challenge current practice as endorsed by a national guideline in the uk
1974434 as a direct result of the lack of evidence many couples with unexplained infertility endure and even request expensive potentially hazardous and often unnecessary treatments
1974435 hey what you have posted about me is hurtful and destructive to my reputation please take it down
1974436 we never planned how many children to have we just let god guide our lives you know because we strongly believe life comes from god and thats the reason we did not stop the life
1974437 we thank god all of them are healthy and happy
1974438 a conservative democrat who is sometimes embarrassed for his party
1974439 i dont apologize for being patriotic if there is something socially incorrect about being patriotic and supporting your troops then they can kiss my ass on that because im not going to budge on that at all and that has nothing to do with politics politics is whats killing america

1974442 billboard country singles chart and his self titled debut album was polydor records and released his next two albums
1974443 in 24 hours its gone from 1 55 to 1 50 which is highly unusual that changes your game plan for the marketplace
1974444 this is payback time for the european currencies against the dollar
1974445 these currencies have to retreat to better reflect the sharp deterioration in economic fundamentals in the euro zone region this is not to say theres been an improvement in u s fundamentals
1974446 confirmed that the window of opportunity for further rate hikes has been slammed shut by the cold blast of negative data releases that swept through the euro zone in the last few weeks
1974447 lots of investors have been on high commodity prices and a low dollar and those bets are getting destroyed
1974448 there is a fundamental rethink in the alignment between the major currencies with the u s dollar coming out on top despite ongoing turmoil in the financial sector
1974449 we continue to see the need to care for and monitor these patients as conditions such as respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases and post traumatic stress disorder are common sometimes chronic and require long term monitoring by healthcare professionals
1974450 furthermore we are concerned about the development of new illnesses such as cancer and autoimmune disease which may have resulted from the intense exposure to dust and toxins
1974451 we offer a unique program that addresses the medical and psychosocial needs of our patients in an integrative manner
1974452 all of our healthcare providers receive special training to meet the myriad of problems that these patients are confronting
1974453 the trend for the dollar is changing quickly we are in a situation now in which the ecb is expected to start cutting interest rates while the federal reserve will have to start hiking
1974454 that combined with the drop in oil and other commodities is giving a big boost to the dollar this is not just a technical move fundamentals are now in place to support a sustained dollar rally
1974455 the contagion is now going global the data is manifesting itself in economies around the world
1974456 the contagion trade is very much factored into the dollar but not for other economies
1974457 the break of eur usd at 1 5300 opens potential to 1 47 within a matter of weeks
1974458 the dollar is in my view in a genuine recovery this trend could run further than many think
1974459 the problems between russia and georgia are not new but the situation seems to be escalating
1974460 this type of conflict gives investors another reason to avoid some higher yielding currencies such as the ruble and fly back into very liquid ones such as the dollar
1974461 dr stein is a major figure in his field and he will help lead us beyond our highly successful clinical research and educational programs to a broader mission that includes regenerative medicine and stem cell research
1974462 dr steins experience and leadership developing new collaborations involving experts across multiple disciplines will be particularly relevant to this broad mission and for our tri institutional program
1974463 working together is the key to our continued ability to effectively rehabilitate patients with a wide range of conditions including heart disease stroke cancer and osteoporosis
1974464 dr steins outstanding record demonstrates a strong commitment to providing individualized and innovative treatments that help patients recover function and regain their independence
1974465 in the coming years as our population ages rehabilitation medicine will become even more important
1974466 dr steins particular expertise in pioneering treatments and technologies together with his passion for educating the next generation of physiatrists will help us meet this challenge
1974467 i am thrilled to join a department on the leading edge of rehabilitative and restorative medicine
1974468 i look forward to the opportunity to continue my research exploring the potential of technology in stroke rehabilitation and recovery alongside the esteemed faculty and staff of columbia university medical center weill cornell medical college and newyork presbyterian hospital moreover i hope to build on the particular strengths of these departments to maintain and improve the combined program in rehabilitation medicines position at the forefront of academic research and clinical care
1974469 if the pregnancy is uncomplicated and the delivery is at 37 weeks or more the only predictor of gbs disease in the baby is maternal colonization
1974470 the risk increases if the mother had a urinary tract infection with gbs before delivery the mother has ruptured membranes more than 18 hours before delivery premature water break or the mothers womb is infected with gbs before delivery the signs are fever tender abdomen high white blood count in the blood
1974471 women should receive penicillin or cefazolin for those allergic to penicillin by vein at least four hours before delivery
1974472 if the baby is born before culture screening has been done women should ask their doctor to perform cultures and treat if necessary
1974473 theres no obvious trigger for strong economic growth in europe until the end of 2009
1974474 massive financial imbalances need to be worked out and the corporate sectors in many countries remain in a substantial deficit
1974475 things are looking pretty gloomy for spain for the rest of this year and into 2009
1974476 in 2009 the gdp growth rate in germany might just slip under the 1 mark
1974477 the latest economic data point to a weakening of real gdp growth in mid 2008 which in part was expected
1974478 we are identifying downside risks since a number of months and i would say that the information that we had very clearly suggests the materialization of those risks
1974479 the main development over the past month seems to be that the ecb is more downbeat about the euro zones current growth situation and the outlook
1974480 unchanged interest rates seem highly likely in the near term at least as mr trichet indicated that the ecb continues to hold a neutral stance
1974481 this worrying level of inflation rates results largely from both direct and indirect effects of past sharp increases in energy and food prices at the global level
1974482 we have one needle in our compass and we take absolutely all the information that is pertinent to identify the risks for inflation in the months and years to come
1974483 the peak of the price of oil and commodities was very abnormal and not corresponding to equilibrium in price but we will see what happens
1974484 volatile captures pretty well the evolution that we have seen in the most recent period
1974485 risks to price stability remain clearly on the upside and have increased over the past few months
1974486 sadly joe passed away this monday at 1am joe was an amazing person always had a smile he was never afraid to help someone out on the bike and he never complained the cycling world will miss you
1974487 she planned to stay indefinitely but house leaders told the original members of a republican protest to go home and take their message to their districts
1974488 over the past two weeks betsy has been in bent baca prowers crowley logan and weld counties talking to folks about how high fuel costs are affecting their lives
1974489 stomping your feet and flying around the country just isnt an energy plan
1974490 while anwr is 19 million acres the footprint of oil exploration in the reserve would be about the size of centerra in loveland
1974491 there is no question that we can develop the resources of anwr in an environmentally friendly manner at a time when working families are struggling with the price of energy we should leave no stone unturned in trying to solve this problem
1974492 when we stand up for folks in southeastern colorado we are really standing up for private property rights
1974493 i will use everything at my disposal to fight this and im glad that were in this fight together
1974494 if hitler invaded hell id at least make a favorable mention of the devil in the house of commons
1974495 one section required that over 600 performers should have uniform expression in their eyes so they must have exquisite feelings and they have to work very hard
1974496 its womens day tomorrow around the world so they wanted a woman
1974497 the national olympic committees were in agreement but the political powers were not
1974498 some gays shoot themselves in the foot once again in trying to be accepted like regular people wanting to live regular lives they parade their freaks for all to see proudly even these freaks are an embarrassment to those in the homosexual community who just want to live and not bring down anything in order to bring themselves up so these freaks will never have my sympathy they got their attention now they can kiss the respect that they want goodbye
1974499 never before have so many people been abandoned at once
1974500 it is inconceivable to think about losing 10 000 jobs in the first wave and the estimates run in the 30 000 range as the wave continues
1974501 i cant assure you that this train wreck isnt going to happen but i will do everything in my power to avert it
1974502 sir promises and trusts are things that have been sadly suspect
1974503 my straight talk would be please dont let this foreign company ruin our part of the world
1974504 please give us a reason to once again believe in promises and trust
1974505 i cant look you in the eye and say were going to avert this
1974506 10 questions is that there are only nine of them but leaving math aside and ignoring two political questions addressed to john mccain and past congresses here are policy answers to the remaining 7 questions
1974507 oil companies to drill on 68 million acres they already control
1974508 a group of christian men who love jesus and love to ride hard
1974509 the two sestrin genes appear to be the missing piece of the puzzle that explains how p53 can inhibit the mtor pathway and thereby negatively regulate cell growth
1974510 we have now shown that in addition to controlling ros accumulation sestrins and p53 also inhibit cell growth by inhibiting the activity of mtor this explains how p53 functions as a potent regulator of so many aspects of cell physiology and provides protection against dna damage and stress
1974511 the heavy preparation for the olympics puts severe strain on an athletes musculoskeletal frame
1974512 the dream of every athlete is to win a medal for his or her country
1974513 this is a great attitude to have but it can become problematic if the athlete develops the stop at nothing mentality to win
1974514 all of us who care about the health of our athletes should be aware of the warning signs of ped use for all athletes not just olympians
1974515 with the easy availability of these drugs some athletes are looking to get bigger and stronger as quickly as possible
1974516 it is our responsibility to educate and inform our athletes of all ages that use of performance enhancing drugs today can lead to life long medical and musculoskeletal problems down the road
1974517 we will not allow the deaths of our compatriots to go unpunished
1974518 give russia the message that invading the territory of a sovereign state and bombing its territory is unacceptable in the 21st century
1974519 we all have to unite in this very important and difficult moment for our homeland when our future and our freedom are under threat
1974520 i hereby announce that reserve officers are called up everyone must come to mobilization centers and fight to save our country
1974521 the best kind of drink is a drink i didnt have to get myself no not because i dont want to pay for it i can even pay for it its because im lazy
1974522 i plan to walk right into those factories and living quarters to see for myself what conditions exist
1974523 elect me i know what the inside of a jail cell looks like
1974524 they said they would take away their endorsement so i guess that kind of makes me a bit of a monk
1974525 that probably falls in the too much information category yeek
1974526 he has a good shot at winning his seat the democrats have already decided they cannot lose
1974527 is this muslim republican mr right or the big cheese
1974528 it is unfortunate in a district like the 2nd congressional district where past representatives have been such stalwarts for the environment that a candidate would be a supporter of cyanide heap leach mining
1974529 i have not and will not support this type of mining it poisons our environment
1974530 she supports the use of cyanide heap mining and will does not
1974531 cyanide heavy metals and acid mine drainage from the summitville mine killed all aquatic life within 17 miles of the alamosa river
1974532 when it comes to protecting our environment there is right and there is wrong i strongly believe the use of cyanide is wrong and i will fight for a law to ban its use
1974533 fitz gerald supports whatever method of extraction is safest including cyanide mining
1974534 i never knew black people listened to that kinda music
1974535 while rational drug design remains a perfectly valid way to develop cancer therapies we also need approaches that are less costly and more productive of new effective treatments
1974536 you could say this is more of a guerrilla approach instead of screening millions of untested compounds for an agent that inhibits or stimulates a particular molecular target we chose to screen a large library of already approved drugs for novel activity against melanoma cells and then advance the most promising candidate rapidly to clinical practice
1974537 our ability to identify novel treatments for melanoma and advance them rapidly into the clinic very much depends on nyus multidisciplinary approach to melanoma care and research
1974538 to be effective translational medicine cannot be unidirectional discovery moves continuously back and forth between the clinic and the bench we are now focused on determining the range of doses to be tested in the clinic whether specific types of melanomas will respond better than others and whether combining mebendazole with other agents will be of further benefit
1974539 one thing we can say with certainty is that treatment of hiv disease with restoration of immunity is good for the heart this is the most important message today
1974540 after taking a look at how quickly we were able to grow the vh1 blog on vh1 com we decided to look at ways we could go deeper with our blog coverage of pop culture and our vh1 shows and events separately
1974541 with a dedicated staff of writers scandalist com will serve as a distinct yet complimentary site for fans of pop culture entertainment news and all things celebrity
1974542 a big part of this hamdan case has been gearing up for the trials of the high value detainees
1974543 nobody will say they are small fry and in each of those cases the government will be seeking the death penalty
1974544 this was a case of a fair minded panel of military officers operating in a fundamentally unfair system
1974545 the fact that the military officers performed their duties conscientiously does not make fair a system which allows the use of coerced evidence is designed to cover up abuse and disregards basic due process protections
1974546 if this isnt enough to validate the commissions against the strident and unfair criticism i dont what would be
1974547 the military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process for prosecuting detainees alleged to have committed crimes against the united states or our interests we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial
1974548 the question is not whether social conservatives will hold their noses and vote for mccain its will they knock on doors and plant yard signs
1974549 we dont have any faith that he will be consistent on the moral issues we really care about
1974550 putting gov huckabee on your ticket will immediately excite mobilize and activate a key grass roots constituency that is essential to your success
1974551 my fear is that there would be a lot of women and any number is too many who would say i think i will stay home
1974552 its something my parents instilled in me i cant relate to stuff like lucky socks or rabbits feet
1974553 if it wasnt for the olympics 8 8 08 would be like any other day
1974554 we dont have to out think our opponent to win any battle we just have to think think we have to know the geography of thought and know enough about our location to be able to move in any direction
1974555 served in the 89th infantry division that liberated ohrdruf a subcamp of buchenwald the first camp liberated by americans on april 4 1945
1974556 hitler had a moustache and mitchturb has a moustache so misturb is hitler
1974557 gee i guess its not that impressive that my grand uncle helped liberate buchenwald so ill just say it was my uncle at auschwitz instead
1974558 too bad that only the russians liberated those in auschwitz and his uncle never was in world war ii
1974559 i realize that many may call their great uncle their uncle so i take that back
1974560 obamas great uncle helped liberate buchenwald not auschwitz so he seems to have the same trouble with specific facts that mccain who says sunni when he means shiite does
1974561 it is ridiculous to support this and no common farmer does
1974562 i never knew black people listened to that kinda music
1974563 at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
1974564 john mccain will participate in tribute to american veterans and active duty servicemen on aug
1974565 lady victoria and 3 other professional women wrestlers will conduct twice daily oil wrestling matches
1974566 we must adopt the way of mahatma gandhi our father of nation and must work with unity and live in unity holistic principle of unity assures us of curbing problem like terrorism
1974567 if they are found involved in any such criminal act strict disciplinary action will be taken against them
1974568 we have traced call details of raju that show his regular contacts with some more chandigarh police officers and with some elite personalities in the city but we will disclose it once we have substantial proof
1974569 not even a gram of drugs can be sold in chandigarh without the police knowledge everyone knows that the police are involved but still no steps are taken to check the senior ips officers
1974570 state lawmakers on monday approved an investigation into whether gov sarah palin abused her power in firing former public safety commissioner walt monegan they want to find out whether palin was angry at monegan for not firing an alaska state trooper who went through a messy divorce and ongoing child custody battles with palins sister
1974571 this is absolute bulls youve got all three commissioners ready to kill that guy
1974572 you cannot build anything on anyones land without their permission
1974573 i wouldnt vote for me either if i approved something like this im not that f stupid

1974578 became a worldwide top 10 hit the albums title track failed to chart or sell noticeably outside the united states and the uk where it managed to enter the top 20 of the single chart

1974583 im happy to say that many of the tracks included are my favorites too
1974584 she couldnt give the new season the attention and commitment it deserved
1974585 i think moesha is so much like me that i feel real comfortable
1974586 its going to be me playing a character based on my life but its not going to be me as brandy
1974587 its going to be a totally different person but with the same challenges that i go through in my life being a single mom raising my child trying to have a life trying to have friends and trying to do my own thing
1974588 pharrell says delayed solo debut is finally done lp due this spring
1974589 songwriter and producer kerry krucial brothers stresses the importance of studying your craft
1974590 is showing republicans how the gop can return to its small government roots
1974591 my husband was jumping up and down for joy and i was just dumbfounded
1974592 the sovereignty issue is very big for the iraqis and we understand that but we are losing patience
1974593 the process needs to get moving and get moving quickly
1974594 this move is meant to offer an incentive for the foreign forces to withdraw
1974595 the special cells of fighters will not strike against foreign forces until the situation becomes clear vis a vis the iraq u s agreement on the presence of american forces here
1974596 this guy was fundraising and missing votes that is reprehensible
1974597 shove a bunch of 30 second ads up opponent mark udalls ass on this issue over the course of the campaign
1974598 not to leave town not to take their vacation or pay raise
1974599 you all are still mad about udall missing that important vote which he did or did not miss
1974600 sen obama as the leader of the democratic party should pick up the phone this morning and convince speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid that they should come here and recall the congress
1974601 should find five things they agree on energy and offer a joint bill and say lets pass it before the conventions if they walked in with five things theyd pass it before the conventions
1974602 hes now entrapped between the anti energy left led by former vice president al gore and pelosi and reid and the pro energy democrats who understand that theyre not going to survive if they are the party thats anti energy
1974603 u s offshore oil drilling is not perfectly tidy its only 99 999 percent clean indeed since 1980 as mms figures indicate 101 997 barrels spilled from among the 11 855 billion barrels of american oil extracted offshore this is a 0 001 percent pollution rate while offshore drilling is not 100 percent spotless this record should satisfy all but the terminally fastidious ironically in terms of oil contamination mother nature is 95 times dirtier than man some 620 500 barrels of oil ooze organically from north americas ocean floors each year compare this to the average 6 555 barrels that oil companies have spilled annually since 1998 according to mms
1974604 coal makes us sick oil makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining our world
1974605 predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future
1974606 hydrocarbon fuels created america gave us the technologies and living standards we enjoy today enabled us to eradicate diseases that plagued earlier generations and boosted our life expectancy from 50 in 1900 to nearly 80 today they still provide 85 of our energy and we could greatly reduce our reliance on oil imports if we would simply end the outrageous policies that keep our nations abundant energy resources locked up we have enough oil natural gas oil shale coal and uranium to provide power for centuries we have a growing consensus that we need to drill onshore and off but partisan intransigence and absurd environmental claims prevent us from utilizing them instead were offered bromides like wind
1974607 floridas economy and the quality of life of its residents are dependent on a sufficient affordable secure reliable and clean supply of energy now and in the future florida is currently facing an energy crisis
1974608 ultimately we dont know what crisis may occur in the next four years therefore youve got to have the confidence in the person and their record
1974609 hes ready to be commander in chief at a dangerous time in the world he has tremendous experience that has given him good judgment both in war and peace
1974610 you cant sweet talk them and give them a warm embrace and think theyre suddenly going to become our friends
1974611 you cant sit down with enemies without preconditions unless it benefits ourselves when we deal with enemies we have to maintain the military power to protect our security and the willingness to use it as a last resort
1974612 senator obama is almost doubly popular than senator lieberman is in the jewish community
1974613 this is so because senator obama is a staunch supporter of the state of israel he holds israels security and its military qualitative edge to be sacrosanct
1974614 well john mccain has always been influential in the senate in part because of the positions he holds i dont think influence is determined necessarily just by position hes obviously influential out of recognition of his chairmanship of the commerce committee but hes also influential because he can work with democrats on key issues whether its campaign finance reform or tobacco policy hes worked with us and that has made him i think a source of great influence in the senate
1974615 you may end up going against a senate colleague perhaps mccain perhaps frist
1974616 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
1974617 what i do know is that john mccain is a close and dear friend of mine i have enormous respect for him hes a courageous patriotic american who stands up for what he believes and im proud to call him my friend
1974618 well first of all let me say that i admire senator mccain greatly hes one of the people we modeled our campaign over because he is very direct very blunt and nobody has to guess at what hes thinking which i think is people people would like to see a lot more of that in politicians around this country
1974619 you know i love john mccain hes a great guy the fact is we do disagree on iraq but i think that on the overall fight against terrorism and that thats the number one priority theres a lot of agreement john and i have been to baghdad together twice and talked about this at length so obviously im gonna be supporting a democrat for president of the united states but i have a very high regard for john mccain and this is just an area of disagreement we agree tremendously on reform and worked together well and im proud to serve with him in the senate
1974620 since coming to washington ive believed that the right approach begins with the proposal put forward by senator lieberman and senator mccain a proposal theyve been pushing for years and i thank them again for their leadership on this issue the lieberman mccain bill establishes limits for greenhouse gas emissions well into the 21st century to remain below these limits the bill encourages the market to determine how best to reduce greenhouse gas emissions rewarding cost effective approaches using a system of tradable allowances
1974621 i think that i have a lifetime of experience that i will bring to the white house i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
1974622 i guess if you decide to keep it ill have to get a second job
1974623 the desire for a male child has always been there but god did not bless us with a male child
1974624 now we are very grateful to god who has answered our prayers
1974625 which is one of my favorite series nowadays cable series are way better than mostly anything on the usual networks
1974626 i had wished my boyfriend was there to cuddle me and tell me it was okay
1974627 a man i do not trust could not get money from me on all the bonds in christendom
1974628 but we want to elect good leaders that represent us
1974629 smith in his career has always looked for ways to make more money for those who are already powerful and wealthy
1974630 we are being driven into debt by gordon smith and our debt is owed by saudi arabia and china
1974631 i think these issues reverberate for everyone who cares about a strong america
1974632 success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best that you are capable of becoming
1974633 i am so excited about this to be honest personally i never thought of myself as sexy or hot but if thats the call that people have taken then i hope i live up to it
1974634 we had spent a few months researching on who the winner of the first ever maxim hot 100 would be since weve been market leaders and the first ones to enter the mens lifestyle scene with a presence of almost 3 years we obviously had a close connection with our readers and the industry deepika was our choice as the winner because apart from her huge fan following with the new generation of indians she also has the potential to be an international face this calls for a huge party
1974635 lg is the prime sponsor of maxim hot 100 india and we feel that the target audience for both lg scarlet and maxim hot 100 would be energetic and enthusiastic we would associate ourselves as this brings in a glamour quotient and style we do believe in constant expansion of our existing product portfolio by offering customized display solutions to our indian audience going forward aesthetics fused with stylized design and smart technology will play a major role in capturing customer loyalty and thus we will continue to launch revolutionary products like scarlet which will further complement the urbane lifestyle of its audience

1974781 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
1974782 i guess id just add that the national media coverage of the berwyn heights raid seems to be predicated on the assumption that the most troubling aspects of the raid the killing of the dogs the violent tactics the lax investigation the likely innocent victims and the police obstinacy after the fact are unusual they arent the only thing unusual about this raid is that its victim happened to be an elected politician

1974826 polylingual latin spanish french ah the eros of having ones head combed
1974827 and susan a little girle having neither man nor boy
1974828 our little girl susan is a most admirable slut and pleases us mightily doing more service than both the others and deserves wages better
1974829 and the little girl susan the best wenches to our content that we can ever expect
1974830 at which i am very well contented for then i hope we shall be settled but i must remember that never since i was housekeeper i ever lived so quietly without any noise or one angry word almost as i have done since my present mayds besse jane and susan came and were together now i have taken a boy and am taking a woman i pray god we may not be worse but i will observe it

1974836 easily enough you never actually went into hiding you just blended back into the population it was just a case of taking my time and making the right friends
1974837 you do understand that by the unfortunate virtue of having gotten this far you have significantly inconvenienced me as much as i enjoy my current occupation ill have to relocate and ask my friends to not be so trusting in the future
1974838 well it couldnt be avoided one way or the other somebody some day would get this far i think that in a way i have done you a favour you could be facing an assassins gun rather than a voice recorder
1974839 why would somebody go through the trouble of assassinating me creating a martyr in the process surely that would be counter productive i am harmless defanged leaving me alone is best for all concerned
1974840 i wouldnt say that youre defanged as you put it youve weaponised rhetoric to the point that you could be considered to be carrying weapons of mass destruction wherever you go look at the way youve incited and encouraged people to commit mass murder and genocide
1974841 i have never incited or encouraged people to kill i merely er sponsored ideas providing a symbolic reference system in which they felt comfortable and justified doing it
1974842 thats a bit blas isnt it how can you distance yourself from the fact that people under your ultimate command have maimed raped and killed thousands surely you must take responsibility for that outcome
1974843 young man you are sorely mistaken first of all would you deny that people are responsible for their actions assuming that you dont for if you do youre merely wasting my time then the people that actually committed those acts must bear ultimate responsibility i have never issued orders to indiscriminately kill anybody i have ordered people to be moved elsewhere in the country if the commanders on the field while in the process of executing those orders actually chose to allow their men to kill maim and rape then that is surely their responsibility and they should stand trial for what theyve done
1974844 how can you claim that you said it yourself you created a climate under which it was acceptable to carry your orders in the way in which they were
1974845 well the climate you speak of was created by simply reminding people of who they were where theyd come from and pointing out that where they were going was up to them i never said hate a or b i said a or b have no place living together with you because they do not share the same values this is the reason why all civilized societies incarcerate criminals or commit people with psychiatric disorders you dont want to share your life with them because they will not abide by the same rules
1974846 i thought that at this point we had come to the conclusion that individual acts were the individuals responsibility
1974847 that is why i used the word systematic this implies organization infrastructure
1974848 and youd have a point there if it werent for one item that youre carefully leaving out those abuses were perpetrated by the military which is an organization notoriously geared toward inflicting death and destruction so what did you expect history is rife with instances of abuses committed by military forces tasked with resettling civilians there will always be my lai events
1974849 but a number of those abuses were committed by non military personnel
1974850 yet again you have defeated your own argument how can i be responsible for what is done by members of an organization that has a chain of command i am not a part of this discussion is futile as you can see i am not easily moved by the moral responsibility argument i firmly believe in personal responsibility and ultimately thats the crux of the matter all the cases of savagery that you can bring to the table were committed by individuals i was not one of those individuals ergo i am not culpable
1974851 would you then deny that those events are logical and necessary consequences of the vision that you put before your people
1974852 no not at all i wrote about that even and i clearly outlined the necessary outcome

1975078 given the fundamentalist self sacrificial mindset of the mullahs who run iran israel knows that deterrence may not work as well as it did with the comparatively rational men who ran the kremlin and white house during the cold war they are likely to use any bomb they build thus an israeli nuclear strike to prevent the iranians from taking the final steps toward getting the bomb is probable the alternative is letting tehran have its bomb in either case a middle eastern nuclear holocaust would be in the cards
1975079 it is in the interest of neither iran nor the united states that iran be savaged by a nuclear strike or that both israel and iran suffer such a fate we know what would ensue a traumatic destabilization of the middle east with resounding political and military consequences around the globe serious injury to the wests oil supply and radioactive pollution of the earths atmosphere and water

1975230 folks cyndi lauper is dancing with young isaac newton chalmers had long hair and a similar face
1975231 the episode that became the jumping off point for this book was the scandal over the leaking of classified national security information
1975232 it originated in a controversy over the intelligence the bush administration used to make the case that saddam hussein s iraq represented a grave and gathering danger that needed to be eliminated when a covert cia officers identity was disclosed during the ensuing partisan warfare turning the controversy into the latest washington scandal i was caught up in the deception that followed it was the defining moment in my time working for the president and one of the most painful experiences of my life
1975233 when words i uttered believing them to be true were exposed as false i was constrained by my duties and loyalty to the president and unable to comment but i promised reporters and the public that i would someday tell the whole story of what i knew
1975234 a trusted correspondent who has dealt with him suggests that giraldi be taken with a big grain of salt

1975248 the internet doesnt make us more creative i dont think but it does enable what we create to be seen heard and used it enables every creator to find a public the public he or she merits and that takes creation out of the proprietary hands of the supposed creative class
1975249 the curmudgeons also argue that this level playing field is flooded with crap a loss of taste and discrimination ill argue just the opposite only the playing field is flat and to stand out one must now do so on merit as defined by the public rather than the priests which will be rewarded with links and attention this is our link economy our culture of links it is a meritocracy only now there are many definitions of merit and each must be earned
1975250 when direct connections can be made isnt advertising a middleman and the internet abhors middlemen with every direct connection to the information we want about a product or a customer who tells us what we need to know doesnt that eliminate another dollar of advertising

1975272 mariya from boise wrote plainly the government is stifling the nations economy
1975273 well robert and jodi and mariya and all the others who have been writing my office asking congress to do something are right
1975274 maybe if speaker pelosi hears directly from idahoans and sees just how much it is costing the families and businesses of our state shell be more inclined to act so im asking idahoans today to engage on this issue in a way they never have save those gas receipts send them to my office and ill make sure speaker pelosi gets them

1975309 under obamas tax proposals tax filers in the middle quintile those earning between 37 595 66 354 annually would receive an average tax cut of 1 042 in 2009 and an average tax cut of 2 136 in 2012
1975310 senator mccains tax cuts would primarily benefit those with very high incomes
1975311 senator obama offers much larger tax breaks to low and middle income taxpayers and would increase taxes on high income taxpayers
1975312 under obamas tax proposals tax filers in the middle quintile those earning between 37 595 66 354 annually would receive an average tax cut of 1 042 in 2009 and an average tax cut of 2 136 in 2012
1975313 senator mccains tax cuts would primarily benefit those with very high incomes
1975314 senator obama offers much larger tax breaks to low and middle income taxpayers and would increase taxes on high income taxpayers
1975315 obama wants to raise taxes on people making as little as 42 000 a year if he got his way then taxes on that group would return to where they were before the tax cuts of 2001 and 2005 took effect which mccain voted against
1975316 obama the celebrity isnt ready to lead according to the mccain camp who demanded that everyone on his side forget his voting against the tax cuts and his class warfare statements

1975326 this is a breakthrough in terms of our understanding of materials and thats important because in order to understand the long term evolution of planets we need to know more about their properties deep down the finding is also interesting from the point of view of understanding why materials are the way they are and what determines their stability and their physical and chemical properties

1975335 whether you think that you can or that you cant you are usually right
1975336 damn this is hard for me i wonder if i am stupid
1975337 actually my degree in astrophysics has proved to be very valuable
1975338 some things in this world are just hard when i am struggling with something i sometimes think damn this is hard for me i wonder if i am stupid and then i remember that i have a degree in astrophysics from cal tech i must not be stupid
1975339 just because you don t know how to program or design or lead or do anything doesn t make you a dummy or an idiot
1975340 no surely we have enough already please dont encourage them to reproduce
1975341 frankly there was a lot of dispute at the time it was granted to them
1975342 circumstances have changed with oil at these levels we dont think that manufacturers credit is necessary to encourage them to explore and produce oil and gas
1975343 because apple has no intentions of supporting iphone use in the enterprise
1975344 the iphone would need to support wireless e mail and pim for at least one popular enterprise e mail system and include a minimum of two security policies the ability to wipe the device of all data if lost or stolen and a complex user password consisting of a coalpha numeric and special characters in a pattern that cannot be easily guessed
1975345 as for setting these parameters microsoft uses a confusing approach assuming that the end device will decide on what type of password will be enforced when the policy is received by the device there is no feedback to the console that the policy has been enforced windows mobile interprets the alphanumeric parameter as an instruction to force the user to employ a complex password the iphone replicates this function in the same manner despite microsofts awkward implementation
1975346 improve the overall deployment scheme for itunes to make it more amenable to enterprise needs such as making the options to turn off certain features an installation option versus requiring direct registry changes
1975347 that apple enhance this area long term to optionally eliminate itunes that is as a desktop application as a necessary component to access business applications and manage the device as microsoft and research in motion rim have done
1975348 in tests conducted by gartner contacts we have discovered that the product works via an unencrypted distributed xml file which could be changed by the end user
1975349 apple indicates that the profiles can be signed warning the user of their legitimacy but the most trusted management tools dont empower the user to make these types of security decisions
1975350 firewalling data leak prevention and other desirable functions that need multiprocessing open application programming interfaces apis or operating system os shims to work
1975351 a closed environment where apple guarantees all software that gets on the iphone is safe that is in lockdown might work conceptually but in the past enterprise attempts to work in this manner have encountered problems
1975352 apple has indicated that there is an encryption api in the firmware but we have not yet seen this feature exposed in an application to assess its viability or effect on the iphone processor and by inference battery life
1975353 the iphone could lower the overall security footprint one way to mitigate concerns would be to limit functionality to browser access
1975354 protocols such as ssl versus the more optimized udp were in use and the signaling methods were inefficient
1975355 this is a problem with exchange activesync and apple must await improvements from microsoft to correct this feature blackberry which uses an alternative method to access exchange can support these options
1975356 the iphone does permit emergency calls when the password screen is displayed but there is no access to the contact manager or other advanced telephony features
1975357 rim and microsoft manufacturers provided similar limited telephony operation prior to password entry but have been forced to greatly expand the telephony functions that do not require password input we believe apple must follow a similar path
1975358 apple has delivered an iphone that is acceptable for business use at the appliance level most prospective iphone users will judge the device based on consumer appeal the appstore applications and the iphones excellent browser are supplemented with an e mail client which provides acceptable business capability with excellence in some areas
1975359 free is only good if someone else is paying for it
1975360 years ago i was asked by a non gaming friend to explain the attraction of gaming specifically playing mmos it just makes no sense she said to me why do you want to pretend to be someone else in a made up place with a bunch of other people who are pretending to be someone else i remember shrugging and saying i dont know exactly you read novels right she did and nodded well i asked whats the attraction of reading something that came from someone elses imagination that is explicitly untrue and that only ends up existing in your head she smiled and said you got me im not saying playing games is the same as reading and im not saying that doing one in any way replaces doing the other but there are stories in games and there is imagination strategy thinking creativity fun friendship and community those are all things i hope my son can find at every library he encounters
1975361 oils filling john mccains campaign with two million dollars in contributions
1975362 the oil industry was so generous with its campaign largesse
1975363 john mccain has not only put exxon on the ticket but he has graciously stepped aside and is allowing exxon to run at the top of the ticket
1975364 i guess he can re run that silly ad that brags that he takes no money from oil companies just like every other candidate for federal office
1975365 jeff dobbs says he doesnt have time to create the whole site but hes offered up a logo

1975370 as i have pointed out to you many times our company has very lttle to gain in a monetary sense from the syndication of this material

1975372 when we speak of difference we are therefore speaking of resistance difference cannot be recognized within the homologation sic this is not a careful translation that biopower imposes on society
1975373 i was walking in the neighbourhood and i came to an intersection i walked to the edge of the sidewalk and stopped to wait for the traffic to clear but suddenly there was no traffic then i noticed that the cars travelling in both directions had stopped for me not only that the drivers were politely waving for me to walk across i mean this is weird
1975374 special canada day report how canada stole the american dream
1975375 heres a pile of money please pass this law which i wrote which will fuck over my competition

1975377 so i went into this bar in dc just said hi im canadian and stood there in amazement while this brawl over health care broke out all around me
1975378 canada is a country which works in practice but not in theory
1975379 i would say that ideally a sheriff should be an elected never appointed official whose authority is limited to summoning the posse which would be made up of the citizens who live in his jurisdiction

1975385 im a gay man i live in new york im not an innocent bystander any more
1975386 his death was supremely unemotional you got god shaking in rage there is no emotional component he was a rebel against god he was taught to be a rebel by his parents he came from a rebel country they brought this wrath upon his head and it sucks to be him and it sucks to be them
1975387 you gotta connect the dots people from your idols to your filthy way of life
1975388 heres what i know he is dead and god does not do that to people that serve in his truth
1975389 i havent met him personally but he has nothing going on
1975390 his life was all about him blah blah blah he was a rebel i dont need to know anything else i dont need to know the minutia everything you need to know is right there
1975391 i say cha ching that goes in our bank god gives us tokens of his love
1975392 manitoba an innocent young victims throat is cut his struggles and cries are ignored the man with the knife shows no emotion the victim is slaughtered and his head cut of his flesh is eaten it still goes on
1975393 like human victims animals in slaughterhouses experience terror when they are attacked by a knife wielding assailant
1975394 we are challenging everyone who is rightly horrified by this crime to look into their hearts and consider leaving violence off their dinner plates
1975395 while it isnt every day that a human is violently attacked and eaten by another human its worth noting that it is the norm for many people not to give any thought to the fact that restaurants are serving flesh that comes from innocents who were minding their own business before someone came after them with a knife how amazingly and conveniently compartmentalized the human mind is
1975396 why are you violating all these safety precautions and regulations are you an idiot or what lets get the plant shut down then well hold a critique on your numerous errors
1975397 if god exists he thinks fred phelps is a douche

1975495 most mainstream media outlets have blacked out news of impeachment
1975496 he never would have gotten away with it had it not been for the craven cowards and feckless enablers of the us congress and senate whom at every turn abdicated their responsibility to the constitution and the american people the resulting damage to our political process festered for decades and was subsequently abused by several more presidents
1975497 political fallout public disenchantment the well connected well financed right wing slime machine of professional liars using the control they have over the message to portray the democrats as petty and vengeful im not saying tossing impeachment aside is right or just im saying it is very costly politically

1975500 one that was really spectacular just recently is the observation of divergence of species of lizards in the mediterranean there were a set of islands there that were kind of abandoned by a war on the slavics on the balkan peninsula what happened was that while they were abandoned there were these introduced species of lizards that were rapidly evolving to take advantage of new situations so they were switching from a mostly insect lifestyle where they were eating lots of insects to one where they were also taking advantage of plant material not only have they observed changes they can document them they can see the species shift but they have also discovered that these lizards have evolved a new structure a new little enfolding of the gut to allow them to digest more food plant material in particular so you know its a combination of things its actually observing a change in populations and its the observing the appearance of novel structures in the gut

1975523 does he like getting wide eyed looks from every hotel clerk and ticket agent he comes across
1975524 if thats the case though i think the better way to turn the tables on conservative propaganda is to retell speers story and to point out how little choice an artist craftsman like speer had even if he had wanted to differ from hitler the regime

1975531 i dunno i saw radiohead at hammerstein in 97 and radio city in 98 im a bit done with them

1975539 shows a group of arab oil barons enraged at the sight of a nissan car
1975540 then the mbc news presenter a young woman with dyed blond hair a fetching low top and white trouser suit interviews a real saudi representative who declares that nissan must be punished and boycotted and demands an apology
1975541 saudi representative who declares that nisson must be punished and boycotted and demands an apology
1975542 and so will all other ads that are based on an intelligent recognition that the the saudis and other rich arabs of the gulf who are raking in their ill gotten trillions have become the object of growing fury all over the westen world
1975543 its my opinion that nissan made a huge error by igniting these racist instincts
1975544 we need to apply punishments against these things in order for nissan to keep its interests in the region it must apologize
1975545 were so sorry oil sheikhs were offended by an advertisement that wasnt shown in their countries

1975552 one thing that hasnt received much attention in conservative and republicans circles is the ongoing conversation on the left about the possibility of nuremberg style war crimes trials for members of the bush administration should a democratic president take office
1975553 in reading this book and these charges that have laid out here and because of my background covering like city stuff and everything for years i cant help but come to the conclusion at the end of this book this book is basically charging the president of the united states or the vice president of the united states with being an accessory before the fact to 4000 murders and more in iraq they lied us into war according to this book
1975554 after a lecture to the marine memorial association last week a reporter thrust a mike toward me and asked if i thought i should be tried for war crimes for my columns in the post supporting our military w hat fascinated me about the silly encounter was how unintentionally revealing it was about the shameless hypocrisy of the left think about it for expressing my views to readers like you on these pages hardcore leftists believe i should be put on trial as a war criminal
1975555 my concern is not that our freedoms will be taken away but rather gladly surrendered in the name of the common good
1975556 who pays the bills here youll get the president we want you to get or you wont get any president at all
1975557 the story sources well and has real heft but the mainstream media wont touch it it doesnt fit the john mccain story arc
1975558 it doesnt help the corporate owned medias propaganda campaign to put their man mccain in the white house to continue the cheneybush policies of huge tax cuts for the ultra rich and deregulation of media ownership
1975559 mccain snuggling up to the bushjerks who smeared him last time he ran

1975568 now do you have any observed examples of evolution i would like to get some actual science that would explain this something we could sink our teeth into the common man
1975569 one that was really spectacular just recently is the observation of divergence of species of lizards in the mediterranean there were a set of islands there that were kind of abandoned by a war on the slavics on the balkan peninsula what happened was that while they were abandoned there were these introduced species of lizards that were rapidly evolving to take advantage of new situations so they were switching from a mostly insect lifestyle where they were eating lots of insects to one where they were also taking advantage of plant material not only have they observed changes they can document them they can see the species shift but they have also discovered that these lizards have evolved a new structure a new little enfolding of the gut to allow them to digest more food plant material in particular so you know its a combination of things its actually observing a change in populations and its the observing the appearance of novel structures in the gut

1975586 not to target the government even if it was an unjust one for there is not any religious permission to do so

1975679 what did we do to make them so mad at us

1975696 few people would consider afghanistan where last year an average of 550 people were killed per month a safe place
1975697 that is about the rate recently in iraq according to official statistics
1975698 the unites states has received reports that its combat casualties in iraq dropped to their lowest level in july with glee lowest ever u s casualties may speak volumes for the u s but it has little meaning for iraqis the drastic drop in u s casualties coincides with a drastic surge in iraqi casualties joint u s and iraqi military operations are proceeding in several provinces leaving behind a trail of destruction and many casualties the u s keeps no tally of the iraqis it kills neither does the iraqi government the military tactics pursued by the u s in the past five years have illustrated that military campaigns in which heavy weapons like warplanes artillery and armor are deployed have become the means to solve problems though experience has shown that they have drastically failed to do so

1975710 i think we could have avoided at least some of this if we had agreed to do the town hall meetings
1975711 in the gamma quadrant maybe so but back here at home id take a guess that mccains hiring of steve schmidt had a wee bit more to do with it
1975712 you can believe that if you want just like you can believe the blame for the negative tone of the campaign is shared equally by obama and mccain as broder certainly does but then of course you would probably have to be as foolish as broder
1975713 the only thing david broder accomplishes with his column today is to reveal his bias toward mccain
1975714 even though mccain reacted negatively to obamas counteroffer of two town hall debates and decided there would be none it is solely obamas fault because he did not accept all five and as a result of there being no town hall debates the candidates couldnt stand on the same stage and become fine friends
1975715 its a classic non sequitur whether mccain runs a relentlessly negative substance free campaign has nothing to do with his proposal for extra debates
1975716 ma ma wheres my pa gone to the white house ha ha ha
1975717 obama mccain fall matchup will be relatively issue oriented compared to recent contests

1975720 the only prospect for us energy independence is cheap and effective power generation from wind and solar energy which needs new cheaper and better methods of battery or other storage to be practical
1975721 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
1975722 mr mccain offers little biography while mr obama is nothing but
1975723 the presumptive democratic presidential nominee resembles none of these past presidents as much as he does the one man who stands between him and the presidency john mccain
1975724 no thanks wed rather not and were going to keep the rest of the party from doing anything either
1975725 it seems to me that obama is executing a long term strategy for getting elected and that if he goes negative against mccain it wont be until the timing is better i e the closing weeks of the contest when the remaining undecideds make up their minds
1975726 we cant attack now people already have set opinions of him so we cant change their minds
1975727 i would like to apologize one more time to all the members and i would like to thank you for what you have done for me

1976025 all the things i could do if i had a little money
1976026 but we now know that these other planetary systems dont look like the solar system at all
1976027 the shapes of the exoplanets orbits are elongated not nice and circular planets are not where we expect them to be many giant planets similar to jupiter known as hot jupiters are so close to the star they have orbits of mere days clearly we needed to start fresh in explaining planetary formation and this greater variety of planets we now see
1976028 such a turbulent history would seem to leave little room for the sedate solar system and our simulations show exactly that
1976029 conditions must be just right for the solar system to emerge
1976030 we now better understand the process of planet formation and can explain the properties of the strange exoplanets weve observed
1976031 we also know that the solar system is special and understand at some level what makes it special
1976032 the solar system had to be born under just the right conditions to become this quiet place we see the vast majority of other planetary systems didnt have these special properties at birth and became something very different
1976033 our solar system an island of calm in a violent universe and its special too
1976034 but we now know that these other planetary systems dont look like the solar system at all
1976035 the shapes of the exoplanets orbits are elongated not nice and circular planets are not where we expect them to be many giant planets similar to jupiter known as hot jupiters are so close to the star they have orbits of mere days clearly we needed to start fresh in explaining planetary formation and this greater variety of planets we now see
1976036 yes this a classic case of limited conclusions born from limited data
1976037 well youve dealt with this for ten years cant you just work through this
1976038 youve worked through this before so i know you can do it
1976039 why dont you just drop it all and try fish oil
1976040 why dont you resolve this by doing a task that for me is basically a minor inconvenience but for you is going to wreck the entire flow of your day and essentially be more of a hassle than anything else
1976041 youre not happy well sit at my table below the salt ill allow you into my world and give you orders what you dont want to why not you need it what else do you have to redeem your existence its not as if youre happy
1976042 its the frame of mind that says youre normal the frame of mind that says nothing is wrong with you the frame of mind that says push forward the frame of mind that says youre imagining things the frame of mind that says you cant trust your own perception

1976046 shut up you dont have anything at all you dont have anything bad
1976047 well you look fine to me just dont use it as an excuse to slack off
1976048 the thing is though as any survivor will tell you that wall is not impenetrable in fact every little assault chips away at it slowly but surely and sometimes i have enough of a buffer built that that one casual comment wont faze me all told but sometimes the world has not been so kind and my defenses are significantly worn down and all it takes is that one stray comment
1976049 oh you poor thing how amazing for you to make it this far

1976066 i want to get the question out not the answer but the question out
1976067 the question is the story of the rock and the clock if you find a rock in a field no big deal if you find a clock in a field you look around for who created it
1976068 did we just appear like the rock or did it take intelligent design to make us
1976069 if you dont want to get treated different then dont ask to get treated special
1976070 america is not better than everybody else america is everybody else
1976071 why dont you pull that thing down and put up a statue of reagan after all hes the reason you have a future now

1976073 of course i dont hate fill in ethnicity here i am fill in ethnicity here
1976074 america is not better than everybody else america is everybody else
1976075 and dont forget that schaumburg wants the blue line extended all the way out there thus cutting out money for transit in the city
1976076 im a little confused as to why you think people living along the first three routes should make do with existing bus service but you want the blue line extension even tho bus service exists there as well
1976077 during rush hour it pace bus only runs every fifteen minutes something most cta commuters would be shocked by

1976080 our sources were current and former government scientists who were all involved in analyzing the substance in the letter
1976081 no he was not if it was ivins i would report that in a second
1976082 some guys looked at it under a microscope and saw something they couldnt identify which theyd never seen before and someone called it bentonite
1976083 because iraqs was the only anthrax program known to use bentonite in its formulation
1976084 oh yeah well our anthrax program uses bentonite yeah thats the ticket
1976085 something they had never seen before but had a brownish color
1976086 our sources were government scientists who were all involved in analyzing the substance in the letter
1976087 it is also suspected that bentonite is linked to the kitty litter industrial complex
1976088 there could be strategic political value in getting some of these cases going before the november 2006 editorial comment original elections we need to think about who could be tried
1976089 ill repeat what i said i truly am not that concerned about him
1976090 the scientific community is really going to run with this
1976091 oh well the ogallala is going to be pumped dry anyway so we might as well let this billionaire make more billions by pumping it dry quicker
1976092 talk about totally stupid building roads for wind power is one time deal and nuclear fussion materials cannot be disposed of so i take wind any day of the week
1976093 there is a counterargument that wind power is damaging to the environment in a way that a single nuclear plant would never be
1976094 have you seen the size of the area the chernobyl rendered uninhabitable it aint small enough to be considered local to anyone except a nation state
1976095 the race against global warming is so desperate that we probably need new nukes
1976096 i see that the anti nuclear mantra is unchanged after three decades or so
1976097 see i dont hate whitey the crackah children love me
1976098 hey people dont think michelle is lovable enough get some video of her with little kids then america will love her
1976099 i wasnt proud of my country when i was in second grade children
1976100 aww isnt that cute a 7 year old who doesnt know sh t about anything
1976101 my team fell behind twice but showed great determination against a swedish side in good shape its not easy playing against such well organised opposition

1976103 i felt the pressure but i am an experienced player and i tried to place the ball the goal was the result of the whole teams work
1976104 we deserved to go through because we were the more positive team
1976105 hes not just a leader here in detroit and in michigan but also in cell block d
1976106 this thing may not have been elegantly planned but thats the beauty of it this is sort a work in progress
1976107 the underlying trend for jobs has got recession written all over it

1976109 the impact of the stimulus has put our problems off for tomorrow
1976110 mr scaife could you explain why you give so much money to the new right

1976112 if israel must exist it at least should be jewish
1976113 lives are still ruled by the fear of a mountain god
1976114 the centers mission is to advance religious freedom and pluralism tolerance social justice and civil liberties in israel the center fights for the rights of the disenfranchised and to create a diverse society in which all individuals and groups will be able to express their uniqueness
1976115 its really these people who carry this baseless hatred within their hearts hatred of women homosexuals and anyone else who doesnt wear the same kind of black hat that they do simply on the basis of their perversion of jewish law and jewish values and morals
1976116 this is anti semitism pure and simple except this time the anti semites are ourselves
1976117 no every single time i hear a religious person in the west scream bias it tends to revolve around either their privilege being checked or someone challenging their attempts to restrict the liberty of others
1976118 big 3 are aware that we operate in a matrix that gives us privilege not afforded to others that same awareness of that inequity is for many what drives us to work for progressive causes
1976119 its really these people who carry this baseless hatred within their hearts hatred of women homosexuals and anyone else who doesnt wear the same kind of black hat that they do simply on the basis of their perversion of jewish law and jewish values and morals
1976120 this is anti semitism pure and simple except this time the anti semites are ourselves
1976121 what would a libertarian do differently to prevent and or deal with this type of situation
1976122 the child will be disabled for the rest of her life
1976123 oh my god thats horrible but if i report it and it turns out im wrong ill have people all over me what if its some wierd offshoot of bhudism or something crap id get sued for trying to infringe on their rights

1976126 the police are the public and that the public are the police the police being only members of the public who are paid to give full time attention to duties which are incumbent on every citizen in the interests of community welfare and existence
1976127 the problem with libertarianism from my anarcho capitalist point of view is where to draw the line on government intervention
1976128 the sex pistols had two land rovers to ferry them around the site but johnny seemed to prefer our car
1976129 so he made us take all our equipment out so he could travel 40 metres in it

1976139 dohertys got trapped in a publicity campaign that has run out of order
1976140 another fool who is given a golden opportunity to do something wonderful in his life and hed rather be selfish and cowardly drugs are the modus operandi of the coward
1976141 pete is a fine lad that needs to sort himself out this is mister rotten telling you i waltz on stage sober because no drug in the world is as good as being absolutely 100 percent honest with your audience nothing compares to that emotion people like him and amy winehouse are getting it wrong as usual
1976142 hes staying true to the same attitude that made him famous
1976143 really was punk about being an attention starved prima donna shit i must have looked like such an idiot in high school
1976144 ok hes got a good point on that last one but what is that in his hand in the top picture
1976145 this is mister rotten telling you i waltz on stage sober
1976146 autokratz as we have taken your auto you are now just kratz
1976147 he went a little overboard w duffy but if she really did run up to him and hug him from behind without even having met him in the past shes a tool
1976148 passenger travel by rail is slow and inefficient i am just not seeing the benefits except for those who have a jones for mass transit
1976149 if you take sexual advantage of her youre going to burn in a very special level of hell
1976150 hey we have an army of slayers and la is taken over by demons
1976151 hey im human now and havent thought about contacting buffy
1976152 it is absurd to think the admin would do that
1976153 19 will willow tara fans ever get to see joss vision of tara coming back through a wish by buffy if even in an alternate timeline its just a scene a lot of us wanted to see go down because it just sounded like perfection i do not think youll see anything like it in season eight sorry
1976154 were going to do story x with returning favorite character y
1976155 well if you think about it change starts with c and that rhymes with t and that spells trouble here in the good ole usa
1976156 as you may know not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
1976157 we want to stop the swift boating before it gets off the ground
1976158 is candidatesixpacks new attack ad working well talk to experts from boths sides after the break
1976159 this idea sounds even more sloppily thought out than his last venture which of course went belly up for lack of financial support
1976160 but if it gives anyone pause they are always welcome to give to freedoms watch all of our donors are entitled to complete anonymity by law
1976161 the way to fight sb attacks is to instantly state in clear and forceful way that it is a lie it is a lie today yesterday and tomorrow go on the tv and when a pundit of newscaster says what about this you say it is a lie and further the person propounding on it is propounding on a lie lie lie
1976162 yes we hear you bloggers we will engage in investigative reporting we will investigate these left wing groups that are using bully tactics and intimidation to curtail donations to the opposition
1976163 right now the democratic party needs as many folks like me in their wing as possible i am not a democrat because i am some sort of crazy liberal who believes in all sorts of left wing causes
1976164 maximizing profits by getting all the contracts and not leaving hope for the competitors
1976165 they tortured me you can tell because i gained 15 pounds clearly this type of mistreatment is a war crime by the evil bushitler
1976166 i was only his driver a lowly position of no consequence
1976167 hey lets run down there and fuck one of them cows

1976175 ive probably know who tom waits is longer than you
1976176 the bouquet never made it to lil kim the party was packed the flowers were cumbersome and at some point rivera and a friend handed them to a barback for safekeeping
1976177 i argued but they wouldnt listen i tried to call rivera but her cell was off
1976178 used a pipe to bash her in the back of the head before jamming her lifeless body into a rooftop electrical room
1976179 mourns the death of ms rivera she knew nothing of this incident until she heard media reports
1976180 another strong example of the serious ramifications that can come from letting impressionable teens play violent video games like this one
1976181 if you look at the whole population youth violent crime has gone down dramatically since the 1990s while playing computer games has gone up exponentially
1976182 it may be that a kid attracted to criminal behavior is also attracted to violent games
1976183 you cant make the simple statement that if you expose a kid to violent games then hell become violent
1976184 damnu mccoont youll never win against that god of a man barack obama

1976188 if a couple buckets of chicken are going to help to get a conviction then get some biscuits to go with it
1976189 i am not saying everyone has to be christian this is not a homogenous nation
1976190 what you have to be is someone who believes in a judeo christian ethic in other words in knowing theres a right and wrong
1976191 not all lifestyles are equal not all religions are equal
1976192 was i saying all people are not equal heavens no we were all created equal
1976193 not all lifestyles are equal not all religions are equal
1976194 was i saying all people are not equal heavens no we were all created equal
1976195 teachers cant mark answers wrong because it may offend a religion
1976196 because she has to have an absolutist rational for parochial fundagelical american bigotry
1976197 the foundation of morality should not be made dependent on myth nor tied to any authority lest doubt about the myth or about the legitimacy of the authority imperil the foundation of sound judgment and action
1976198 i am not saying everyone has to be christian this is not a homogenous nation
1976199 what you have to be is someone who believes in a judeo christian ethic in other words in knowing theres a right and wrong
1976200 ok heres a somewhat ot question ive been meaning to ask for a while now what is the difference between a deist and a theist
1976201 all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others
1976202 but its also possible were incorrectly anthropomorphizing some other emotion or instinct fear at having upset a superior manipulation via empathy for purposes of survival etc
1976203 what you have to be is someone who believes in a judeo christian ethic in other words in knowing theres a right and wrong
1976204 kern who is running for a third term walked to the lectern on crutches and said shes dealing with bulging disks and an irritated sciatic nerve
1976205 what a condescending patronising silly fucking witch its funny how her words simultaneously eliminate her from getting votes because 1 what she says is indefensible and 2 shows she is quite quite stupid
1976206 i have read the book of revelation and yes i believe the world is going to end by an act of god i hope but every day i think time is running out
1976207 picking on christians these days is like shooting fish in a barrel with a sniper rifle
1976208 to the extent that it is christian it is fairly fucking reprehensible
1976209 joel osteens wife is something that starts with a c and i not talking christian
1976210 picking on christians these days is like shooting fish in a barrel with a sniper rifle
1976211 to the extent that it is christian it is fairly fucking reprehensible
1976212 to be sure theres a lot of anti christian sentiment but most of it is reaction to religious bigotry
1976213 but its also possible were incorrectly anthropomorphizing some other emotion or instinct fear at having upset a superior manipulation via empathy for purposes of survival etc
1976214 alpha feed me alpha love me alpha not drive me out of pack
1976215 another chunk of it is in reaction to actual opinions spouted by actual christians it is not bigotry to mock someone if they say something or believe something i think is illogical or poorly thought out that is precisely the gift of free speech
1976216 ah jp you think mocking intolerance well i didnt need further proof that you were an idiot but thanks anyway
1976217 obtuse or narrow minded intolerance especially of other races or religions bigot n
1976218 you affected her faith you evil faith affecter you kill the faith affecter
1976219 a woman displays blatant bigotry and uses her religion to justify this bigotry how is it bigotry on our part to mock both her bigotry and her religious excuses for her homophobia
1976220 i would have thought motley crue was too intellectual for you will miracles never cease next thing you know youll be outsmarting senator mccain on youtube well after you clean the crayon off of your moms monitor and go down to the basement to practice your alphabet
1976221 if your point is that we shouldnt criticize stupid or harmful or factually incorrect beliefs and or statements then it doesnt but if that is your point then we have nothing to say to each other and im quite happy to be your definition of a bigot
1976222 it is not bigotry to mock someone if they say something or believe something i think is illogical or poorly thought out
1976223 i am not saying everyone has to be christian this is not a homogenous nation
1976224 what you have to be is someone who believes in a judeo christian ethic in other words in knowing theres a right and wrong
1976225 i think at the minute villa are a notch above boro and theres a great opportunity for me to play european football as well
1976226 the dismissal of a coach is a common event nowadays
1976227 last season we finished fifth and that was the best result in saturns history we could have achieved more with this team in the future but they did not give me opportunity to do that
1976228 stuart shepard made the prayer request in his latest internet video for the evangelical christian group 33
1976229 then would a light and intermittent mist be gods way of saying
1976230 if you pray for rain long enough it eventually does fall if you pray for floodwaters to abate they eventually do the same happens in the absence of prayers
1976231 so what if it didnt rain haha you didnt think i was
1976232 personally i think a plague of red hot chilli flavour extra sticky flesh eating gummi bears would convince me nothing less
1976233 sure its boyish humor perhaps to wish for something like that but at the same time its something people feel very strongly about theyre concerned about where he would take the nation
1976234 the republicans are having their convention in my town this year
1976235 so if it doesnt rain during the speech then god must approve of obama thats how it works right
1976236 sure its boyish humor perhaps to wish for something like that
1976237 okay you can call on me but only if its really important dont bug me unless you really have to because i swear if you bother me for no reason i am sending you to hell
1976238 sure its boyish humor perhaps to wish for something like that but at the same time its something people feel very strongly about theyre concerned about where he would take the nation
1976239 when i was a kid i used to pray every night for a new bicycle then i realized that the lord in his wisdom doesnt work that way so i just stole one and asked him to forgive me
1976240 america is uh is no longer uh what it could be what it once was and i say to myself i dont want that future for my children
1976241 america is not what it once was after democrats took over congress
1976242 universal healthcare by the government is not a good idea we have two examples of the government taking over healthcare 1 is medicaid and the otehr is the veterans system and neither is working well
1976243 culture we dont need no damn culture all i need is some weed
1976244 name one rapper that makes it look better easier than this guy
1976245 sorry chuck d is light years better than jay z or anyone else you can think of
1976246 in the forthcoming championship the teams that are always present in u21 tournaments will be there again the difference this time around is that it will be organised by uefa
1976247 it wont be an easy tournament any team can give you a surprise if you have an off day and nowadays thats certainly more true than before as futsal has levelled out a lot thanks to the work done by uefa in any given game anything can happen italy will be one of our big rivals but we played marvellously well in the qualification group
1976248 take his tripod around back and throw it at him
1976249 after asking a tv photographer to leave his home several times tennessee congressman steve cohen shoved him out the front door during a news conference wednesday
1976250 richard dawkins has once again proved himself the radio talk show host of science
1976251 man the earth is like so complicated n stuff god did it
1976252 dawkins for such an enthusiastic darwinist seems to have no faith at all in social darwinism
1976253 does anyone what museum dawkins is walking around in during the opening minutes
1976254 all the geologists with whom this book is concerned were convinced that geohistory had been played out on a timescale of humanly inconceivable magnitude though they had as yet no means to put reliable figures on it the many who were also religious believers saw no conflict between their geology and their understanding of the creation stories in genesis they had long since learned that it was a religious mistake to treat biblical texts as if they were scientific sources because an inappropriate literalism deflected attention away from religious meaning it is true that some of these geologists particularly in england had to confront vocal critics the self styled scriptural writers who relentlessly pursued a literalist line of maters of geology and genesis
1976255 aha so you dont even claim evolution is a fact
1976256 does anyone what museum dawkins is walking around in during the opening minutes
1976257 what darwin achieved was nothing less than a complete explanation of the complexity and diversity of all life
1976258 how any school could knowingly allow priests to have unfettered access to young minds is beyond me
1976259 the girl said she still believes what the bible tells her yet we know truthfully she has no idea what all is in her churchs version of the bible thats whats so sad blind submission to powerful authority
1976260 in this series i want to persuade you that evolution offers a far richer and more spectacular view of life than any religious story its one reason why i dont believe in god
1976261 here he began to wonder why god would have created distinctive kinds of tortoise finch or iguana on more or less identical small islands
1976262 this pattern of relationships became even more intriguing when darwin encountered fossils
1976263 the fossils closely resembled in every other detail the skeletons of modern sloths living nearby
1976264 darwin was one of the first scientists to correctly identify them as long dead species of animals
1976265 the reason about the stupid thing is when someone posts a comment on here and people dont agree they call them stupid this place is very hostile to new ideas it seems
1976266 it is a fact that evolution takes place in much the same way that it is a fact that there is gravity the economy and weather we have theories about how all of those work in fact our theories about evolution are more well supported than our theories about the others these theories are modified as more data are collected but the modification of theories does not undermine the fact of the phenomenon or process
1976267 i can see how you can walk across the room or maybe the town but there is no way anyone could walk all the way to china even if they had years in which to do it
1976268 evolution is the only explanation for the existence of life on this planet
1976269 in science there is only physics all the rest is stamp collecting
1976270 lets take a bunch of 15 16 year olds and show them the evidence for evolution
1976271 lets put the real world in the do not look at box
1976272 lets take a bunch of 15 16 year olds and show them the evidence for evolution
1976273 why do you believe something for which there is no evidence
1976274 do you just believe the first thing you are taught and disregard anything that contradicts that
1976275 that is to say whats the longest continuous set of rings we have that has a hard death date
1976276 why do you believe something for which there is no evidence
1976277 do you just believe the first thing you are taught and disregard anything that contradicts that
1976278 bragging rights for the oldest living thing on earth may go to a creosote bush found in 1980 in the desert outside palm springs its believed to be 11 700 years old
1976279 the total amount suffering in the natural world is beyond all decent human contemplation during the minute it takes me to say these words thousands of animals are running for their lives whimpering with fear feeling teeth sinking to their throats thousands are dying from starvation or decease or feeling a parasite rasping away from within there is no central authority no safety net for most animals reality of life is struggling suffering and death
1976280 thank you but i have to admit that this and other honest statements of atheism were thrust upon me against my will especially right at the beginning of episode 1 not by the director or the television company but by the lawyer that sounds weird it isnt strictly a legal worry but a worry about satisfying ofcom the regulatory body that controls british television i dont fully understand it but i think it has something to do with the need to respect creationists the lawyer thought that ofcom would have preferred me to present both sides because i obviously wasnt going to do that he thought the next best thing was to be completely up front and announce in advance that the reason i took the line i did was that i was an atheist of course i dont like the sound of that at all id prefer to say im an evolutionist because the evidence is so convincing it is as though the lawyer has been infected by the all opinions are equally valid viewpoint so its ok to promote evolution rather than creation so long as i announce in advance that i am an atheist
1976281 well they wanted the state to stop fucking em over by making their sex illegal so why on earth would they want the state to enforce their ability to make medical decisions for each other
1976282 can spout a few half understood bromides from my ec 101 course taught by a republican economist
1976283 you describe yourself perfectly how sad that you have no interest in learning
1976284 ive never met a libertarian who would accept the end of trademark patent and copyright law i wonder why that is
1976285 if evolutionary psychologists say altruism evolved then how do you explain libertarians
1976286 wouldnt that be because theyre educated and have good jobs
1976287 and i think the families who do the same now only in foreign countries where they have no legal protection against their employers like minimum wage and where union organizers are frequently shot so as to suppress any sort labor movement could personally attest to how ridiculous that is you dont need a large prosperous market to sell to you just need a small rich one
1976288 fucking libertarian trolls why come here to spew your idiocy unless you simply intend to drag stinky bait
1976289 you ever get seriously sick without health insurance or government socialized healthcare
1976290 i dont recall saying the u s still had low standards of living no we passed legislation for a minimum wage workplace standards and education that allowed for the average americans lot in life to improve since then weve merely shifted our industrial working core overseas to places like india china etc which have significantly lower standards of living and a much lower income per capita that have largely failed to introduce these market controlling necessities america is a such a big market because so much of the worlds wealth is concentrated here
1976291 the argument ive heard against it is that when health care is privatized it becomes more efficient because theyre trying to make a profit i think its a false dichotomy i think it can be universal and still reward efficiency
1976292 us govt debt and tanking dollar are mostly due to the idiotic and immoral war in iraq gross amounts of corporate welfare and exploding oil prices
1976293 your narrow interpretation of the situation would say that nobody ever got wealthy exploiting slavery because slaves didnt have any money like much in libertarian economics such facile comments just dont hold up under even moderate scrutiny
1976294 ummm not to come in and merely point out how dumb you sound tooting your own horn but
1976295 the marxist fantasy of people getting rich by exploiting the poor is absurd on its face the poor have little wealth to trade
1976296 austin naacp president nelson linder who has known ron paul for 20 years unequivocally dismissed charges that the congressman was a racist in light of recent smear attempts and said the reason for him being attacked was that he was a threat to the establishment
1976297 its ok to be out and be in the military thats an order
1976298 he has me where he wants me solidly in his camp and i cant imagine any realistic scenario where his pre election maneuvering makes me desert the cause
1976299 promise support for these policies or we wont vote for you
1976300 congratulations in this particular election youve gotten lucky and get to run against a caricature you are currently by far the lesser of two evils should you gain office i will be watching your performance for evaluation in four years
1976301 choosing between a socially efficient and free riding equilibrium nurses versus economics and business students
1976302 youve convinced me that i want to do it now make me do it
1976303 someone plainly hasnt been to the uk we also eat awful food and dont walk anywhere and have the fastest growing obese population in europe yet we come out better so it doesnt explain why the us pays more for weaker results
1976304 that still makes it rather difficult to support a claim that
1976305 we are losing more and more factories because we are now playing on a global scale and many countries allow their laborers to be exploited by corporations
1976306 the simple fact is that libertarians are primarily white males
1976307 i want the liberty to be rich and you can have the liberty to starve
1976308 being taxed by an elected government even if you dont like what its doing is not calling it such is simply an attempt to change the meaning of words grow up
1976309 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
1976310 do you really think quoting the us declaration of independence settles anything
1976311 they solve nothing in science in ethics or in politics
1976312 it is you who wants to ignore the rule of law since the us federal governments constitutionally mandated right to levy taxes means that doing so is not robbery
1976313 no state shall coin money emit bills of credit make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts
1976314 i see no point in arguing the us system with someone from england
1976315 the founding fathers and the groups they came from merchants and planters almost exclusively started out with a huge and i mean humongous advantage in initial endowments relative to the rest of the population so they sought to institutionalize their advantage and make sure that the wealth and power of people like them was protected from the majority
1976316 we might have to change the name its a church
1976317 implements a new holiday to accommodate the muslim workers at the plant
1976318 according to tyson fully 80 percent of the unions 1 000 members agreed to the new holiday arrangement if a workforce with a huge muslim contingent wants to make a deal with management to have their biggest religious holiday off who cares and why are there rumblings about boycotting tyson when its the union thats driving this what am i missing is there an anti eid exception to freedom of contract
1976319 a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and allahs religion is made victorious over all other religions
1976320 that there is a lot of bigotry against muslims and that this agreement has clearly touched a raw nerve among those who are prejudiced against them however the rwdsu has always understood that unions are only strong when they work to protect the dignity of workers of all faiths that includes muslims our union may be the first to negotiate this kind of agreement but i have no doubt that others will follow our lead
1976321 that there is a lot of bigotry against muslims and that this agreement has clearly touched a raw nerve among those who are prejudiced against them
1976322 we are here we are here to stay and there is nothing you can do about it and nothing you can do to stop our onward march

1976332 there you will learn that this whole thing is not about race or ethnicity it is about the jihad of muslims against non muslims
1976333 see this link at which may be read a long muslim essay expounding on how all non muslims are to be hated and despised and humiliated
1976334 one of their sacred books even comes right out and tells them to push us
1976335 they are also taught a boundless supremacism and total sense of entitlement we non muslims are supposed to grovel to muslims flatter them be their slaves and pay them tribute hence their battening on welfare
1976336 their religion explicitly teaches them that they are entitled to rob rape assault insult enslave kill and generally use and abuse us non muslim untermenschen with complete impunity for this is the just punishment we deserve to suffer from them if we refuse to embrace their hellish religion

1976338 the report states that hussein grabbed the womans hand and twisted it but she began to kick him and he let her go
1976339 she then entered the office of the church with the man behind her according to police records with hussein allegedly grabbing her purse but the woman
1976340 following a struggle the woman was able to shut the door placing her feet on a cabinet to brace herself against the door to prevent the man from getting into the church office
1976341 the stolen vehicle was spotted by sgt milton binkley of the sheriffs department who attempted to pull it over
1976342 hussein was driving without lights and pulled into kennith wessner ford but as binkley attempted an arrest hussein allegedly sped away from the scene nearly running him down

1976345 in previous simulations this region came out smooth but now we have enough detail to see clumps of dark matter

1976363 he almost seems not to care very much about what people think of him which in a way is admirable i would not say that about bloomberg now although i still think he does not behave like a typical ingratiating politician in many ways that may be a reason for his great success

1976373 lopez lomong represents so many wonderful aspects of the olympic movement youth talent and an ability to overcome amazing obstacles in life with poise and determination the movement to bring awareness to sudanese suffering is well served by someone who has lived through it as a fellow u s olympic team member i know i will be more inspired by his life experiences

1976709 while this may seem like any standard security hole other researchers say that the work is a major breakthrough and there is very little that microsoft can do to fix the problems
1976710 if you think about the fact that net loads dlls into the browser itself and then microsoft assumes theyre safe because theyre net objects you see that microsoft didnt think about the idea that these could be used as stepping stones for other attacks this is a real tour de force
1976711 the genius of this is that its completely reusable they have attacks that let them load chosen content to a chosen location with chosen permissions thats completely game over
1976712 this stuff just takes a knife to a large part of the security mesh microsoft built into vista

1976796 he is in big danger of losing the cachet he built up for himself in being pro western and the restraint he has often shown in the face of provocation by russia
1976797 if he is going to start a war he is going to lose the support of a lot of friends in the west
1976798 he has had plenty of warnings from the west that it wont pull any chestnuts out of the fire for him so i dont think he can count on the cavalry riding in

1976828 theyve said theyve done nothing wrong i didnt sign up for this fight but i think what we have to do now is make changes to how prince georges county police and prince georges county sheriffs department operate
1976829 weve done these similar kinds of operations over and over again to the tune of removing billions of dollars of drugs from the community and without people or animals being harmed we dont want any of our operations to result in the injury or loss of anybody and certainly not animals
1976830 we have witnessed a frightening law enforcement culture in which the law is disregarded the rights of innocent occupants are ignored and the rights of innocent animals mean nothing a shadow was cast over our good names we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us

1976832 at a time when businesses are increasingly over regulated and over taxed rdas have become a symbol of wasteful bureaucratic excess
1976833 they should be abolished before the government hands them even greater powers
1976834 those powers can only be transferred when there is the required community confidence
1976835 it is critical that any arrangements have the widest and broadest support possible
1976836 i believe that the involvement of the assemblys executive and review committee in the autumn will help ensure this is the case

1976847 there has been a great sporting rivalry with australia and that will continue in beijing
1976848 its good to see that kate ellis is showing the courage of her convictions by having a bet with gerry
1976849 we hope that it is her donning a british top in australia after the games rather than vice versa
1976850 australia are expected to struggle to keep up their medals tally britains most optimistic outcome is about 41 medals

1976853 experts agree that there is a high probability of another influenza pandemic occurring but it is impossible to forecast its exact timing or the precise nature of its impact
1976854 should be sufficient to treat all those who fall ill in a pandemic of similar proportions to those that occurred in the 20th century
1976855 you might want to ask the question for example what happens if many of our heavy goods vehicle drivers fell victim to that influenza and werent able to perform their jobs
1976856 do we have enough back up to be able for example to deliver food to the supermarkets
1976857 i have great faith in the public and they would prefer to have information because the thing that causes fear is ignorance of things
1976858 an independent and unfettered appraisal of what it thinks is required by public policy in public law matters

1976860 the scottish government is determined to help the fishing industry adapt to high fuel costs and although we cant control the price of fuel we will do what we can to help in other ways

1976865 while both have increased from their low base as expected the overwhelming majority of the uks borrowers continue to pay their mortgages in full every month and will continue to do so
1976866 the cml is maintaining its forecast of 45 000 total possessions and 170 000 mortgages in arrears of more than three months by the end of the year
1976867 these numbers remain extremely small when seen in the context of the 11 74 million mortgages in the uk
1976868 in general terms while arrears and possessions rates have risen across the industry the impact of the credit crunch has hit the adverse credit sector harder than most of the mainstream market which continues to perform well
1976869 in the 1990s the problems people faced were high unemployment and high interest rates

1976871 faced with stagnant earnings rocketing living costs and soaring mortgage bills the weight of debt is taking its toll on thousands of hard working families who stretched themselves to the limit to get on the property ladder and are now finding they can no longer make ends meet

1976876 this scheme would have turned a green glade of heroes into a vast blasted chewing gummed piazza
1976877 there is absolutely no sense in londoners paying 18m from their already stretched transport budget in order to reduce capacity on londons roads
1976878 the mayor remains fully committed to the development of hydrogen as a cleaner greener fuel in london as indicated by the continuation of the programme to deliver 10 hydrogen buses and a refuelling facility
1976879 mayor johnson has just scrapped the biggest hydrogen vehicle project in this country
1976880 it is one thing for the london mayor to talk green but he is clearly turning into a one man environmental disaster

1976893 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
1976894 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
1976895 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
1976896 we never sent enough troops in the first place resulting in large us casualties and wasted material but now the worst seems to be over
1976897 that he refused to visit u s troops in germany because he couldnt bring the press with him is a case in point

1976902 i was down there in the hospital close to two months before they found out what was wrong and could find the right antibiotic
1976903 maybe somebody would be interested in a story where everything didnt go as planned
1976904 people who need a transplant think their lifes over it doesnt have to be that way i waited seven years for a transplant those werent happy years
1976905 one day ill be reinfected and my liver will be reinfected itll probably take 20 years for that to happen ill be in my 70s and who cares by then
1976906 every time these doctors see me they refer to me as their walking miracle
1976907 we support georgias territorial integrity and call for an immediate cease fire we urge all parties including georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate and avoid conflict
1976908 the most important thing now is that they stop the violence and that they de escalate and get into a position where they can sit down and talk
1976909 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
1976910 georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
1976911 ill never forget this image of my father trying to teach his new rabbit how to speak

1976914 if i could just finish trevor because i have been interrupted already
1976915 so i turned up in happy disney mode and everyone was on this almighty fucking downer
1976916 and then i flew back feeling down and everyone else was up
1976917 the way england reacted to neighbours was such a surprise to me i couldnt walk down the street without people screaming so that allowed me to take england off its pedestal and see it for what it is
1976918 i suppose that houdini might as well have been called joe smith in that hes just used as the tool to help gillian delve into what she wants to get into which is love
1976919 funnily enough i came into this film after playing andy warhol in factory girl where i was really struggling to get everyone to keep the facts straight throwing history books down in front of everyone
1976920 they say ah you must be so disappointed you havent had russells career but that just shows the external perception of what they think every actor wants that if you want to be an actor you must want to be tom cruise but ive always struggled with the idea of fame and recognition yes i want a certain amount of attention but i dont need a whole lot of money and i dont need to be throwing phones at people and ending up in the press doing crazy things every week because you know that brings attention to yourself and if you dont want that kind of attention dont do it
1976921 heres a guy who does big hollywood films but theyre solid credible films and he does good work in them
1976922 well if theres a good studio film theyre going to offer it to johnny depp theyre not going to offer it to me
1976923 and if its a bad studio film that johnny depp is not going to do theyll offer it to me and if its bad im not going to want to do it anyway so the problem sort of takes care of itself
1976924 then there are the ones that ride the line where you think ooh is it good
1976925 i dont want that experience and ive never wanted that experience
1976926 and i suppose that for me it would be that i suffer from a lot of social anxiety i was a really anxious kid a real loner
1976927 and i still have trouble in some social situations im very aware of space taker uppers those people who are always demanding attention they make me very uncomfortable so maybe thats why ive arranged my life the way i have why ive never moved to la or wanted that endless barrage of attention
1976928 but im a lot better than i used to be
1976929 but i think the public is fascinated by the more lewd titles so the big book of lesbian horse stories has a good chance
1976930 given salman rushdies midnights children picked up another booker of booker prize perhaps nude mice is the early favourite
1976931 the public will decide although let it be known im still not entirely convinced about opening up the prize up to the public their debased vulgarity has been responsible for electing many a nudge winker as winner in recent years
1976932 when a driver of a vehicle is an illegal alien or may be reasonably suspected of being an illegal alien
1976933 we have a good team we have a strong team
1976934 we pale in comparison to the level of support we are able to give our olympic athletes to develop
1976935 i can tell you why i think that china performed the way they did in 2006
1976936 the country has 1 3 billion people they have used large amounts of resources behind these sports programs and it is a very important matter of pride for them
1976937 those were on international soil all around the world in 2008 theyll be at home theyve hired the worlds best coaches whove not only coached the athletes but coached their coaches theyre bringing in coaches in sports they have not traditionally done well at because they need to learn the sport
1976938 basically we are not yet a strong nation in sport we must be practical and realistic weve got only liu xiang for athletics and i dont see much hope in swimming
1976939 i believe thats a misconception that the world has upon us
1976940 first of all we dont think were capable of being no 1 in reaping the olympic medals for example in the athens games even though we ranked no 2 in the gold medals for all of the medals we were only ranked no 3 america had 102 russia had 92 and we only had 63 in terms of levels we dont think we can get most of the medals next summer
1976941 the world does not really know enough about china as we wish
1976942 police mistakenly raid maryland mayors house kill his dogs for sport
1976943 it is clear to me that the he said she said nature of communications to you is not advancing the conversation
1976944 theyre misrepresenting their proposal to the teachers and to the public
1976945 inflating the currency and then having less product to buy and charging you fees to do it its hyper inflation
1976946 i wish it wasnt the kind of decision we felt we had to make
1976947 this new structure will attract more new customers benefit current customers and help differentiate delta from other carriers
1976948 are trying to stay competitive and be a little more innovative
1976949 antimatter is just like ordinary matter in every way except that every quantity you can think of apart from mass and spin is reversed
1976950 annihilated particle antiparticle pairs are converted entirely into energy in the form of light photons
1976951 thats what it seemed like to me one older kid picking on a little kid
1976952 i only smile in the dark my only comfort is the night gone black i didnt accidentally tell you that im only happy when it rains
1976953 since i retired i couldnt go anywhere in china im pretty tall i cant hide i got tired of staying in all the time so i went to the u s
1976954 volleyball is not very popular in the united states not many people recognize me i can have a normal life
1976955 mothers throw their children at her to get a chance for their children to touch her
1976956 shes actually had to have bodyguards here because her fans want to touch her
1976957 any one of the short films might prove diverting in the right place at the right time but all of which dont much make for a knockout night at the cinema

1976963 there is something disingenuous about the way the american comic lobs in high grade opinon bombs and then goes hey whats all the fuss about
1976964 hunter bounces from joke to joke with a readiness that does more to maintain comic momentum than build an argument
1976965 his hour flies by partly because of his incredibly poised delivery partly because the show i saw was only 45 minutes long

1977001 now i want to depict this character but i also want her attractive oh i know let me just scrub off all that extra melanin now shes hawt
1977002 but what did they do to her skin and her nose
1977003 then we all act surprised when little black girls pick the white doll as the pretty one in the doll test
1977004 the ad pr marketing industries are roughly 90 white male and white female dominated
1977005 black women all look like x and are never attractive to me
1977006 well ill take a black woman as long as i can ignore it
1977007 but its also important to think about the generalisations and imagery used in the media about people from africa today
1977008 now i want to depict this character but i also want her attractive oh i know let me just scrub off all that extra melanin now shes hawt
1977009 que sea el ministerio quien ejecute la ley para que en madrid esperanza aguirre y fuera sus compa eros no se salgan con la suya que es no dar las ayudas y mandar a los dependientes a residencias privadas

1977014 que no es eso lo que ellos ven en la tv
1977015 it is the first finding of this kind on the european mainland which we have been able to fully excavate and which shows a structure we have until now only seen in britain
1977016 the way it is built with many concentrated rings of graves walls palisades and pillars are very similar to the british monument at stonehenge
1977017 while we live in a nation that is enriched by a vast array of diverse traditions cultures and histories it is our commonality that most defines us
1977018 we know that the cost of the american dream must never come at the expense of the american family
1977019 thats why ill double spending on quality after school programs so that you can know your kids are safe and secure
1977020 but we also have to do more to support and strengthen lgbt families because equality in relationship family and adoption rights is not some abstract principle its about whether millions of lgbt americans can finally live lives marked by dignity and freedom
1977021 ill be a president that stands up for american families all of them sincerely barack obama
1977022 my characters go places and do things and i just follow along behind and take notes
1977023 i dont know what happened but my character just got away from me and did his own thing i had nothing to do with it
1977024 nabokov used to say that he pushed his characters around like serfs or chess pieces he had no time for that metaphorical ignorance and impotence whereby authors like to say i dont know what happened but my character just got away from me and did his own thing
1977025 but maintaining control doesnt necessaily equate with taking responsibility nor does experiencing surprises when you write automatically equate with capriciousness

1977027 this is the first time that we have found a completely preserved chariot in bulgaria
1977028 they thought it would be better to open up a roster spot for someone younger and more deserving they didnt want me back younger and more deserving that blew me away
1977029 i thought for someone in my position that was an insult it hurt i just thought it was a strange thing to say i didnt really know how to react my jaw hit the floor i didnt say anything
1977030 i dont want to muddy ewings name or his reputation
1977031 id contemplated retirement but i hadnt retired and then decided to come back like favre
1977032 but the thought of playing for another team asking to be traded no way theres no way i could have thought about putting on another uniform after 19 years with the royals i didnt want to
1977033 if it had come to it i would have just retired then even though i wanted to play more
1977034 i had him labeled as a major league second baseman with the ability to fill in at shortstop i was always impressed with his bat
1977035 some people think i sell things that i am a salesman and ive been asked before what are the keys to being a good salesman
1977036 i say there are five things first ask for the money and ive forgotten the other four
1977037 is ive been making better pitches when i need to keeping the ball in the ballpark is going to help you win a lot of games dont pitch in the middle of the plate keep the ball in and out
1977038 what happens especially with a young pitcher when they try to come inside they try to throw it as hard as they can then you cant control it
1977039 taking a little bit off the pitch has made all of the difference
1977040 it was macs idea and i just throw a batting practice fastball in there not try to blow it by the guy let him hit it and see what happens
1977041 even if he doesnt swing i can use it for an effect pitch then go back down and away which is the way you want to pitch anyway
1977042 pitching inside is one of those things that sounds easy but its not that easy to do
1977043 for gil its made his stuff that much tougher to hit teams know he has a real good breaking ball and they look for it
1977044 now hes using it to his advantage by not throwing it as much instead hes blowing that fastball inside and the cutter away and when theyre not expecting it hes throwing that breaking ball early in the count
1977045 no doubt about it but if you cant throw off speed pitches off your fastball its not going to work my curveball took a while to come this year normally thats a pitch i can throw in my sleep
1977046 you play baseball in the summer you know its going to be hot you cant worry about that stuff
1977047 when its hot youve still got to go out and play
1977048 you dont want to give up runs but you also want to make sure you go deep into games
1977049 one of the reasons you are a starting pitcher is to go out there and go as long as you can four or five innings is not very good for the team
1977050 i know there have been teams that have done it before that were worse off than us
1977051 obviously a lot of good things have got to happen right and in things we cant control
1977052 i think if we continue to play good baseball and play the type of baseball we are capable of good things will fall into place
1977053 they are ahead of us in the standings if we can do something in that series it gives us a better chance
1977054 and its costing us games ive got to find a way to make an adjustment and take care of that
1977055 thats all you can do im not going to sit here and bury a guy who weve got a lot of confidence in hes just got to get better at it
1977056 i kind of felt like i didnt have much behind it today
1977057 it is early august and i hope its just a tiny bad spell
1977058 i need to shoulder a lot of the blame for leaving him in
1977059 its the nastiest pitch youve seen when its off hes average thats just the way it is
1977060 he allowed us to get on track offensively because we didnt do much early
1977061 he lifted it to the outfield my approach was right my thought process was right he just made a good swing on the ball then ortiz hit a ground ball up the middle
1977062 these guys need more reps and more experience in those situations
1977063 with experience and the type of athlete luke hochevar is and the kind of competitor he is hell get it but obviously its painful until he starts getting it consistently
1977064 it helps you with your approach you are not going to be able to simulate the exact same thing but you dont really do that in regular bp batting practice either
1977065 second inning on he had it going he mixed in a couple of fastballs at opportune times its a difficult thing when you are looking for that thing to be dancing and all of sudden he throws a 72 mph fastball
1977066 he located the fastball when he needed to the knuckleball from the second inning on was just that good
1977067 you get to meet people in the community all the while raising money for the royals charities which all goes to a good cause
1977068 at the emmys sandra lee would surely be in the running she might lose out to some of my favorite roseanne halloween eps though

1977074 these findings factory girl a downer but its lead actors give the sad tale a lift
1977075 the bottom line is if people didnt want this stuff then it wouldnt be a problem in our current system or under a universal health care system but people do want the stuff so it is a problem now and would likely still be a problem under any sort of universal health care system the real problem is educating people about the scientific method and how to recognize implausible health claims
1977076 it was not it any way a broader discussion of the strengths and weakness of a single payer system
1977077 republican campaign by claiming government doesnt work and procede to promptly prove it as soon as theyre elected
1977078 well give you whatever you want as long as you pay for it
1977079 well tell you what you want but well cover the cost
1977080 interest in examining the kind of messages we are putting out
1977081 unnecessary expense a patient later feeling betrayed by her physician when the treatment doesnt work or the placebo effect wears off and she realizes that it was only a pretend medicine all along other patients or physicians concluding that the treatments have validity and possibly being convinced to forgo rational treatment people in general losing confidence in modern medicine when it appears that many physicians cant distinguish between the rational and the bogus wasted research funds human subjects unnecessarily duped and endangered a befuddled media a befuddled public befuddled leglislators endorsing quacks to a befuddled public
1977082 some of these outcomes may be thought of as mainly exposing a puzzling lack of reach for more rational voices
1977083 we can fairly easily find instances where such dire predictions are fulfilled
1977084 select few who have a clear enough grasp of the scientific evidence
1977085 resort to ethical argument about the use of placebo medicines
1977086 disconnection between the benefits of medical interactions and their scientific content
1977087 5 15 minute hurly burly of the typical present day medical practice
1977088 the practitioner who is not hamstrung by what science says and in consequence has a confident explanation for everything and never runs out of remedies
1977089 a change of tack that might actually be more in touch with medical realities
1977090 science reason ethics and modern medicine part 5 penultimate words
1977091 some of the methods may simply have not yet been subjected to sufficient study to be quite sure whether they have intrinsic medical activity or not
1977092 it is not us who heal the body heals itself
1977093 either we go on beating ourselves and our students up over this problem or we simply give everyone a break and accept these variant spellings as such
1977094 i am not asking people to learn to spell these words differently all i am suggesting is that we might well put 20 or so of the most commonly misspelt words in the english language on the same footing as those other words that have a widely accepted variant spelling
1977095 i smoked up from high school through college and now i manage several mutual funds while that dullard jim who wouldnt even drink carbonated stuff works in construction

1977100 i just couldnt believe that i read that when i was in seattle
1977101 i thought theres a reason why im here right now
1977102 im just super excited to be here and couldnt believe the providence of all these things happening
1977103 put a log on the ole coal fire cos me old dads got tb
1977104 now if you dont mind can i have my beer and my sandwich please

1977107 hey mr duck i reckon i can line you up with a top job paying really good money
1977108 im always looking for the next job says the duck

1977116 although our pipeline of commercial jobs has never been larger because commercial installations span multiple quarters we expect to see continued revenue volatility as commercial projects become a larger portion of our revenue mix
1977117 despite the prolonged uncertainty about the passage of the investment tax credit interest in solar power shows no signs of abating
1977118 bookings are at record levels still there is no question that economic weakness and delay in the passage of the tax credit are impeding industry growth this year
1977119 the kaiser chiefs are playing a gig at the academy and ive got a spare ticket if you want it

1977122 our staff examined the impact on corn prices fuel prices and current price for renewable fuel credits which are used to demonstrate compliance with rfs mandate
1977123 this research found that the rfs mandate isnt costing a severe economic harm rfs is strengthening our energy security and supporting the american farming community
1977124 herds and flocks have been reduced eggs set for hatching have dropped in numbers significantly
1977125 whats happening now may be mild compared to what will happen in the future there may be a small amount of meat and poultry available on the market
1977126 kansas now produces more corn per acre than wheat so thats a drastic change in the last 20 years
1977127 this ruling clearly recognizes the important role of biofuels in helping meet current and future energy demands
1977128 there is nothing like building something that no one else has
1977129 nobody builds things exactly as shown in the plans they put their own personal touches on the vehicles
1977130 although some may urge otherwise the commission should resist the temptation to define what constitutes an eligible offset or rec
1977131 doing so would require the commission to resolve highly technical environmental debates that are beyond its expertise
1977132 the fact that standards may differ from one seller to another simply reflects the fact that there is no consensus about what does or should constitute a carbon offset
1977133 different authoritative and expert institutions have adopted different but reasonable approaches
1977134 although the commission should insist that all carbon offset claims are supported by a reasonable basis ftc precedent provides no reason to choose one reasonable approach over another
1977135 attempt to keep offsets guidelines vague shows the company is more interested in marketing potential than actual environmental change
1977136 unspecific standards would allow the retailer to commit to carbon neutrality without providing much real documentation
1977137 give marketers and advertisers wide latitude to substantiate the determination that a source of electricity is renewable
1977138 companies that are investing in alternative energies while generating carbon from their own production line are making marketing and product claims of carbon neutrality or negativity such as fiji bottled water being marketed as carbon negative

1977310 abbiamo adottato un metodo in uso in altri paesi intendiamo aprire una consultazione pubblica durer tre mesi su unipotesi di scenario accompagnata da molti interrogativi vogliamo che vi partecipino in molti nel parlamento e nella societ pensiamo che il ridisegno del modello sociale sia parte della costituzione materiale del paese non quindi una consultazione dettata da generica propensione bipartisan ma la convinzione che il punto di arrivo i valori debbono essere largamente condivisi nel gergo della commissione europea il libro bianco invece un prodotto compiuto pi che domande contiene risposte ancora a valle poi come governo predisporremo le riforme legislative per transitare dallattuale al futuro sistema di welfare
1977311 puntiamo a un sistema che non sia solo risarcitorio come lodierno ma che rafforzi lungo tutto larco della vita la possibilit delle persone di fronteggiare i bisogni che quindi agisca sullautosufficienza delle persone sulla loro antropologia una grande ambizione la seconda caratteristica del nuovo modello la sua sostenibilit finanziaria oggi paventiamo i pericoli di insostenibilit di un welfare vecchio tanto per i bilanci pubblici quanto per le famiglie che spesso pagano out of pocket di tasca propria le emergenze basti pensare alleventualit di dover ingaggiare due badanti per uno o addirittura due genitori anziani o che si abbia una grave problema oncologico e si debba andare per il mondo alla ricerca della soluzione migliore
1977312 con una societ pi attiva con pi occupati che renderanno anche possibile un nuovo apporto delle persone alle spese per i bisogni sociali una partecipazione organizzata attraverso fondi mutue assicurazioni private lo stato ritroverebbe equilibrio per due ragioni primo si allargherebbe la base dei contribuenti secondo si razionalizzerebbero le prestazioni e ridurrebbero i bisogni ad esempio si spenderebbe meno per indennit di disoccupazione o altri ammortizzatori sociali
1977313 ci ispiriamo dichiaratamente alleconomia sociale di mercato che appartiene a tutta la tradizione europea le ragioni del mercato si debbono misurare con quelle della persona della famiglia della comunit questo tanto pi vero ora che siamo impegnati anche a crescere nelleconomia della conoscenza dove conta soprattutto il capitale umano leconomia sociale di mercato non si limita a distribuire bene la ricchezza ma sa produrla attraverso un impiego ottimale del capitale umano
1977314 se ragionassimo solo in termini di bilancio parleremmo esclusivamente di tagli non cos vogliamo riconvertire il modello sociale un esempio nella sanit ci sono unit ospedaliere marginali che vanno chiuse non per risparmiare ma per rendere pi efficiente il sistema

1977336 thanks to vitaly for this great opportunity i have to admit that im not very good at telling stories basically its always been hard to explain every detail on how i get it done and why i did this and that partly the idea for this theme is based upon my own theme which has a slightly personal touch and uses vibrant and appealing colors with some rambling designs and fancy head imagery ive tried to put all pieces together to make the theme literally stand out among other things the start page window of the infinity theme has thumnails and offers delicious integration i tried to keep it as simple as possible unlike regular post entries style with wordpress custom filed functions ive used them to show off image titles next to the thumbnails this design decision is intended to catch readers attention in a better way and it could be a huge advantage for portfolios where designers want to present their photos or design works i hope you enjoy this theme and i would love to hear any comments you have about my new theme and for more information please visit my website or feel free to ask any questions regarding the theme in comments to this post ill do my best to answer them

1977358 we are working with event organizers and we recognize the importance of such meetings especially in quebec city this year but visa officers have to keep in mind the safety and security of canadians when they make their decision
1977359 its ironic but sad when you know that the title of our conference is librarians without borders
1977360 its an outstanding issue and unfortunately its only getting worse
1977361 for some reason african citizens seem to be targeted more than others by immigration authorities
1977362 sustained job growth and positive migration are supporting more single detached home starts in 2008
1977363 sudburys population grew by nearly 3 000 between 2001 and 2006
1977364 you drove mom to work and she gets off at 4 30 so you should be home around 5 30

1977367 what how did you get that out of loving me
1977368 our government is committed to ensuring newcomers integrate into their communities and find meaningful employment
1977369 by offering various settlement programs such as language training we are giving newcomers the opportunity to succeed when immigrants succeed canada succeeds
1977370 the regina open door society has been serving refugees and immigrants in collaboration with citizenship and immigration canada cic for the additional resources which will enable the organization to expand its capacity to assist increasing numbers of newcomers to the region
1977371 i was scared and lonely and did not have any friends or family in canada
1977372 thats not acceptable and we have to change it we cannot let newcomers fall behind
1977373 i was a high school teacher back in india and i was using english very often
1977374 which really helps me close the communication gap between me and the native speakers
1977375 we cannot have people waiting six years to get into this country
1977376 were working as fast as we can weve redeployed staff weve redeployed resources
1977377 no way particularly given our provinces economic condition that we can afford to turn away anybody who wants to make our community their home
1977378 if you want but dont feel like you have to
1977379 look at that poster on the wall gestation periods how exciting
1977380 im still very concerned about your possibility of having children in the future
1977381 amy beth do you have any plans to begin attempting to have children in the near future
1977382 shell laugh before she answers i know this because its what we do every single night of the week maybe well go into the nursery tonight maybe well decide where the changing table should go
1977383 i always thought that having children was gods plan for my life but maybe its not if we end up together welljust see what we get
1977384 i saw the creators hands forming little me the same hands that had created the start and the heavens were carefully fashioning me i was filled with wonder and gratefulness
1977385 the one i have been waiting for the one who has been waiting for me is it him
1977386 is that her the one i have been waiting for the one who has been waiting for me
1977387 im still very concerned about your possibility of having children in the future
1977388 i asked why i shouldnt i bring her and was told by the border guard that because she was disabled she had a lifetime ban
1977389 i have never ever in my whole life seen such blatant discrimination lucy is different and therefore in their eyes not perfect
1977390 i kept saying to them so because my daughter is disabled you are telling me she cant come in and they simply said yes
1977391 my dog was allowed to stay my dog has a higher status than my daughter in canada just because she is disabled
1977392 in canada we have rules and regulations to protect the canadian people and we have to make sure that the proper process is followed
1977393 it is not that we do not want them the chapmans herethey just have to follow the proper process which includes ensuring the residency permit is in place before arriving in canada
1977394 plenty of room in her pelvis for a 7 lb baby maybe even an 8 lb one
1977395 la grandeza de una naci n y su progreso moral se pueden juzgar por el modo en que se trata a sus animales
1977396 were really pleased with the look and feel that brian helped create for diablo iii and the new person we bring onboard will work with the other artists on the team to maintain the art style moving forward
1977397 nothing in this section in any way limits the power of the minister to otherwise determine the most efficient manner in which to administer this act
1977398 these programs are offered by ngos and various levels of government they are not always co ordinated or part of a coherent framework
1977399 theres a lack of long term financing so they are not able to develop and build on their experience
1977400 companies are not good at assessing competencies as opposed to credentials
1977401 the government can provide an employment dating service but in the end employers have to step up to the plate
1977402 i think we have to have a real level of consistency though the whole season if we want to succeed
1977403 last year we didnt perform to what we could do in a few games and still got a result but i dont think we can afford to do that this season
1977404 the first two or three games are always unpredictable local amp nations
1977405 cooperation between law enforcement agencies and the community is essential in meeting the challenges of apprehending high risk individuals who pose a threat to our society the arrest of these criminals and their removal from canada can only improve public and community safety
1977406 ini kehendak akar umbi umno yang mahukan perubahan kerana yakin dengan agenda pembangunan azalina untuk penduduk pengerang
1977407 paling ketara yang mahukan azalina menjadi ketua bahagian yang baru ialah golongan wanita
1977408 sebagai menteri pelancongan azalina lebih berkemampuan untuk membantu penduduk berbanding harun yang hanya seorang adun
1977409 kami sepakat mahukan muka baru menerajui bahagian ini dan orang yang paling layak menjadi ketua bahagian pengerang ialah azalina
1977410 we went down a terrible path where we had too many careers
1977411 we had 250 odd at one point and we boiled it right back down to 20
1977412 kabinet yang ditubuhkan menerusi cara itu daripada segi moralnya tidak berkredibiliti parlimen sendiri akan tercemar badan eksekutif dan penggubal undang undang akan dianggap oleh rakyat sebagai institusi yang kehilangan integriti
1977413 saiz dan skala lompat parti yang diusahakannya itu amat sukar hendak dibayangkan
1977414 pernahkah misalnya terjadi di dalam dunia ini di mana sebuah kerajaan yang mempunyai lebih 58 kerusi daripada gabungan pembangkang berterusan diancam dijatuhkan hanya kerana seorang individu yang malahan tidak berada dalam parlimen sentiasa mendabik dada kononnya jumlah tertentu anggota parlimen akan lompat parti pada tarikh tertentu
1977415 jika ancaman lompat parti terus mengancam ketenteraman negara ia adalah disebabkan ramai rakyat tahu bahawa pada satu ketika dahulu anwar sebagai pemimpin bn dan kerajaan persekutuan telah memainkan peranan penting dalam menjatuhkan kerajaan negeri pbs yang dipilih secara demokrasi di sabah pada 1994
1977416 mereka sepatutnya cuba meyakinkan beliau yang ia lebih bermaruah untuk memasuki putrajaya melalui pintu depan ini dengan cara memenangi pilihan raya umum ke 13 di peringkat persekutuan dan membentuk kerajaan menerusi undang undang dengan cara beretika
1977417 harapannya ialah beliau juga akan sebagai ketua pembangkang membentuk kabinet bayangan yang akan mendesak kerajaan bn untuk memperkenalkan sebanyak mungkin perubahan yang diperlukan
1977418 pendirian saya selalu dengan sikap terbuka dalam ruang demokrasi tetapi menimbulkan rasa sensitif sama ada berkesan jika diadakan dengan cara terbuka ia nampak seperti agak provokatif
1977419 atau lebih kepada perbincangan tertutup jadi perbincangan boleh diteruskan tanpa kelihatan provokatif
1977420 jika forum itu ingin diteruskan pada tahap ini mesti memastikan dibuat dalam forum tertutup dan turut melibatkan pihak lain terutamanya mereka yang menyatakan kebimbangan
1977421 saya rasa untuk kepentingan malaysia yang pelbagai kaum kita patut berhati hati tentang perkara ini teruskan perbincangan bertemu dengan mereka yang bimbang saya rasa sebagai strategi ia akan lebih berkesan untuk jangka masa yang panjang
1977422 mencetuskan syak wasangka dan ketegangan hubungan antara penganut islam dan penganut pelbagai agama
1977423 kurang bersesuaian dan boleh menimbulkan salah tanggapan di kalangan masyarakat
1977424 dalam kalangan mereka yang mempunyai latar belakang dalam bidang berkaitan
1977425 perlu patuhi undang undang dan prosedur yang ditetapkan jika patuhi undang undang tidak akan timbul sebarang masalah
1977426 kami memang merancang untuk menambah anggota sepanjang pilihanraya tapi pada masa ini kami tidak pasti lagi berapa ramai yang akan diletakkan di sana
1977427 beri peluang kepada anwar untuk masuk jadi ahli parlimen di dewan rakyat
1977428 pas perlu memberi sokongan kepada anwar walaupun dari segi politik tidak serupa
1977429 you work so hard and its tough to move the ball in the nfl as an offense we take pride
1977430 its the first drive of the game they the redskins already put seven up we have to match that we just have to do better
1977431 we just want to keep moving the ball the same way as we did it was nice long drive with a lot of plays and a lot of time taken off the clock to punch it in would have been nice
1977432 i dont know how much im going to play whether its a series like it was last week if its a good series a quarter and a half
1977433 when im out there im going to play the best i can and hopefully put some points on the board and give the other guys a head start so we can win this ballgame
1977434 my completion percentage was good but it could be better
1977435 i made a mistake throwing the ball to wide receiver reggie wayne on one it wasnt a good read and i probably shouldnt have went there i had two incompletions inside the 10 yard line you cant have that
1977436 when you get in the red zone everything gets a little tighter and gets a little smaller but thats where you make your money thats where you have to put the ball in the end zone
1977437 we talked to our offense and they moved the ball 450 some yards
1977438 they had a lot of long drives but we only scored one touchdown we got down there quite a bit and went for it on fourth down a couple of times didnt make it and kicked field goals all of us on offense would like to see us be more productive in the red zone
1977439 thats one of the things that we talked about all through camp
1977440 i think its going to be very similar to last week
1977441 were still in the first game of the preseason mode so the starters will play and well get a couple of series with them depending on how long they go and we want to get some of your young guys in just like last week mixed in with that first group
1977442 youll see some veterans come out fairly early but it will be very similar to last week
1977443 they probably will go with that first group and play
1977444 he should be able to play with that first group he wants to get a little bit in
1977445 i dont have gary yelling at me and im doing part of the yelling
1977446 i guess thats a little different there are a lot of young guys and they need to get used to doing things the way we know how to do them on defense theyre coming along all right
1977447 since garys been out a little bit i noticed him trying to keep on the young guys the young linebackers he was that way in college so we kind of expected that hes done a good job with that
1977448 its a great opportunity for these guys to get a lot of reps during camp
1977449 some teams if youre the third or fourth string guy you dont get any reps in camp guys have a great opportunity
1977450 i think im adjusting pretty well to what were doing
1977451 it has taken a while to get acclimated i came to camp pretty sick i wasnt playing too well at the beginning i was a little unfocused being here the last two weeks ive been getting focused and getting healthy
1977452 im the type of guy if im out there im going to be practicing
1977453 im not going to hold back anything i dont think i should ill let the coaches take care of that if they want to give me more rest thats their prerogative
1977454 really made me think that how you play when youre not feeling your best is real important when youre at your worst you want to play your best you have to strive for that every time no matter how you feel physically
1977455 its been good for him so far to be out at all the practices and be involved and not miss time
1977456 i just have to be refining my skills this camp and thinking more about what offenses are trying to do to me garys our team captain hes our leader at linebacker when hes not there there a void to be filled
1977457 deem is proud of its strong affiliation and history with the colts and the city of indianapolis we are excited about our new partnership in lucas oil stadium and feel that this is a great opportunity for deem to show its continued support for the community and the indianapolis colts
1977458 deem has been a partner and supporter of the indianapolis colts since 1984 when the team moved to town deem is a fixture in indianapolis and like the colts understands the importance of giving back to the community deem was one of the supporters who were involved in attracting and securing super bowl xlvi for our great city and state deem is a first class company doing great things in our community its only fitting that their name be on the upper suite level of lucas oil stadium where the amenities are also first class
1977459 kita sentiasa mengadakan perbincangan dengan diplomat malaysia di washington mengenai pelbagai perkara termasuk dengan karuppannan
1977460 kita memandang berat banyak persoalan serius yang dibangkitkan di malaysia termasuk oleh majlis peguam berhubung kes ini
1977461 were looking at probably eight weeks from now before hes ready to get back going
1977462 well have to look at that as we come down
1977463 we wont have to make any decisions now when we cut down to 53 well have to see where we are and how we are healthwise
1977464 itd be nice to be able to keep him well see what happens though
1977465 i just feel a lot better this year than i did last year coming in as a rookie last year i didnt really know what was going on in our defense and i was kind of lost out there i pretty much didnt know what i was doing i was running around out there like a chicken with his head cut off this year i actually have a clue whats going on things are slowing down and im making a little bit better breaks on the ball
1977466 it was a good day this morning i thought our energy level was up i thought our players sensed that were getting ready for a game it was a good practice and we got a lot of things done
1977467 i was a little bit nervous at the beginning of the game but as the game went on i got relaxed and just let things come to me
1977468 he had 19 plays and most of them were in pass rush situations most of it was very very productive he had two sacks and had a hit on the quarterback so it was a good debut for him
1977469 he was playing against a veteran offensive lineman so i think getting the sense of what its going to be like is good but he had a good start
1977470 i thought it was going to be a good fit with guys like robert mathis and dwight freeney and some other people
1977471 the tampa 2 defense allows you to be able to roam around and play football ive been doing the scheme for about two months so its starting to come to me but we still have more things to put in so i just have to take my time
1977472 i thought it was a big difference of speed during practice but in the actual game its a real big difference
1977473 i was just trying to go out there and my main goal was to go out and do the right assignments and not mess up
1977474 patutkah kita mendakwa orang yang membuat laporan polis mendakwa kejadian itu berlaku
1977475 kita mesti ingat juga bahawa anwar tidak bersalah sehingga dibuktikan oleh mahkamah
1977476 mencetuskan syak wasangka dan ketegangan hubungan antara penganut islam dan penganut pelbagai agama dalam negara
1977477 isu isu berkaitan dengan hak dan kepentingan islam adalah seasuatu yang mutlak
1977478 dewan ulama perlu ada di peringkat kawasan untuk menggembleng tenaga tenaga ulama di peringkat itu
1977479 kami meminta bpr melakukan tindakan yang sewajarnya bagi membetulkan keadaan yang tidak sihat ini daripada terus berlaku
1977480 elaun yang dipotong itu bukannya khusus untuk mengurus pusat khidmat di kawasan masing masing tapi sebaliknya terus disalurkan kepada jabatan kebajikan masyarakat jkm negeri bagi membantu golongan kurang bernasib baik
1977481 walaupun sudah buat pada siri pertama forum memeluk islam dan hujung minggu ini siri kedua saya bagi amaran majoriti senyap masyarakat islam di malaysia belum lagi bangun untuk menyanggah mereka tetapi jangan suruh kita bangun
1977482 sehubungan itu saya dengan tegas mengingatkan mana mana kumpulan yang kononnya sedang berusaha keras untuk melakukan
1977483 begitu juga dalam memperbaiki dan meningkatkan pentadbiran undang undang islam di mahkamah syariah perkara 121 1 a perlembagaan persekutuan memainkan peranan yang penting dalam menjelaskan bidangkuasa mahkamah syariah di malaysia
1977484 saya tidak fikir semua perkara sensitif seperti ini boleh dibincangkan secara terbuka lebih elok dibincangkan secara tertutup
1977485 kita tidak menghalang sebarang bentuk perbincangan kerana ia sesuatu yang sihat tetapi biarlah dibuat secara tertutup
1977486 kami akan membentuk jentera bersama untuk memberikan beliau sokongan politik
1977487 dalam kes ini bukan sahaja datuk seri anwar sahaja yang dibicarakan tetapi seluruh negara sedang dibicarakan
1977488 saya memohon maaf mana mana yang tersinggung kepada semua anggota polis tetapi tulisan dalam artikel itu saya pertahankan
1977489 apabila disebut dalam siasatan tentang lambang pdrm itu saya langsung tidak mempertahankan saya kesal dan saya tidak pertahankan kalau ada orang bertanya bab itu saya malas layan lagi
1977490 dalam siasatan saya mempertahankan hak saya untuk menulis seperti yang terdapat dalam posting itu
1977491 jadi sekarang saya patah tangan saya sekarang tidak dapat nak ubah buang dari blog sebab saya patah tangan kerana komputer saya dirampas
1977492 in nearly every trial we found staff morale runs considerably higher when bosses dont read workers e mail over their shoulders complain about their superior salaries or act in any way like giant self centered assholes
1977493 similarly we found that typical dick manager phrases like i dont disagree can weaken worker disposition by as much as 63 percent
1977494 keselamatan doktor itu dibimbangi kerana beliau telah menyebut nama nama polis yang mengugutnya membuat keterangan palsu berhubung dakwaan liwat ke atas anwar
1977495 beliau abdullah baru tahu bahawa dna tahan lama menantunya khairi jamaluddin tidak sampaikan maklumat
1977496 penyokong kuat beliau di kalangan orang melayu sendiri mulai muak dengan perkara ini tambahan lagi perdana menteri sedang berhadapan dengan penyiasatan badan pencegah rasuah bpr mengenai dakwaan penglibatan beliau dalam korupsi dan politik wang
1977497 kita telah memberi alibi dan nama mereka kepada pihak polis sewaktu siasatannya
1977498 what is the proper aim and goal of human life
1977499 the incidents of crimes of violence has decreased in the last decade
1977500 how can we have objective knowledge in ethics how can we get the kind of epistemic certainty in our ethical judgments that we strive for in our scientific judgments
1977501 how can we be certain how can we have epistemic objectivity about our political judgments and our claims of political obligation
1977502 how exactly do biochemical processes at the level of cells cause cancer
1977503 how exactly does the genetic structure of a zygote produce the phenotypical traits of a mature organism
1977504 a plugger remembers when the most expensive thing at the movies was the ticket to the movies

1977514 well here they are by god straight out of an anatomy textbook disproportionally huge and held up at an angle that nobody would ever actually use when clapping
1977515 youre making this day the most amazing day of my life
1977516 these measures are aimed at increasing domestic availability and a consequent reduction in prices through improved supply management
1977517 knowing who im dating and what kind of cereal i eat aint gonna benefit anybody else that kind of thing is not important
1977518 people have different opinions on that type of thing i told you what mine is and i think for each person you do whats right for you for me part of the reason that i have anxiety is the fact that i feel like people are always staring at me so its important for me to make sure that i have my friends and vacation and what i do at home with my family and that type of thing stays private
1977519 i had slipped on some water that the dogs spilled out of their bowl and my legs came up from under me and slammed down right on my back
1977520 they can get up and get moving much quicker in the hospital and they leave the hospital quicker

1977523 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds

1977531 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
1977532 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
1977533 his quickness put a lot of pressure on me and forced me to make a couple of errors
1977534 the ball moves slower which gives me more time to set up
1977535 at the end i thought i could break back i thought i could take the set
1977536 hopefully this result will help me out in the future with easier draws and hopefully i can reach the finals again
1977537 he played pretty well in the second set when i was up 5 3 and vieyra threatened a comeback i got worried his forehand moves around and it kept me on my defence
1977538 it was hard with the rain but i just tried to keep my focus i tried not too worry too much about it

1977550 while increases in domestic oil production are possible they are not where the long term debate is headed
1977551 innovation low carbon clean energy technologies are the vision that is ultimately going to win out
1977552 there are better ways to establish markets for many of these things than government mandates
1977553 a very big energy deal that involves climate change and oil security together

1977565 global warming is undoubtedly one of the most important problems of the contemporary world global warming defies all of the worlds traditional boundaries including geographical racial gender and religious boundaries global warming has bound the whole human race with a universal rope of fear and anxiety
1977566 it means global warming has not only posed a grave danger to the artists primary sources of inspiration the beauty of nature and the splendor of culture but also to the lives of the artists themselves as members of the human race

1977572 if you asked me to make a list of the six nuttiest people there bruce wouldnt even hit it
1977573 i wish i could control the thoughts in my mind
1977574 its hard enough sometimes controlling my behavior when im being eaten alive inside i always try to put on a good front here at work and at home
1977575 i get incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and theres nothing i can do until they go away either by themselves or with drugs
1977576 he said well they told my family that i was a murderer
1977577 what he said was my therapist is revealing all my private conversations to the fbi
1977578 somewhat prone to hyperbole when you talked with him youd have to sift through what he was saying to get to the truth of it
1977579 one glass of wine and it would make him really goofy
1977580 bruce was like the guy that was yelling at the top of his lungs
1977581 he loved it and we liked to have him there
1977582 he was very clumsy and could not hit the broad side of a barn
1977583 the picture sometimes gets painted that he was some sort of timothy mcveigh type person
1977584 he liked to be with people he liked to be part of the group
1977585 bruce has been an absolute manic basket case the last few days
1977586 im the other half of bruce when he lets me out
1977587 our original aims are still valid because he may be re elected in 2011
1977588 can you assert the contrary now nobody knows in a clear way what is going to happen and this is a source of great anxiety and uncertainty
1977589 we dont know exactly what they have in mind it has been their custom to manage this country in a secret way mimicking a gang more than a responsible government
1977590 i dont think that this young man from the popular point of view has any chance to rule egypt this is clear but from the authorities point of view the issue is different
1977591 we are a news label on paper and on the computer now we are also on your mobile phone

1977607 there are similarities in that they are people who are demonstrating for what they believe in and they are doing so in a way that draws attention to them from the media and from the forces of the state
1977608 on monday i saw police stopping vehicles on the road near the camp and the police as in 1984 and 1985 have no right to do this to these people but they get away with it because they are in a uniform
1977609 the people at the climate camp have my sympathies in that they have a right to demonstrate
1977610 i agree with their campaign for a cleaner environment policy and agree that we should be putting an end to nuclear power i do not agree with stopping coal power
1977611 i am saying that we can use clean coal by removing the co2 by using a process called carbon capture and i think that we can fit kingsnorth and any other coal fired power stations with the technology to do this that way we can extract all of the oil and gas we need from coal just like we did during the war without hurting the environment it will also allow us to use up all of the coal supplies that we have that will last us for 1 000 years
1977612 i am saying that it can work the problem is that we are not seeing the government invest in the way they should be in carbon capture so that it can be achieved
1977613 it shut because the coal reserves were exhausted but it made a profit every year since it was bought by the miners who worked there it proved that we were right and the government was wrong coal mining could make money

1977616 the increased acceptance of greener vehicles such as hybrid and electric vehicles is to be encouraged they have an important role in improving fuel economy and reducing emissions our technology increases pedestrian safety while retaining the cars environmental benefits
1977617 we need to look at ways of ensuring the safety of pedestrians we welcome innovative solutions which address this
1977618 blind and partially sighted people use the noise of oncoming traffic as a cue for when it is safe to cross a road if a quiet hybrid electric vehicle is approaching then they will no longer have this cue and are immediately put at risk
1977619 we recognise the environmental benefits of these vehicles however more consideration needs to be given to the safety implications to visually impaired pedestrians

1977759 i can only speculate as to why the media would remove the threat against bush in these accounts is it because it is harder to portray obama as the victim when he isnt the only one threatened or just harder to sell the meme that the offender is probably a murderous racist when he threatens a white president as well

1977776 in a stunning upset the jets finalized a trade wednesday night for packers legend brett favre
1977777 the jets stunning acquisition of favre makes them matter again on the new york football landscape
1977778 the jets want to win the super bowl this year and they made the boldest move imaginable to get it done that is the ultimate takeaway from the stunning news that the jets have acquired brett favre in a trade with the green bay packers
1977779 the stunning news that brett favre has been traded to the jets puts a fitting end to the teams 1991 draft day debacle
1977780 the jets have pulled off one of the most stunning trades in their history
1977781 the jets have pulled off their greatest quarterback coup since luring joe namath to the afl when he left alabama in 1965
1977782 he gives the jets their biggest star since namath gives the jets their best chance to overcome bill belichick and tom brady makes them a legitimate super bowl contender
1977783 the minute favre shows up he transforms the jets from a good team to a team that will not be afraid to knock on the door of greatness
1977784 they made the only trade that could possibly transform them into a better team than the new england patriots
1977785 the trade instantly catapults the jets in the short term to the top of the sports entertainment heap where for countless years they have been behind the yankees the giants the mets and even the lowly knicks
1977786 he already rescued one sickly green franchise from the morbid miasma of mediocrity can he do it again
1977787 they sure could use the fuzzy grizzled face of an old gunslinger to take the sting away from psl high noon at their next ok corral
1977788 its not that the cost of a conditional draft choice is unreasonable its where are the jets in two years there was arm enough left in favre last year to win 13 games and a playoff contest but after all he has been through all he has put himself through does he have enough heart left for the game to make this more than just a late wild swing by the jets for some attention
1977789 brett favre does not put the jets into the super bowl and favre does not just show up in a different kind of football green and make the jets better than the patriots or the chargers or even the colts he does not make eric mangini into a real genius or prove that mike tannenbaum the young general manager has the game to make the jets a real contender in their conference or in their sport what favre does is make the jets a team to watch again and that is enough for now

1977804 arack obama s first and most grievous mistake was to make the campaign about himself the people became the mere backdrop for his mass rallies no real organizer mints a presidential seal describes himself as the symbol of a generation believes he is the one and makes himself the object of ridicule no real organizer insults the masses as gun toting bible clinging ignoramuses at a fundraiser attended by billionaires in san francisco not a single experienced mass agitator would ever dream of extolling the values of arugula and upbraid the workers for their ignorance of tire pressures what kind of alinsky style organizer reminds people of his sacramental nature repetitively monotonically and deadeningly memo to obama a tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag a real organizer works in small settings amplifying exhorting putting others on the stage he doesn t work in front of large crowds and from the front pages of newspapers and if it is objected that nobody can become president of the united states that way the answer is that community organizers don t want to become presidents they want to be organizers john boyd was a genius of a different sort from saul alinsky
1977805 boyd versus alinsky classical values has a wonderful post which examines the performance of barack obama s campaign in the context of saul alinsky s famous rules for radicals classical values attributes the decline in bho s recent poll numbers to john mccain s application of john boyd s ooda loop strategy he writes well he has gone after mccain in particular and the republicans in general mccain blunted the attack and counter attacked republicans are not buying it at all mccain the fighter pilot has gotten inside obama s ooda loop something the navy teaches fighter pilots to do the ooda loop often called boyd s cycle is a creation of col john boyd usaf ret col boyd was a student of tactical operations and observed a similarity in many battles and campaigns he noted that in many of the engagements one side presented the other with a series of unexpected and threatening situations with which they had not been able to keep pace the slower side was eventually defeated what col boyd observed was the fact that conflicts are time competitive elections are nothing if they are not time competitive evidently the freezing of the opponent that alinsky recommends has not worked on mccain he was not frozen once that happened mccain was operating inside obama s decision loop evidently boyd is beating alinsky or to put it another way the fighter pilot is beating the community organizer as a navy man myself i m not surprised

1977823 perhaps the high profile of this raid will lead to more scrutiny
1977824 was conducted responsibly given what deputies and officers knew at the time
1977825 in some quarters this has been viewed as a flawed police operation and an attack on the mayor which it is not
1977826 this was about an address this was about a name on a package and in fact our people did not know that this was the home of the mayor and his family until after the fact
1977827 please name an actual drug raid where given what the police knew going in they would have been disciplined for switching to dynamic entry

1977836 the two parties announced on march 27 an agreement to collaborate in managing web traffic and to work together to address network management and content distribution
1977837 this matter would have had a better chance on appeal if we had put the horse before the cart and conducted a rulemaking issued rules and then enforced them the majoritys view of its ability to adjudicate this matter solely pursuant to ancillary authority is legally deficient as well under the analysis set forth in the order the commission apparently can do anything so long as it frames its actions in terms of promoting the internet or broadband deployment

1977846 god commonly first manifested himself in a way which was terrible and then by those things that were comfortable
1977847 which should be enough with christians who are willing to have the word of god rather than their own philosophy and experiences and conjectures as their sufficient and sure guide in things of this nature
1977848 nor does the spirit of god proceed discernibly in the steps of a particular established scheme one half so often as is imagined
1977849 there are no other principles which human nature is under the influence of that will ever make men conscientious but one of those two fear or love and therefore if one of these should not prevail as the other decays gods people when fallen into dead and carnal frames when love is asleep would be lamentably exposed indeed and therefore god has wisely ordained that these two opposite principles of love and fear should rise and fall like the two opposite scales of a balance when one rises the other sinks
1977850 fear is cast out by the spirit of god no other way than by the prevailing of love nor is fear ever maintained but when love is asleep
1977851 i was first exposed to the idea of love and fear being equal and opposing by john piper and have spent a lot of time thinking about it
1977852 experience plainly shows that gods spirit is unsearchable and untraceable in some of the best of christians in the method of his operations in their conversion nor does the spirit of god proceed discernibly in the steps of a particular established scheme one half so often as is imagined

1977868 you will be a part of our country and well keep bombing you till your grateful for that fact
1977869 russians are the bad guys so the georgians must be the good guys plus theyre pro western
1977870 oh no russias poor defenseless neighbors are being oppressed again
1977871 what are the implications of this conflict for the broader region i e turkey armenia possibly iran
1977872 russias president earlier promised to defend his citizens in south ossetia moscows defence ministry said more than 10 of its peacekeeping troops in south ossetia had been killed and 30 wounded in the georgian offensive at least 15 civilians are also reported dead
1977873 georgia accuses russia of arming the separatists moscow denies the claim
1977874 it wont happen obviously but the ioc should condemn the russian attack and send its delegation of athletes home using a global festival of sport as a cover for a nationalistic land grab and the murder of civilians is disgusting
1977875 immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovreign georgian territory
1977876 while i know the olympics and particularly the ioc falls far short of its ideals sport and politics should be separate

1977879 it is many years since british historians felt comfortable in celebrating their countrys triumphs once upon a time britains incontestable naval and commercial supremacy in 1815 would have been explained as the predestined fruit of national virtue religious truth and political freedom among professional historians all three explanations would nowadays arouse varying degrees of amusement distaste and embarrassment but no modern consensus of opinion has emerged to replace them for many years the tendency has been to ignore or belittle the fact as well as the consequences of british naval supremacy not many would go so far as to dismiss it outright as a convenient myth or imply that napoleon won the napoleonic war but a number of intellectual strategies have been devised to ignore it

1977882 the state has no reason nor moral right to bar anyone entry to canada just because they dont like what he she might say or think
1977883 the logical next step is now to extend the border checks and the entry forms with questions such as do you or do you not believe in a tax payer funded womans right to abortion as a basic human right do you or do you not believe in socialized healthcare do you or do you not believe in the superiority of multi culturalism do you or do you not believe in unlimited state oppression provided the state considers it appropriate do you or do you not consider catastrophic agw to be a fact do you or do you not totally admire the un and the proud canadian heritage of peacekeeping note if you answered no to any of the above questions you may be barred from entry into canada

1977885 canada or any other sovereign state is perfectly entitled to determine which foreign nationals will or will not be granted entry and under what conditions
1977886 as over the top as your example is if canada wanted to it would be completely within its rights to ask such questions
1977887 in a perfect world and forgetting about the costs involved they should be permitted access to canada

1977890 the first question i asked john mccain and then barack obama was how do you feel about the tone and direction of the campaign so far
1977891 no surprise both men pronounced themselves thoroughly frustrated by the personal bitterness and negativism they have seen in the two months since they learned they would be running against each other
1977892 behind the accusations from both sides in the last 24 hours
1977893 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills

1977902 i dont think theres much doubt about the fact that theyve been galvanised
1977903 collingwood supporters are generally very galvanised in regard to the way theyre perceived anyway you love collingwood or you hate collingwood
1977904 its been a difficult week but i reckon the boys have handled it pretty well
1977905 theyve moved on very well ive been delighted with the way theyve been able to handle it
1977906 people are very resilient and the other thing about it is we dont want to lose sight of what were here for were here to play football which we are doing tomorrow evening
1977907 the player group got themselves very much focused on that very early in the week and theyve continued to do that up to training today
1977908 its one of those weeks that happens in football but its only how big its been with the press
1977909 inside its been one which we would prefer behind us which it is
1977910 we move forward we open a door for young players its fantastic
1977911 theyre two exciting young players who perhaps have surprised us all about their development over the last few weeks
1977912 i think it would be fair to say that chris dawes as a young man before he did his knee was always thought of as a key position player
1977913 as a consequence to doing the knee we were able to pick him up pretty cheaply we thought
1977914 hes a highly intelligent young man who i think will be down the track a fairly good partner in playing in the forward line with travis cloke and ben reid and sean rusling
1977915 and johnnie mccarthy is a kid who is very dedicated to wanting to be a good footballer
1977916 i hope they can stay in the side the next four weeks and if they can do that and play good enough football who knows they may be in the side for the rest of the year if we manage to make the finals
1977917 i doubt mundine expected him to read out the entire list of excuses he had prepared for him

1977922 yahoo strongly believes that consumers want choice when customizing their online experience and they have also demonstrated a strong preference for advertising that is more personally relevant to them
1977923 however we understand that there are some users who prefer not to receive customized advertising and this opt out will offer them even greater choice

1977925 the code will stop working after five uses so use it quickly update the free pass has now gone

1977933 oh and by the way this looks a little different as we pre process it with a magic rails action
1977934 this php version proves that it is not necessary to add constants to css
1977935 the other implementation is written in php it proves that it is not necessary to add constants to css just like the existence of the webkit implementation cannot be taken as proof that constants in css are useful so the php implementation cannot prove that either but the php implementation has the benefit of letting authors determine the usefulness for themselves without modifying css on the web

1977994 yesterday i linked to a story about the discovery by jonathan zdziarski of a remote blacklist apple is maintaining supposedly according to zdziarski to remotely disable rogue iphone apps previously distributed through the app store
1977995 but the story seems fishy there may well be some sort of kill switch that apple can deploy to remotely disable an app that s already installed but this list is not it
1977996 apple has no reason to hide such a configuration in a sneaky place
1977997 an informed source at apple confirmed to me that the clbl in the url stands for core location blacklist and that it does just that

1978025 after tonight there are eleven games left in the regular season i dont think complacency will set in when were not even half way through the season
1978026 if one man makes their defense then i feel sorry for them theyd better put him in some bubble wrap or somethin and make sure he stays healthy but um i dont really know what it is i think its the o line and our receivers comin off the ball blocking if you look at the film its obvious it wasnt nothin spectacular about it its not like they were running out of my way or something like that they were playing football we were playing football and we won the battle sorry we couldnt lay down and give them their 60 yard average but we got games to win
1978027 all those yards he got last game hes not getting those this game
1978028 the tx sa806x is the natural follow up to last months tx sa706x announcement but then onkyo went and broke the naming convention with the tx na906x receiver thats some kind of marketing
1978029 in the culmination of a racially fraught congressional campaign in memphis a black candidate is linking her liberal leaning white primary opponent in thursdays contest representative steve cohen to the ku klux klan in a television advertisement
1978030 yesterday i posted about a democrat candidate down in tennessee who has been running ads against her also democrat opponent that ask why he a jew was in our churches campaigning because apparently jews shouldn t be allowed in the churches of good christian people anyway the new york times decided to report the story as well the problem they put 662 words into an article about these two democrats and didn t actually use the word democrat even once convenient no if this were a republican running race baiting ads in the south his her party affiliation would have been mentioned in the headline
1978031 these are sad sad people trying desperately to medicate their self loathing by imposing it on others
1978032 the colourful war boosting paper attacks liberal leader stephane dion on a daily basis
1978033 the posts texas style ideology has been a nice fit for alberta but it has trouble finding a growing audience

1978035 where exactly are these stories going to come from when the gray lady is laid to rest
1978036 after all 30 of conservative taxpayers are forced to support it
1978037 well im on this show hence the dude with the camera
1978038 so its like that im just some slut im just a wrapper to be thrown away after youve eaten the yodel
1978039 no no we cant do this later mocking i want to do this now
1978040 i wasnt put off by it being in the national enquirer i was worried it if it was true
1978041 sometimes people who read news on the web are frustrated by what they see as our sluggishness
1978042 hes forfeited the luxury of not speaking to this and wed like him to come forward and address this
1978043 i cant tell you whats going on here hes usually someone whos very accessible
1978044 he was very polite he just said he wasnt able to get into it and briskly walked to the car
1978045 were trying to verify the allegation to the extent that we can but were also trying to find concrete fallout from it
1978046 im two bucks short can i give it to you tomorrow
1978047 i just installed a new hard drive in my g4 laptop and put the old hard drive into a usb enclosure installed leopard and after making sure the computer would boot properly i used migration assistant to move my old account from the usb drive now all my applications are there but the account name i moved does not show up in the login screen when i go to system preferences gt accounts the account shows up in a section called groups
1978048 i dont know any information beyond that whether they plan to charge for it
1978049 now i dont want anyone to panic but i would recommend you head on over to the itunes store more cowbell
1978050 we see solid growth for the prominent apple 3g iphone driven notably by its evolving economics iphone now unlocked greater subsidies leading to lower retail price and no geographic exclusivity
1978051 people really are selling their talent in a way that can make them money
1978052 they really know that if they work with the government theyll benefit
1978053 what information consumes is rather obvious it consumes the attention of its recipients a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention

1978055 a new version of apples iphone software could provide iphone and ipod touch users with access to their home computers entire itunes media library while on the go without having to first download those media items through a traditional sync a new company filing patent application has revealed
1978056 the cupertino based electronics maker notes that downloading media items from a computer to a media player is often a time consuming process and one that is limited by the players storage capacity therefore users who are out and about sometimes find themselves without access to some of their content which sits inaccessible on their home mac or pc
1978057 new versions itunes and the iphone software could theoretically eliminate this problem by syncing only the metadata or tiny files containing the barebones attributes of each media item or playlist but not the content itself from a users itunes library to their portable devices
1978058 you need to understand that this year and this last four weeks is crucial in the survival of the football club
1978059 even though we had this big night on tuesday dont think that this job is over
1978060 we have a 5 million debt that we need to deal with this year
1978061 if we let it go on this year or the year after we will lose that much pace with the rest its not funny
1978062 this is really serious and i ask you and i plead with all of you that if you can give us something to help us survive this year so we can get back on track it will go a long way
1978063 if we can start next year without this crippling interest payment hanging on our ankles then well be able to get back in the game and will be a lot closer to getting back in the black and well do it fast
1978064 i loved rons words when he said melbourne will either survive in this town or it will not survive at all and thats the line ive taken
1978065 for anyone out there i will not be part of this football club if we need to move or merge
1978066 i doubt mundine expected him to read out the entire list of excuses he had prepared for him
1978067 this time you successfully avoided calling league rugby and confusing the hell out of everyone
1978068 run the business like youre going to own it forever
1978069 i too started having this problem over the weekend i thought it had something to do with my daughter activating spaces on my computer in my absence ie perhaps the missing apps were in other spaces but this does not seem to be the case upon reactivating and checking other spaces which are empty
1978070 the typical downloadable price for digital only games on pc is actually 19 99
1978071 should probably expect our pc pricing to always be slightly higher than the console equivalent in this digital distribution space
1978072 at this time capcom entertainment inc has not officially released a release dat
1978073 number of transistors that can be inexpensively placed on an integrated circuit is increasing exponentially doubling approximately every two years
1978074 things are going to get twice as efficient every two years
1978075 as newer tools mature their popularity may increase but in person communication likely will remain the most reliable way to keep employees connected informed and motivated
1978076 microsoft knows of the exploits existence but hasnt been given a private briefing
1978077 i saw this app with a few friends and we jokingly clicked buy thinking it was a joke to see what would happen
1978078 this is no joke do not buy this app and apple please remove this from the app store
1978079 he has not been given an official reason for the takedown
1978080 i saw this app with a few friends and we jokingly clicked buy thinking it was a joke to see what would happen
1978081 this is no joke do not buy this app and apple please remove this from the app store
1978082 well i dont think it is worth the money i paid
1978083 used that control of the form factor the interaction design the operating system and the software development environment to create a simple intuitive user experience and because apple controls the platform it is able to iterate improve the experience and introduce new features or applications more quickly than other handset makers
1978084 as a result a wide range of software companies have been scrambling to build new iphone applications
1978085 an online grab bag of games books friend finder tools and hundreds of other software applications designed to make the iphone more fun and useful
1978086 yeah but i liked them it before they it were was cool
1978087 yeah but i liked them it before they it were was cool
1978088 i used to hate on hipsters back when it was still cool
1978089 prestige has shifted from the producer of art to the aggregator and the appraiser
1978090 aspects of this are splendid some of it is a bit meh but ultimately the meh stuff doesnt quite undermine the splendid
1978091 hey were all part of group x and were awesome
1978092 fonelink 2 1 supports more than 70 cell phones from sony ericsson including the latest models
1978093 the software features a bluetooth assistant to pair a phone to the macintosh computer in one step
1978094 htcs first phone based on googles android mobile os has not only been set back but may be part of a greater shift away from the linux based platform says global equities research analyst trip chowdhry
1978095 the taiwan area cellphone maker is not only described as encountering structural problems adding features google wants in the phone as a showcase for android but is allegedly holding up the launch with demands for a minimum payout that chowdhry interprets as a lack of confidence in androids success
1978096 more concerning may be a shift in developer support the researcher says despite androids open source foundation google is reportedly struggling to encourage development of apps and is losing potential candidates to apples recently launched iphone software development kit as well as other mobile offerings
1978097 were sorry you found out about it you cant have it we have nothing to say about when you might get a newer version
1978098 is losing potential candidates to apples recently launched iphone software development kit as well as other mobile offerings
1978099 hey lets screw around in this market too it looks like a good business opportunity or something whatever were google im sure well bring the world revolution without trying
1978100 steve is always looking prophetic he can alter the entire tech industry through sheer force of will afterall
1978101 in the 1960s a mafia don was only as strong as his family
1978102 we found the hierarchical culture of organized crime intriguing running an organized crime family in a world defined by family loyalty is something that we felt could introduce a new strategic element to the genre that is what the dons view is all about laying out a strategy to pick off the competition one by one the dons view is so unique it could fundamentally change the rules of open world games by blending action and strategy to create something entirely new
1978103 seriously looking at launching the iphone at the end of august or early september
1978104 they would have played a bit of footy coming up with those two matches against argentina and new zealand
1978105 they are world champions and they will have their backs up theyve gone quite well so far this year
1978106 its a good opportunity for us and one that i dare say we will be up for
1978107 with the all blacks it seemed that everything they did turned into points and they profited from it whereas whenever we tried to be positive it didnt quite come off and then they profited again from the turnover or the ensuing phase
1978108 there was some glaringly obvious things that we can improve the breakdown some of our set piece and probably our kicking accuracy
1978109 they are the things we work on all the time so drastic changes dont need to be made so that we can turn around
1978110 its a good opportunity for us and one that i dare say we will be up for
1978111 motivation but they need to lose that mentality of being satisfied by just winning the home games only as spiro points out deans approach is key here and fortunately he has a good track record
1978112 the wallabies will not win at ellis park the boks could win that game on adrenalin alone
1978113 im not wrirting off the all blacks its just that i feel better all black sides than this have failed to win in south africa so if the boks perform im sure theyll pull it through
1978114 i doubt mundine expected him to read out the entire list of excuses he had prepared for him
1978115 this time you successfully avoided calling league rugby and confusing the hell out of everyone
1978116 we prefer him djite to play games at his club to get a place in the team
1978117 we keep every player in mind i have enough strikers for the south africa game we have contact with him we know he is doing well we know he is happy we know he has to work hard
1978118 as far as i know at the end of august viduka will probably be fit enough to start playing games
1978119 thats probably not enough time to go for the qualification game in uzbekistan and timmy thats the same situation
1978120 so i dont think we can use those players on the september game but we always have hope and well see whats going on in the next four weeks
1978121 hes very willing to be a part of the socceroos again
1978122 its always good to have a more experienced player back in your squad
1978123 its important now when a new season starts that the a league can start with full strength squads
1978124 i doubt mundine expected him to read out the entire list of excuses he had prepared for him
1978125 this time you successfully avoided calling league rugby and confusing the hell out of everyone
1978126 we think weve got a great opportunity to deploy the wimax networks and to provide an opportunity to upsell them customers on other products and services that could increase arpu and increase stickiness
1978127 we can take advantage of the infrastructure we already have
1978128 seo rumors never stop and one of them has it that noarchive used to be a red flag i personally dont think so officially google also states theres nothing wrong with webmasters using the tag
1978129 microsoft has announced that datacontractserializer in version net35 sp1 will no more require class attributes datacontract and datamember finally however it is intersting that datacontractserializer implementation in silverlight already does not require datacontract and datamember attributes on classes which have to be serialized
1978130 but it also means no rifle shot tax breaks for big oil it means no line items for hydrogen no mandates for other renewable fuels and no big government debacles like the plant it means ethanol entrepreneurs get a level playing field to make their case and earn their profits
1978131 the swing states of pennsylvania ohio virginia and colorado are all among the top coal producers
1978132 when he talks about it hell say think how many jobs that means right here in ohio
1978133 notably barack obama too supports clean coal technology though hes become more chided by environmentalists
1978134 the first time in north america that man made co 2 destined for atmospheric release is instead pumped deep into the earth where it might potentially be sequestered for thousands or even millions of years
1978135 we are very excited to introduce linuxjournal com readers to the mobile version increased accessibility will allow us to reach a broader readership and will afford our readers the convenience of reading linux journal anywhere which has become essential in todays increasingly mobile lifestyle
1978136 today i deleted entourage and will use ical instead why does entourage keep popping up though under my list of calendars i have deleted this calendar in ical by right clicking on it and deleting it it keeps popping up
1978137 the users desktop must load before the user has time to call technical support and or buy the xbox 360 version of the game
1978138 i dont give a fuck what they call it im calling it the revolution
1978139 apple has spit out a pit in its itunes app store a controversial 999
1978140 a glance thursday of the store showed no offering for i am rich created by someone named armin heinrich the app displays a glowing red gem on a users iphone screen for the sole purpose of proving to onlookers one is of the moneyed class
1978141 but on wednesday when the app was present in the itunes store a little pop up message told us i am rich is not available for sale to u s residents
1978142 i am rich isnt the most clever piece of art but its not bad either for some the iphone is already an obvious display of wealth and i am rich is commenting on that plus buying more than you need as an indication of wealth is practically an american core value for a growing segment of the population is paying 5000 for a wristwatch or 50 000 for a car when much cheaper alternatives exist really all that different than paying 1000 for an iphone app
1978143 excluding i am rich would be excluding for taste because some feel that it costs too much for what it does app store shoppers should get to make the choice of whether or not to buy an iphone app not apple particularly since the app store is the only way to legitimately purchase consumer iphone apps imagine if apple chose which music they stocked in the itunes store based on the companys taste no kanye because jay z is better no dylan because its too whiney of course they dont do that they stock a crapload of different music and let the buyer decide we should deride apple for that type of behavior not cheering them on
1978144 he likely made a 5000 10000 profit in the few hours
1978145 apple must do whatever is necessary to buy off at amp t ma bell is killing the iphone
1978146 twice last week the macs daddy debuted and then pulled a tethering application called netshare from the digital shelves of its app store as of monday software developer nullriver said that email problems on both ends led to the interruptions
1978147 really i find that barely plausible at best it seems more likely to me that at amp t objected to what netshare does
1978148 tethering allows a cell phones connections to the web to be shared with other devices netshare would allow a macbook to plug into at amp ts 3g network when wi fi is unavailable alas ma bells iphone usage terms prohibit exactly this sort of activity
1978149 tethering is an extra at amp t sells it for 15 a month to customers whose use motorola nokia and research in motion handsets but not to iphone users like me
1978150 think about the consequences of that apple may have just blunted innovation on the iphone for the sake of a partner that wants to sell more stuff
1978151 apple should use whatever portion of its 20 billion war chest is necessary to buy off at amp t and escape from their exclusive iphone deal only then will the iphone grow to be the pervasive platform that the company and its investors desire
1978152 apple would have to use a different 3g chip for use in th us with other carriers att uses a gsm based 3g
1978153 what the hell does this guy think would happen if verizon carries the iphone does he believe that they would be more willing to allow this kind of thing
1978154 tim beyers mdn are the type that bring one girl to a party and leave with another
1978155 it was a tough decision for all of us because the state law and the federal law are at odds
1978156 they let them go with just a warning but i am tempted to join the non pot head community doesnt want to live in an experiment to see what happens if amp when we fully legalize it
1978157 if youre convicted of a crime you should be punished but that we are sending far too many first time nonviolent drug users to prison for very long periods of time and that we should rethink those laws
1978158 i smoke to get high and do not understand that medical patients dont smoke to get high
1978159 well itll be fine once merck puts their name on it and charges 300 an ounce
1978160 whatever you just want to be sent to a nursing home so you can toddle around in a walker
1978161 but i am tempted to join the non pot head community doesnt want to live in an experiment to see what happens if amp when we fully legalize it
1978162 the asp for mac desktops is more than 1 000 greater than for windows pcs and mac desktop asps were higher in june than they were two years ago
1978163 heres how the midrange imac and dell inspiron 518 compare based on apple store and dell online pricing
1978164 if apple is going to continue its market share gains or simply maintain that 8 5 percent u s share prices must go down and configurations bulk up the math is simply undeniable
1978165 wilcox writes if apple is going to continue its market share gains or simply maintain that 8 5 percent u s share prices must go down and configurations bulk up the math is simply undeniable
1978166 refined to the point where it delivers only pure unadulterated gaming bliss
1978167 a feeling of energized focus full involvement and success in the process of the activity
1978168 what weve found is that advertisers and agencies are only interested in professional media so professional content providers are having a good time finding extremely high demand because they have a lack of video views
1978169 now that the phone is affordable enough for a wider audience a new status symbol has emerged a seemingly useless application called i am rich
1978170 its function is exactly what the name implies to alert people that you have money in the bank
1978171 apple apparently had some problems with i am rich after initially approving it for distribution the company has since removed it from the store heinrich a german software developer has yet to hear back from apple concerning the removal i have no idea why they did it and am not aware of any violation of the rules to sell software on the app store heinrich said in an e mail with the times today
1978172 but apple couldnt pull it down before curious aristocrats eight of them had purchased it
1978173 in the e mail heinrich said there seemed to be a market for the program
1978174 is paying 5000 for a wristwatch or 50 000 for a car when much cheaper alternatives exist really all that different than paying 1000 for an iphone app
1978175 and a stupid app like this makes all us fanboys look bad if my son or daughter were to click on this app i would really be upset with apple thanks apple i for one appreciate it
1978176 if you spend the dough on an m3 because you really love to drive and utilize capabilities beyond those of a kia then more power to you if you dropped the dough on a porsche with auto transmission youre probably just a dick with security issues and theres a big difference between the two
1978177 as listed in the console we especially want to know if any operation takes longer than 200ms this information will be used to increase fruitmenus loading speed in the future
1978178 my first thought is that articles like this are nothing new
1978179 one more point i noticed something interesting with the comparison the author compared a mid range tower box to the imac it would seem to me that the computer to compare the imac to would be the xps one and it would seem that the dell all in one costs more than the dell tower imagine that i guess that maybe engineering might cost you a bit more and the new studio hybrid cost about the same as a mac mini
1978180 you have to take into account the software included not the crapware that comes on a peecee and what kind of service you get for that money apple is consistently the best in service surveys
1978181 nobody complains that a bmw costs more than a chevrolet well im sure someone does but not reasonable people now if you equip that chevrolet when possible with the equivalent options to the bmw then you might end up in the same ballpark or maybe paying even more
1978182 same with macs and pcs compare apples to apples pun intended
1978183 macbook 13 3 listing at 1300 2 4 ghz core 2 duo 2gb ram 160gb hd dual layer superdrive
1978184 to get that at dell youre paying 900 on sale right now
1978185 its so encouraging and pleasing to see that result tonight thats what they did i thought our boys were absolutely fantastic in just playing footy the way we want to play it
1978186 we know melbourne arent the best side in the competition we knew where they were but it was so important for us to stick to our task and we did that
1978187 i am very pleased very proud and love watching this group of boys play
1978188 some people might have turned the tv off tonight but if i was coming to a game of football i wouldnt leave watching this team play the way they played tonight
1978189 they could have dropped off after a big two weeks but something inside them they didnt want to drop off
1978190 it was a level we couldnt even match from the first minute to the last minute
1978191 they geelong used the ball well and they moved the ball quickly
1978192 they were intent and the first quarter was all about them and it was almost boys playing against men bigger bodies around the ball better decisions kicking easy goals in conditions that were slippery
1978193 it was incredibly disappointing on a very important night for the melbourne football club they really made us look second rate
1978194 i doubt mundine expected him to read out the entire list of excuses he had prepared for him
1978195 this time you successfully avoided calling league rugby and confusing the hell out of everyone
1978196 hows this for the ultimate digital age small business irony want the best possible environment for microsoft office try running it on a mac
1978197 the apple line of personal computers and peripherals offers the small enterprise a tantalizing if frustrating set of risks and rewards macs used as they are intended in their full 64 bit glory are blazingly fast integration of the intel processing chips and other bits of electronics the popularity of the iphone and the ipod and the emergence of virtual desktop environments such as vmware means the berlin wall between all things mac and all things pc is nowhere near as treacherous as it was just a few years ago
1978198 but turning the newly plays nice with others mac into a real roi generator in your shop is no slam dunk if youre accustomed to working with windows machines
1978199 in several months of side by side testing of imacs and pcs i found that gains in speed can be offset by user confusion in mastering macs approach to the web
1978200 earlier this year the macintosh business unit one of the oldest teams at microsoft released microsoft office 2008 for mac not to be confused with microsoft office 2007 which runs on the windows vista and xp operating systems the code optimizes for macs the now ubiquitous line of word excel powerpoint and e mail and calendaring tools for the mac entourage takes the place of outlook for the most part office 2008 for mac simply emulates office 2007 for the pc but in my testing this riff on the microsoft flagship flourishes in the current apple os x leopard environment
1978201 if you see margins in being super efficient in the digital domain and you have to guts and the means to make it work i would invest the time in seeing if office 2008 for mac is for you
1978202 the microsoft flagship flourishes in the current apple os x leopard environment
1978203 in several months of side by side testing of imacs and pcs i found that gains in speed can be offset by user confusion in mastering macs approach to the web
1978204 this week at the black hat security conference two security researchers will discuss their findings which could completely bring windows vista to its knees
1978205 mark dowd of ibm internet security systems iss and alexander sotirov of vmware inc have discovered a technique that can be used to bypass all memory protection safeguards that microsoft built into windows vista these new methods have been used to get around vistas address space layout randomization aslr data execution prevention dep and other protections by loading malicious content through an active web browser the researchers were able to load whatever content they wanted into any location they wished on a users machine using a variety of scripting languages such as java activex and even net objects this feat was achieved by taking advantage of the way that internet explorer and other browsers handle active scripting in the operating system
1978206 while this may seem like any standard security hole other researchers say that the work is a major breakthrough and there is very little that microsoft can do to fix the problems
1978207 this stuff just takes a knife to a large part of the security mesh microsoft built into vista said dai zovi to searchsecurity
1978208 these techniques are being seen as an advance that many in the security community say will have far reaching implications not only for microsoft but also on how the entire technology industry thinks about attacks
1978209 if you think about the fact that net loads dlls into the browser itself and then microsoft assumes theyre safe because theyre net objects you see that microsoft didnt think about the idea that these could be used as stepping stones for other attacks
1978210 if they knew in the early 1990s what we know now about what windows has become would business still have chosen windows
1978211 if they new they were lied to would they have voted for the war
1978212 im honored to shake the hand of a brave iraqi citizen who had his hand cut off by saddam hussein
1978213 according to dino dai zovi a popular security researcher the genius of this is that its completely reusable
1978214 lowest approval ratings you mean congress they are in single digits
1978215 a retarded coke head good ol boy with the lowest approval rating in u
1978216 do i enjoy the fact that theyre making record profits while ordinary americans are bent over their cars and wallet raped with a fuel nozzle every time they fill up
1978217 ah yes a congress with nancy pelosi who apparently is so intent on saving the world that even if gas reached 10 a gallon they would not lift the oil drilling moratorium
1978218 please dont compare bush to people that are above him not ever again
1978219 the economy is growing productivity is high trade is up people are working its not as good as wed like but and to the extent that we find weakness well move
1978220 in one line you insulted retards coke heads good ol boys every president to have an approval rating and god
1978221 14 99 represents an appropriate price for the platform and you should probably expect our pc pricing to always be slightly higher than the console equivalent in this space
1978222 at this time capcom entertainment inc has not officially released a release dat
1978223 built on the history of the popular eurotaac authorware and elearning conference eels is bigger and better than ever before with quality presentations from elearning professionals sourced from across europe eels has detailed and up to date information useful to all elearning professionals from educational designers and developers through to managers educators and corporate planners
1978224 if only this show existed 5 years ago when i was trying to learn flash authoring
1978225 youre not kidding robin though i think you mean to say whhhoooorrrres
1978226 weve seen some research that says 60 percent of people who bought a wii fit play it once and dont play it again so we have to get the balance right because what we are doing is bringing new consumers into the market for the first time in their lives sometimes and we have to treat them with respect
1978227 what nintendo have done with the wii is truly fantastic there is no question about it but i think sometimes there is a thin line between gimmick and great gameplay
1978228 at the end of the day that comes back down to creativity they are not good if they are gimmicks there is a challenge for us to make sure that all new user interfaces are deep and are rewarding to the end user
1978229 if you look a what people dont like about existing karaoke games its that youve got wired microphones which look like theyve come out of a toy shop and a fairly restricted song base

1978232 the iphone keeps eating into the potential service opportunities carriers and others are trying to create
1978233 the response to the app store has been dramatic enough that others will have to come up with one of their own
1978234 i dont think the doors closed on a crackdown sequel
1978235 obviously right now were tied up with apb and everything else but hopefully in the future well have the resource and something can be worked out with microsoft
1978236 we would have loved to have seen it we poured five years of our lives into that game
1978237 but at the end of the day were a company that has to do whats best for the company weve got to stay in business and the numbers just didnt add up were not in the business of doing things because wed like to if we cant guarantee that it makes sense for the company

1978249 with this many javascript bugs in acrobat one begins to ask questions why would a full thick application like acrobat need to be using javascript especially when javascript in the browser has historically been a target for hackers and since javascript has been a target for so many years why hasnt adobe flushed out these vulnerabilities already
1978250 there is a very serious bug in the os x version of the screensaver offered for download on the dark knight website if you download it and try to install it it will convert the folder containing your download usually your downloads or desktop folder to a bundle and rename it needless to say no screensaver is installed this is very sneaky and very nasty as its hard to figure out what happened stay away from that screensaver

1978257 i hadnt considered that until i heard that last night who knows
1978258 i think people would have a lot more respect for him if he just came out and said look im just doing it for the money because thats the only thing i can see
1978259 i doubt mundine expected him to read out the entire list of excuses he had prepared for him

1978262 warner music group corp s fiscal third quarter net loss narrowed despite continued struggles with the consumer shift toward digital music
1978263 the record company reported a net loss of 9 million or six cents a share for the period ended june 30 compared with a net loss of 17 million or 12 cents a share a year earlier
1978264 revenue rose 5 5 to 848 million but declined 1 1 in constant currency domestic revenue fell 6 5 while international revenue increased 17 or 3 6 on a constant currency basis
1978265 within the recorded music segment digital revenue which now makes up 23 of segment revenue and 20 of total revenue jumped 39
1978266 in an effort to adapt with consumers shift to digital music from physical cds and better compete with apple inc s itunes which in april became the nations no 1 retailer of music warner and two other music recording companies formed a partnership in april with news corp s myspace to offer the social networking giants members a range of new music listening and merchandising features
1978267 speaker of the flop pelosi sells 2 737 copies of book
1978268 i still dont understand why the record companies just dont start their own online store with drm free music they are selling it on amazon why not do it themselves and keep allll of the profit without having to worry about drm they could be completely free of apple microsoft amazon etc etc they could set their own price structure bit rates offer 5 1 surround versions for premium pricing sell music videos etc etc is setting up an online storefront that hard
1978269 i still dont understand why the record companies just dont start their own online store with drm free music is setting up an online storefront that hard
1978270 just imagine steve jobs wandering the hall with a flame thrower in hand asking random people do you work on mobileme
1978271 i expect a bunch of friends and people i know were involved in that project and i feel really bad for them
1978272 but the reality is the thing wasnt ready and the release got botched and steve and apple arent terribly tolerant of that kind of major screwup i expect heads have rolled and there are a few tanned hides waiting for the welts to go away
1978273 someone steve jobs depended on to tell him what reality was told him it was ready to roll and steve believed him and whoever told him that was wrong and made everyone including steve and apple look bad thats not a good way to advance your career at apple
1978274 that this release was botched isnt about apple not having a clue but about the mobileme people either blowing it i can think of any number of scenarios scaling it hard
1978275 and now eddy cue has been brought in to fix it which means its going to get fixed
1978276 eddys name isnt familiar to most apple people but hes in his way as important to apples success as jonathan ives sic his specialty the back end infrastructures that make apples online universe tick his groups did the apple online store itools later mac itunes store etc etc its the not sexy part of the company but its the guts that make all of the sexy front ends actually work
1978277 apple has the expertise this isnt a case of mobileme problems crawling out into itunes but apple bringing the itunes expertise into mobileme and having thrown eddy cue at the problem thats exactly whats going to happen here
1978278 someone steve jobs depended on to tell him what reality was told him it was ready to roll and steve believed him and whoever told him that was wrong and made everyone including steve and apple look bad thats not a good way to advance your career at apple
1978279 i just dont get the big deal about mobileme being this huge disaster it was
1978280 i just dont get the big deal about mobileme being this huge disaster it was
1978281 that also makes me wonder actually does steve have a sad mac branding iron perhaps failure in apple is rewarded with the ultimate mark of shame or perhaps its an xp certified sticker for really grievous offenses
1978282 mobileme was previously under guy also responsible for ilife he should have been fired already after imovie 08
1978283 actually imovie 08 is a very capable consumer focused app its simply an example of apple being willing to innovate in the linear editing space in order to make film editing easier for newbies the point btw of the ilife suite if its underpowered for you apple has differentiated the market buy fce or fcp
1978284 on august 3 2006 the uk s mail online claimed that apple is about to launch a nano version of the hugely successful iphone it is expected to be in the shops in time for christmas the report went on to state that the product would be launched in the uk for pay as you go customers by o2 the mobile phone group owned by spain s telefonica
1978285 on august 5 2008 lehman brother analyst ben reitzes said in a research report that while he believes that apple is working on a lower end iphone form factor he didn t think it would arrive until spring 2009
1978286 yet the uk rumor may still have some legs when you consider that a prominent apple ipod and iphone accessories company by the name of digital lifestyle outfitters dlo has been working on a nano styled iphone dock
1978287 good question but i still dream of moving to phuket thailand
1978288 i wonder if the chinese make fun of our names like some of us do of theirs just a thought

1978290 the cops shot one of the dogs as it was running into a back room how threaten could they possibly have been by a fleeing dog
1978291 is it possible that here on mefi we can keep this focused on the event in question and avoid generalizing to every police officer in every department
1978292 now that someone in with power has had this happen to them perhaps well start seeing a change
1978293 its just that the fuckups are a lot more tragic when they involve someone carrying a gun
1978294 i totally pumped it with one hand kachik while walking up to them
1978295 looks to me like youre just trying to flame up the issue
1978296 how many pg county cops does it take to push a n r down a flight of stairs none he just fell
1978297 said calvo experienced police action familiar to many young black men in the county
1978298 from what i know their swat team wasnt available and thats why they were out shopping
1978299 they were dumb enough to do this to a rich white guy i thought that only happened to poor folk
1978300 order now amp well email you as soon as yours is on its way
1978301 maybe apple should build an iphone production plant here in the us to help meet demand
1978302 oh we dont have any in stock you should simply order your iphone from the apple web site
1978303 maybe apple should build an iphone production plant here in the us to help meet demand put some americans to work for a change
1978304 i was in two shops today disguised as a normal user interested in smartphones

1978309 apple inc s iphone 3g is ready to serve business customers as an alternative to the blackberry e mail phone so long as users are willing to compromise on security and battery life gartner inc said
1978310 software released last month adds support for microsoft corp s exchange corporate e mail system and offers the ability to erase data if the device is lost making apples handset acceptable for business use analyst ken dulaney said in a report released today by gartner a research firm
1978311 with the new iphone 2 0 software released when apple began selling a faster version of the phone on july 11 business users have access to a device with the most readable e mail and an excellent web browser dulaney said in stamford connecticut based gartners report
1978312 still there are inconveniences the device offers less than a full day of battery use and an insufficient amount of security to run a companys custom programs dulaney said
1978313 macdailynews take battery equip your employees with external battery packs many of which also double as protective cases for example mophie juice pack for iphone 3g can more than double iphone 3g s usage time august 05 2008 there are many other and even more on the way bulk pricing will surely be available
1978314 equip your employees with external battery packs many of which also double as protective cases
1978315 frankly the battery life isnt even a concern as its pretty much the same as windows mobile using activesync

1978323 we are accepting the fact considering that our handsets werent attractive enough
1978324 an important step in the evolution of digital music nokia s comes with music is a leading example we believe all stakeholders will benefit from the access model it presents an attractive value proposition for consumers who want to achieve a richer deeper music experience artists have the opportunity to significantly broaden their fan base record companies music publishers and artists can monetize consumer behavior across vast networks and platforms and device manufacturers can drive device purchases customer retention and data revenue by associating their devices with leading global and local artist brands and comprehensive music offerings

1978333 id rather see david lynchs house or the abode of john waters you know for a second i thought the pope was sitting in a toilet doing his thing after seeing the rest of the pictures i dont think it would have mattered much
1978334 about that as a matter of fact you neednt bother to ascertain i ascertained theyre real

1978341 justin williams even started a site as a way to showcase his fellow developers frustration with apple

1978349 apple sold 11 million ipods last year 30 of that would mean they sold 3 3 million iphones which would give them the smartphone industry on a silver platter

1978357 i am very happy today i started badly in the early laps but my bike had a really good set up so i could keep lapping in 1m26s laps then i pushed and pushed and finally i got the win
1978358 i was feeling quite comfortable for most of the race and everything was working quite well but i havent actually spent much time racing with kiyonari and wasnt sure how it was going to pan out he was very strong on the first split and when he came past i would have been very happy for second but when he did i realized he was in the same trouble as me then i saw max coming so fast and had to push really hard and it became a bit of a dogfight towards the end
1978359 im quite satisfied with the result i started good then went backwards as some other riders came through the first laps were very hard then i got into a good rhythm and overtook one by one at the end i couldnt believe i came close to these two guys but there was not enough time to try and take troy or kiyonari but it was a good race
1978360 im very happy with this weekend on friday i was in first position in qualifying then yesterday i set a good time in superpole it was the same today with fast lap times and a double win i had a lot of pressure with nori behind me and many times i made a mistake but to win here at brands hatch was fantastic today
1978361 im very happy for this result because in the first race the rear tire was not so good and i was very disappointed in the second race i just changed it and this tire gave quite a good feeling i make a battle with kiyo but he was faster than me in some places and finally i was not able to catch him but we made a really good race congratulations for kiyo
1978362 it was better than the first race when we had a few tire troubles but we made some changes to the bike which definitely improved it but there was no way i could run the pace of the guys at the front they just pulled away i had a bit of a battle with bayliss and it took me a few laps to get past him but im content with third itll do for now but im looking forward to winning races again
1978363 changes in motorcycle related head injury deaths hospitalizations and hospital charges following repeal of pennsylvanias mandatory motorcycle helmet law
1978364 data alone however are not sufficient to reverse helmet law repeal many states maintain repeals despite multiple studies showing increases in deaths injuries and costs until life saving mandatory helmet policies are reinstated voluntary helmet use programs should be developed and evaluated
1978365 to evaluate the 2003 repeal of pennsylvanias motorcycle helmet law we assessed changes in helmet use and compared motorcycle related head injuries with non head injuries from 2001 2002 to 2004 2005 helmet use among riders in crashes decreased from 82 to 58 head injury deaths increased 66 non head injury deaths increased 25 motorcycle related head injury hospitalizations increased 78 compared with 28 for non head injury hospitalizations helmet law repeals jeopardize motorcycle riders until repeals are reversed states need voluntary strategies to increase helmet use
1978366 motorcycles must be fully integrated into the transport system and transport policies
1978367 norway was the perfect place to hold the workshop because it is a leader in road safety with many excellent initiatives emanating from norway that have spread elsewhere
1978368 it was crucial for motorcycle safety that all stakeholders meet in order to find an integrated approach to the challenges
1978369 an enthusiastic role in the current international discussion on increased road safety
1978370 apple needs to do a lot of work to improve communications between developers and the people in charge of the app store
1978371 in my experience communication has been pretty spotty so far as opposed to the great service apples provided with developer technical support we have questions that have gone unanswered so far and unlike dts we dont even have any kind of direct contact with anyone there unfortunately
1978372 netshare did not violate any of the developer or app store agreements
1978373 automated e mail systems being employed on both ends which resulted in e mails being lost in transit
1978374 its like the app store division is this top secret untouchable branch of apple
1978375 apple pulled the app july 31 without giving my any notification that they were doing it or what their justification was for removing it
1978376 ive tried to contact them about the issue but its been a complete dead end
1978377 clear consistent communication and a application standard policy that is clear and applied universally to all developers
1978378 communication is the key here both between apple and devs and also among devs themselves
1978379 the iphone sdk nda has been completely hindering progress and it needs to be lifted asap
1978380 if apple wants to keep things in upcoming versions of the sdk under wraps then it should be possible to modify the nda so that were all able to communicate about things that are in the final shipping version of the iphone os and sdk once this happens iphone development in general will improve because well be able to discuss issues openly and share code publicly the iphone platform as a whole will undoubtably improve as a result

1978386 the ultimate failure seemed to be more capacity planning mistakes than anything else if im guessing right but the ultimate failure was not being willing to tell steve we arent ready and taking that heat they thought they could release and make it work and guessed very wrong or thought they were in good shape which is worse
1978387 one of my sources opined that apple clearly wasnt too savvy about all the progress made in infrastructure over the past few years if this insinuation is indeed true then there is no way apple can get over its current spate of problems
1978388 eddys real specialty is to be able to take what steve asks for implement it hit the target dates make it work and keep the damn thing a secret until steve announces it thats a big reason why his team is self contained it also means his people can do what needs to be done to implement things that never existed before and which dont fit into normal it this is how we do things standards he and his teams spends most of his time off in uncharted territory where a need to be innovative and flexible is a must and yet they have to do it on huge scales
1978389 tennessee hillbilly who assembles a team of eight jewish american soldiers to take on the nazis
1978390 all we know is that the iphone downloads a list of malicious urls
1978391 for all we know it could trigger world war 3 or it could cause some computer somewhere to spit out recipes for buttermilk pancakes
1978392 truly malicious software is going to find a way to burrow deeper into the iphones operating system so that a simple mechanism like this wouldnt affect it so really the only type of applications this could effectively kill off are applications that are annoying to apple but not malicious that certainly calls for a lot more concern

1978395 dealing with flash audio and video and oft changing content within pages may also present challenges according to one experienced unica customer creating the link specific tags becomes highly labor intensive and reporting still remains page view focused and not event focused which makes unica less than ideal for sites using rich internet applications rias or highly componentized content

1978405 without the investment tax credit will it be 2017 or 2020 i can tell you it will slow it down
1978406 there is a view that institutional clients ought to be sophisticated investors who knew what they were buying
1978407 i cant see why ubs would want to settle with institutional investors now that citigroup and merrill lynch have set the precedent
1978408 it would certainly be a concern as we did not expect them to repurchase all of those auction rate securities however it will also mean that the problem will be sorted out and the uncertainty wont drag on
1978409 consistently working with regulators toward a comprehensive solution for all auction rate securities people shares fell 1

1978420 and a new 199 price point in line with the iphone
1978421 we note that the macbook has had the same design since its launch over two years ago and the macbook pro has had essentially the same design since its launch over 2 5 years ago which was very similar in design to the powerbook g4 released over 5 5 years ago
1978422 to compare the long running imac g5 design lasted three years
1978423 are just the beginning of apples exploration of multi touch on the mac
1978424 currently these gestures require the same touch sensing technology used in the iphone but they use a traditional looking trackpad
1978425 eventually we expect apple to change the trackpad to backlit color screens for a more dynamic user interface on the mac
1978426 until the technology has fully matured over the next 2 3 years
1978427 apple needs to do a lot of work to improve communications between developers and the people in charge of the app store
1978428 in my experience communication has been pretty spotty so far as opposed to the great service apples provided with developer technical support we have questions that have gone unanswered so far and unlike dts we dont even have any kind of direct contact with anyone there unfortunately
1978429 netshare did not violate any of the developer or app store agreements
1978430 automated e mail systems being employed on both ends which resulted in e mails being lost in transit
1978431 its like the app store division is this top secret untouchable branch of apple
1978432 apple pulled the app july 31 without giving my any notification that they were doing it or what their justification was for removing it
1978433 ive tried to contact them about the issue but its been a complete dead end
1978434 clear consistent communication and a application standard policy that is clear and applied universally to all developers
1978435 communication is the key here both between apple and devs and also among devs themselves
1978436 the iphone sdk nda has been completely hindering progress and it needs to be lifted asap
1978437 if apple wants to keep things in upcoming versions of the sdk under wraps then it should be possible to modify the nda so that were all able to communicate about things that are in the final shipping version of the iphone os and sdk once this happens iphone development in general will improve because well be able to discuss issues openly and share code publicly the iphone platform as a whole will undoubtably improve as a result
1978438 house republicans believe they have struck political gold with american voters
1978439 selling out to big oil costs rep david davis his job
1978440 we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
1978441 they were the reason we bought this house because it had a big yard for them to run in
1978442 cheye and trinity we support you friends and citizens of berwyn heights
1978443 we urge restraint on all sides that violence would be curtailed and that direct dialogue could ensue in order to help resolve their differences
1978444 i am obligated to defend the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
1978445 we will not allow the unpunished killing of our fellow citizens those who are guilty will suffer the punishment they deserve
1978446 belief growing that reporters are trying to help obama win
1978447 a reminder of obamas essential elusiveness and how little we understand about how the candidate himself would resolve these thorny problems
1978448 im like a dog running after cars i wouldnt know what to do with one if i caught it i just do things
1978449 heres a way things could be we can have them any way we like because there are no rules shall we have them this way then
1978450 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
1978451 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
1978452 we are a freedom loving nation that is now under attack
1978453 in the end they just moved in its unheard of its unparalleled its absolutely outrageous
1978454 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
1978455 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face
1978456 theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent
1978457 they got me in an ad with paris hilton you know i never met the woman
1978458 whoop it up for the ragged trousers put the lazy greasy fizzle who cant pay his debts on the altar and bow down and worship him let the state ideal be high what we need is not the respect of our fellow men but the chance to get something for nothing
1978459 ill just buy an episode from the itunes store and well be able to watch it in less than a minute
1978460 shutdown allow system to be shut down without have to log on
1978461 the fact that we are around and there is a place that people can go will give them some confidence
1978462 unfortunately there are some companies that take a dim view of some peoples freedom to tinker
1978463 in my experience the smaller the company the worse they are
1978464 a merkin first use according to the oed 1617 is a pubic wig originally worn by prostitutes after shaving their genitalia to eliminate lice or disguise the marks of syphilis
1978465 but we are continuing to look at what the potential may be here
1978466 it might be one of the greatest technical blunders in our nations history
1978467 for security and logistic reasons very limited attendance will be permitted at both sites
1978468 presumably somewhere down the line there will be technology that develops that potentially could use white spaces without interference
1978469 so we have to be open to that potential and look at what is the appropriate policy
1978470 the reason for these consistent failures was simple no customers
1978471 even in googles own backyard no one has been able to attract enough customers to make unlicensed wifi viable
1978472 a rigorous adjacent channel interference methodology that calculates whether adjacent channel interference is acceptable or not from other broadcast signals
1978473 this broadcast methodology is just as applicable for the white space channels that are to be used for mobile tv applications
1978474 in europe there is a greater propensity to consider something that is not from a traditional vendor
1978475 we think that staying power shows that ubuntu is for real
1978476 for shuttleworth ubuntu isnt just a business mission its a personal mission
1978477 the whole point about surgery is to execute small finely controlled movements with your hands
1978478 then we saw people using the wii and noticed the precision of some movements looked very similar
1978479 develop an increased efficiency less errors more fluid movement basically theyre just better
1978480 no one has yet been able to demonstrate that they are able to modify change or alter data within the chip if any data were to be changed modified or altered it would be immediately obvious to the electronic reader
1978481 gee officer even though im covered in blood it couldnt have been me my car uh i mean i was across town at the time just check the toll records
1978482 did i miss some technological developement that only allows cars to be driven by their rightful owners
1978483 i cant run ms office on os x so how am i supposed to work
1978484 how do i open an application and what is the dock
1978485 most of the time i get to fight the war and go home and see the wife and kids at night
1978486 it is quite different going from potentially shooting a missile then going to your kids soccer game
1978487 there is no magic number of soldiers that are needed on the ground to win this campaign
1978488 what we need is security of the people we need governance we need reconstruction and development
1978489 unless you stabilize that border with pakistan and uproot the terrorist safe haven that has developed in the pakistan tribal areas youre not going to be able to stabilize afghanistan
1978490 ninety percent of the worlds opium comes from afghanistan and much of that money ends up in the hands of warlords and other militants
1978491 there is a clear linkage between narco trafficking and financing of the insurgency
1978492 there is a sense of commitment from those troops and when they go in for the fight they go in with everything theyve got
1978493 and so an answer to that was to do a superbad pineapple express crossover an unprecedented crossover movie with two directors greg motolla and david gordon green each directing half of the movie and somehow these characters get together which doesnt make sense at all but could work
1978494 we are continuing our investigation with an appeal to the people involved to hand themselves in we are looking at cctv from other stations in previous days
1978495 weve found pieces of the incident but havent captured the whole incident we have some blurry images of the two offenders
1978496 were disappointed that it hasnt helped the police as we hoped it could
1978497 a scuffle broke out and she was shoved on to the tracks then a metropolitan police officer who was off duty but on his way to work chased the two but they ran off the platform via an exit and managed to escape
1978498 the woman was very lucky she was not more seriously injured the third rail carries 750 volts of electricity and she could have been electrocuted or even struck by an early morning train
1978499 i feel im just lucky to be alive it could have been a lot worse than it is and im just shocked by the whole experience

1978506 designers must be able to draw on experience and knowledge from a broad range of disciplines including the social sciences and humanities in order to solve problems in a global competitive market of products and ideas

1978515 are joining with us to collectively restore meditation to its beautiful presence as a symbol of peace and tranquility for residents of st pauls east side
1978516 rescuing any good at all from the greedy nastiness of the vote for the beijing olympics
1978517 if we do nothing this will definitely strengthen the hands of the communists they will be emboldened knowing that they can get away with whatever they want
1978518 dude i cant talk im being chased by the police
1978519 with a growing mass of web content from blogs news sites image and video archives personal websites and more internet users have an option to turn not only to the major search engines but also to search engines on individual sites as vehicles to reach the information they are looking for
1978520 given this unfortunate situation simply taking part in the olympics was important enough that the chinese persevered demonstrating the countrys motivation to stay engaged in the world through sports
1978521 if we cannot set aside sports art science and other such activities to be the province of individuals for the benefit of people as individuals everywhere then i cannot believe that the word civilisation has much meaning left
1978522 international sport is the means of attaining triumphs over another nation
1978523 young chinese have become fatter less active and overall less healthy mainly due to a lack of exercise
1978524 could the web browser help you follow and participate in online discussions
1978525 personally opposed but not willing to legislate my morality on this issue
1978526 well you wouldnt want all of the bums republicans to congregate in the mens public restroom of the transportation stations
1978527 what is the percentage of bums that want or need or use wi fi service you stupid jackass

1978534 seriously it has been two hours can you provide us with another update for a company with your reputation im absolutely shocked at the apparent absence of customer service
1978535 guess how secure that is in the face of a dns attack
1978536 ssls not the panacea we would like it to be
1978537 i do not want to see my cell phone bill this month
1978538 the entire scope of the attack is even yet to be fully realized
1978539 im shooting him tomorrow if you dont believe me come witness it for yourself
1978540 hey fat fuck go to jack and grab a dozen jumbo jacks
1978541 open standards and in particular semantic web standards can help lower the cost of government make it easier for independent agencies to work together and increase flexibility in the face of change
1978542 we need to solve important challenges such as lack of standards in end user devices network constraints service cost issues of literacy and an understanding of the real information needs of rural communities
1978543 to do so requires an multidisciplinary approach a step we take through the creation of this new group
1978544 b enefits to end user interaction of adopting such common infrastructure will include richer user interaction enabled through simplified approaches to mixing multiple interaction technologies in a single application the ability to easily share data across multiple components and to freely intermix ajax and declarative components should support a wider range of high function composable uis
1978545 i am glad to see that the community of developers including browser vendors is working together to create the best possible path for the web
1978546 trying to use the semantic web without sparql is like trying to use a relational database without sql
1978547 i went on to become a journalist and worked for radio before moving into nonfiction television
1978548 they had a certain charm even though they seemed fairly primitive to me even as a child but i saw what could be done with technology when star wars arrived
1978549 but its not just a childrens program to make it appealing for adults the drama had to work on its own so we ended working toward that pg 13 feel
1978550 im glad we were able to offer something new for itv
1978551 and id like to see how the show plays out i think it can turn out to be something special something quite entertaining so well continue to grow it slowly
1978552 without a doubt the government plans to use csli to learn whether suspects are in private places outside of public view
1978553 the government quibbles with magistrate judge lenihans factual findings but does not promise that it does not and will not use the stored csli as evidence that calls are made from a constitutionally protected space or to infer facts about the interiors of private homes
1978554 there can be no assurance that impairment charges will not be required in the future and any such amounts may be material
1978555 simply because the competition cannot sell their product at half the price
1978556 there is no reason for apple to have these prices other than to improve their cash reserves
1978557 the same equipment on a pc versus a mac costs a lot less
1978558 the first of the brigade non lethal capability sets nlcs is now fielded to the armys 1st heavy brigade combat team
1978559 i think the surest sign that there is intelligent life out there in the universe is that none of it has tried to contact us
1978560 i think it will be very simple but profound its not going to be something of lots of color
1978561 but something that has gravitas to it because of the occasion
1978562 weve said for a long time that a centralized network dvr is a better engineering solution than having hard drives all over everybodys home
1978563 if this particular court case is upheld we will deploy that
1978564 the whole concept of the fully internal network may be broken
1978565 about five years ago we were fighting the company my team mostly in the information security business
1978566 so we changed a lot of it and we started injecting things like
1978567 for many teachers and parents the issue isnt whether king was gay or straight his father still isnt convinced his son was gay but whether he was allowed to push the boundaries so far that he put himself and others in danger theyre not blaming king for his own death as if anything could justify his murder but their attitude toward his assailant is not unsympathetic
1978568 the important thing now is not blame its learning from what happened doing so requires a candid look at what went on and why
1978569 beyonc knowles has been a spokesperson for the lor al paris brand since 2001
1978570 it is categorically untrue that lor al paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign for f ria hair color
1978571 there is no doubt that anyone seeing that ad will know that it is beyonc
1978572 skin is lighter than the way im used to seeing her
1978573 advertisers and magazines need to be careful about this even if its just a production process

1978581 do not buy this app and apple please remove this from the app store apple must must must start to screen these fake apps and ridiculous scams
1978582 theres no reason for this app to exist and apple is taking the responsibility to protect its platform from spam like this
1978583 even if you dont keep one at home youll be glad to have it there get a nice one like a moleskine and you will be more likely to write down your experience with the crazy waitress or the local slang you just learned

1978596 as is true in all conventions were still working out the mechanics the coordination
1978597 i know that there have been a lot of questions on this subject senator obama and i share the goal of ensuring that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
1978598 i want to assure everyone that we are working together with senator obamas campaign and the dnc and i am confident we will have a successful and unified convention in denver
1978599 to continue to do whatever i can to help senator obama and democrats across the country win in the november
1978600 demonstrate an apparent acceptance by the legislature that home schooling is taking place in california with home schools allowed as private schools

1978625 and the people are rustic its great to bring my daughter here to see this way of life
1978626 i wanted to come to shangli to see the ancient landscape
1978627 its said there are relics here dating back to the qing dynasty circa 1644 1911 those of us born after 1980 we dont know much about this so we can come here and learn from the experience and get a taste of ancient times
1978628 the water can be used to make tea if old people drink it theyll have a long life if young people drink it theyll earn more money if students drink it theyll get the top score on their exams
1978629 at a time when the economy is clearly under stress the commission has a responsibility to assure that destructive practices such as abusive naked short selling are stopped
1978630 the basic principles behind neuro eye therapy are similar to those of physiotherapy following a stroke if muscles are affected following brain injury patients are asked to repeat a pattern of limb movements in order to improve their mobility
1978631 in the same way after daily use of the vision rehabilitation programtm over a six month period patients have reported an improvement in their sight as well as a range of other benefits including being able to get about more easily both inside and outside their homes and finding reading much less of a struggle
1978632 the device used in neuro eye therapy is simple to set up in the home or office and requires no prior expertise or experience of computer use
1978633 kiran was prepping on the fly she did an incredible job and made lots of news
1978634 he got miced up and we got right to him it was a five minute turnaround at tops
1978635 this is when you know youre in the big leagues and youre performing as the best amongst the best
1978636 hes too new and he needs to put some meat on his bones
1978637 ive been in there so long my powers are weak i can only grant you one wish and its a choice of two i can either make you super rich or super smart whatll it be
1978638 yknow ive always been bothered about being kinda slow always felt people were laughing at me behind my back well no more of that make me super smart
1978639 the son of an alumnus who goes to a private preparatory school now has less chance of getting in than some boy from p s 109 somewhere
1978640 for a long time in robotics there was this focus on a smart machine an android that would make you breakfast and go out and buy your shopping
1978641 but thats extremely challenging its going to be far easier for us to engineer little simple things and rely on them to organise themselves
1978642 you might have some complex robot that is sent to mars has a technical problem and then the mission is basically over
1978643 with swarm robots even if a percentage of them fails theyll still be able to achieve their goal
1978644 if you design software with typical engineering tools like if this and that then do this its like playing a chess game by calculating all the possible never get there
1978645 one application were looking at in the us is renewable energy technologies
1978646 if we look at the biological world there is a huge amount of change complexity and adaptation
1978647 these artificial life ideas are a very useful source of inspiration as the products and services we provide become increasingly complex and demanding in terms of resources
1978648 with self organisation you have very simple rules governing individual units that together perform a bigger task a typical example is ant colonies
1978649 its a very economical solution especially for problems that are very dynamic anything you can do with self organisation is basically a free lunch
1978650 if you were to have a rigid control system that depended on a fixed set of rules that could fall apart if any part of the network is lost
1978651 i am ready to talk to the tatas if a proposal comes from them this is a matter of courtesy moreover i am not opposed to the car plant at singur
1978652 but in the discussions i would request them the tatas to tell the state government to return the 400 acres to unwilling farmers and set up the car plant on the remaining 600 acres the tatas have some social obligations after all and i have no confrontation with them
1978653 we are a responsible opposition and are at the helm of governance in two zilla parishads east midnapore and south 24 parganas at this juncture we want to send a message across the state that we are not opposed to industry to counter the cpms propaganda
1978654 it is up to the government to take a decision i have nothing to say
1978655 its good that mamata has expressed her desire to have a dialogue with the tatas but before that she should also talk to the state government after all an across the table discussion is the need of the hour to clear the misgivings
1978656 a negotiation is always good more so in this situation i certainly hope it happens but i cannot answer your question on whether the opposition would eventually sit down across the table with the tatas
1978657 on my side there is no problem but if the government wants to discuss everything except return of the excess land the discussion has no meaning they should begin talks with an open mind and without any conditions
1978658 and i think if he wanted to come back he was welcome we welcomed him
1978659 how unwelcoming do you have to be before a guy feels unwelcome i mean yeesh take a frickin hint
1978660 despite opinions to the contrary i like brett a lot id love to see him have the time of his life
1978661 im wishing him well that he does well i think all football fans want to see him do well and we pray he will
1978662 obviously the more that prima donna plays and the more successful the jets are the higher the draft pick well receive as compensation that aside the guy ruined my summer impugned my character and made us all miserable if vince wilfork falls into his knee i guess the karma gods will have rendered their verdict
1978663 i was not going to let the hypothetical enter our locker room because it wasnt in the best interests of our football team
1978664 i was not going to let brett favre enter our locker room because it wasnt in the best interests of our football team
1978665 one thing i will just say it wasnt bretts fault and it wasnt our fault
1978666 but the relationship got to a point where it couldnt go forward
1978667 im not going to blame one side or the other a lot of things happened this season a lot of shocking things but at this point its irrelevant
1978668 ill let the fans of green bay and the shareholders who own the publicly traded franchise assign blame but i would just remind them before they do im brett favre
1978669 you have the duty and gift of living you dont have the right to sit on the sidelines use your life and get back into the game
1978670 no matter what age you are or what your circumstances might be you are special and you still have something unique to offer your life because of who you are has meaning
1978671 dont spend time beating on a wall hoping to transform it into a door
1978672 the amount being paid to the music industry even though their games are entirely dependent on the content we own and control is far too small
1978673 this is the point at which both of those video games should stop using any warner music content and see how bronfman feels when everyone else is jamming to content from his competitors

1978682 you have to remember that this market has baffled anyone whos used fundamentals or charts but if youre a chartist today is the death knell for the possibility of new highs in the market place
1978683 the biggest driving factor now to the downside is the fact that the u s economy has a lot of company right now in terms of weakening economic growth

1978698 mbia agrees that the statements made by certain short sellers may have in fact violated new york insurance law and we plan on cooperating with any investigation or action brought by the new york state insurance department or any other regulator who may wish to investigate these activities
1978699 i continue to expect that the rest of this year and perhaps next will be bumpy until the global credit markets stabilize but mbia has the resources to meet whatever challenges may lie ahead
1978700 the decision to proceed will be based solely on whether we can expect to earn a reasonable return for existing shareholders if we allocate capital to that business
1978701 not only will this acquisition bring critical mass to publicis groupes formidable search capabilities but it will also enhance our affiliate marketing and overall performance marketing offering

1978704 the drop was largely due to due to increased competition and promotional activities for the olympic games we expect the margin to remain stable at this level in the current year
1978705 the olympics will have some negative impact on the pc sales not necessarily less than the earthquake since it will last a few weeks and will affect main cities such as beijing
1978706 even if the margin on the netbook is very low lenovo must do it otherwise it will lose market share

1978710 a year and a half after the debut of facebooks web site it was built by copying the look feel and features of facebook com
1978711 facebook is concerned that because studivz looks like facebook and incorporates similar features and functionality to facebook users will incorrectly believe that studivz is associated with facebook
1978712 they didnt have a strong point of view on digital media
1978713 we were an advisor for them on how to move into the new media space taking into account their mission of voter education
1978714 myspaces piece of the partnership is less about the debates themselves we dont have any editorial control over how the debates are run
1978715 our role is to create a suite of online tools that helps people take what theyve learned in the debates and organize it and process it and decide who to vote for
1978716 theres a pretty hard line between myspace and the mydebates world
1978717 using youtube and google to measure popularity just means that you pick up the buzz factor many serious application developers are not even present on the web which tends to overemphasize academic and hobbyist views as the list itself says this has nothing to do with quality of languages or level of usage
1978718 furthermore java is mainly used in web applications that are mostly fairly trivial
1978719 if all we do is train students to be able to do simple web programming in java they wont get jobs since those are the jobs that can be easily outsourced what we need are software engineers who understand how to build complex systems
1978720 by the way java has almost no presence in such systems at least as of a few months ago there was not a single line of safety critical java flying in commercial or military aircraft i recently talked to a customer who had a medium sized application in java which was to be adapted to be part of a safety critical avionics system they immediately decided that this meant it would have to be recoded in a suitable language probably either c or ada
1978721 it was from a software hardware company in the valley the writer said that at the end of ads for software engineers they added the sentence this job will not involve any use of java or any web based application programming and that this single sentence was enough to essentially eliminate american applicants for their jobs which was their idea they felt they had wasted too much time interviewing incompetent college graduates
1978722 its a really easy way to deploy a fully configured oracle software stack
1978723 one of oracles problems is its seen as a fairly aggressive software license vendor and theres a fear of vendor lock in
1978724 theres no reason why customers would take its virtual machine for free when they can get virtual machines from citrix or xen
1978725 for open source adepts its not a challenge to build the oracle software stack with xen
1978726 while oracle may be able to push its vm templates into its installed customer base it has a real challenge with people who arent its customers
1978727 if you run the oracle database virtually on the same platform that you did physically youll see a performance hit
1978728 theyve got millions of users and are a great place to target
1978729 if youre trying to get friends really fast for a social attack its important the bigger your network the more legitimacy you have friends are currency on social networks
1978730 we spent most of last night working on a fix for a worm which was targeting people on facebook and placing messages on walls urging users to view a video that pretends to be hosted on a google or youtube web site
1978731 less than 002 percent of people on facebook have been affected all of whom we notified and suggested steps to remove the malware
1978732 if we get a report of a bug or a hole from a user a security researcher a reporter blogger or anyone we check it out and fix it as quickly as possible
1978733 in fact we appreciate it when help comes our way from the many security experts and organizations out there

1978743 when writing the business plan they decided to stay away from the notion of a personal computer since the bankers they were talking to had no idea what a computer was or wasnt
1978744 so for the first product they needed something they could get off the ground with existing technology but the notion from the get go was to build a personal computer firm
1978745 noyce said it was an intriguing idea and that intel could do it but it would be a dumb move
1978746 he said that if you have a computer chip you can only sell one chip per computer while with memory you can sell hundreds of chips per computer
1978747 no nose saddles are a useful intervention for bicycling police officers alleviating pressure to the groin and improving penis health different saddle designs may require some re learning of how to ride a bicycle but the health benefits to having unrestricted vascular flow to and from the penis and less penile numbness is self evident

1978750 is there a point at which serious people acknowledge a need to re examine literally everything thats happened during the past seven plus years
1978751 we are grateful to the washington post the new york times time magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years it would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years but the work is now much more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government the supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national autodetermination practiced in past centuries

1978757 this level of spill is so small that we shouldnt tell anyone because it doesnt matter why should we inflame a foreign government
1978758 why are we spilling radioactive water at a rate greater than the designed value
1978759 so far this year 13 fires have been reported on navy subs and ships thats nearly five times the cost of all navy fires afloat over the past five years
1978760 officials with knowledge of the incident could not quantify the radiation level but insisted it was

1978764 a bromide is a figure of speech referring to a phrase or person who uses such phrases that has been used and repeated so many times as to become either insincere in its meaning or seem like an attempt at trying to explain the obvious it can also mean the unnecessary insertion of an often irrelevant clich into a conversation designed to make the speaker sound more authoritative

1978774 we continually look for ways to enhance our customers dining experiences whether through diverse menu choices or in this case a better experience at the point of sale
1978775 merchants in busy environments like quick service restaurants increasingly recognize the value of accepting mastercard paypass which provides greater speed and convenience at the point of sale
1978776 taco buenos acceptance of paypass will help improve customer service with shorter faster lines
1978777 we put everything that he asked for on it and he comes back hollering at everyone
1978778 its not good manners to go in and try to crack into the press network here because it is so valuable to having the conference covered well
1978779 the press room is designed to be a safe harbor in a fairly stormy sea
1978780 how did you do that and where are those steps
1978781 if you only watch the first episode you wont understand the direction its going

1978803 if people liked bart allen they should probably read the book xs is in it
1978804 obviously one of the big things in lightning saga that we still havent addressed is the lightning rod and what thats all about that will be a central focus of the series
1978805 the key characters are cosmic boy lighting lad and saturn girl and then from there brainiac 5 polar boy sun boy dawnstar and wildfire those are really the main guys
1978806 a lot of them are in there but those are the main guys
1978807 hes the main guy who gets us into the story
1978808 so if you have been following him for a while youre all set if youve liked or loved to hate watching superboy prime through infinite crisis and sinestro corps war heres where he is going to be next this is the next stage of his quote unquote adventure the adventures of the boy of steel
1978809 its debatable i think thats a great debate and that will be talked about in this book
1978810 you have star wars you have star trek youve got these future universes and the legion of super heroes is kind of the superhero version of that paul levitz keith giffen jim shooter abnett amp lanning and so many others helped build this wonderful universe
1978811 and theres also something really interesting to me about what influence superman has on the universe a thousand years from now and how he is going to influence other aliens to immigrate to earth in hopes of a better life and to make a difference to this place
1978812 i hope that anybody who has enjoyed something that i have worked on before or who wants to follow superboy prime or wants to see what happens to the green lanterns a thousand years from now will give the book a shot because weve put in 185 percent on this from top on down
1978813 when the book comes out it will take you a half and hour to read it
1978814 the best thing about what we are doing is that everybody is loving it so much
1978815 and george is having a great time he loves the legion of super heroes he already wanted to work on the legion and the story was coming together it was just sort of serendipity nobody else could draw the story i am writing nobody else
1978816 hes an amazing artist to work with because hes so concerned about detail but at the same time hes always focused on story people say he can draw a million characters and he can but he gets all the references and the little details right too everything is perfect and the way he paces his stories is fantastic hell do an eight panel page and it wont feel crowded and thats a feat and a half
1978817 its not directly tied in but the characters and where jim has them are jim shooters work on the legion is a huge influence hes one of the greatest comic writers in any generation from his work at valiant marvel and now again at dc
1978818 if the opportunity presented itself and it was the right time well see i love the legion

1978821 no one had heard of starbucks back then at least not on the east coast
1978822 i started bringing back colombian brands 100 arabica coffee that was roasted right by true craftsmen it was a little darker much richer and a lot smoother than the coffees that were available in the u s friends and family went crazy over it
1978823 coffee became our passion a sort of casual obsession you could say all of our travel revolved around coffee all of my research was related to coffee and all of our friends seemed to be connected to coffee in some way
1978824 gustavo has been studying agriculture and growing coffee his entire life he is an incredible wealth of information

1978828 the more we can mobilize this community the fewer patents that will actually be granted
1978829 whatever happens in the patent reform world in the next u s administration is great but we have to act now to stop the granting of patents that threaten linux and open source in general
1978830 a production environment where we educate and train people to do this well work with them to make sure its put in a form that is acceptable
1978831 those are kind of the key areas to linux as it moves forward
1978832 this was way worse than expected and there was hardly a silver lining in the data it will bring forward expectations for a rate cut that the market has already priced in
1978833 anyone reading the newspapers has been aware of the flurry of plant closings and downsizing announcements and statistics canada surveys are finally catching up with the reality
1978834 the only significant gains were in accommodation and food services
1978835 over the past 12 months manufacturing employment across canada was down 88 000 with nearly all the losses in ontario
1978836 this pushed georgia into a philosophy of self reliance the idea that georgia will be able to regain breakaway entities only by its own means
1978837 the elephant in the room behind this whole story is georgias nato prospects
1978838 i think the surest sign that there is intelligent life out there in the universe is that none of it has tried to contact us

1978858 we thought that we had focused correctly on the non investment grade paper of which we held little
1978859 there are also many situations in which it makes tactical sense to defer delay delegate or procrastinate on any given task and go work on something else instead in the meantime not everything is equally important and also a given task may in fact become much easier and be completed in a much better way if one waits for ones own skills to get stronger or for other events to happen that reduce the importance or need for the task in the first place

1978874 thats going to drive savings in weight which will drive savings in fuel costs so where you see normal routine data gathering operations by manned aviation today i would see that gradually being transferred over to uavs in the next 20 years

1978989 this project moved the swimming world beyond the observational into scientific fact
1978990 the knowledge gained gave me the foundation for which every technical stroke change in preparation for the beijing olympics was based
1978991 to see how a swimmers motion affects the flow you need to know how much force the swimmer is producing and how that force impacts the water

1979000 is democracy with all his contradictions the best political solution
1979001 charles krauthammer called for both drilling conservation and pursuing alternative energy sources although i usually find a lack of reason with the democrats i think in this case they are very reasonably concerned that drill now really will provide short term relief on oil prices this in turn will relieve the current pressure that is spurring development of alternatives the fear then is that we will go another generation before do anything of course they cannot admit that they think the high prices are good it would be political suicide my question for you is what i would like to ask krauthammer can we really do both arent the high prices the only thing that will drive us from oil a few months of 4 gas has sold more priuses than 30 years of cafe standards

1979123 the design of the network was to isolate it from the rest of the public network its not designed to isolate it from one computer in the press room to another computer in the press room
1979124 i admit that i have been under much influence of militant free tibet organisations back home
1979125 inroads in share particularly in the u s and in the consumer segment
1979126 subtle changes in industry growth rates are often far outweighed by fluctuations in market share and pricing amongst the it hardware vendors
1979127 as a result we prefer companies with upward market share bias and we believe it will be difficult to find a near term bottom for companies with declining or rigid market share
1979128 we anticipate that apple will continue to grow at a multiple of the overall market for many years to come
1979129 good boy johnny now sit stay and dont lick your balls when companies around
1979130 obama and bush are two faces on the same currency
1979131 they blocked abu nawas street opposite the green zone and searched the houses there then they moved to the babylon hotel and took up positions on the rooftops i was stuck in the traffic the whole evening
1979132 why does it matter to us if a white man or a black man wins the us presidential election
1979133 obama and bush are two faces on the same currency an american currency
1979134 why does he come here what will he do for us will he fix the electricity he is just coming because of the election
1979135 he says hell withdraw his troops from iraq but i dont believe that
1979136 the americans planned for a long time to take over iraq to protect israel from iran and seize the oil here

1979141 if were going to maintain the habitat weve got we need some help
1979142 i dont think its a problem getting them to buy into it but its a matter of getting the word out
1979143 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
1979144 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
1979145 we are working on mediation efforts to secure a cease fire
1979146 they have sent in their troops and weapons and they are bombing our towns
1979147 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
1979148 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
1979149 blood shed in south ossetia will weigh on their conscience
1979150 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
1979151 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
1979152 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
1979153 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
1979154 we are a freedom loving nation that is now under attack
1979155 in the end they just moved in its unheard of its unparalleled its absolutely outrageous
1979156 oh shit he must have those polaroids of your mom
1979157 lovin you is more than just a dream come true la la la
1979158 has done more damage to this country than any single person in modern history
1979159 its not a stretch to say this might be 2008s best fighting game
1979160 weapons are to be exclusively in the hands of one group the resistant group
1979161 i find the timing is great from the standpoint of look this is a commitment to the program on one of many fronts
1979162 this makes a statement of commitment and confidence its important for our student athletes to know that we have confidence in him
1979163 where were at nothing would tickle more than to have bonuses earned
1979164 i find the timing is great from the standpoint of look this is a commitment to the program on one of many fronts
1979165 this makes a statement of commitment and confidence its important for our student athletes to know that we have confidence in him
1979166 where were at nothing would tickle more than to have bonuses earned
1979167 the area is closed because of a possible terrorist attack its just a defensive measure
1979168 this ad is a lie and its part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam even though a host of independent nonpartisan organizations have said this attack isnt true senator mccain continues to lie about senator obamas plan to give 95 of all families a tax cut of 1 000 and not raise taxes for those making under 250 000 a single dime the reason so many families are hurting today is because weve had eight years of failed bush policies that senator mccain wants to continue for another four and thats what barack obama will change as president
1979169 in my almost 20 years first as a prosecutor and now as an attorney general i cannot recall ever seeing let alone hearing of a situation where a police officer trying to serve a subpoena was assaulted
1979170 arbitrary curved surfaces and movable parts such as the joints of a robots arm
1979171 blood shed in south ossetia will weigh on their conscience
1979172 i know of no other damages that need to be collected
1979173 when all the proceeds are tallied we will sit down and decide what is the best use of those funds
1979174 we would have way more houses than what we have demand for
1979175 so what is going to be done with the money from the property sales
1979176 the city paid 11 million for something they should have gotten for free
1979177 it will be like instant messaging its ubiquitous but no one makes money on it
1979178 it will have to be a very different kind of advertising if someone does figure it out then google will be in a good position
1979179 if you are a publisher youre paying for this expense and youre trying to figure out how ad revenue will offset that expense
1979180 what weve found is that advertisers and agencies are only interested in professional media so professional content providers are having a good time finding extremely high demand because they have a lack of video views
1979181 so i turned up in happy disney mode and everyone was on this almighty fucking downer
1979182 and then i flew back feeling down and everyone else was up
1979183 the way england reacted to neighbours was such a surprise to me i couldnt walk down the street without people screaming so that allowed me to take england off its pedestal and see it for what it is
1979184 i suppose that houdini might as well have been called joe smith in that hes just used as the tool to help gillian delve into what she wants to get into which is love
1979185 funnily enough i came into this film after playing andy warhol in factory girl where i was really struggling to get everyone to keep the facts straight throwing history books down in front of everyone
1979186 they say ah you must be so disappointed you havent had russells career but that just shows the external perception of what they think every actor wants that if you want to be an actor you must want to be tom cruise but ive always struggled with the idea of fame and recognition yes i want a certain amount of attention but i dont need a whole lot of money and i dont need to be throwing phones at people and ending up in the press doing crazy things every week because you know that brings attention to yourself and if you dont want that kind of attention dont do it
1979187 heres a guy who does big hollywood films but theyre solid credible films and he does good work in them
1979188 well if theres a good studio film theyre going to offer it to johnny depp theyre not going to offer it to me
1979189 and if its a bad studio film that johnny depp is not going to do theyll offer it to me and if its bad im not going to want to do it anyway so the problem sort of takes care of itself
1979190 then there are the ones that ride the line where you think ooh is it good
1979191 i dont want that experience and ive never wanted that experience
1979192 and i suppose that for me it would be that i suffer from a lot of social anxiety i was a really anxious kid a real loner
1979193 and i still have trouble in some social situations im very aware of space taker uppers those people who are always demanding attention they make me very uncomfortable so maybe thats why ive arranged my life the way i have why ive never moved to la or wanted that endless barrage of attention
1979194 but im a lot better than i used to be
1979195 those who want war crimes investigations brought against bush administration officials remind me a lot of the republicans who wanted bill clinton impeached and removed for his conduct in monicagate in the late 1990s theyre mistaking the anger and sense of moral righteousness among the base with the attitudes of the public at large
1979196 those who want war crimes investigations brought against bush administration officials remind me a lot of the republicans who wanted bill clinton impeached and removed for his conduct in monicagate in the late 1990s
1979197 in 1994 when he signed the violence against women act he restricted the kinds of digging that defendants can do into the past of sexual harassment plaintiffs and specifically allowed such evidence against harassers who are accused of assault the jones team has argued in pleadings that clintons alleged behavior in the hotel room amounts to assault
1979198 wasnt a principal part of ojs defense that the police were motivated by racism
1979199 how would the fact that one of the police officers used the
1979200 what was clever was that some of the senior people in al qaeda were egyptian
1979201 it served american purposes to get these people arrested and egyptian purposes to get these people back where they could be interrogated
1979202 nothing like that great conservative respect for the rule of law
1979203 we had them begging that theyd never be gang members again begging us
1979204 when the defendants case is predicated on his claim that he is being persecuted by racist cops the fact that one of the lead detectives bragged about using a racial epithet is definitely relevant and material to the defense
1979205 its only the right which convicts first and investigates later
1979206 assume that one or more of these people were indicted in a foreign country rumsfeld for example could he not be extradited to germany to stand trial his diplomatic immunity can be waived by the president obama
1979207 an act of war do you really believe that if germany tried rumsfeld against our wishes assume that the germans got him because he was foolishly travelling through berlin and not because they kidnapped him from boca raton we would go to war with germany over it
1979208 tommy this and tommy that and chuck im out the brute
1979209 yes of course this would have heavy political consequences domestically
1979210 in any case dont make the mistake of projecting your fantasies of bush the hero onto the public
1979211 the senators on the oversight committees have been briefed for years on the specifics the senate chose twice not to pass legislation banning waterboarding now they have stirred up a ruckus that forces them to take another vote in order to avoid being called hypocrites this subject has been exaggerated for political gain
1979212 my specific references to the holocaust and slavery were to give examples of the types of acts which could not possibly be considered
1979213 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
1979214 it is a humbling experience to have our investors profit advisory honored so highly by peers the newsletters circulation has increased exponentially over the last few years and this honor will help us grow its readership even faster
1979215 after being promoted by michael corleone to don of new york players expand to new cities as they build up their families through extorting businesses monopolizing illegal crime rings and defeating new families in an effort to become the most powerful mob family in america
1979216 russian armoured vehicles have entered the northern suburbs of tskhinvali
1979217 they have been calling it training exercises but they have not been concealing the fact that they are training these troops for use inside georgia
1979218 the way the escalation went was we came first under extensive artillery barrage from the separatists but in the end i was told that russian armoured vehicles started to cross the georgian border and that was exactly the moment when i had to take this decision to fire back
1979219 i want to reiterate on his behalf that the united states supports georgias territorial integrity and we call for an immediate ceasefire
1979220 about 1 400 died we will check these figures but the order of the numbers is around this we have this on the basis of reports from relatives
1979221 he is in big danger of losing the cachet he built up for himself in being pro western and the restraint he has often shown in the face of provocation by russia
1979222 if he is going to start a war he is going to lose the support of a lot of friends in the west
1979223 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives

1979226 im not sure about the need to build a complete new machine but some standards and software to manage rights e g delete a book after so many weeks unless a renew key is used could be developed and installed on consumer readers that way a user could use their own reader to read library ebooks as long as the reader supported the library standards software
1979227 however we understand that there are some users who prefer not to receive customized advertising and this opt out will offer them even greater choice
1979228 this pushed georgia into a philosophy of self reliance the idea that georgia will be able to regain breakaway entities only by its own means
1979229 the elephant in the room behind this whole story is georgias nato prospects
1979230 these peaks should have triggered action but there was not an effective local surveillance system in place
1979231 with regard to the state of facilities and procedures at the vale of leven the picture painted by the review team report is appalling and completely unacceptable
1979232 as the report makes clear it is a picture of a hospital suffering the consequences of ten years of uncertainty about its future
1979233 it identified a lack of clear focus and leadership in relation to infection control a poor standard of physical fabric in the hospital with inadequate hand hygiene and patient isolation facilities beds placed too close together and a shabby appearance even where cleaning was of a high standard
1979234 this was compounded by poor staff morale and deficiencies in knowledge and training around infection control in general and c difficile in particular
1979235 fostered an environment where there was inadequate management of clusters of cases at ward level or awareness of problems at higher levels
1979236 i cant answer for what happened in the period before i took office but i am determined now as i have been over the last year to ensure that the hospital does not continue to suffer death by a thousand cuts
1979237 we are pleased we have got an apology from the health secretary and the health board but only a full public inquiry will answer all the questions that we have
1979238 the families main concern is for a public inquiry to be held into this outbreak
1979239 there was not much room to move in the wards when my mother in law was sat in her wheelchair next to the bed nobody could get to the sink to use that
1979240 there were boxes of gloves and aprons right next to patients sometimes visitors would sit on the boxes because there was not enough chairs on the ward
1979241 there was also a laundry storage unit nearby where they were constantly collecting clean laundry it was always left open with people passing back and forth in the bay my mother was on before she died there was no sink
1979242 clear more could have been done to identify the risks earlier and potentially reduce the spread of infections
1979243 i am much more interested in getting this right than trying to have an exercise of apportioning individual blame
1979244 social media is an umbrella term that defines the various activities that integrate technology social interaction and the construction of words pictures videos and audio this interaction and the manner in which information is presented depends on the varied perspectives and building of shared meaning among communities as people share their stories and understandings

1979262 the average consumer could improve gas mileage by 3 3 percent by simply keeping his tires inflated to the proper pressure for the average driver in the u s and his 15 gal fuel tank thats a savings of about 2 00 on every fill up figure in the increased tire life from those correct pressures and this is beginning to add up to a handy sum of course if you or your mechanic have been diligent about keeping tire pressures set correctly you wont save anything which sounds like rewarding lazy people and penalizing the careful ones to me but thats life according to the department of energy underinflated tires alone cost the country more than 1 25 billion gal of gasoline annually roughly 1 percent of the total consumption of 142 billion gal according to the annual energy outlook 2007 published by the energy information administration offshore drilling would increase domestic production of crude oil by only about 1 percent we opened this discussion with sen obamas assertion that we can offset the need to reopen offshore drilling and save money at the pump by keeping our tires inflated properly hes right
1979263 im not a racist i just like the confederat flag
1979264 having raised kids as a single mom i gotta say i dont trust barack to do the responsible thong and its not because hes black
1979265 mr mccain took the lead in youtube hits small stuff and there will be a lot of twists and turns before this is over but theres movement down there beneath the crust of the earth
1979266 that crowd may not be who the msm thinks it is
1979267 most presidential candidates fly at about 15 000 ft barack obama has been living at 30 000 ft
1979268 the idea was lets not try to pull him down from that plane and be mad about it lets push him up to 50 000 ft and create an updraft that sends icarus a little closer to the sun
1979269 or is he say a product of the self esteem campaign that movement within the schools and homes of our country the past 25 years that says the way to get a winner is to tell the kid hes a winner every day you can get some true people of achievement that way because some people need a lot of reinforcement to rise
1979270 but you can also get not to put too fine a point of it empty suits that take on a normal shape only because theyre so puffed up with ego
1979271 okay i have an idea for our big fund raiser comedy extravaganza during the democratic convention i think i will bring a camera and ask the audience to stand as one and offer the obama salute so i can take a picture

1979277 this is a beta program and theres no guarantee but yes if appchecker says your program should work with say ubuntu 7
1979278 programs c c symbols mostly functions with some global variables and libraries required by an application that are satisfied by dynamically linked libraries provided by a distribution
1979279 type information expected by the application matches the type of the object provided by the distributions libraries for example the layout of a data structure might have changed or the function parameter that had previously been a 32 bit integer may have been changed to a 64 bit integer another problem that cannot be detected by the appchecker is if the details of a functions behavior changes from one version to another

1979285 i was actually considering voting for your man obama because he had the guts to take the anti populist stance of being against the gas tax holiday too bad hes now caved in by supporting the release of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve anyone who is truly committed to steering the country toward alternative energy must realize the best maybe the only way to get us there is through sustained high energy prices thomas friedman made this point in an nyt column a while ago and i agree
1979286 i will work my heart out to make sure that senator obama is our next president and i hope and pray that all of you will join me in that effort

1979292 weve already spent our budget because theres a flood of requests during the economic crisis
1979293 i have no idea why they did it and am not aware of any violation of the rules to sell software on the app store
1979294 i am sure a lot more people would like to buy it but currently cant do so
1979295 the app is a work of art and included a secret mantra thats all
1979296 i saw this app with a few friends and we jokingly clicked buy thinking it was a joke to see what would happen this is no joke do not buy this app and apple please remove this from the app store
1979297 ive got e mails from customers telling me that they really love the app
1979298 its a great work of art my guess is it will increase in value and was a bargain at 999 99
1979299 umm where is the evidence that the people who bought this are mac users
1979300 you realise that using an iphone makes you a mac user so you can all stfu

1979317 all we know is that the iphone downloads a list of malicious urls
1979318 for all we know it could trigger world war 3 or it could cause some computer somewhere to spit out recipes for buttermilk pancakes
1979319 truly malicious software is going to find a way to burrow deeper into the iphones operating system so that a simple mechanism like this wouldnt affect it so really the only type of applications this could effectively kill off are applications that are annoying to apple but not malicious that certainly calls for a lot more concern

1979337 i could hear them researchers shouting no rosie dont i looked over and joes mate this huge dolphin i hadnt even noticed before was virtually standing up right out of the water towering over me on its rear fins she seemed to be 12 feet tall emitting this loud high pitched noise the attendants were screaming weve got to get you out i was afraid i was going to get my other arm broken
1979338 if she had made that plunge toward me i would have been killed instantly as surely as if rosie had been a shark
1979339 apparently an enraged jealous dolphin is incredibly dangerous what a way to die who would have believed it
1979340 another monkey rushed to the defense of his mate and in beating it off the king received another bite which severely lacerated a gland the infection which set in following the bites gradually poisoned the kings entire system

1979347 to the president of the baath revolution party and president of the republic may god protect you
1979348 mohammed atta an egyptian national came with abu ammer an arabic nom de guerre his real identity is unknown and we hosted him in abu nidals house at al dora under our direct supervision
1979349 we arranged a work programme for him for three days with a team dedicated to working with him he displayed extraordinary effort and showed a firm commitment to lead the team which will be responsible for attacking the targets that we have agreed to destroy
1979350 the fruit of your excellent secret meeting with bashir al asad the syrian president on the iraqi syrian border
1979351 may god protect you and save you to all arab nations
1979352 the important thing is that we did find it and the information it contains
1979353 there are people who are working with us who used to work with habbush who are convinced that it is his handwriting and signature we are uncovering evidence all the time of saddams dealings with al qaeda and this document shows the extent of the old regimes involvement with the international terrorist network
1979354 but even if that meeting did not take place you have to remember that atta used a large number of aliases when he travelled it is not inconceivable that atta slipped out of the us undetected sometime in the first half of 2001
1979355 it has been spoken about for a long time but things are actually starting to happen
1979356 you forget about the technology if the story is good
1979357 a battered copy of vogue from three months ago and something on sale in the local boutique written in german
1979358 there is a visceral quality that you miss with an old book
1979359 i can control my environment now im not going to live in this ever expanding library
1979360 they represent a democratisation of literature even more important than the public library
1979361 the devices are coming on the market but there still isnt a great deal of content
1979362 it will be a considerable time before e books compete with the paper book
1979363 the book is the most perfect use of technology humanity has ever invented
1979364 they are cheap to mass produce contain a huge amount of easily accessible data and all you need to use them is a small amount of light
1979365 there is a real tactile pleasure in reading books that you just dont get reading from a screen
1979366 the younger generation have spent their formative years reading from screens we dont really know how they are going to react
1979367 it is perfectly conceivable that in the future we could have something that looks like a book feels like a book reads like a book and with separate paper thin pages like a book but which uses e ink instead of the normal kind
1979368 here are five words that i would suggest are usually meaningless in a world where the populations were talking about are limitless in size and diversity and doubling overnight just add the word
1979369 it is an interesting point but i think it is
1979370 series it has become clear that the manufacturers have succumbed to feature creep just because you have a device that has a color lcd screen and a speaker doesnt mean you should shoehorn photo slideshow and mp3 player capabilities into the unit
1979371 i keep getting confused as to when i can or cant water

1979373 set of clear and rigorous principles such that restrictive governments would be unable to ignore or reject these best practices on freedom of expression and the protection of individual privacy
1979374 these errors did not affect the outcome of the election of directors
1979375 but you cant cross the finish line unless you have the secret number

1979377 mccain blogger lies insinuates obama has received more money from big oil than mccain
1979378 tallying contributions by employees in the industry and their families
1979379 there are a ton of different paths that lead to doom
1979380 if there is a silver lining in all of this its that users will become more aware and more conscious of who they do business with
1979381 we have anticipated these flaws in dns for many years and we have basically engineered around them
1979382 its been overplayed in a sense i think it has served to confuse the consumer into believing there is somehow now a way to misdirect them to a wrong site
1979383 the fact of the matter is that there have been many ways like phishing attacks to misdirect them for a long time and this is just yet another of those ways that will be surgically exploited
1979384 the industry has rallied like weve never seen the industry rally before
1979385 quite frankly all the pieces of this have been staring us in the face for decades
1979386 the biggest gap in security rests between the keyboard and the back of the chair
1979387 the look and feel of a website is not what a consumer should trust they should trust the security behind that website and do simple things like use more secure passwords and change their password regularly
1979388 we have been trained since we were young to lock the door to our house our car we take these sensible security measures in the environment we are functioning in
1979389 es el inicio de un nuevo cap tulo para el d lar para trichet y para otros bancos centrales porque ahora centrar n su atenci n en los riesgos del crecimiento

1979391 the world has never needed mutual understanding mutual toleration and mutual cooperation as much as it does today
1979392 anyone who tries to disturb the olympics now by arousing social instability should be severely punished
1979393 i came to beijing last night to celebrate the olympics even though i dont have a ticket
1979394 china is never more glorious than friday the whole world is watching us
1979395 it was the best experience of my life thus far
1979396 as we were coming through the tunnel we were singing o canada a couple times
1979397 its an extremely powerful experience im just extremely proud to be canadian today
1979398 i can tell you there were very few walking wounded
1979399 its premature to jump out there and say exactly what may have happened
1979400 we went around to the bodies and the local police looked in the pockets for identification
1979401 if they had identification then that information was shared between me and the detectives
1979402 there were two ministers that came up from dallas so theyre helping identifying and dealing with the families
1979403 basically we generally know what happened massive blunt trauma but just to cover the bases we ordered two one male and one female
1979404 the bodies were already outside the bus in body bags
1979405 it was still a horrible scene you had bodies and medical personnel police and ambulances it was just a horrible scene
1979406 it reminds you we need to keep praying im praying right now as we speak
1979407 i have four boys ages 10 and under and when i saw this i thought my god said sherman mayor bill magers
1979408 but when you hear about the dead it just hits you
1979409 you never want something like this to happen in your community but the good news is that our first responders did a magnificent job
1979410 what we know is a tremendous amount of people were injured and they are going to require a lot of blood
1979411 we were down to a one day supply in north texas
1979412 metal recyclers have protested provisions that require them to tag and hold certain metals including copper for a certain number of days before mailing checks or making electronic transactions for the metals
1979413 we hate metal theft as much as anyone else in our communities and have been on the front lines with law enforcement fighting to stop it
1979414 but the new statute goes too far in punishing innocent businesses while not stopping the criminals
1979415 desperate to avoid the merits of clemenss claims mcnamee moves to dismiss on insubstantial and frivolous grounds that are contrary to controlling authority which requires mcnamee to answer to a texas court and jury for his intentional conduct that injured a texas resident in texas
1979416 because most of the key witnesses in this case are in the southern district of texas the cost of attendance in new york city for willing witnesses is substantially higher than it would be in houston and the courts in the southern district of texas are less congested
1979417 whether mcnamee falsely charged clemens with using steroids in new york texas or on the moon is of little consequence it simply does not change that mcnamees conduct was calculated to and did harm clemens where he lived and worked

1979420 were disappointed but due to a variety of factors the timing was not right to complete this particular deal
1979421 central florida is quickly becoming a prime distribution center for the state replacing traditional regional distribution hubs such as atlanta
1979422 we are confident in the long term potential of central florida and will continue looking for other development opportunities in the area
1979423 what drives the nader gonzales campaign clearly is the country is in deep trouble
1979424 the giant corporations are tearing the heart and soul out of america in so many ways the corporate crime wave being the more recent one and john mccain and barack obama are ignoring corporate crime they want a bigger military budget they want to stay in iraq they want to expand the war in afghanistan and theyre not good on consumer protection at all
1979425 theyre using a lot of money in their campaigns from commercial interests and in many ways theyre similar
1979426 theyre not really for a living wage theyre both opposed to a canadian style health care system which gives you free choice of doctor and hospital hows that for starters
1979427 no one dies in canada because they cant afford health insurance everyone has it but 18 000 americans die every year according to the national academy of scientists because they cant afford health insurance
1979428 so it does not subordinate environmental consumer and labour rights to the supremacy of commercial power
1979429 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to continue counterterroism missions in iraq against al qaeda
1979430 bush burned down a haystack to try to find a couple of needles he didnt find the needles but there have been 1000s of innocent deaths
1979431 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death
1979432 i dont really have anything worthwhile to say but i might as well bash harper since thats the in thing to do
1979433 in canada you get to choose your own doctor and hospital
1979434 in many ways it was a less doctrinaire year for the court
1979435 on the important cases however the court remains closely divided and justice kennedy continues to play a pivotal role
1979436 i think this is john roberts chief legacy so far
1979437 the court is saying we are going to be very skeptical of facial challenges and demand a high level of evidence
1979438 the court did infer a cause of action in the retaliation cases but said this is really about stare decisis
1979439 it had to do this in a way that was consistent with and didnt do damage to what it has been doing with implied causes of action
1979440 pre emption is so important to businesses which operate in all of the states
1979441 their market is more and more about efficiency which comes from uniformity of regulations and laws a patchwork of regulation is the antithesis of that
1979442 overall it was a good term for business both in the number of cases taken and decisions rendered
1979443 to the extent the court appreciates the difficulties the business community faces i think that represents a significant development in the court as shown by the fact their decisions reflect significant majorities and often only a single dissent or two
1979444 was framed as much by what was not there as by what was there
1979445 the other part of roberts method of having the court mean less and less in terms of the national debate is having a docket with none of the explosive devices available
1979446 there were no major religion speech race or abortion cases
1979447 i think this emerging trend in the difference between facial and as applied challenges is crucial
1979448 the difference is who can sue when they can sue and what kind of relief they can get it partially closes the courthouse door limits judicial remedies and reduces the judicial role
1979449 the court found both sides failed to introduce very much evidence but the burden was on the plaintiffs
1979450 i do think the as applied approach is important and a major device the chief has hit upon to continue to get narrow rulings and rulings with vote margins wider than 5 4
1979451 you get a general discussion of the meaning of the statute which can be helpful but you also get a remand to the lower court
1979452 the proof will be in pudding as to how the lower courts react do they take the hint from the consensus opinion or continue to go their own way we dont have a representative sample on that yet
1979453 we are entering an era where the court is very bitterly divided in its approach to the death penalty baze was about how you do it the five more conservative justices fundamentally have no problem with the system the more liberal members have deep doubts and are persuaded by data about erroneous convictions but they are picking their fights and are not actively trying to join the abolitionist movement
1979454 the first time in our lifetime and probably the only time in our lifetime in which the supreme court is interpreting part of the constitution unencumbered by any precedent
1979455 i think this case is justly big this was a federal case not a state case
1979456 once a right is defined as fundamental it would be difficult not to apply it to the states
1979457 well be in for a round of full employment litigation by all the gun enthusiasts and all the municipalities and states who are going to be defending these laws not to mention the federal government
1979458 the first time the court found an act of congress a violation of the suspension clause and the first time in history the supreme court has ruled that a decision made jointly by the two political branches exceeded their constitutional power
1979459 kennedy takes a functional approach to whether the constitution applies who are you your relationship to the united states where are you held and how hard is it for the courts and the government to give effect to the constitutional right
1979460 in some ways i think it was salutary for the court to express its commitment to a generous application of the writ to show the regular court system will also be applied to people we think have done us wrong
1979461 but when it actually comes to knowing what that actually delivers to the detainee i think thats very little
1979462 the systematic and lopsided deference to business and the raising of the bar for plaintiffs
1979463 so each of those statistics suggest the business cases are less divisive for the court than the run of cases
1979464 i view stoneridge as an area where the court basically said its a statutory issue congress didnt indicate it wanted to do this and were not going to do it on our own we saw this in other cases in the previous term
1979465 really test where the boundary line is between the limited powers of the federal government and the general powers of states to police the general welfare
1979466 in past terms it was difficult to find five votes for any one view but the direction is moving very much in favor of federal pre emption
1979467 if youre going to believe in narrative youll have to believe in that kind of god
1979468 the seduction of my intelligence is that there is something infinite about it but in the exercise of my intelligence to think of a reality there has to be experience i cannot think outside of my sensible experience the sensible quality of table is a formal abstraction ive never touched a man never seen a man the unique character of intelligence is that it operates on abstraction i move myself in the midst of this diversity and at the same time my intelligence touches something that is more than body that the body itself cannot explain this induction respects profoundly the relationship between diversity and unity
1979469 we may resort to horizontal flight pulling back into a small cozy corner of reality where we feel at home or we may resort to vertical flight kicking ourselves free of recalcitrant reality altogether and constructing a more cooperative image of that reality operating solely within out own minds we no longer have to deal with reality but only with what we happen to think about it
1979470 it aint about how hard you hit its about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward how much you can
1979471 this just proves that there is no global warming the lefty scientists have no clue what they are talking about
1979472 tufdawg youre rassling with pigs its not a good idea
1979473 update brian bedwetter at snapped shot who was the one that got bob all hee hawing about photoshopped floods and the like doesnt like us and has blocked our link to his site a sure sign that he stands behind his work so after you see his clever little mohammed carton to which our link has been directed you can copy and paste this link
1979474 if you click through gomer biles links youll discover that his fauxtrage is directed at one photo out of hundreds illustrations photographs and graphics
1979475 keep your heads and arms inside history at all times
1979476 by taking corporate kickbacks mccain is actually representing the lower middle class who have pension funds with these companies
1979477 is it bob owens job to be the designated pawnee for sn

1979479 nine element framework that can help you diagnose your organizations health and address the factors that increase corporate life expectancy
1979480 the industrial era is ending its extraordinary successes advances in literacy life expectancy human rights and technology have propelled us headlong into a myriad of side effects food and water shortages cyclonic destruction prolonged drought and rising sea levels to delay acknowledging the need for lifestyle and business changes the necessary revolution risks our very survival what only a couple of decades ago was still a vigorous scientific debate has become as close to a consensus as scientific communities ever achieve human induced climate change from greenhouse gases concentrating in the atmosphere has reached a threshold of significant social and economic impact and we are only now at the start of experiencing the effects stabilizing atmospheric carbon dioxide will require a profound reversal a 60 80 reduction in growing worldwide emissions in the next twenty years this is the 80 20 challenge and this manifesto presents inspiring real life examples of how this is starting to happen
1979481 private ownership usually creates wealth but too much ownership has the opposite effect it creates gridlock when too many people own pieces of one thing cooperation breaks down wealth disappears everybody loses gridlock is a free market paradox there has been an unnoticed revolution in how we create wealth in the old economy ten or twenty years ago you invented a product and got a patent you wrote a song and got a copyright you subdivided land and built houses today the leading edge of wealth creation requires assembly from drugs to telecom software to semiconductors anything high tech demands the assembly of innumerable patents and its not just high tech thats changed today cutting edge art and music is about mashing up and remixing many separately owned bits of culture even with land the most socially important projects like new runways require assembling multiple gridlocked parcels innovation has moved on but we are stuck with old style ownership thats easy to fragment and hard to put together
1979482 a mini saga is a story told in exactly 50 words not 49 or 51 but in exactly 50 words benefit 1 writing a mini saga expands your creativity constraints typically expand creativity or induce flight when you have to put everything in 50 words you have to leave behind a lot thats where the creative juices start flowing benefit 2 writing a mini saga stretches your thinking what will you write about you have to think about topics that will fit in 50 words or squeeze them to fit in 50 words that puts thinking on overdrive mode benefit 3 writing a mini saga enhances your discipline deciding what to write about deciding what to leave behind and putting it in 50 words requires discipline throughout
1979483 weve developed the tuned in process to allow companies to create success again and again we see these same principles at work in a wide range of successful product experiences such as business to business technology products fast food chains and professional services firms anyone can use tuned in to replicate the model for success it works for well known companies like ford apple and ge and those not so famous like gopro and zipcar it works for realtors doctors ministers and even rock stars with a tuned in approach your everyday activities can be transformed into those which create the kind of culture that builds market leaders
1979484 theres a lot of talk these days especially in business circles about the importance of innovation all ceos worth their low salt lunch want it and they want it of course now innovation they reason is the competitive edge
1979485 tripping over his platinum walking stick or getting his diamond studded monocle stuck in his eye
1979486 see those guys arent any better when you get right down to it
1979487 hey our guy is a loser but hes not a really big loser at least we hope maybe
1979488 i will stop taking creepy pictures of hawt co eds
1979489 he gave in to torture and sold out his country
1979490 the fact that he didnt choose to die at the hands of his captors the fact that he was nothing more than a cog in the wheel fighter pilot back in the old days and they got him thats no goddam path to call him out and if you try it and you dont feel shame im sorry for you mikey
1979491 yes he served john kerry served as well remember millions of americans have served so what
1979492 when my fellow progressives find out my leftwing political affiliations they will go frickin bananas desperately trying to prove i didnt do it because we all know only wingnuts are capable of such nefarious deeds
1979493 theres just something about him that worries me but i cant really describe it
1979494 when my fellow progressives find out my leftwing political affiliations they will go frickin bananas desperately trying to prove i didnt do it because we all know only wingnuts are capable of such nefarious deeds
1979495 clearly mccain didnt learn any moral lessons from his experience so why should anyone else pussyfoot about the subject
1979496 the use of double names without hyphens is fairly common back home
1979497 which in my opinion is actually kind of a nice thing culturally speaking
1979498 america is uh is no longer uh what it could be what it once was and i say to myself i dont want that future for my children
1979499 hes not selling hope hes selling despair and himself as the snake oil that will cure us of all our ills
1979500 there are serious problems with america and i want to make my home a better place
1979501 i hate america and will fight with my last breath to bring her down
1979502 are you better off than you were 4 years ago
1979503 you are going to get sicker and sicker and then die buy dr halberstroms do nothing herbal concoction which wont help ve believe in nussink ve vill cut off your chonson
1979504 to borrow a phrase its like they take pride in their ignorance
1979505 america is uh is no longer uh what it could be what it once was and i say to myself i dont want that future for my children
1979506 i dont like how this is going that is why i want to lead the way to make it better
1979507 the economy will bounce back because these women out here arent going to stop going to get their nails done and going shopping
1979508 id rather have the underarmor of god so i could dominate at rugby
1979509 my solution i could wear bible costumes and go door to door giving out tracts to these poor lost souls i am so so glad that my parents said no
1979510 nothing that happened from 2000 2006 affected 2007 2008 everything went wrong because pelosi became speaker of the house but nothing is really wrong anyway but if it were it would be the democrats fault ftw republicans rule
1979511 geisel allegedly referred to obama with a racial epithet and continued if he gets elected ill assassinate him myself
1979512 good gravy these guys really need a surge in their war against english right now theyre losing badly it would be fairer to call it winglish a weird creole version of english with its own vocabulary and drastically simplified grammar
1979513 comsympinko said domination in rugby requires two elements 1 leverage if youre lower than your opponent it is very difficult for them to move or tackle you 2 leg strength driving over your opponents scrums rucks mauls leaving them with cleat marks on their chest or through their tackles in the loose leaving them wondering what hit them is demoralizing in the extreme stay low and drive everything else will take care of itself
1979514 if you morons would just raise the level of discourse to civil and stop namecalling
1979515 unless you are a fullback then you just need hair that is longer than everyone else on your team and a nice smile
1979516 comsympinko said august 8 2008 at 1 03 fullback is teh suck
1979517 stay low and drive everything else will take care of itself
1979518 but if the tooth fairy really existed it would be great for all us you can see the logic of that cant you
1979519 which isnt really socialism anyway socialism is when the means of production are owned co operatively by the workers and those co operatives are also the political basis of government
1979520 and i thought judging from what pictures surface after our local rugby tournaments that real players go commando
1979521 maybe they can make fun of the way he eats
1979522 im sorry but youre an idiot if you had one available and chose not to wear it
1979523 americas disneyland everythings great not notsberry farm ya big negro ingrate
1979524 the views of chinese youth on the olympic games nation and sports their media behavior of watching the games and their reaction to the great deal of olympic related marketing and pr activities
1979525 the survey results show three product attributes stand out as paramount to installing dealers making their decision about what brand to use
1979526 i tell you what pay me 15 hour and send me articles to edit or cancel my subscription hard to believe the headline today had the same spelling you can cut and paste but cant spell check
1979527 ive been in sales almost 10 years and every so often i have to apologize to a customer when our product isnt up to the quality they should be able to expect i think you owe all of us an apology those are mean streets out there and you dont do your sales people any favors when you produce a paper like the one on tuesday
1979528 in your shoes i would do both scan for malware and block the calls
1979529 im principled and take stands on what i believe in i will change those stands if it allows something else i believe in as often as i choose
1979530 dont put words in my mouth or anticipate what im going to do
1979531 we installed slackware on this old computer i had in my office that was my introduction to open source a student id work with knew about linux and he helped set it up i learned how to admin the box then he graduated and went off so i was the person holding the bag it was a great experience to find out theres this easier and cheaper way an organization could get online
1979532 i had been doing c programming for some research folks when i graduated i was either going to become a programmer or go to graduate school
1979533 i work with my clients to help them figure out the best way to implement technology i help them write bid requests hire web design vendors do project management
1979534 i work with clients who are using various types of open source software
1979535 it was quite serendipitous some colleagues of mine had mentioned me as a possible person to help them out
1979536 i got into open source primarily because i saw it as a way to level the playing field
1979537 i had been working with nonprofit organizations for a very long time and one of the things thats been a real issue for me is that many of these organizations dont have a lot of resources and they want to spend their resources on helping people as opposed to spending them on it its been troubling that in order to get good software theyre forced to spend a lot of money that should be spent on helping people so for me its a lot about putting software in the hands of everybody
1979538 for me thats the primary benefit of open source i dont have anything against proprietary software its fine if you want to pay for it but for me its a crime that organizations that really need good software and do amazing work in the world are often constrained in their ability to get it i value very much the other ideals of open source that you can get at the code and modify and change it if you want to but the way in for me was the level the playing field thing
1979539 this is true over the long term and for all types of different software
1979540 it ebbs and flows i was using drupal and it was atrocious and now its great wordpress was really hard to use and now its like amazing all of this stuff goes through those phases the linux desktop i end up always giving up theres a lot of reasons why that happens but its gotten much better compared to what it was even three years ago
1979541 i would like to see more people of various types and varied levels of expertise involved id like it to be less totally geek driven and more reflective of the wide range of people in the world im not sure how that would happen its not necessarily the open source communitys fault but i think that there would be a lot of interesting benefits if there were more people like designers involved and users who could actually find ways to contribute that are not programming

1979774 so these can be placed vertically for minimum space and easy access
1979775 sign on young man and sail with me the stature of our homeland is no more than the measure of ourselves our job is to keep her free our will is to keep the torch of freedom burning for all to this solemn purpose we call on the young the brave the strong and the free heed my call come to the sea come sail with me

1979779 great video lots of good basic information to help me start learning python easy to watch the videos and then open up an interactive prompt and try out the new features i just learned i also like the web links for additional details
1979780 across the organization associates have contributed to quills growth by providing innovative ideas and solutions for challenges and opportunities
1979781 we launched a program a few years ago to facilitate our ability to become a company of ideas it is this wellspring of ideas coming from all over the company that is helping fuel our growth and will assist us in remaining competitive into the future
1979782 one of our junior staff members modeled out a program that would potentially create a 9 million revenue stream for quill to ensure the ideas success we have promoted her a vice president will mentor her as she works to make sure the idea takes hold throughout the company having worked on creating an innovative environment over the past few years this is the kind of success and excitement we hope to continue to foster well into the future
1979783 sometimes the simplest ideas are ones that make the difference
1979784 since the ultimate goal of the innovation program is to make innovation an organic part of quills approach to business quill recognized that such a program can only be ingrained within the company when it is supported from the top down creating a culture of innovation
1979785 in fact every vice president throughout the company is required to identify three challenges that exist within their areas that are important to the business the vps then must generate innovative ideas to address these opportunities our challenge now is to ensure innovation becomes imbedded in our culture and becomes part of what we do on a daily basis
1979786 inflation expectations are higher than i would like but are relatively stable
1979787 james mirtle is good enough to challenge eric at off wing as the best hockey blogger out there
1979788 his performance during this years trade deadline became its own tribe in brazil
1979789 one of my favorite spots on the internet is mirtles site i wont lie guy knows his stuff and is an excellent writer
1979790 mirtle looks like the kind of guy who would like to take you out to a nice dinner and talk hockey to you all night long
1979791 james mirtle is battling off wing for the title of
1979792 james mirtle bats out one heck of a hockey blog
1979793 want to know what sports blogging can look like when its in the hands of a real journalist
1979794 i think you have to go with matt leinart and hes the future
1979795 playoffs would be a good step forward we have the players in place its time for the cardinals to step it up
1979796 i think we all can see the big picture i understand that if everything were perfect they would want matt to be the starter for 10 years
1979797 and as a friend i want matt to have all the success too but where it gets difficult is that i believe im a proven commodity and that every time ive been given an opportunity ive performed at an extremely high level nothing against matt but i believe i give us some advantages he doesnt at this point and time of his career
1979798 im not trying to convince them that i can play or that i can read coverages or that i know what im doing in this offense
1979799 im just trying to convince them that what they saw last year is at least what theyre going to see this year if not more
1979800 but i approach it as a year where i have to go out there and not necessarily win over my teammates but i have to be the quarterback i know i can be and that my teammates know i can be
1979801 and thats it i think my teammates have confidence in me i think they know i can get the job done i just have to do out there and play and stay healthy
1979802 ive put the time and the work in during this offseason and during last season when i was hurt to get to this point and i feel light years ahead of where i was last year
1979803 its like wow youre arm looks a lot stronger even though it may not be
1979804 your footwork looks a lot quicker even though its probably the same
1979805 youre just more balanced with everything because you know where youre going with the football and thats the biggest thing thats happened to me this summer
1979806 it was tough to deal with but it was something you learn from ive never made an excuse about it and never said anything you take it like a man and move on
1979807 i could say all these things if i wanted but it doesnt really matter it happened and i was disappointed i was disappointed for my family and my son but you learn from it
1979808 even with all that stuff i know my teammates have my back i know they supported me all my coaches saw how hard i was working so something like that i didnt look it as a setback i just looked at it as kind of a road block
1979809 has had an impact fatherhood he has a 2 year old son changes you and makes you grow up in the best way possible thats changed my life and made me more mature as a person
1979810 ive said lets not forget what matt did either and thats why hes named the starter he had a great drive in the fourth quarter against the pittsburgh steelers that essentially won the game for us and showed he could be a big time quarterback and the next week he got hurt
1979811 but with that being said lets also not forget the progress kurt made and that our offense made with kurt doing it we have two quarterbacks who can play in this league
1979812 and hes trying to take it from me and thats the way you have to approach it because its a job and thats what has motivated me this offseason and this training camp to step up and be the guy i know i can be
1979813 that they have to say we want matt and we think hes improved and we think matts going to be a good quarterback but we cant start him we cant go against kurt because hes something special and because he can do something special for us that nobody else in this camp can do right now
1979814 this is not the same as working with a detached element tinos example proves it
1979815 in my experience the usecase where you want to append several childnodes to an element that already has some childnodes is quite slim
1979816 i quite often need to append rows to a table id imagine its a fairly common scenario in many applications
1979817 if you have it between your arms you wont knock it over i have never spilled a drink on the table
1979818 frenemos esos impulsos iniciales para que el tiempo desgaste los nimos de los no comprometidos
1979819 we have lost our way we have a government of men not a government of law were talking about the restoration of constitutional government and the rule of law
1979820 in each town we pass through with every american we meet at every farmhouse and every crossroads we will educate the people about the condition of the country and the solution to its troubles the principles of liberty and the constitution
1979821 we will cut a swath across two states and leave a trail of freedom in our path
1979822 the case for freedom the constitution is the way forward for america
1979823 we will also encourage dialogue about the constitutional issues raised by the presentation we intend to spark thought and discussion giving voice to the people on the most pressing matters facing the nation today
1979824 the response from the people of wisconsin has been tremendous we have town hall meetings scheduled at high schools public libraries american legion posts and churches the responsive participation we are receiving is exemplified by the leader of a boy scouts troop who upon learning of the upcoming meeting offered to distribute flyers to all the parents and scouts at their next gathering he also volunteered to place the flyer on public bulletin boards around town and place an ad in the town newspaper
1979825 i cant believe what this country is becoming its sure not what i went to fight for
1979826 i always say if you dont have rules then youre going have rulers
1979827 someone is going to decide if its not the unbiased law then its going to be men with a self interested agenda
1979828 the happynews glass is always at least half full and sometimes it bubbles right over

1979830 youre our starter aaron dont mind the 7 time all pro local hero sitting on the bench he wont play unless you screw up no pressure
1979831 if as some kind of gesture we said no to new coal fired power stations we would be in a very difficult position of not being able to develop this technology ourselves it requires some new coal powered fire stations for the technology to develop
1979832 world demand for coal is projected to rise by 70 by 2030 an average annual rate of 2 2 and the bulk of the rise will come from india and china
1979833 china is a nation built on coal so the idea that if we showed some kind of lead and we in britain say no to coal and china will say ok we will follow is just daft
1979834 we are responsible for 2 of emissions worldwide and we have a duty to tackle that
1979835 but the real gain here the real challenge and if we do not meet the challenge all is lost on global warming the stakes are that high is to bring on clean coal technology and carbon capture and storage
1979836 once we can develop those technologies we can help the chinese the indians and others to retrofit power stations and make ccs a component of new coal fired power stations that is the only way we are going to tackle this problem
1979837 if we were to have a moratorium on coal fired stations we would therefore most likely become more dependent on gas
1979838 i dont want to exaggerate but gas comes from some fairly unstable parts of the world and some not readily associated with human rights and democracy
1979839 i think if we did that at the moment when we do not know 100 that ccs is going to work the engineering has not yet been tested and no one is fully aware of what the costs might be then that would put an end to coal fired power stations and demonstration plant and people would build gas again
1979840 dr yoests experience in pro life issues in political strategy and in organizational communications make her the ideal person to lead the team at aul in taking on challenges and capitalizing on opportunities in the present legal and political climate
1979841 it is a great honor to join aul an organization with a remarkable reputation for excellence and achievement
1979842 aul has been involved in every pro life case before the u s supreme court since roe v wade and aul authored legislation is in place all around the country saving lives every day

1979862 i sat down and i talked to mike barwis i was on the bike and he told me look at you youre the only person who is not able to finish a workout you dont want to be that guy i thought about it all that night i told myself i didnt want to be that guy i started eating right i started getting my sleep i started drinking a lot of water it was all mental to be honest with you weve been doing it all summer breaking our bodies down to see what we could do in the end he broke me down mentally then he built me back up now im mentally tough like ive never been before in my life
1979863 its somewhere out here in the ground from the sweat
1979864 im kind of a simple guy i live a simple life
1979865 some of the people i probably respect the most both in the profession and guys that are successful in their profession business whatever said coach whatever you do you gotta be yourself and thats what ive always done so thats what you gotta do if youre not youre being fake and i know one thing were not gonna do is be fake
1979866 ive not changed who i am i never have it just seems what was portrayed was changed and that was probably the most disappointing part i mean what i have i done wrong image wise
1979867 its always easier to say whoa than sic em and so were saying sic em
1979868 and if we have to say whoa later well say whoa later
1979869 if it wasnt mine he wouldnt have gotten hired you want to hire a coach that has a like philosophy or youll always be battling scotts personality and philosophy is something anybody would want id hope
1979870 all of them got tested at times i think they know now why were doing that were trying to test them ive seen it sometimes when youre out of shape and getting tired and getting pushed to a new limit its easy to be surly

1979878 we are protesting against the chinese governments failure to live up to the undertakings it made seven years ago when it made its bid to host the olympics
1979879 if we talk more about human rights in china today it is because of protests like this
1979880 pnfs moves the metadata server out of the data transfer path
1979881 instead of having to deal with a number of competing proprietary and open source parallel file systems pnfs will allow users to reap the benefits of parallel storage systems by choosing best of breed solutions without having concerns over vendor lock in
1979882 for environments that need improved performance for large sequential files where parallel access is needed pnfs has some legs moving forward
1979883 however not every environment or application needs parallel access to data
1979884 for mainstream markets pnfs will most likely remain a niche at least near term being used for specialized applications and environments
1979885 the big benefactors of pnfs will be the parallel file systems like those from ibm sun ibrix and others as well as proprietary storage systems like those from panasas
1979886 the architecture for the pnfs proposal was derived from the panasas directflow parallel protocol which is a core component utilized by the panasas panfs parallel file system
1979887 the directflow protocol used in our activestor parallel storage clusters currently provides essentially all of the functionality expected to be available in the nfs 4 1 later this year
1979888 running an organized crime family in a world defined by family loyalty is something that we felt could introduce a new strategic element to the genre
1979889 that is what the dons view is all about its so unique it could fundamentally change the rules of open world games by blending action and strategy to create something entirely new
1979890 users want to go to any server working with any platform at any time and want any virtual machine vm on any platform at any time
1979891 the power of virtualization is achievable if and only if that happens
1979892 has to change its licensing policy to allow independent software vendors to redistribute windows virtual licenses
1979893 you dont want to go from 200 000 pcs which a large enterprise might have to 200 000 virtual machines in the data center thats not going to make it any more manageable
1979894 you go from 200 000 pcs to two windows golden images hosted on a cloud deliver the user product to two virtual machines and stream them to users
1979895 should emphasize what their current policies are and have multiple layers of protection in place and functional to thwart these attacks
1979896 if their spam filters are tight theyll want to make them tighter if they have a layered approach where they also have antimalware a patching policy and spam detectors it may not be so important for them to specifically target olympic related spam attacks
1979897 as long as your operating systems and applications are well patched your antispyware is looking for those types of exploits and you have application control and whitelisting define in place so that only known good applications can run you should be safe
1979898 an independent third party review of antivirus solutions showed they were only catching about 80 to 90 percent of known virus signatures
1979899 keeping an up to date signature database of malware is almost impossible
1979900 to defend something is always to discredit it yes the person who defends that has never believed in it if he does believe then the enthusiasm of faith is not a defence no it is the assault and the victory a believer is a victor

1979902 these incendiary and personal attacks have no place in our politics

1979906 still despite the somewhat disturbing nature of the films made by dove the short physical education is tagged with this movie is not rated and contains graphic images of implied rape and murder he says that he is doing nothing more than providing a product to a niche market his product scream kings a tongue in cheek answer to the scream queens genre that began in the 50s and remained popular right up through the low budget but very high visibility 80s
1979907 now that its well known that rock hudson was gay and died of aids its hard not to look at his filmography in a new light though no one has taken the process as far as mark rappaport in his hour long video rock hudsons home movies this revisionist retrospective suggests that hudson was constantly subverting his own image in his movies blandly revealing the truth about his sexual identity while acting in character if only one knew to listen deconstructing an exhaustive compilation of familiar clips in this context rappaport finds either hilariously campy innuendo or poignant sublimation in every coy line of dialogue or stoic glance that made hudson such an icon of self effacing virility it becomes easy to believe that in all those pseudo sophisticated 50s sex comedies rock was secretly relieved to have his attempts at romance with doris day repeatedly thwarted preferring instead the company of tony randall

1979917 wir haben in der beurteilung der situation absolut auf einer wellenl nge gelegen ich habe mich bei jens f r gro artige leistungen in der nationalmannschaft bedankt sicher wird unser erfolg bei der wm 2006 dank des elfmeterschie ens gegen argentinien immer eng mit seinem namen verbunden bleiben aber auch bei der euro 2008 hatte er einen genauso gro en anteil an unserem erfolg

1979927 i think it would be premature to jump out there and say exactly what may have happened
1979928 we know one contributing factor would be that it appears that a right tire on the tour bus had a blowout and that certainly contributed to the accident
1979929 this brutal new attack ad from house candidate nikki tinker who is challenging liberal tennessee rep steven cohen in tomorrows democratic primary just might be the nastiest most race baiting and jew baiting ad of the entire cycle
1979930 it has no place from a democratic candidate nor a republican candidate nor a white candidate nor a black candidate it is shameful nikki tinker in the tennessee ninth democratic primary for congress todays worst person in the world
1979931 we were shocked to see the recent ads run by the nikki tinker for congress campaign we believe the ads are offensive and divisive
1979932 these incendiary and personal attacks have no place in our politics and will do nothing to help the good people of tennessee
1979933 all the candidates running for the democratic nomination in the ninth district share a commitment to civil rights which transcends partisan labels and political attacks

1979945 it was an unforgettable and moving ceremony that celebrated the imagination originality and energy of the
1979946 ballantine was hoping to show reviewers that the novel wasnt just fluffy historical romance
1979947 spellbergs book was one of the first i read when i wanted to learn more about aisha
1979948 theres nothing in my book that doesnt exist in nonfiction except for a few instances of literary license which are of no great significance
1979949 nobody was saying it was time for a fatwa it didnt feel violent to me it felt like the response i might have expected
1979950 i was never angry about their decision i can imagine how easy it is to push that fear button in new york and theyre a private corporation they can do whatever they want
1979951 and we think readers will find kamran pashas book to be a compelling work of historical fiction that with great respect and sensitivity portrays an empowered muslim woman who helped usher islam into the world
1979952 im just so passionate about her and about telling her tale
1979953 shes one of the most influential women in history and so little is known about her in the western world i really believe she represents the potential in all women
1979954 a better chance that the book will be read by more people

1979958 developing an accurate model of ice would help architects civil engineers and environmental engineers understand what happens to structures and systems exposed to freezing conditions
1979959 it could also help us understand and better predict the movement of glaciers
1979960 but they just stop where they happen to lie in different configurations throughout the crystal with no correlation between them and no single one lowers the energy enough to take over and reduce the entropy to zero
1979961 the original spin ice research went from one part of the periodic table to a more flexible one
1979962 but artificial spin ice goes off the periodic table altogether
1979963 it mimics the behavior of real ice but is completely designable with specific properties
1979964 we can change the strength of the spin or reformulate the alloy to change the magnetic properties which creates new bulk properties that we either couldnt get from normal materials or couldnt control at the atomic level
1979965 this is the first time the rules of ice behavior have ever been rigorously confirmed by directly counting pseudo hydrogen atoms
1979966 we can track the position and movement of each pseudo atom in our model see where defects occur in the lattice and simulate what happens over much longer periods of time
1979967 our meta material is very similar to patterned hard disk media
