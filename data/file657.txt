6570209 people talk about basketball on grass youre making them play in space
6570210 it used to be youd go into the recruiting process and go get those big defensive linemen or big linebackers well guess what they better be able to run because this game has turned in to a much faster game when you play in space you have to cover the whole field
6570211 weve been working in this direction now for the last three years about recruiting personnel to be able to match up against people playing in space
6570212 youre going to see it more and more until defenses show that theyre capable of stopping it
6570213 all three of these freshmen receivers are very good football players all three of them are and theyre all practicing legitimate reps its just that michael right now on the depth chart is ahead of the other two its not because the other two are playing bad its just that hes playing really really well i mean hes pretty good

6570219 id just come off my world tour and got back to toronto and was writing right away
6570220 i had no idea what i was going to do no one did people wondered if id run out of things to write about but it was the opposite
6570221 we got together one night and all of a sudden we had a song
6570222 no one knew what i was up to not my management not my label
6570223 we did that for two weeks and wrote 12 songs
6570224 i was only off my tour for a couple of weeks and i was ready to record
6570225 it was a great time for me living out there being out of the public eye and having my independence and my friendship with chantal evolved into one of the best ive ever had
6570226 i was involved in every aspect of making this record im very hands on
6570227 i knew how i wanted the drums the guitar tones and the structures to be i understand the whole process so much better this time because ive been through it im really picky with my sound
6570228 they all mean so much to me but i love together which is all about being in a relationship and knowing its not right its a song that basically says its not working out honey
6570229 i guess thats just the way that i am now
6570230 im happy with what im doing and have faith that everything is going to work out for the best
6570231 im such a chick im a hopeless romantic and surprisingly old fashioned
6570232 thats why i wrote a song about not giving it up to just any guy
6570233 i feel refreshed and im looking forward to the next thing
6570234 the songs on under my skin are definitely deeper than those on let go

6570246 what were striving to do is actually do a more proactive role within the plant situation
6570247 as opposed to having our inspectors standing line by line theyll have a more oversight role within the plant itself

6570285 i feel like a champagne bottle that got shook up im totally excited about people hearing it because i want them to know how much i love my music theres only one way to prove it its not about being old school or new school its about being classic im not really interested in all that legend and icon its cool i mention it here and there but i really wanna make a hot joint if i never made an album before i think this album would be hot when theres pressure situations i usually deliver
6570286 i have a remix of baby with richie sambora which is a rock joint
6570287 we creatively put our heads together i told him i wanted that talk box slippery when wet by bon jovis is one of my favorite albums i thought the talk box on a couple of the songs was incredible livin on a prayer especially so i got richie to do it on the baby remix it sounds crazy then he did some vocals and he did some guitar solos so its good imma drop it out there shoot it out there and give people a chance to feel it we been talking about it having some good conversations
6570288 i thought his voice would do that song so much justice
6570289 it resonates it has that truthful energy to it that pain i wrote a song that basically its a letter to the president if i had an opportunity to have a conversation with him id pose a few questions to him in a respectful manner because i think that as a community we can get further with me asking him questions in a respectful manner than me talking crazy instead of me starting a bunch of ruckus i pose a bunch of questions that i thought were fairly intelligent to him and well see if theres a response that comes back the questions are relevant to our current president and at the same time could be posed to a president that comes in office after bush because none of the problems will be resolved theyre pretty timeless questions
6570290 dear mr president with all due respect wish we could have a conversation i would take a trip down to your residence and we would talk about the state of the nation
6570291 dont get me wrong i respect the flag but it hurts to see a kid in a body bag he fought for his country with all he had now we have a family without a dad lil mamas crying the kids are scared on 9 11 why were we unprepared
6570292 with a guy he can connect with dads in a different kind of way its really powerful stuff
6570293 it feels different to have a guy come in to work with your kids a woman has a womans touch and people are more accepting and ready for her advice we had to find the right person who has real authority and a gentle touch as well
6570294 he has lots of experience at the top level and his international record is phenomenal

6570357 fue una excelente pregunta parece una tonter a pero es un problema complicad simo en general puede decirse que tienen una sola cr a aquellas especies que invierten toda la energ a en producir un descendente que sale muy desarrollado y por el contrario tienen muchas cr as las especies que reparten su energ a en muchos cuerpos poco desarrollados
6570358 somos la especie m s tolerante que existe en la naturaleza

6570366 is given to those who have demonstrated a lifetime of outstanding achievement and merit of the highest degree especially in service to canada or to humanity at large
6570367 but what constitutes outstanding achievement and merit of the highest degree there is no question that terry fox met and exceeded those qualifications some other choices however are more dubious how has former teen idol paul anka served humanity at large by singing why david ahenakew and not clarence louie chief of the osoyoos band who received the order of british columbia in 2006 and who serves as an outstanding role model for the kind of economic independence first nations bands can achieve

6570373 we have more than 200 cards like to address a traditional wedding a second wedding or an interracial wedding

6570378 obviously they are paying attention to a trend in the culture weve been pleased in new hampshire to pass a civil union law we celebrate civil unions here i hope soon to be able to say were celebrating a marriage
6570379 each person should be free to choose as we will with this issue and not legislate our particular morality on others
6570380 if you dont like the cards dont buy them when i went to testify in concord on the marriage equality bills i was amazed at what i heard from my colleagues allowing this does not constrain their religious freedom at all
6570381 we feel everyone should have the right to be who they are

6570387 i would ask why are you here and they looked at me like i was dumb

6570610 when they play in the national team they play against the best xi from another country and the level is high it is not as easy as when you play with the club it is different
6570611 the movement of rooney and the work that he does in every game is very important for me
6570612 i think rooney gerrard and other players are not in perfect condition physically at the moment that will be very important
6570613 maybe at times i am a bit too honest and at club level the manager is telling me not to defend too much to try and save some energy for when we are attacking
6570614 but sometimes you just want to win the ball back and work hard for the team that is just how i play
6570615 maybe it does affect my goals tally but hopefully i can learn and get better
6570616 you have to understand that this player was not in a good condition at the moment
6570617 it was the first time they played without fear at wembley well or not well but they played with no fear this is important this is the style of the english player
6570618 i spoke with some people in the dressing room and after the first half they were happy also the players
6570619 in the first half we shot six or seven times and i think one of the best players was petr cech because he made three saves this is important for me
6570620 beckham plays not only for free kicks and set pieces but because he plays well

6570643 reframing involves the ability to see things differently including new ways of thinking about an organizations strategic challenges and basic capabilities it involves questoning or restating the implicit beliefs and assumptions that are often taken for granted by organization members it plays a critical role in the formative phases of the strategic learning process from assessing where we are through learning how to get there
6570644 mintzberg argues that strategy emerges over time as intentions collide with and accomodate a changing reality thus one might start with a perspective and conclude that it calls for a certain position which is to be achieved by way of a carefully crafted plan with the eventual outcome and strategy reflected in a pattern evident in decisions and actions over time this pattern in decisions defines what mintzberg called realized or emergent strategy

6570649 im excited because i have got an apple iphone i am not bothered about the price good things come at a price
6570650 i have been waiting for a year to buy one last year i missed buying the iphone 2g which was launched june 5 as i left for the us on june 3 now i am very happy to have got the latest one
6570651 i already have five iphones this is the sixth i bought it because my family wanted it the earlier phones were 2g this is 3g

6570657 they decided this instrument the tat probe would be adequate to use as a ladder
6570658 are now doing things to our aircraft that may put our lives and the lives of our passengers at risk
6570659 its manifestly moronic because youre writing about a scheduled event that is going to take place on a known timeline youre contributing nothing its the opposite of news any useful public information is entirely missing but thats the way the press bubble operates not only do reporters write about what theyre talking about but theyre writing about each other
6570660 the only important issue about saddleback is that the constitution specifically forbids any religious test for office so why are you having an evangelical minister asking the two candidates about their relationship to christ but the people who are in charge of delivering useful information to the public about the process have no historical frame of reference they literally dont know what theyre doing
6570661 the best source of information is the print media though it is increasingly mimicking the structure of tv coverage online reporting doesnt help much its real time coverage so you not only get who won the day but ideologically interested people are steering things in one direction or the other
6570662 its not a stretch to say that the media largely defeated al gore
6570663 come out that little studio and stand with the people like a man stop standin behind a desk stand out here with the people and lets see where your heart is
6570664 there is no conventional establishment old style conservative candidate mitt romney pretended to be one for awhile but he wasnt rudy giuliani sort of pretended but he wasnt mccain is certainly not its not only a lack of political talent theres just no driving force and it will soften up normal republicans for change
6570665 i still see you as a central midfielder but the problem is that neil lennon and stilian petrov are doing too well in that area to be left out or moved elsewhere if i had to select a team for the next match and the three of you were all fit i would have to plump for neil and stilian
6570666 i would like to return to football but a lot of the jobs arent that much different from the ones i had at coventry and southampton maybe thats my true level as a manager but i would like to try something more exciting
6570667 well we dont know how long martin is going to be here he will never get the sack from celtic but maybe he will want to go somewhere else
6570668 there is something in the pipeline for me so i could be going somewhere myself in a few weeks
6570669 if you do make sure you have a get out clause in your contract
6570670 i bet you couldnt believe what he was saying to you but take it from me he meant every word he does not tell porky pies
6570671 i know you are the major shareholder but i am not coming along if its just you who wants me here
6570672 look if you dont fancy me just let me know and i wont come here you have my promise that if this is the case i wont drop you in it i will just make an excuse
6570673 if he was not a football club chairman he would probably be an estate manager
6570674 how many people do you know in professional football with the name rupert
6570675 no mr chairman of course he shouldnt have done that
6570676 i know why you are here bet those two are getting on your breests again
6570677 you know gordon i think i have cracked this game of football now it is very much like hockey
6570678 the next time im going to knock you into the stand
6570679 youve had many years to do that to me and youve not been able to do it once even though im 40 now youve no chance

6570682 and isnt it true that this july 12 2005 letter from ms lustila to you addresses the very same concerns that you raised in the december 27 2005 letter from your attorney
6570683 is it a substantive response to your claims of procedural violations or failure to identify the student
6570684 does it specifically address your sons prior history in special education and the comments made by ms
6570685 does it contain substantive information about your sons prior history
6570686 okay does it address the concerns about statements made by mrs foco and ms foisy im referring you to paragraph two on b 24 page one of two does it address your concerns that you had raised concerning statements made by mrs foco and ms foisy does ms lustila address those concerns in this letter
6570687 not in a substantive fashion in isnt it true you just didnt like ms lustilas answers to the questions you posed
6570688 also our members are very committed to their job so walking off the job is a major issue for them
6570689 we know there are major understaffing issues in the banks already so any staff not being at work will put pressure on those services
6570690 there will be some regional branches that close but were not anticipating significant branch closures to be fair thats actually not the point the point is to send a strong message to the bank that we expect them to be a good corporate citizen

6570695 was outside the building in a car at the time of the murder
6570696 at reneaus trial the prosecution had argued that reneau was the person chiefly responsible for the crime and that woods role was secondary
6570697 wood was involved in the robbery in this case because of his longstanding mental illness that allowed him to be easily manipulated by the principal actor daniel reneau
6570698 executing someone who didnt kill violates the most basic principles of justice
6570699 if a person is only mentally ill and not incompetent the decisions are less clear and are up to individual judgments by the governor or the jury
6570700 it is awkward and quite strange to see states force inmates to take medication so they can be killed but this is the hateful nature of our capital punishment system
6570701 it has very little to do with logic and certainly nothing to do with compassion
6570702 the church in india is shocked and deeply saddened by this barbarous killing the result of a growing climate of intolerance and violence against christians in this country
6570703 but he did not die in vain because his body and his blood enrich the church in india particularly the church in andhra pradesh
6570704 we think this agreement is very good for the united states and india and for the international community otherwise we would not be pursuing this
6570705 a rivalry made all the more precarious by the resignation on tuesday of the pakistani president pervez musharraf
6570706 with mr musharraf gone an arms race on the sub continent would likely be more difficult to control
6570707 its condominiums where ill have them get to you he said before quitting the campaign trail for three days to strategise with top aides as both the candidates finalise their choice of running mate
6570708 now think about that i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make us5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong he said
6570709 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their house you might have a different perspective
6570710 so theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6570711 we cant afford eight more years or four more years or one more year of the same failed economic policies that president george bush has put in place senator obama said
6570712 heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6570713 he couldnt count high enough to know how many houses he owns he said on cnn before introducing senator obama in chester by countering republican charges that the relatively inexperienced democrat is too
6570714 to put somebody in the white house who says i dont know much about the economy thats whats risky mr kaine said recapping senator mccains own confession that he knows more about national security than about economic affairs
6570715 also our members are very committed to their job so walking off the job is a major issue for them
6570716 we know there are major understaffing issues in the banks already so any staff not being at work will put pressure on those services
6570717 there will be some regional branches that close but were not anticipating significant branch closures to be fair thats actually not the point the point is to send a strong message to the bank that we expect them to be a good corporate citizen

6570719 we need a bit of time to work on this
6570720 whatever the cut off there will always be those who felt they were left behind
6570721 while it wishes to be as inclusive as possible there is a need to start the new measures at a specific date in considering the feedback from some expectant parents and moving the qualifying date more couples will now be able to benefit from the enhanced m amp p package
6570722 the government hopes that employers would be able to do their part and support the enhanced leave provisions even though these will only take effect when the laws are amended
6570723 im not surprised that theres a change because i think a lot of the feedback was valid
6570724 we did think that this might be an issue but we still wanted to give some time to implement the measures because it would mean a cleaner implementation giving employers time to adjust and so on
6570725 i think clearly this is something our parents care about so we want to do something
6570726 shows that we appreciate and value this group of parents as well
6570727 i think a lot of people were also frustrated they thought there was no use complaining because the government would not change its position
6570728 i think this will show that they are listening to what people have to say
6570729 the plan was to work with employers to implement before the deadline anyway
6570730 we have these fake queues at front of 20 stores around the country to drum up interest in the iphone

6570735 it wont go there today but certainly over the next two or three days we could see the australian dollar higher again
6570736 its more a weaker us dollar stronger commodities story than anything else
6570737 weve had a good month of us dollar strength so i would suggest it is a pause

6570741 when he was in power he did not do anything when he is not in power now he makes 1 001 promises to the people this is just playing politics
6570742 this means that each childcare centre should impart essential life skills and provide the right learning environment they should never be pressure cookers and should haveactivities which help our children develop into well balanced and happy young people
6570743 also serve the larger purpose of encouraging more births as families are assured of good care options
6570744 we hope to push the industry towards achieving higher staff retention rates better working conditions and to attract talent into the field
6570745 we will also be working with childcare operators and the moe ministry of education in the coming months to formulate an integrated curriculum framework for the entire early childhood education and care sector for younger children an even more holistic approach is advocated
6570746 it was something i strongly advocated before i embarked on my political career in the 1980s many people used to see childcare centres as places where young children go to eat play and sleep while their parents are at work
6570747 crucially the research has revealed that those who become terrorists are a diverse collection of individuals who fit no single demographic profile nor do they all follow a typical pathway to violent extremism
6570748 i gamle dage under sovjetisk styre troede vi ikke et ord af vores egen propaganda men vi troede at oplysningerne var fri i vesten og vi l ngtes efter det

6570751 som en steurop isk diplomat h rtes knurre kom til orde og
6570752 adspurgt om den russiske pr sident vladimir putin sagde gorbatjov at selv om han oprindelig havde tvivl om putin er i stand til at f re rusland st tter han ham nu

6570758 in the old days under soviet rule we didnt believe a word of our own propaganda but we thought that information was free in the west and we longed for it
6570759 but we have learnt since that the west has its own propaganda and in some ways it is more powerful because people believe it
6570760 the planners of this campaign clearly wanted to make sure that whatever the outcome russia would be blamed for worsening the situation the west then mounted a propaganda attack against russia with the american news media leading the way russia was already being accused of aggression news reports were often an embarrassing recitation of the georgian leaders deceptive statements
6570761 as one eastern european diplomat was heard to growl had their say and
6570762 asked about russian president vladimir putin gorbachev said that while he initially had doubts about putin being able to lead russia he now supported him
6570763 putin is a very capable person a wise person a man of strong character of few words but with good management skills
6570764 now he is more than just a manager he has become a credible political leader
6570765 i think that we have not been able to establish proper governance in the global world
6570766 in den alten zeiten unter sowjetischer herrschaft glaubten wir kein wort unserer eigenen propaganda aber wir dachten dass die informationen im westen frei seien und wir sehnten uns danach
6570767 aber wir haben gelernt der westen hat seine eigene propaganda und gewissermassen ist die kraftvoller weil die menschen ihr glauben
6570768 die planer dieser kampagne wollten offensichtlich sicherstellen unabh ngig vom ausgang w rde russland einer versch rfung der situation beschuldigt werden der westen setzte dann eine propaganda attacke gegen russland ein mit den us medien an der spitze russland wurde die aggression bereits vorgeworfen nachrichten meldungen waren oft ein peinliches vorlesen der irref hrenden aussagen des georgischen f hrers
6570769 das beste was wir tun k nnen ist nichts zu tun
6570770 wie man einen osteurop ischen diplomaten murren h rte zu wort kamen und
6570771 russland braucht seine westlichen partner aber russland ist nicht und will auch nicht junior partner ein baby bruder sein der macht wie der westen befiehlt die probleme in der kaukasus region k nnen durch gewalt nicht gel st werden es wurde mehr als einmal w hrend der letzten zwei jahrzehnte versucht und es hat immer r ckschl ge bedeutet der westen t te gut daran einen beitrag zur erreichung einer einigung zu leisten erwarten sie sonst das schlimmste
6570772 auf die frage ber den russischen pr sidenten vladimir putin sagte gorbatschow dass obwohl er urspr nglich zweifel h tte ob putin in der lage sei russland
6570773 putin ist eine sehr f hige person eine weise person ein mann mit starkem charakter der wenigen worte aber mit guten verwaltereigenschaften
6570774 nun ist er mehr als nur verwalter er hat sich zu einem glaubw rdigen politischen f hrer entwickelt
6570775 es sei denn man ist der verstorbene bobby fischer will man mit den russen nicht schach spielen russen spielen nicht um den n chsten zug sondern um in die position zu kommen um an die position zu gelangen wo sie die z ge machen k nnen die man nicht kommen sieht
6570776 david rockefeller henry kissinger und val ry giscard destaing besuchten gorbie 1989 und berredete ihn zur aufl sung der sowjetunion ebenso wie eu kommissionspr sident jacques delors im gleichen jahr wie die berliner mauer fiel gorbie ist offenbar der einzige russische gespr chspartner f r den westen ber die weitere entwicklung ihres neuen weltordnungs projekts regierung in der globalen welt zu errichten
6570777 seine fangarme erreichen viele bereiche des v lkerrechts und der politik verlangt am ende die unterwerfung aller nation zu einer globalen umwelt regierung eine von vielen bem hungen die er zur umsetzung und durchsetzung der bernationalen zust ndigkeiten unternimmt
6570778 our belief was that newsight would have completed its financing transaction in the first half of 2008 laying the groundwork for newsights future operations

6570792 well i asked where we buy tickets so i guess that answers that

6570794 even then i have to pay so many additional charges that i sometimes just stay in the office until 10pm
6570795 you people are too spoilt cars taxis why not go for public transport after all doesnt singapore have one of the most efficient bus and train systems in the world
6570796 you so smart you go and take our public transport now
6570797 trains have been getting more packed because more people are taking them to avoid the erp gantries
6570798 comme les hadrons sont des particules composites ils peuvent aussi appara tre sous des tats excit s
6570799 el iphone 3g ha registrado una demanda sin precedentes entre nuestros clientes en el reino unido espa a e irlanda y esperamos un xito similar en latinoam rica
6570800 its not like we are wealthy people but theyll kidnap you for a watch everyone is living in fear
6570801 before they only kidnapped key well known economically successful people like industrialists and landowners now they are kidnapping people from the middle class
6570802 must have double income singapore too expensive to live on one paycheck alone
6570803 wah you really support the gahmens baby policies is it why not have one more can get four months maternity leave now you know lots of baby bonus
6570804 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies
6570805 they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
6570806 we just reacted because we didnt have any other option any civilised country would act same way i may remind you september 11th the reaction was similar american citizens were killed you know the reaction
6570807 lets be clear our troops have completed every mission theyve been given they have created the space for political reconciliation
6570808 by using months old quotes and selective editing the obama ad distorts mccains assessment of the economy
6570809 to just say i dont know on the most divisive issue in america is not a clear enough answer for me
6570810 that importance of government agencies reacting quickly to rumours that are getting out of control cannot be overestimated
6570811 the traditional media as i see in singapore need to get out of their comfort zone they need to become a whole lot more bold a lot more questioning in order to better reflect the range of opinions out there in private life
6570812 the media field there has become very interesting very lively but they still have the peoples daily which officials and ordinary chinese citizens instinctively go back to if they want to know official positions what is the position coming down from beijing
6570813 then once you read the alternative media youre in a position to use the grey matter and say ok fine i know whats the agenda on the other side i also know whats the agenda in the mainstream media
6570814 for the citizens themselves you can see there are some qualifications put in for example pm says the footage has to be factual it cannot be made up it cannot be slanted now that itself is open to a lot of interpretation
6570815 a lot of it is just human beings establishing contacts sharing joys and disappointments
6570816 matt does stuff anwar gets stuff and i think about stuff
6570817 thats what makes design great design is all around you its so important everybodys involved in design somehow
6570818 dont work for them unless you want to be underwhelmed and underpaid
6570819 good place to hide if you want an easy life
6570820 there is an initial level of discomfort for chief executives but most see this as inevitable
6570821 people dont talk enough about how they can be more valuable this should help them knowledge is power
6570822 we take data integrity very seriously we have technical and procedural mechanisms that all postings go through
6570823 more than 10 per cent of postings are not allowed
6570824 patton said the stick was in my hand i think i felt it but it wasnt in all the way before i grabbed it i take the blame for it it was my fault
6570825 its great to come out and defend my gold medal and its been great to see jamaica get a clean sweep of the sprints
6570826 as a working mother i do benefit quite a lot
6570827 my in laws care for my child now but if i choose to send my children to a childcare centre in future i can use the childcare subsidy
6570828 i guess it means ill not be paying taxes for an even longer time
6570829 it will come in useful to ease the demands on us
6570830 from the feedback we got from consulting women it is really a huge demand on them to want to have children and also worry about the cost and do well in their career so we wanted to help these women as much as possible
6570831 this will help these women the converts who already want to have children significantly
6570832 se fractur una rodilla y tiene magulladuras por todo el cuerpo pero dentro de lo que cabe no lo est llevando mal

6570836 la crisis de spanair desemboca en una tragedia de 153 muertos
6570837 no me atrever a a decir que spanair descuida la seguridad de sus aviones ni mucho menos
6570838 in fact i saved the addresses and banking information of1 5 million clients
6570839 brazil have to work hard to form a team because nothing will happen with just big names with 11 big names a team has to be prepared if the players dont know that it will be difficult to form a team
6570840 its not good for us against argentina its always very difficult with a great rivalry
6570841 losing the game to argentina in this way is really shameful
6570842 we will try to find motivation for our next match thats my role as captain
6570843 its difficult because our goal was to win the gold medal
6570844 were trying to build a new team for the world championships in 2011 and the important thing is what the girls do in the match working on the speed of their passes one on one defence
6570845 some of the teams like samoa are sending a young team well have to do our homework in the first few days but i suspect samoa will be the biggest challenge as they have some depth in their three new zealand based players
6570846 i feel more responsibility as one of the seniors on the team
6570847 im really excited and nervous about the nations cup as its my first international tournament but i hope to apply what our coach has taught me
6570848 we are here to bury anwars political career we are here to make history to ensure our nations future is free and safe from him
6570849 i am afraid that if anwar is elected as a mp and forms a new federal government our country will be sold to the united states
6570850 anwar had an interview with malaysiakini i readmalaysiakini and they asked anwar whether he took saiful overseas and he replied yes
6570851 i dont understand why he would take a coffee boy a volunteer without a fixed salary overseas i never take my coffee boy abroad
6570852 if i really am going to be charged with 15 years prison i ask that others also be brought to trial
6570853 it helps me to communicate better with toddlers as they are very young and have limited english vocabulary
6570854 one of the challenges in this profession is getting staff to continually upgrade their skills many people leave because they feel it does not pay as well as other jobs but you cant compare what we do with another industry say finance
6570855 when you throw 16 23m at such a big meet like the olympics what does it mean i dont know
6570856 since her personal best of 18 57m in 2005 she has gone downhill
6570857 i wouldnt close the door on her but she needs to let her performance and results do the talking
6570858 we will still support her if she shows us her plans for the future but if she is only interested in asking for help in covering miscellaneous expenses then im sorry no weve had bad experiences with that in the past
6570859 we saa wanted to send her to high level meets in europe but she declined it seems that she is happy with just competing in smaller meets
6570860 she keeps giving excuses for not wanting to go and that has been the main reason for us being at odds
6570861 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100m
6570862 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6570863 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion
6570864 he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6570865 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 1930s
6570866 im in los angeles right now getting ready to leave for the tour
6570867 my lashing out was confined only to the pitch in that game it was the passion of a cup final
6570868 we knew that it was our only chance at any silverware for the season after very narrowly losing out in the league and it was an emotional match we went ahead three times only to lose 4 3
6570869 it all got to me and i guess i just lost it as the clock started ticking down in the state of mind that i was in i would have taken it out on my best friend even
6570870 i have learnt my lesson and i will keep my temper in check i regret what i did
6570871 but it is this passion and aggression on the field that make me the player i am if you take that away from me i do not think i can be the same player i am today
6570872 when the club called me on monday to say they were ready to register me i was really excited i just packed my bags and drove from kl to singapore that same night
6570873 i reached singapore at about 3 30am on tuesday and i was down for my first training with tampines that very same day
6570874 when the coach handed me the green bib at training meaning i was playing in the opposition and not in the team that the coach was planning for the match it really hit me i was gutted
6570875 it felt like i was finally let out of jail after finishing my term only to be told to go back in again for three more games
6570876 will seek a new agreement within the boundaries of the law
6570877 we cant ban a folk belief but we hope to change how it is practised to ease pollution and eventually to phase the habit out
6570878 in the past we burnt several truckloads of paper money brought by our followers in ghost month the stoves cracked after burning non stop and the smoke was terrible
6570879 tampines are very good at keeping the ball and moving it around so we will have to restrict their space and time on it
6570880 there is no point for us trying to send in crosses because defender kenji arai is good in the air
6570881 she may be playing with millions of chinese behind her but i will also have millions of singaporeans supporting me
6570882 i remember that match when i beat her 3 1
6570883 i will try to recall what i did well back then and we will see how it goes
6570884 right now i am only focused on my own form
6570885 these next few hours thats what i will do i have been getting better and better with every match in the team event and now in the singles and im happy with my form
6570886 we should be down by double digits so we are definitely outperforming
6570887 you can tell any story you want to about this race at any point in it
6570888 we have one of the finest midfielders in steven gerrard he plays for liverpool and he is like roy of the rovers he shoots he scores he tackles he is not a left midfielder it is unbelievable he has to be in the centre
6570889 that was one of the worst performances i have seen from an england team what positives can you take from that
6570890 the second half was diabolical we keep chopping and changing managers and we dont improve ive not seen fabio capellos teams play worse than that
6570891 we played 4 3 2 1 we played defoe gerrard and rooney and three midfielders behind them
6570892 as the olympics here in beijing come to a close i know your pens laptops and cameras will turn south to south africa
6570893 this journey that south africans have been on started in 1994 when we registered our intent to bid to host the 2006 world cup finals with fifa we lost to germany by 11 votes to 10 when the announcement was made in 2000
6570894 from despair then we tasted joy in 2004 the journey is embedded in the very soul of the nation
6570895 this will be the first mega sports event hosted on the african continent so it must be the best world cup ever to open doors for all african countries
6570896 yes we do have a plan b but that is for instances when the situation is out of south africas control and out of fifas control and we have to move the tournament
6570897 it is just like when sars hit china and we had to move the womens world cup to the united states right now we are on the right track and right timing
6570898 nothing is ready yet in south africa just like in germany in 2004 two years before their world cup
6570899 for the time being there is no red light and the world cup is in south africa
6570900 from the moment you arrive at the airport in beijing everyone is so friendly and the systems are efficient passport control visa requirements the helpful staff the transport out everything works so well that first impression is so important to set the tone for the rest of the experience and we have to get that right
6570901 we need to break away from the welter of negative publicity in the press and the media that our continent receives
6570902 we are going to celebrate africas humanity with the world
6570903 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6570904 its about the issues that everyones talking about but theres a lot of hope
6570905 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6570906 there was healthy competition among artists to create art that was commercial and political at the same time
6570907 our music now is not representing the times at least not socially and politically or maybe were just distracted
6570908 these musicians speak to millions of people every day so for them to use their voices to inspire people is a key part of our program
6570909 everyone is great and she is a healthy beautiful baby girl
6570910 there are some people who claim that we are unfair
6570911 we provide fair and equal opportunities to all races in this country
6570912 coincidence crass political exploitation why not penang boy chong wei getting the award in his home state is the perfect setting except for that little by election gig where anwar is heavily involved it was inevitable lee chong wei has unwittingly or not been made a fodder in this by election battle
6570913 any systematic experimental and investigative study that involves novelty and technical risk
6570914 lets be positive and give this a try to achieve what we have set out to do promote r amp d activities in singapore
6570915 in the retail industry not many people would be qualified to claim the tax now given a broader base i think more people may be able to
6570916 taxpayers must be truly motivated by this to do more r amp d and the inland revenue authority of singapore in applying its judgment on these definitions does not disincentivise and demotivate taxpayers such that this becomes a failure
6570917 tv will fundamentally change how we talk about imagine and experience the internet
6570918 this effort is one of what we believe will be many exciting new ways to bring the internet to the tv and it really shows the potential of what consumers can look forward to
6570919 would no longer be a passive experience unless the viewer wants it that way
6570920 we plan totransform traditional tv into something bigger better and more exciting than ever before
6570921 yahoo plans to enable the cinematic internet ecosystem which will benefit consumers device makers advertisers and publishers
6570922 we remain confident that infinitys proposal stands a strong chance given that our new partner has significant global experience both in the sector as well as in related areas
6570923 no reason was given although we believe the direction and strategy of the bid could have prompted such a move
6570924 i dont think that they can change the terms to state if qatar can invest more or not
6570925 these companies starhub and m1 definitely have the capability of implementing it the new broadband network as long as they have the financial investment to support it its just how much you are willing to spend
6570926 starhub has both the technical and operational experience of rolling out a nation wide broadband network in singapore m1 brings a wealth of operational and management experience to the consortium and qia represents substantialfinancial and business support
6570927 it remains to be seen whether this is going to help markets anticipate policy changes but it should
6570928 the risk they have is that people start to focus on minor changes in wording of the post meeting statements as they do withthe fed
6570929 queenslanders have expressed concern about this virus and thats why ive asked the dpi to undertake an independent review of their emergency response in this case as part of biosecurity queenslands normal best practice
6570930 we will work together to identify what needs to be done to accelerate hendra research
6570931 thats why i have asked that a high level working group be established with relevant government departments research groups and stakeholders
6570932 this group would work to identify further research opportunities as well as ways to reduce the risk of hendra transmission

6570938 im not happy with this because the people are not getting satisfaction from riding the trains
6570939 i just saw the plight of people using the trains to get to work every morning
6570940 theres no queue people push their way in women with children and old people are pushed aside
6570941 the difference is the difference between popularity and the underground your favorite obscure bands
6570942 petty tyrants the scourge of human rights freedom and privacy
6570943 people people can we please keep this board civilized even discussing a mexican sullies our lit
6570944 ok thanks please post back here when if it ever gets fixed
6570945 by tunneling deep into their pasts their paranoias and anxieties their troubled romantic relationships their outsize dreams lacy delivers a sophisticated psychological study of an ascendant economic class
6570946 like any spaniard i am in mourning but we have to go ahead with the european grand prix this weekend
6570947 this part of the city is not really heavy with traffic
6570948 we actually closed 90 per cent of the track since monday we wanted to make sure it is in top condition for the racing this weekend
6570949 this is the summer holiday period for us and people have generally been supportive of the grand prix in fact 80 per cent of the 112 000 tickets have been bought by foreigners from outside of valencia and the rest of europe
6570950 those who can be disciplined in theirinvestment strategy would be looking at the present environment as presenting opportunities that do not come true everyday
6570951 you buy when there is blood on the street and sell when there is euphoria
6570952 obviously there will be ups and downs as anyone knows with regards to investments and these would be quite trying times
6570953 phenomenal rise in a very short time of a number of new kids on the block
6570954 the intuitive distrust of swfs and their investment objectives arises from the assumption that swfs are created for political objectives and not to optimise returns on government reserves this scepticism has at its roots the distrust of the political system and political governance of certain swf governments
6570955 temasek is not and has never been a conventional swf singapore has no oil money no natural resources we are not tasked with managing the countrys foreign reserves we were formed simply to take a load off a government that had other priorities
6570956 for example in the us germany canada and japan we see looser definitions of national security and more complex regulations to evaluate investments on grounds of security
6570957 the us attitude towards swfs has been more welcoming as the us deals with the credit crunch but once the emergency has passed foreign money may become less welcome again
6570958 theres a lot of buzz around these devices and a lot of people have been waiting for the iphone 3g when we heard that the iphone was going to be launched here we started developing itoday to give people more ways to access our content while theyre on the move
6570959 in the coming months well update it adding search capability and increasing the size of the archive
6570960 were looking at how readers can interact online and enjoy an even more compelling experience with today perhaps they would be able to contribute news tips and post comments using itoday
6570961 we have these fake queues at front of 20 stores around the country to drum up interest in the iphone
6570962 when a horse accidentally bangs his leg with his other leg and gives himself a little bruise we ll give him some of these big aspirins
6570963 any foreign substance they pick up pretty much means disqualification you have to be so so careful
6570964 we fully appreciate and share your concern about the potential civil liberties implications of the consolidated guidelines
6570965 afford appropriate protections for our civil rights and civil liberties
6570966 this was not a shooting that was a random act
6570967 we dont know the particulars as to why it escalated to the situation that occurred today
6570968 we have received the notification from the russians though military channels and they say that they have decided to halt international military cooperation events between russia and nato countries until further instruction
6570969 i cant imagine a circumstance right now in which we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6570970 right now it is too early to make confirmation that all military cooperation has stopped
6570971 mr rogozin will be in moscow for consultations with our leadership and after that we can confirm or refute
6570972 cooperation with nato is a complex issue and until the russian political leadership makes a decision on its future the defense ministry has frozen military cooperation with the alliance
6570973 we are not abandoning the nato russia council but as long as russian forces are occupying a greater part of georgia i cannot see a nato russia council convening at any level
6570974 as per the order of the supreme head of the armed forces on friday august 22 at 6 00 am local time 0200 gmt all russian forces will begin their withdrawal from georgian territory to south ossetia
6570975 deal running from 2006 2010 gives police officers a four percent raise in each of those four years and contains no substantial givebacks
6570976 i have always believed that the best contract agreements are those that are reached at the bargaining table and this is a good example of that
6570977 the question is not when were going to get wind turbines but where theyre going to go
6570978 but we know for sure theyre not going on top of buildings in manhattan
6570979 as much as 15 20 25 miles offshore where its virtually invisible to land
6570980 i decided id quit my job and sit in the basement playing with all the gear id acquired over time but never had an opportunity to use due to the overtime at work
6570981 i started recording things id fuss with on cassette 4 track and old digital programs after i was happy with a number of them i made five copies on burned cds and handed them out to people i held in high regard around portland ore including herman jolly from sunset valley courtney taylor from the dandy warhols spike keating of swoon now with black rebel motorcycle club and matt hollywood who had just recently quit his band the brian jonestown massacre
6570982 they drive viewers to share in the olympic experience on network television in record numbers and as a result of this unprecedented digital effort consumers have a destination to watch thousands of hours of video and relive the great moments of these olympics
6570983 but you wouldnt say online blew out expectations people still prefer tv to online and its unknown whether its because tv is better or online is lacking
6570984 theres a real cool opportunity here for car companies to attach a specific sound to their car for audio branding
6570985 we are experiencing a rising tide of unemployment not seen in georgia in more than fifteen years
6570986 its surprising that barack obama wants to have a debate over houses after he added on to his with the help of a sweetheart deal from convicted felon and chicago crook tony rezko
6570987 not to mention that obama made more than 4 million last year and just got back from a private hawaiian vacation
6570988 first of all you cant get worse than where we are now
6570989 it would be an intellect youd be finally dealing with which we havent seen in a long time
6570990 really unusual the fish has an obvious abnormality i had never seen anything like that myself before i cant speculate on what might have caused it
6570991 tell them to look up tell them to remember the stars
6570992 tell them to look up tell them to remember the stars
6570993 the team is definitely on a high right now believing we were going to make a statement in the whole tournament
6570994 it didnt start like we wanted to but we just kept digging and getting better each game it was a full team effort and it was so special with everyone doing it together
6570995 freedom of conscience is not to be surrendered upon issuance of a medical degree
6570996 this nation was built on a foundation of free speech the first principle of free speech is protected conscience
6570997 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6570998 planned parenthood continues to be concerned that the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
6570999 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
6571000 its about abortion and conscience it is very closely focused on abortion and physicians conscience
6571001 this regulation does not limit patient access to health care but rather protects any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience
6571002 if she finds out im cheating will she go all berserk
6571003 we wish you a metal christmas and a headbanging new year
6571004 these actions would ensure that low power auxiliary operations do not cause harmful interference to new public safety and commercial wireless services in the band
6571005 these are the favored frequencies because they can be run at lower power and can be used for very high quality audio
6571006 vytorins effectiveness has been in doubt and now its safety is questionable
6571007 that sir petos work in this matter has somehow been influenced by the companies is insulting to him and entirely untrue
6571008 nobody should avoid taking a statin because of concerns about cancer
6571009 i dont think any foreign internet company can effectively compete against chinese companies in the chinese market
6571010 the regulatory environment is so difficult that its almost impossible for foreigners to have an advantage over locals who have better political connections and who can manipulate the regulatory system much more effectively
6571011 if we do nothing the cost of waste management will rise to almost a 1 billion the extra cost of landfill will have to come from somewhere
6571012 that will mean cutting other essential public services like education social services or bus services just so we can go on dumping our rubbish that would be madness this project will save the council taxpayers about 200 million over the period of the contract
6571013 the withdrawal needs to take place and needs to take place now
6571014 there is no bread there is no food no medicine people are dying
6571015 i cannot go on like this anymore i cry every day
6571016 moving around in the city and looking and searching in different places
6571017 we are waiting for the russians to respect their word

6571040 it is not true that the united states feels any land hunger or entertains any projects as regards the other nations of the western hemisphere save such as are for their welfare all that this country desires is to see the neighboring countries stable orderly and prosperous any country whose people conduct themselves well can count upon our hearty friendship if a nation shows that it knows how to act with reasonable efficiency and decency in social and political matters if it keeps order and pays its obligations it need fear no interference from the united states chronic wrongdoing or an impotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized society may in america as elsewhere ultimately require intervention by some civilized nation and in the western hemisphere the adherence of the united states to the monroe doctrine may force the united states however reluctantly in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or impotence to the exercise of an international police power

6571059 a city laid out on apparently rational grounds where different specialized facilities are separated from one another across a vast terrain connected by motorways deprives its inhabitants of the pleasures of incidental discoveries and presupposes that we march from place to place with a sense of unflagging purpose but whereas we may leave the house with the ostensible object of consulting a book in a library we may nevertheless be delighted on the way by the signt of the fishmonger laying out his startled bug eyed catch on sheets of ice by workmen housing patterned sofas into apartment blocks by leaves opening up their tender green palms to the spring sunshne or by a girl with chestnut hair and glasses reading a book at the bus stop

6571065 this is a really sad story my heart goes out to the families involved
6571066 for some reason though it bothers me that 60 gun owners were asked to voluntarily relinquish their legally owned firearms
6571067 since when does oklahoma have handgun registration i seriously hope they catch the vermin responsible for this but im disturbed by the implication that oklahoma one of the most free states in the usa has handgun registration
6571068 i would never voluntarily submit their weapons for testing get a warrant
6571069 i wouldnt voluntarily submit my firearms to law enforcement without a warrant either this is really starting to bother me why ask 60 citizens to do this or maybe theyre waiting for somebody to refuse to submit voluntarily whereupon they do get a warrant
6571070 why dont they just test fire all the 40 cal handguns in oklahoma yeah thats the ticket
6571071 i hate to perhaps sound callous about the tragedy thats not my intent at all but this is some of the goofiest stuff ive ever heard of
6571072 what the osbi stupidly did was ensure that if the real murderer still has the murder weapon and got one of these letters he will now without doubt destroy it post haste
6571073 human beings can only interact with one another through two methods reason or force if at any point either party chooses force the other must either submit or respond with force
6571074 i prefer reason but i am ready to respond with force submission is not an option
6571075 the issue of private control of firearms in the united states has been a hot topic this year in light of the washington d c dispute over a complete ban on private handguns in that case the
6571076 its no wonder that the district is awash with lawlessness the contempt for the law starts in the city council chambers
6571077 the absolute prohibition of handguns held and used for self defense in the home

6571079 we are grateful to each and every one of our donors who helps and believes in our mission at uc davis
6571080 their support and commitment provide new and better opportunities for our students and faculty as we look to address societys challenges of the next 100 years
6571081 even our early advocates understood that philanthropic support could provide an extra margin that can make all the difference
6571082 philanthropy continues to be so very important to uc davis this year the university has benefited in many ways from unrestricted annual gifts that provide funding where it is always needed to the magnificent grant from the gordon and betty moore foundation to found a nursing school that is critically important to california and the nation
6571083 we are very grateful to all of our donors who have been so generous to uc davis this year
6571084 we are honored and inspired by these donors who have seen what uc davis can accomplish through philanthropic support
6571085 we are excited to be able finally to send a brand new top class wwry company out on tour around the uk we are completely hands on and will be visiting the mother ship in the dominion theatre london will be rockin on all the while keeping the home fires burning until further notice
6571086 we are bursting with excitement at last provincial audiences will get a true rock extravaganza we cant wait to see the first night reactions throughout the country we will rock you will rock the uk it is the biggest and best rock theatrical
6571087 we take the legend of queen and create our own fantastical story of young kids battling the might corporations who want to suppress their individuality and their love of music they need a hero who can help them in their struggle and we have two the dreamer galileo and the sassy rock chick scaramouche guess who ends up winning
6571088 the amazing bonus is that bens script subtly works as a metaphor too people definitely come out of the theatre feeling that in a strange way they now know us queen and our struggle our journey
6571089 creating the show with ben was very much a three way thing which was great because ben has such a great active mind and has been a great pleasure to work with he has a great fertile mind that never ever stops churning out ideas hes written a fantastic idea for the sequel i counted 23 more hits he can put in it lets see if people like this one first
6571090 theyre accessible theres a lot of interest in 2016 developing i dont think theyre ready yet to get into the detail of the bid but they want to know about the cities they dont give any sense of preference theyre really happy to have four world class cities
6571091 with all of the vast resources that are represented at indiana university the question is how we bring them all to bear for economic development and strategic technology transfer
6571092 how can you help policymakers come together for the state and use these assets
6571093 i think youll see a lot of international outreach as time goes on
6571094 this level of joint collaboration is unprecedented and holds tremendous potential for indiana and the midwest
6571095 the challenges facing a new product entering a market on a broad scale are too great for any one person to solve
6571096 new products typically face questions from the realms of engineering it management and finance that require expertise in different areas if you want to fully reach potential
6571097 we want the iurtc to be a grand facilitator between the university community and the world beyond
6571098 we need to make sure that the outside stakeholders have every opportunity to access the vast resources our university provides
6571099 there are network management practices that most experts agree are reasonable and that are important to the development of new technologies and internet services
6571100 i also emphasize that discrimination is not per se wrong it is unreasonable discrimination that is wrong
6571101 so the trick is to find the fine line between reasonable management techniques that allow the net to flourish and unreasonable practices that distort or deny its potential
6571102 so specialized and varying in nature as to be impossible to capture within the boundaries of a general rule
6571103 the commissions network principles only recognize and protect users access to legal content the sharing of illegal content such as child pornography or content that does not have the appropriate copyright is not protected by our principles similarly applications that are intended to harm the network are not protected
6571104 the network management technique arbitrarily blocks or degrades a particular application
6571105 comcast has several available options it could use to manage network traffic without discriminating as it does comcast could cap the average users capacity and then charge the most aggressive users overage fees
6571106 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6571107 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6571108 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6571109 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6571110 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6571111 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6571112 im gunna keep havin kids til the truth comes out
6571113 fuck you who are you to tell me what the fuck i do with my kids
6571114 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6571115 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6571116 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6571117 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6571118 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6571119 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6571120 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6571121 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6571122 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6571123 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6571124 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6571125 going to be out of this world on august 28th
6571126 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6571127 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6571128 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6571129 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6571130 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6571131 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6571132 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6571133 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6571134 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6571135 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6571136 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6571137 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6571138 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6571139 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6571140 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6571141 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6571142 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6571143 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6571144 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6571145 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

6571149 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6571150 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6571151 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6571152 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6571153 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6571154 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6571155 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6571156 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6571157 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6571158 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6571159 its always fun to come up with unique pairings cast reunions and surprising personalities as presenters on the emmy show and this year weve got a number of those
6571160 and the good news is weve got plenty more to come
6571161 but by the same token we know these very same people are not interested in less religiosity in the political discourse they almost universally want a religious person as president
6571162 its not that they want to take religion out of politics its that their frustrations with the way things seem to be going are leading them to say well maybe churches should back off on this
6571163 five or maybe six what about that beachhouse of yours in malibu dear
6571164 portavoz internacional de las farc encargada de dar conferencias participar en foros y dar a conocer a las farc a nivel internacional
6571165 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6571166 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6571167 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

6571169 as to the righteous they will be in gardens and in happiness
6571170 they will recline with ease on thrones of dignity arranged in ranks and we shall join them to companions with beautiful big and lustrous eyes
6571171 round about them will serve devoted to them young male servants handsome as pearls well guarded
6571172 your wives are as a tilth unto you so approach your tilth when or how ye will
6571173 if any of you have not the means wherewith to wed free believing women they may wed believing girls from among those whom your right hands possess
6571174 abstain from sex except with those joined to them in the marriage bond or the captives whom their right hands possess
6571175 marry women of your choice two or three or four
6571176 o mankind we created you from a single pair of a male and a female and made you into nations and tribes
6571177 admonish them first next refuse to share their beds and last beat them lightly but if they return to obedience
6571178 and there will be companions with beautiful big and lustrous eyes
6571179 they are able to carry out far more seasoned tactical operations than they had been recently and were paying the price
6571180 none of the wounds sustained by those killed or wounded were consistent with air delivered ordinance
6571181 it was a huge act of aggression on the part of the georgian army
6571182 this is not yet a known story to the world
6571183 but i am sure that every day every hour the truth will be coming through
6571184 to you the living and the dead to you south ossetia
6571185 what i have seen today is stalingrad it is complete destruction
6571186 if not for the help of great russia there would have been even more numerous casualties here
6571187 for the ossetian people after the beslan tragedy to lose 2 000 more people is a terrible loss a terrible loss
6571188 only here thanks to this music i feel the fear leaving
6571189 i feel that life is returning to tskhinvali and the music helps me forget the horrors of the bombardment that i went through
6571190 music has reminded me that life is not only war
6571191 here i remembered that i am a construction worker and that means a creator
6571192 hopefully this thorough report puts to rest the various 9 11 conspiracy theories which dishonor the men and women who lost their lives on that terrible day

6571198 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6571199 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6571200 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6571201 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6571202 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6571203 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6571204 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6571205 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6571206 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects

6571219 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6571220 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6571221 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6571222 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that

6571384 que nosotros trabajamos en temporada de verano al l mite permitido puede significar un cansancio general y atravesamos una situaci n de conflicto pero en temas de seguridad en todas las compa as llevamos este ritmo de trabajo y nunca se sobrepasan los l mites legales y esto no supone una causa directa en el accidente
6571385 puedo afirmar rotundamente que no se oblig a salir a este vuelo si no se cumpl an las condiciones necesarias hay muchas personas responsables t cnicos de mantenimiento pilotos hay una serie de procedimientos muy rigurosos que se cumplen a rajatabla nunca se asumen riesgos porque los tripulantes de vuelo y los pilotos son personas tienen familia y por ellos mismos hablando ego stamente no quieren asumir riesgos nadie quiere arriesgar su vida por un trabajo
6571386 tengo conocimiento por algunas personas de que el plan de emergencia de spanair ha funcionado bien el trato directo con las personas afectadas es siempre dif cil y es complicado cumplir las expectativas de los familiares no s exactamente en que sentido no han cumplido pero tomaremos cartas en el asunto para comprobar si es verdad que se han lavado las manos en el asunto y desde luego si hubiera sido as esto no se puede permitir

6571388 the problem we have is that as we understand it and based upon the evidence that ive seen is that they circulated these petitions with etzels name never intending her to be the candidate

6571390 we have a horrible problem in this state with voter fraud
6571391 this move by the mccain campaign completely contradicts everything john mccain stood for in 2000 when his competitors were trying to keep him off the ballot
6571392 mccain has become a part of the same corrupted machine he spoke vehemently against only eight years ago
6571393 now think about that i guess if you think that being rich means you gotta make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6571394 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective

6571406 the public should really recognize the science is really behind what we have said
6571407 given the real time news cycle we live in today many important issues and controversies that impact our country simply do not receive the time and examination they deserve we are in this for the long haul and look forward to engaging on a broad range of issues well beyond the campaign
6571408 the launch of our immediate advocacy effort is a direct response to barack obamas rejection of public financing which will allow the liberal 527s and other leftist organizations to dramatically outspend conservatives this election cycle

6571411 when the american public fully understands the close continuing relationship between their potential president and a remorseless domestic terrorist we believe it will send a chill down their spines
6571412 beyond the speeches how much do you know about barack obama consider this united 93 never hit the capitol on 9 11 but the capitol was bombed thirty years before by an american terrorist group called weather underground that declared war on the u s targeting the capitol the pentagon police stations and more one of the groups leaders william ayers admits to the bombings proudly saying later some members of the group ayers founded even went on to kill police but barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama american issues project is responsible for the content of this ad

6571437 as for fuel fires the team found that they could not have been sustained long enough could not have generated sufficient heat to fail a critical column and or would have produced
6571438 the debris from wtc1 and 2 scooped out over 25 of the building
6571439 while debris impact from the collapse of wtc 1 initiated fires in wtc 7 the resulting structural damage had little effect in causing the collapse of wtc 7
6571440 wtc 7 used a structural system design in widespread use
6571441 the investigation team found that the design of wtc 7 was generally consistent with the new york city building code in effect at the time
6571442 the nist investigation team also determined that other elements of the buildings construction namely trusses girders and cantilever overhangs that were used to transfer loads from the building superstructure to the columns of the electric substation over which wtc 7 was constructed and foundation below did not play a significant role in the collapse
6571443 the team said that the smallest blast event capable of crippling the critical column would have produced a

6571445 not only is this not a comedy its not a kids movie they wont be bored by it but theyll miss whats so special about it its so exquisite from the near silent movie ness of it during its first half to the brutal but candy colored satire of its second half that people will still be watching this movie hundreds of years from now and if were not lucky and not smart and not wise those people will watch wall e and theyll know that we knew that the ruination of the earth was possible and that we did nothing to stop it

6571469 i encourage people from government agencies to join this w3c forum to make the web better serve the people
6571470 open standards and in particular semantic web standards can help lower the cost of government make it easier for independent agencies to work together and increase flexibility in the face of change
6571471 the publication of the version 3 normative edition 2008 is another milestone for hl7
6571472 it assembles all of the hl7 version 3 v3 content approved as normative standards through the end of 2007 and includes standards for communications to document and manage the care and treatment of patients in a wide variety of healthcare settings as such it is a foundational part of the technologies needed to meet the global challenge of integrating healthcare information in areas such as patient care and public health
6571473 we chose the hl7 v3 standard because it supports semantic interoperability in an environment where diverse clinical systems from multiple organizations and geographies must interoperate hl7 v3 is the foundation for all of our messaging standards that support the national ehr infrastructure we are building to provide canadians and their health care providers with secure access to the health information they need
6571474 hl7 v3 has been successfully implemented in a drug information system serving the province of prince edward island standards in other domains laboratory clinical history and notes demographic registries and public health surveillance have been developed based on v3 and are in the process of being implemented across canada
6571475 in healthcare topics in care provision public health regulated studies and therapeutic devices represent an extension in the clinical scope simultaneously the addition of standards for the services oriented architecture soa implementation of version 3 with snomed ct role based access control and templates extend the technical foundations upon which these standards can be implemented

6571477 persistent block storage has been among the top requests of developers using amazon ec2 and we
6571478 first amazon ec2 rewrote the rules of cloud computing offering companies an intuitive and reliable means for accessing unlimited computing power with amazon ebs amazon has turned the industry on its head again providing unlimited storage potential
6571479 amazon ebs has enabled us to create large scale enterprise level databases that allow us to run and maintain various disparate applications ec2 and ebs together provide a cost effective flexible system that allows us to crunch data faster than we had been previously able
6571480 with sun also recently making the opensolaris platform available on ec2 web companies can now access the unique features of the zfs file system such as rollback and 128 bit checksum capabilities to enable the highest level of data integrity on ec2
6571481 now with the highly anticipated release of amazon ebs our enterprise ec2 customers have the ability to persist virtual machine configuration and application data across instantiations and manage their cloud solutions in as consistent a manner as their on premise deployments
6571482 these are the types of capabilities our customers especially the isvs and enterprises are looking for
6571483 sparqlmotion puts the power of data integration where it should be in the hands of end users and domain experts
6571484 until now it has been necessary for application developers to predict and hardwire the data sources searches queries and reports that end users will utilize within a particular application this approach has significantly limited the output from business intelligence and other enterprise applications sparqlmotion gives end users the freedom to dynamically merge data sources as needed and create one of a kind applications
6571485 there is great potential in sparqlmotion as it brings users one step closer to realizing the power of the semantic web
6571486 with sparqlmotion non technical users can begin to create semantic applications without resorting to challenging ontology manipulation messy rule creation or difficult interaction with semantic languages i continue to be impressed with the innovation that comes out of topquadrant
6571487 swc has established itself as one of the leading companies in the area of semantic technologies swc maintains excellent relations with the national and international semantic web community we are using semantic technologies in a number of our projects and there is a constant need for expert contacts information about recent development and about the needs of companies this explains why we are very keen on gaining a partner like swc who is able to grant us access to these communities and to this type of information there arent many possible partners in austria that have the competence and network to meet our needs swc is exactly the kind of partner we were looking for
6571488 service oriented knowledge workplaces and combination of existing semantic and knowledge management technologies are the trends of the future
6571489 the market is currently on the move needs and demands change quickly and the demand for semantic web solutions is clearly increasing we are receiving more enquiries and requests for consultation both from enterprises and smaller companies in austria and from abroad there is a need for semantic web training and an explicit demand in the project market one of the most frequently expressed needs is the need for more powerful search engines

6571491 but by the same token we know these very same people are not interested in less religiosity in the political discourse they almost universally want a religious person as president
6571492 its not that they want to take religion out of politics its that their frustrations with the way things seem to be going are leading them to say well maybe churches should back off on this
6571493 the main reason the comics fell behind schedule was because it took so long to satisfy the x files people they went over everything with a fine tooth comb including the letters columns

6571497 sparqls focus on querying the data models saves time for developers theres no need for a host of little web services to retrieve different aspects of the state of a system
6571498 this allows the user of the sparql endpoint to ask any question it is as though they could design their own interface instead of having to work with a limited set of fixed services
6571499 people learn that data is more valuable than applications or hardware

6571507 a beautiful flower delights and refreshes the hearts of all people equally no matter what soil it grows in that is the power of beauty the same is true of great art it is this spirit that the german poet heinrich heine sang of when he wrote that once the peapod bursts open the sugar peas inside are for everyone to enjoy

6571511 the adoption by business of semantics technology is producing a new generation of applications sometimes known as web 3 0 and enterprise 2 0
6571512 linked data allows us to look at data from a range of perspectives by peeling back the containment of a web site web page database or database table it sets the records free by bringing the entities that records represent to life
6571513 when people first started to learn about the web they needed to learn about
6571514 what linked data offers over odbc or jdbc is the ability to provide data source naming amp resolution scoped to a database record as opposed to the database or database table levels

6571520 more than two centuries ago congress passed the logan act which forbids private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments as an elected official pelosi isnt restrained by the law but negotiating with world leaders particularly those at odds with the united states should be left to the president

6571528 a growing challenge for corporations engaging with their customers through social technologies is how to address the flow of blog comments without the ability to track users reputations companies cannot manage and respond to comments properly and the value of the community diminishes

6571534 your report is the best money ive ever spent on the internet
6571535 even though there are several similar and probably competing systems under development at the moment
6571536 the benefit of the application of semantic technologies is that they are designed to mutually support and benefit from each other
6571537 umbel is like a map of an interstate highway system a set of roadsigns to help find related content and a way of getting from one big place to another once in the right vicinity other ontologies more akin to detailed street maps are then necessary to get to specific locations or street addresses
6571538 the umbel project and its need to capture the open world aspects of the web has brought a fresh perspective and set of challenges to cyc
6571539 we are excited and committed to support umbel as part of our overall web relevance strategy
6571540 nearly two years ago we co founded the dbpedia project to expose rdf based linked data from wikipedia and many other sources with umbel we now have a complementary space in the linked data realm that delivers contextual linkage between named entities and subject matter concepts
6571541 a two day trade mission to savannah georgia in june is being credited with standard aero spending more than 20 million on a plant expansion that could create more than 300 jobs over the next six years in winnipeg
6571542 also our members are very committed to their job so walking off the job is a major issue for them
6571543 we know there are major understaffing issues in the banks already so any staff not being at work will put pressure on those services
6571544 there will be some regional branches that close but were not anticipating significant branch closures to be fair thats actually not the point the point is to send a strong message to the bank that we expect them to be a good corporate citizen

6571548 a semantic layer can improve a skills management system if for instance some employees use different tags words but actually talk about the same skill
6571549 social semantic applications require a culture of trust and openness in particular the will to share information for a collective benefit
6571550 there are more than 2 billion of rdf triples at the moment the vision is to have a semantic layer of 100 rdf structured data
6571551 we need to achieve some basic ethics of creating semantic web content life science communities might be able to pave the way

6571555 weve had folks from china and japan visit the oilsands in previous years and now weve had some very high profile wealthy people form the u s to go and take a look
6571556 the visit may be somewhat symbolic in a way but i dont expect warren buffett or bill gates to go out and start buying oilsands companies at this point i think theyre just going up there to kick the tires and see what its all about
6571557 wed be very surprised if this was a precursor to a major investment on their part especially on the part of warren buffett
6571558 he looks to invest in companies at the bottom of the cycle and theres no reason to believe that were at the bottom of the current commodity price cycle
6571559 its more likely that warren buffett and bill gates were brought to the oilsands area as a form of damage control
6571560 the most likely future investors especially given the rising environmental lobby in the states against the oilsands would be companies from northeast asia
6571561 theyre not going to be able to produce domestically to satisfy their needs and theyre looking elsewhere
6571562 the u s demand for oil petroleum products and natural gas continues to increase
6571563 there are a lot of countries interested across the board who are investing in alberta but in terms of markets in terms of politics the u s is still the big picture for us

6571565 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
6571566 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
6571567 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries all together
6571568 that is potentially a world changing event this is the closest weve had to something being commercially available in this class
6571569 its great that we have wireless email and wireless internet and stuff like that but at the end of the day it would be nice to have wireless recharge as well

6571586 caddie ronan flood had to remind me that i wouldnt be as good thursday as i would be sunday harrington said
6571587 i worked my way through most of the round said harrington who came into the barclays fourth in the points
6571588 as i said i made a few mistakes in the middle of the round and missed a couple of putts from four or five feet for birdie but i look back at the two sixes and gave away four shots or certainly two on those holes
6571589 i thought the scores werent going to be as low as they were hunter had such a great round and there were some 4 or 5 under par rounds
6571590 so my 1 under par round is not as good as i thought it would be but i thought i played well and ill take it i obviously need to make up some ground tomorrow and have a good day
6571591 there are tournaments where ill shoot 6 or 7 under and thats as good as i can play and the winner is 21 under and im thinking how did they do that
6571592 its funny how some courses fit a guys eye and rip it down the gut all day and some guys are struggling and are marginal and struggling here and there and hitting rough and scraping around it trying to make pars
6571593 i hit a couple balls ten 15 yards off the main and it was fine over there
6571594 oh yeah you dont want to miss the fairway and youre forced to take on a lot of shots out there youve got to hit it well off the tee i managed that okay
6571595 we had two practice rounds i need to get a little bit more precise and hit my irons a little bit better and give me another day looking at the green surfaces together and trying to figure out the reads
6571596 thats a good question because you can drive the ball well and hit good iron shots mickelson said
6571597 but if you dont come into the green properly its hard to get it close because the subtleties will pull the ball away from the hole
6571598 i think thats the biggest challenge is controlling the iron shots to get it close to the hole because of all the mounding on the green that pulls the ball away

6571903 he was quite cutting about the claim that uranium had been sought from africa my source believed that the documents on which the allegation rested were forged
6571904 we know that in the 1980s iraq purchased more than 270 tonnes of uranium from niger therefore it is not beyond the bounds of possibility let us at least put it like that that iraq went back to niger again that is why i stand by entirely the statement that was made in the september dossier
6571905 iraqs a big place and theres lots of sand it is impractical to dig up the whole of iraq but for somebody to say we are absolutely certain that there is nothing there would be a very rash and unfounded thing to say in our judgment
6571906 the subsequent mysteriously forged documents claiming evidence of an actual deal made between zahawie and niger were circulated well after the first british report the original british report carefully said that saddam had sought uranium not that he had acquired it
6571907 since the war in iraq began two independent british inquiries have firmly reiterated that the original intelligence concerning niger was sound and has withstood careful scrutiny
6571908 there is intelligence that iraq has sought the supply of significant quantities of uranium from africa
6571909 did the united states accept that the claim was sound
6571910 that iraq sought the supply of significant amounts of uranium from africa
6571911 the government asked the originators of the intelligence that iraq sought the supply of uranium from africa to discuss the issue with the international atomic energy agency the government understand this was done shortly before the iaea report of 7 march 2003 i am withholding further details of intelligence exchanges with allies under exemption 1 c of part 2 of the code of practice on access to government information
6571912 i can confirm to you that we have received information from a number of member states regarding the allegation that iraq sought to acquire uranium from niger however we have learned nothing which would cause us to change the conclusion we reported to the united nations security council on march 7 2003 with regards to the documents assessed to be forgeries and have not received any information that would appear to be based on anything other than those documents
6571913 what i believe the assessed intelligence has established beyond doubt is that saddam continues in his efforts to develop nuclear weapons
6571914 as a result of the intelligence we judge that iraq has sought significant quantities of uranium from africa despite having no active civil nuclear programme that could require it
6571915 there is intelligence that iraq has sought the supply of significant quantities of uranium from africa
6571916 iraq has sought the supply of significant quantities of uranium from africa
6571917 by saying the unauthentic documents didnt affect the judgment on the second source we can fairly infer that they did affect the judgment of the first
6571918 the evidence that we had that the iraqi government had gone back to try to purchase further amounts of uranium from niger did not come from these so called forged documents they came from separate intelligence
6571919 absolutely no knowledge of any documents relating to this area being forged
6571920 this is the first time ever that a government has put sensitive intelligence into the public domain
6571921 the pm has asked ann taylor to read through the dossier in draft and give us any comments he stressed that it is for her and for her only and that no one else outside this building was seeing it in draft im contacting john scarlett to work out how this should happen needs to be tomorrow
6571922 needs to come across as an impartial professional assessment of the threat
6571923 it is self evidently bad practice to appoint someone to a committee when their previous conclusions are under scrutiny
6571924 according to mark huband the national security correspondent of the financial times in an important front page article he wrote on june 28 2004 the consensus among european intelligence services was that niger was attempting to deal in yellowcake with anyone it could find from north korea to iran
6571925 there was further and separate intelligence that in 1999 the iraqi regime had also made inquiries about the purchase of uranium ore in the democratic republic of congo
6571926 there was some evidence that by 2002 an agreement for a sale had been reached
6571927 other reporting that suggested that iraq had tried to obtain uranium from africa was not detailed or specific enough for us to be certain that such attempts were in fact made because of this lack of specificity
6571928 this reporting alone did not rise to the level of inclusion in a presidential speech
6571929 in order to take the joseph wilson view of this baathist ambassadorial initiative you have to be able to believe that saddam husseins long term main man on nuclear issues was in niger to talk about something other than the obvious
6571930 25 hard to conceal 10 ton tractor trailers would be used to transport the off the books uranium because niger is landlocked the convoy would have to cross at least one international border and travel at least 1 000 miles to reach the sea moving such a quantity over such a distance would be very difficult particularly because the french would be indisposed to approve or cloak this arrangement
6571931 the cia advised caution about any suggestion that iraq had succeeded in acquiring uranium from africa
6571932 agreed that there was evidence that it had been sought
6571933 the authors of the earlier report felt free to be candid about what the butler report chose to keep hidden namely that most of the british judgment about uranium from africa was based on the phony documents the butler report claims had nothing to do with their judgment
6571934 eric in new bern today and while its tuned to homeland security the bi product is it will help with local crime

6571937 and to provide a local flavor on the information that is coming from raleigh with isaac or that is heading back up to isaac
6571938 we have as much criminal information sharing going on as we do terrorism sharing information probably even more so because we deal with the criminal aspect of it every day in every single criminal jurisdiction across the sate

6571951 in big seizures theres a very strong tendency to ship ivory out of a different country than where its poached its a bit of a red herring
6571952 the methods we developed are very important in that regard because it focuses where the poaching is ongoing
6571953 crime syndicates were targeting specific populations for intense exploitation hitting them hard and fast to satisfy the demands of a particular consignment
6571954 at the time of the analyses authorities thought the ivory came from tanzania and or the democratic republic of the congo our analyses refocused the investigation allowed authorities to point the finger at zambia and get them to do something
6571955 is a serious subject and its a room full of serious people who have taken it in that manner
6571956 but for our part in the united states we continue to believe this is a very important initiative and we remain committed to achieving an outcome that is both a net benefit for the non proliferation regime and it meets indias energy needs
6571957 an important emerging relationship with india that we continue to believe is critical and important for the united states
6571958 there is nothing new that is being said every countrys position is well known but the question is whether we can take a decision either way by tomorrow
6571959 what some countries are looking for is tighter language tying the nsgs waiver to those commitments
6571960 i ve always been proud of our club weve got great members and we really achieve quite a bit we really do
6571961 as far as conviction of casting me all the credit goes to him ram gopal verma i had no idea what he had in his mind due to lot of intensity in the character he casted me and probably wanted me to make the character look real and not very star cast type he has gone on with casting because i guess because he wanted people to just get into the flow of the subject and not the casting
6571962 my character in the film is about a girl who is a complete believer in god somewhere down the line she starts believing in black magic she thinks that as god is power so is black magic which takes one towards the evil but slowly as the film progresses she thinks that practical things like doctors and medicine also exist so my character transforms from a complete believer in god towards an atheist
6571963 actually i was excited and i wanted to do this movie because i had to touch the roof and somebody who was to slap me was not visible
6571964 my mother in law went to the field to work and suddenly fainted we took her to the doctor but he could not diagnose the problem then we brought her here where she has been diagnosed with leptospirosis

6571977 the cfda and many other people have been working to try and come up with a solution for the garment centre its a really difficult process but the longer it goes on the more businesses will have to leave because they lost their leases or their landlords are raising rents
6571978 he said he hadnt heard of any controversy so i asked when was the first time you heard mccain tell this story his response i heard that story in 1970 1971 back in that time frame anybody who says its not true is full of here he used some salty language

6571995 its just one more contradiction and example of him being out of the mainstream with america
6571996 most americans cant afford yachts private planes thousand dollar haircuts or homes in nantucket

6572008 at this point we do not know exactly how the child got outside in the pool however there is a doggie door that was not closed and it appears that the child may have crawled outside through that door
6572009 this case is a tragic accident and there will not be charges filed against anyone
6572010 it is a good time to remind the community to check the doggie door or any other possible areas of access for little ones to get into a pool or other standing water

6572038 youre playing in very different emotional territory with the olympics
6572039 if youre a 41 year old mom and you win the 50 meter freestyle which is the creme de la creme of speed

6572051 human culture as we have known it for the past 200 years is drawing to a close a revolution of civilization is upon us prepare
6572052 the most significant characteristic of modern civilization is the sacrifice of the future for the present and all the power of science has been prostituted to this purpose
6572053 nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could only do a little
6572054 sooner or later everyone sits down to a banquet of consequences
6572055 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6572056 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around

6572066 we think the pleasant state that can be induced by music leads to special physiological changes which eventually lead to stress reduction or direct immune enhancement
6572067 stress reduction probably plays an important role but the stress reducing effect seems to be different for various types of music

6572071 its difficult to work so hard against a bill that has such good intentions
6572072 but sb 201 actually creates a detour around the regulation of raw milk and must be re written before the bill is ready there are e coli and other toxic bacteria and there will be more of them in california and nationwide unless changes are made to this legislation
6572073 raw milk given that it is outside the pasteurization process has inherent risks
6572074 illnesses from raw milk and raw are on the rise and weve seen first hand a growing number of consumers whose lives will never be the same because of this product dee creek farm e coli o157 h7 11 ill 4 with hemolytic uremic syndrome or hus grace harbor farms e coli o157 h7 2 children ill one with hus organic pastures e coli o157 h7 6 ill 2 children with hus herb depot e coli o157 h7 two children ill town farm dairy e coli o157 h7 5 ill 2 with hus alexandre family ecodairy farms campylobacter 15 illnesses one on a ventilator
6572075 its the large producers of raw milk products that sb 201 aims to regulate
6572076 because of the haccp loophole a huge amount of contaminated product could reach the public this bill is intended to stop them but instead will give them a free ride for years to come california legislators and governor schwarzenegger please send sb 201 back

6572091 the sim card was used by roge to contact his accomplices involved in the murder hence we need to investigate where and how roge managed to forge the documents and get a sim card
6572092 the state of the bmc roads is pathetic despite several assurances it is unable to meet the deadlines errant contractors should be blacklisted and criminal proceedings must be initiated against them

6572098 since mr diaz balart is having such trouble finding time in his schedule for a televised debate in the district mayor martinez will be glad to meet him on any day and time during the convention for a televised debate
6572099 a week to fly across the country to act as a republican hatchet man instead of focusing on the problems in his own district
6572100 the people of south florida deserve a representative who will be their champion
6572101 instead they have a representative who leaves his district and stands outside the democratic national convention in a sad attempt to defend president bush and the republicans failed record on everything from housing to the economy to iraq
6572102 the problem we have is that as we understand it and based upon the evidence that ive seen is that they circulated these petitions with etzels name never intending her to be the candidate
6572103 they went to the convention nominated barr and then she withdrew
6572104 we have a horrible problem in this state with voter fraud
6572105 this move by the mccain campaign completely contradicts everything john mccain stood for in 2000 when his competitors were trying to keep him off the ballot
6572106 mccain has become a part of the same corrupted machine he spoke vehemently against only eight years ago
6572107 it was a bit of a shock to us i cant make it a one man show or the tito ortiz show giving him more than a guy like fedor who is coming in here with a winning record i was disappointed i was shocked it was almost like dont even bother calling back because there is no point in making a deal here it was aggressive
6572108 theres nothing concrete as of yet if we can come to something great if not so be it
6572109 i think titos obviously a good draw and hed be good to have for a show to say anything else would be stupid however that draw comes with an expense in the cost benefit analysis the question is is it worth it the answer is at those numbers definitely not
6572110 we know that war service can have both a physical and mental impact on the lives of service personnel physical impairment can be obvious psychological injury is less so
6572111 this government is determined to support veterans and ex service personnel who may suffer psychologically as a result of their service however to do so we need a better understanding of the incidence and characteristics of suicide amongst this community
6572112 we are seeking to better identify those at risk common contributing factors in recent cases the incidence of suicide in the ex service community and whether there is more that government agencies and the medical and allied health professions can do to support veterans under stress
6572113 we know that war service can have both a physical and mental impact on the lives of service personnel physical impairment can be obvious psychological injury is less so

6572133 it happens at entry or exit people forget their codes or they accidentally hit two keys at the same time when a false alarm occurs sometimes police are called to the scene that isnt really a crime scene and they are diverted from being somewhere else
6572134 we wanted to do something for our customers that would make activating or deactivating the alarm system easier and that would reduce false alarms
6572135 each button on the transmitter may be programmed for any zone response
6572136 but is typically used for arming disarming panic and relay activation the customer has to press one of the buttons to activate an action such as disarming

6572138 most smokers who want to quit do not understand what it takes to conquer their nicotine addiction or they underestimate how powerful that addiction can be
6572139 the approach provided by ex changes that equation by showing them how they can quit namely by combining coaching pharmacotherapy and social support so that smokers have the support that they need at the times when theyre most likely to crave a cigarette and smoke

6572158 reports that actor jean reno is in the hospital due to a heart attack are false he is vacationing in the caribbean and went to a local hospital as a precaution for some discomfort he was feeling due to heartburn and gastroenteritis

6572160 i think he was just enjoying vacation and probably ate a little too much spicy caribbean food

6572164 i said thats gotta be worth a lot of money and she came out with this revelation when i looked at the history research she had parties where she entertained hitler so she was like a social hostess
6572165 she hated her first husband because he was so domineering i think she was ashamed she hated hitler and didnt really want to talk about the tryst once it was out there
6572166 i think she reluctantly told me because i asked about the cigarette case and immediately regretted it
6572167 she said that she tried to tell movie mogul louis b meyer about hitler and he said he didnt want to talk about hitler and he told her not to talk about hitler i bet she didnt tell anyone except me
6572168 she said she met hitler and was forced into a relationship with him because her husband was making millions of dollars from him
6572169 theres a real cool opportunity here for car companies to attach a specific sound to their car for audio branding
6572170 he tried to have a tough exterior like a shield to fit in
6572171 he was a good kid who was dealt some bad cards in life
6572172 it was an individual directing his aggression toward another individual not the school or the students inside the school
6572173 he got shot and started walking and he was holding his chest there was blood everywhere and then he fell and his arm hit me
6572174 i took off running and ran outside and called my mom

6572177 i knew jeremy briefly i saw him maybe four or five times socially i didnt really know him well
6572178 he blake was a friend and so i read the thing script and liked it

6572180 we never met to discuss the film i did explain to her i wasnt looking to act right then and with the album tour schedule and a baby on the way it wouldnt be feasible

6572185 hes a teacher thats what he was born to do
6572186 i tell gigi all the time you have to slow him down
6572187 he doesnt know this but i think his goal is to touch every kid
6572188 and i think theres nothing more rewarding for him than the kids
6572189 then white sox manager chuck tanner grabbed me and said chet see there thats 400 something feet of grass you can run all you want

6572238 ich habe gerade eben von der schlie ung erfahren ich wei nicht wie ich t glich nach frankfurt pendeln soll das kann ich doch gar nicht bezahlen
6572239 das verhalten der berliner polizei ist modernes raubrittertum und gegen klare absprachen es zeugt auch von dilettantischer amtsf hrung wenn die berliner polizei kollegen zur ckholt die sie vor wenigen jahren noch weggeschickt hat

6572249 if you think the fact that we have sold in excess of 2 million records and have never been paid a penny is pretty unbelievable well so do we and the fact that emi informed us that not only arent they going to pay us at all but that we are still 1 4 million dollars in debt to them is even crazier that the next record we make will be used to pay off that old supposed debt just makes you start wondering what is going on shouldnt a record company be able to turn a profit from selling that many records or at the very least break even
6572250 we are thrilled to be producing racine for the first time in a c t s history
6572251 timberlakes extraordinary and fresh translation of ph dre pays homage to the gorgeous poetry of the original while sustaining this plays explosive heat and visceral sexuality i have admired stratfords work for many years and am excited to work at the theatre where heather kitchen my partner at a c t started her career
6572252 i am amazed at the muscularity of stratfords acting company who perform major classics in repertory for eight months in 2 000 seat houses in particular seana mckenna is a remarkable talent capable of keeping act audiences on the edge of their seats through racines erotic and complicated tragedy

6572264 wow i think thats the cabin next to our land
6572265 milan had wanted to take the player on loan with the right to buy him but
6572266 thats why i stayed at manchester for so long playing for him has been a great honor he listened to me and didnt want to act against my wishes it was difficult to leave because im leaving some very good guys behind me
6572267 we have a strong squad but a young squad and mikaels versatility experience and caliber will provide the extra depth we need to reinforce our challenge for honors this season
6572268 i am satisfied even with the result which is always important
6572269 also im not used to finding ourselves two goals down after half an hour
6572270 we improvised with bonera and barzagli but its not liking pressing a button and it works so on a couple of occasions we got caught out
6572271 fabio cannavaro and marco materazzi are our tried and tested giorgio chiellini and alessandro gamberini have the future secured and one will be fit for september
6572272 its true we were fortunate with the equalising goal but we had created other chances and anyway i rediscovered the winning spirit
6572273 the lads did well because they looked to win the game they conceded us only the space to play on the flanks and we did well to exploit it and we looked to claim the victory until the end
6572274 i have great respect for totti as he has always scored against me in every way possible shot from distance chip free kick
6572275 we are extremely solid even with almost all the defence out of action but in ivan cambiasso we have uncovered an unexpected surprise
6572276 he is really exceptional but i naturally hope that our central defenders return as soon as possible
6572277 im aware of romas interest they have already spoken to my agent and i know they watched me play against nantes im waiting to see how the situation unfolds
6572278 roma is a great club amongst the best in europe and its pleasing to know they are interested in me i dont know if my club wants to sell me but if the directors considered my sale as good business and it also satisfied me then i could leave
6572279 i feel stronger and more mature after all that has happened and im bursting to get back on the pitch im sure that whatever team ill play for ill unleash the anger ive pent up over these terrible months
6572280 if that team should be juventus it would be a dream nobody refuses juventus and im confident i could give more than i did in my first experience there
6572281 it surprised me in fact i think it has come as a surprise to everyone
6572282 it is not often a player leaves one big club to go to another like
6572283 but mikael did not play much last year and i think he just wanted to go somewhere where he would so in that sense i am happy for him
6572284 he has been here a long time and he still deserves to play at the highest level
6572285 mikael has given so much to this club i am just surprised he is going to arsenal but he has made the choice
6572286 neither of us started well and we used to say we wanted to leave we can laugh about it now because we have both reached 100 games
6572287 tell them to look up tell them to remember the stars

6572516 un 21 de agosto fue probablemente uno de los d as m s negros de nuestra historia que se prolongo siete a os y hoy es deber rendir homenaje a las personas que perdieron la vida
6572517 el acto de conmemoraci n se inscribi en la l nea de la recuperaci n de la memoria hist rica de nuestro pueblo pues muchas personas como mauricio lefebvre cayeron y esto debe ser un aliciente para profundizar y recrear nuestra democracia impidiendo que estos actos vand licos se repitan sabiendo que la democracia cost muchas vidas y mucha sangre ha sido derramada en su nombre
6572518 no se trata de conocer los resultados e inmediatamente actuar sino siempre buscar el mayor consenso posible hay que agotar y hacer el ltimo esfuerzo eso es racional y democr tico pero si eso no es posible ah el pueblo entender que el presidente debe actuar en representaci n de la mayor a de los bolivianos para viabilizar los proyectos
6572519 es necesario que este proceso de cambio se consolide sin embargo es muy lamentable que algunos actores particularmente de las regiones del oriente no entiendan que el mejor camino es el di logo y no posturas de intransigencia que no nos llevar n a nada
6572520 una minor a del pa s no puede bloquear a las mayor as el revocatorio nos ha demostrado que hay una gran mayor a de la poblaci n boliviana que apoya el proceso de cambio y ese apoyo no es al presidente como persona sino al proyecto pol tico al programa de cambio y de transformaci n y uno de elementos importantes de este programa es el proyecto de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado

6572572 irrigating with wastewater isnt a rare practice limited to a few of the poorest countries
6572573 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities as well
6572574 the negative and positive implications of wastewater agriculture have only recently received attention
6572575 this study offers the first comprehensive cross country analysis of the conditions that account for the practice and the difficult tradeoffs that arise from it
6572576 of the large potential of wastewater agriculture for both helping and hurting great numbers of urban consumers
6572577 and it isnt just affluent consumers of exotic vegetables whose welfare is at stake
6572578 poor consumers of inexpensive street food also depend on urban agriculture
6572579 a key aim of iwmi research is to find feasible approaches whereby wastewater irrigation can continue strengthening food security and generating economic benefits but without major health risks for urban consumers and farmers

6572593 i still think theyre confused specifically about right of way
6572594 rather than clarity and segregation he had created confusion and ambiguity unsure of what space belonged to them drivers became more accommodating
6572595 and when i see people not enter the roundabout even though theres no approaching traffic that to me still indicates confusion about the workings of a roundabout
6572596 rather than clarity and segregation he had created confusion and ambiguity unsure of what space belonged to them drivers became more accommodating
6572597 if i missed what the article said relevant to this perhaps you can point it out
6572598 may have also decided that a proponent of traffic calming design thinks all roundabouts are wonderful
6572599 the other example i cited is the driver who doesnt enter the roundabout even though theres no approaching traffic you say this is forcing the driver to be more accomodating accomodating to whom i have to wonder
6572600 claims that roundabouts are bad because they are confusing are insincere
6572601 how about accomodating someone anyone other than him or herself
6572602 traffic or not there is great value in accommodating other possible non traffic life forms i
6572603 given the alternative ill take the confused stopped driver over the relaxed speeding inattentive driver

6572632 im not a natural fullback but at the same time im stronger than most fullbacks
6572633 physically i go in there and i can slam into a linebacker but im really a runner thats what i do coming out of the backfield and catch some balls
6572634 but ill do whatever my coaches ask me to do i wont complain about it ill just go out there and just do my job pound for pound im probably one of the strongest guys on the team
6572635 fullbacks are usually slower they take longer to read pittman flies right in there he hits whoever
6572636 thats my type i like somebody thats just going to go all out
6572637 its just an adjustment for me its just another step in my career this is my 11th year and im excited to do a lot of new things so like i said if the coach asks me to do it i just go out there and i have fun doing it
6572638 i really dont like lead blocking too much but i go in there and ill do it just catching passes its a mismatch me against a linebacker 1 on 1 i can really take advantage of a linebacker
6572639 and physically thats a mismatch too because physically they cant cover me so theres a lot of things i can bring to the table in the passing game so i will say just really coming out of the backfield
6572640 heer als ik voor u uitloop kan ik niet zien waar ik terecht kom laat mij gaandeweg ontdekken dat achter u mijn weg veilig is en mijn toekomst zeker
6572641 all three reports tend to indicate that were bottoming out but that there is no real end in sight and thats what i think the market has to get used to

6572652 it is important that the entire world understands that what is happening in georgia now will affect the entire world order
6572653 its not just georgias business but the entire worlds business
6572654 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
6572655 to be very careful and sensitive these days the russians are selling many arms to iran and syria and there is no need to offer them an excuse to sell even more advanced weapons
6572656 both war and peace are in the hands of israeli jews
6572657 gal hirsch who was defeated in lebanon went to georgia and they too lost because of him
6572658 we have turned down many requests involving arms sales to georgia and the ones that have been approved have been duly scrutinized
6572659 well be pressing on the pakistanis themselves to be involved with us in fighting terrorism and making sure the number of terrorists coming into afghanistan from pakistan is limited
6572660 obviously we have had a period of political uncertainty in pakistan i think its very important now that we see the pakistan and afghan governments working together
6572661 we have obviously also suffered casualties because of the summer offensive
6572662 we have always expected there to be a summer offensive because of the fact that there was very little of a spring offensive
6572663 its a summer offensive of the taliban we will see that happening but in our view our strategy will be to build up the afghan army to build up the rest of afghan society
6572664 sort out the government so that we have a full attack on corruption
6572665 we want to see on the ground the delivery of results
6572666 musharraf has ruined every institution of the country its economy and the entire social fabric he has killed dozens of innocent people in lal masjid carnage and murdered benazir bhutto and akbar bugti he pocketed billions of dollars from aid given to pakistan by international donors under the war against terror
6572667 the rising lawlessness political as well as economic de stability poverty and unemployment all are the gifts of musharraf and his coterie
6572668 musharraf was to resign on february 18 but he delayed it till august 18 reinforcing the public will and strengthening the coalition governments legitimate struggle to put democracy on track

6572674 four attacks in two days ships being hijacked and crews being taken and large ransoms being demanded is completely unacceptable

6572676 give piracy a much higher priority to bring this under control there have been seven vessels hijacked since the 20th of july

6572678 dont you dare talk about politics in a baseball forum
6572679 you can read a history book about what happened then or someone will say there were tanks here but when you see these photos you know it was real
6572680 this is no longer 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia when a great power invaded a small neighbor and overthrew its government
6572681 russia never changes theyre incapable of being free so they dont want anyone else to enjoy their freedom
6572682 if you compare slovak and czech reactions there is one key difference the soviets attacked the czechoslovak leadership in prague which many slovaks themselves did not identify with
6572683 compared with czech attitudes in the streets and in political parties anti russian feelings are much more charged than in slovakia

6572690 is it iran russia the price of oil terrorism it may in some ways look like the cold war again but the context today is blurred past recognition
6572691 will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic means
6572692 nato is trying to make a victim of an aggressor georgia and whitewash a criminal regime
6572693 the russian federation and the united states are not about to enter a new cold war even if tensions between moscow and washington rise dramatically
6572694 the cold war pitted an ideologically driven soviet union against the free world a conflict where both sides devoted enormous resources to defeat the other
6572695 an ideologically driven notion that the only possible choices these two countries have for relations are total conflict or total agreement neither of which is possible or desirable
6572696 we are stuck in relationships in which major powers are not enemies but not friends
6572697 the un isnt working the new world order and the democracy surplus never came to be but there are networks of capital and cooperation between russia china and the west that werent there before
6572698 a new context of fear rippling through its border regions

6572813 the drier areas are becoming drier while the wetter areas are becoming wetter
6572814 in the past the rivers had a fairly constant flow throughout the summer due to melt water now you have a lot of rain in the spring and then you have fairly dry conditions throughout the rest of the summer
6572815 maybe before your district was suffering from one flash flood every season and that was perhaps what people managed to cope with but if you get three or four or five flash floods maybe thats too much the question is how much more can people tolerate without losing their basis for livelihood

6573226 the price of utilities of gas oil and everything went up
6573227 but then we have to take into consideration too that we had a lot of soldiers that were deployed
6573228 the thing that s really killing us is the utilities
6573229 i m burning 135 euro a month just on gas
6573230 i had to pay a final bill that was a little bit higher than i thought
6573231 the governor has the power to decide if our national guard troops are to be used on a federal level
6573232 our resolution will call on him to do just that
6573233 the consent of a governor described in subsections b and d may not be withheld in whole or in part with regard to active duty outside the united states its territories and its possessions because of any objection to the location purpose type or schedule of such active duty
6573234 i look forward to seeing continued improvement in workforce diversity and complaint processing
6573235 another advantage to the grievance and arbitration process is that in the event of a mixed case alleging discrimination and an unfair labor practice or contract violation we will get a fair hearing on all those issues before someone who is familiar with the law and practice in all those areas
6573236 eeoc hearings do not necessarily consider contract violations or violations of statutes other than those prohibiting discrimination
6573237 now more than ever before with the increasing expectations of government institutions federal agencies must position themselves to attract develop and retain a top quality work force in order to ensure our nations continued growth security and prosperity to develop this competitive highly qualified work force federal agencies must fully utilize the talents of all employees regardless of race color religion national origin sex or disability
6573238 when i hear the word elitist linked with barack obama to me that is a code word for uppity
6573239 i find it extremely offensive and john mccain should know better and until this election he handled himself in a far more enlightened way theyre not using the word elitist by
6573240 its not a surprise anymore when he goes out there and pitches like that
6573241 its against detroit next tuesday thats where my focus is
6573242 i usually do a good job of getting out of those problems
6573243 its not like those errors would have ended the inning im not making good pitches after that
6573244 i had to battle the double plays were big give credit to the offense when you get five runs in the first three innings it gives you some cushion
6573245 youre going to get yourself in tough situations and you have to limit the damage
6573246 cliff has done a good job of that this season
6573247 its going to be a stopping block for this community
6573248 i have nothing but good things to save about them
6573249 the free market didnt want to move in and improve this property
6573250 there are two reasons for this turnover first the position is often ill defined and the expectations unreasonable secondly the ceo has hired a cmo to facilitate change and yet the cmos have very little authority they are expected to change things but only as a corporate staff person in this way the cmo is a sort of advisor
6573251 if you say you want change in the way you do marketing but dont want to break any eggs its not going to happen
6573252 what would you do if i created an action plan that changed the direction of your marketing as needed to achieve the objectives you just outlined to me you approved it but some my peers and a few other senior executives feared that the required changes threatened their positions in some way and no matter how persuasive i was getting broad consensus on the required changes could never happen without forcing the needed decision what would you do
6573253 it is wholly your role and responsibility to get consensus and support for the ideas you bring to the table it is 100 your responsibility to persuade and move the organization for the needed marketing changes

6573262 were delighted to have a debate on judgment with barack obama who bought his own million dollar mansion in a shady deal with a convicted felon sen obama is obviously frustrated and abandoning his politics of hope for negative personal attacks
6573263 i will put my judgment on foreign policy over the last five years against john mccains anytime anytime
6573264 i think an objective analysis would say ive been right a lot more than he has for all his years in washington
6573265 cold when i am denied it your light is ultraviolet
6573266 theres a traditional idea that the critics thats us guys who write stuff about games and lob a number between 6 and 10 at the end to drum up a comments thread and or death threats have rarefied and or completely counter populist tastes wed more happily hail a game made entirely of the string and weeds thats emerged blinking into the sunlight from the anus of a man quoting proust than a good four square solid meat and potato game like our mum used to make and to a degree its true problem is its just not true enough but i think its growing more so and theres a chance this year could be the turning point
6573267 i am writing this by hand because i have not been able to locate a wi fi signal anywhere in the castle the count appears to have the oddest notions of how business is conducted in this day and age
6573268 ive been so busy this post will be mega long and picture packed

6573274 they also cost more we dont think its fair for someone whos deaf to have to pay more for his or her cell phone than someone whos hearing
6573275 the bottom line is that airgun noise from seismic surveys that are thousands of yards distant does not drive away sperm whales living in the gulf
6573276 however some individual whales feeding at depth reduced the rate at which they searched acoustically for their prey when scientists carried out controlled exposure experiments by bringing seismic surveys close by the whales as a result the oil and gas industry has agreed to a best practice attitude that seismic surveys should shut down temporarily when towed airguns come within one third of a mile of whales or groups of whales in the gulf
6573277 sperm whales go to where their food source is and that means very deep water so folks that do see them are marine mammal observers who ride the seismic survey vessels and the workers on the big oil and gas rigs and even that does not happen often
6573278 we now know that the sperm whales in the gulf appear to be their own distinct stock they show genetic and social differences from other sperm whales around the world
6573279 there are believed to be about 500 to 1 500 sperm whales that reside in the gulf
6573280 the five year study has greatly contributed to our knowledge of sperm whales especially those found in the gulf of mexico its also raised new questions we need to know more about such as their feeding and breeding patterns theres still a lot we dont know about these huge creatures
6573281 the research raises the perception both of how common these events are and specifically where they may occur
6573282 today with so many more buildings and people a magnitude 5 centered below the city would be extremely attention getting
6573283 wed see billions in damage with some brick buildings falling people would probably be killed
6573284 we need to step backward from the simple old model where you worry about one large obvious fault like they do in california
6573285 the problem here comes from many subtle faults we now see there is earthquake activity on them each one is small but when you add them up they are probably more dangerous than we thought we need to take a very close look
6573286 the probability is not zero and the damage could be great
6573287 it could be like something out of a greek myth
6573288 indian point is situated at the intersection of the two most striking linear features marking the seismicity and also in the midst of a large population that is at risk in case of an accident
6573289 this is clearly one of the least favorable sites in our study area from an earthquake hazard and risk perspective
6573290 new data developed in the last 20 years disclose a substantially higher likelihood of significant earthquake activity in the vicinity of indian point that could exceed the earthquake design for the facility
6573291 nothing happens for a while then it goes with a bang
6573292 is a major substantiation of a feature that bears on the long term earthquake risk of the northeastern united states
6573293 it gives us the best possible evidence that we have an earthquake hazard here that should be a factor in any planning decision it crystallizes the argument that this hazard is not random there is a structure to the location and timing of the earthquakes this enables us to contemplate risk in an entirely different way and since we are able to do that we should be required to do that
6573294 these findings shed light on why in listening environments such as noisy parties or restaurants it is more difficult to follow a conversation involving many people where the relevant talker often and unexpectedly changes locations than to focus on one talker at one location exclusively
6573295 in addition these results may have implications for visual attention in tasks where object formation and target segmentation is challenging or where the identity of a visual object depends upon continuity of visual features over time
6573296 random processes could promote job sharing in many different types of organisms
6573297 the impact of climate change on human and global security could extend far beyond the limited scope the world has seen thus far
6573298 most critical for human survival are water and food which are sensitive to changing climatic conditions
6573299 environmental changes caused by global warming will not only affect human living conditions but may also generate larger societal effects by threatening the infrastructures of society or by inducing social responses that aggravate the problem
6573300 the associated socio economic and political stress can undermine the functioning of communities the effectiveness of institutions and the stability of societal structures these degraded conditions could contribute to civil strife and worse armed conflict
6573301 large areas of africa are suffering from scarcity of food and fresh water resources making them more vulnerable to conflict an example is sudans darfur province where an ongoing conflict was aggravated since droughts forced arab herders to move into areas of african farmers
6573302 although climate change bears a significant conflict potential it can also transform the international system toward more cooperation if it is seen as a common threat that requires joint action
6573303 the bali roadmap has many good ideas but was criticized as being too vague to induce a major policy shift
6573304 nevertheless the seeming conflict between environment and the economy will be best overcome with the recognition that protecting the climate in the best interest of the economy
6573305 history has shown how dependent our culture is on a narrow window of climatic conditions for average temperature and precipitation
6573306 the great human civilizations began to flourish after the last ice age and some disappeared due to droughts and other adverse shifts in the climate
6573307 the consequences were quite severe in parts of europe associated with loss of harvest and population decline
6573308 riots and military conflicts became more likely as a recent empirical study has suggested
6573309 the challenge is to slow down the dynamics and stabilize the climate system at levels which are not dangerous
6573310 global warming receives now more public and political attention than a few years ago
6573311 grass roots movements are emerging in the united states for protecting the climate and developing energy alternatives involving not only many local communities and companies but also influential states such as california led by gov arnold schwarzenegger
6573312 congressional and presidential candidates now acknowledge that something has to be done to play a leading role on energy and climate change to not fall behind the rest of the world
6573313 it is like compacting your entire wardrobe into a shoebox
6573314 what takes care of neutralizing dna to allow chromosomes to condense
6573315 did dinoflagellates once have histones and then lost them or did dinoflagellates never have histones and just figured out a different way to fold large amounts of dna into chromosomes
6573316 chromosomes would fall apart when calcium and magnesium were removed
6573317 cations play a very important role in the folding and charge neutralization of dna in all eukaryotes but more so in dinoflagellates

6573319 there is now incontrovertible evidence that marketing of tobacco and the depiction of smoking in the movies promote youth smoking and can cause young people to begin smoking
6573320 the role of the media in promoting and reducing tobacco use
6573321 the role of marketing in the success of the tobacco companies is conclusive
6573322 the reports recommendations offer the best approach to employ marketing techniques and the media to help prevent a further increase in youth smoking
6573323 this direct link between marketing and tobacco use is very powerful
6573324 anti tobacco ads before films and a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising are two effective strategies found to curb effects of tobacco images on youth now we need to use marketing to steer youth and others away from tobacco
6573325 our dna analysis corroborates what the historical sources say namely that vanilla was a trade item brought to tahiti by french sailors in the mid 19th century the french admiral responsible for introducing vanilla to tahiti alphonse hamelin used vanilla cuttings from the philippines the historical record tells us that vanilla which isnt native to the philippines was previously introduced to the region via the manila galleon trade from the new world and specifically from guatemala
6573326 the pre columbian maya had been managing their forests for millennia to cultivate cacao and to make chocolate and we know they were also cultivating vanilla to use it as a chocolate spice the maya created these forest gardens by introducing different types of species of wild cacao and vanilla from the surrounding forests which meant that species that had previously been geographically separated were then able to hybridize because they were in the same place thats the scenario we present in our research paper for how tahitian vanilla got started it is an evolutionary product but also a maya artifact
6573327 pesach has demonstrated that vanilla species can exchange genes quite frequently across species barriers
6573328 this provides an opportunity to breed new commercial varieties of vanilla through hybridization in the future

6573336 there was an altercation involving an unknown male who obviously threw something through a window he said

6573339 through their heroics they entered there and retrieved one male who was nearly unconscious he was unable to get out on his own sgt connolly said

6573423 gwens so excited to have this baby because she gained a lot of weight during this pregnancy
6573424 it looks pretty nice its very wide and the surface looks very smooth it looks pretty fun so we will see tomorrow it looks nice when you walk it but it is a different story when you go 300km h around it but i expect to have good fun when we drive around
6573425 it takes a few laps when you know where to go but you learn and learn all the time small things and small lines but i would not say it is too hard
6573426 there are a few bumps because i guess they need to turn the bridge sometimes that is the only place where i found any bumps on the circuit and one of them is in the middle of the corner so that might affect things a bit but apart from that the circuit looks very smooth and very well done we will see tomorrow how good it is in the end but i expect to have quite good fun
6573427 definitely we would rather have won more races we had some chances but in the end we couldnt win them but we are still in a good position for the championship although the season could have been much better it could also have been much worse
6573428 overall i am happy where we are right now lately the races have not been exactly what i was expecting so hopefully we will get some good races now and get back where we should be the biggest issue is getting stuck behind people after having a bad qualifying so if we can sort out that then we should be fine we just need to work on some things and hopefully we will get back to winning some races
6573429 there are some circuits coming that i enjoy hopefully we can get things sorted out so that we can really fight for wins we have the good speed as long as we can use it in qualifying in the race we should be fine
6573430 i dont really worry about anything there are many races to go it is easy to lose points but also easy to win we will try to do the best every weekend and hopefully after a few races we are still in a good position and then we can try and win the championship
6573431 more or less there is pressure every race so it doesnt really change anything when it gets later in the season when you have the chance to win the championship it is more crucial not to make any mistakes but that is normal all the time like i said we will do the best we can every race and then see where we end up
6573432 we will try at least at the last race i ran off the circuit as the handling was not what we expected i just ran wide it is always easy to say that i have fixed this or that but we should be fine
6573433 we know when we get everything as we want that we have the speed but it hasnt been easy it is a similar situation to last year so its not the first time to be in this position hopefully we can fix it now and have better qualifying and better races after that
6573434 every race is crucial its not just monaco the last race if you look you could not get past anybody if they did not make a mistake so it is the same here the circuit is very wide and there are some long straights so here there are some better overtaking chances than in hungary
6573435 but still if you are not in front then you are going to lose many seconds stuck behind people even if you get past them in the end it is always crucial to be at the front
6573436 there is no one issue sometimes it goes right sometimes not at the last race i ran off the circuit which doesnt help but like i said we havent been exactly happy with the handling and it easily makes it look worse than it is
6573437 the problem is that it is very close between everybody now and if you are one tenth slower you lose three places we would have fixed it if we knew what to do but i think we will find a solution we just need to put more effort in and try to get it right
6573438 q do you think the summer break was a help for you allowing you to recharge a bit
6573439 i really dont know we will see tomorrow and over the weekend but i enjoyed it i had a good time we havent had good races lately for many different reasons but we know we have the speed if we get things right so im not too worried about it the main thing like i said before is the qualifying after that we have good speed when we get it right
6573440 i was mainly home just doing different stuff seeing my friends and family and just enjoying it ive been watching a lot of the olympics enjoying whatever sport was on and for me the highlights have been the sprint races the one hundred and two hundred metres especially
6573441 well what can i say i havent been fast enough that is the first point without going off in the last qualifying we could easily have been in third place so it is the small things that when it goes wrong you lose a lot of time and it looks much worse than it is
6573442 it can be just a small issue and it makes you go off the circuit and run wide and you lose a lot of time since we changed to these tyres even last year i wasnt exactly happy in qualifying even though in race conditions we are much happier with the car
6573443 it is not a new issue sometimes we get it right and sometimes we dont
6573444 but we are still looking for it and it depends a lot on the circuits at some circuits it is easier to get it right at some its very difficult hopefully we have found some halfway solution where we are fast but can still be happy with
6573445 i dont see any point to do anything silly we are as hard as we can be we try to overtake when we have a chance but it is not so easy to get in the position always i dont see any point to be harder to any one of them we are hard to anybody and we try to win
6573446 the difference is only five points but every time we are behind him we are going to lose more points so definitely we will try to be in front of the people who are ahead of us i dont think i am driving better than before i dont think i drove badly before we just could not get it right so well see what we can do this weekend and go from there
6573447 vamos tentar encontrar o melhor acerto para o carro e assim lutaremos por uma boa classifica o claro que tudo depende do circuito e como n o conhecemos a pista de val ncia acredito que possamos desenvolver um bom trabalho
6573448 apesar de tudo estou feliz com nosso momento nossas ltimas corridas n o foram exatamente o que hav amos planejado mas esperamos nos recuperar a partir desta prova e assim voltar ao mesmo patamar de sempre

6573764 ah the pigeons figures always suspected they were smarter than they let on john
6573765 i feel compelled to point out that there was a controversial finding a few years ago that pigeons
6573766 copy paste and enjoy the best artist youve never heard about
6573767 its going to be a stopping block for this community
6573768 i have nothing but good things to save about them
6573769 the free market didnt want to move in and improve this property
6573770 its unfortunate that barack and his allies have sunk to such depths that they are trying to draw connections that dont exist and everyone knows dont exist
6573771 and the republican power broker ralph reed was in the middle of it in deep with convicted felon and lobbyist jack abramoff but when the senate investigated the senator in charge never even called reed to testify and that senator john mccain and whos now raising money for mccains campaign ralph reed
6573772 is willing to do whatever it takes to win even if it means embracing president bushs policies his tactics and now his disgraced fundraisers
6573773 im in washington at meetings that have been scheduled for quite some time
6573774 im strongly supporting senator mccain and proud to do so because of his record for lower taxes stronger families and a 26 year pro life voting record in congress
6573775 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6573776 ralph reed or not one of the things the democrats have been phenomenally successful in doing is characterizing all republican campaigns as below the belt dirty tricks
6573777 he cannot be trusted to bring change to washington politics
6573778 watchdog groups are floored that mccain who has worked with them for years to reform campaign finance law has called on reed to help bundle contributions
6573779 but having said that many small blips can turn into something thats more problematic
6573780 john mccain led the committee that went after jack abramoff
6573781 no one is more responsible for putting jack abramoff behind bars
6573782 i think reed could be viewed as an asset to mccain for fundraising hes still a great fundraiser
6573783 if barack obama wants to run a campaign based on associations
6573784 im sure the american electorate will want to revisit his relationship with a number of his associates including tony rezko
6573785 as ive traveled around alaska you know i havent had that question asked to me by anyone but a newsperson

6573853 there have been eight cases of salmonella agona to date in wales of a total of 119 and the investigation seeks to establish the source of the illness
6573854 salmonella is usually contracted by eating contaminated food and can cause diarrhoea stomach cramps and sometimes vomiting and fever
6573855 people who become ill with salmonella generally make a full recovery but serious complications may occur in frail elderly people very young children and people with impaired immune systems such groups may need to exercise additional care to avoid salmonella infections
6573856 more specific information should become available as investigations progress but meanwhile it is important for people with symptoms of salmonella to ensure that they wash their hands regularly to prevent the spread of the infection to other people
6573857 anyone who believes they may be suffering from food poisoning should contact their gp or local authority environmental health department

6573880 the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
6573881 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6573882 people should not be forced to say or do things that they find morally wrong
6573883 words in that draft led some to misconstrue the departments intent
6573884 this regulation is consistent with my intent to focus squarely on the issue of conscience rights this specifically goes to the issue of abortion and conscience

6573889 its time for colorado voters to see the real betsy markey
6573890 her years as a democratic operative have taught her to cynically manipulate the truth and thats what shes doing now the fact is that while anwr is the size of the fourth district the total drilling area in anwr is about the size of centerra in loveland when more than 70 percent of voters are in favor of increased domestic exploration and middle class budgets are straining to pay for soaring fuel costs why does betsy markey continue to toe the line for her friends the defenders of wildlife we hope betsy will quit hiding behind false campaign ads paid for by her surrogates and answer to the voters in a debate with congresswoman musgrave on the issue of anwr

6573897 this is the first report to conclude that tobacco advertising and promotion increases tobacco use
6573898 its the first report to make the conclusion that there is a causal relationship between exposure to depiction of smoking in the movies and youth beginning to smoke
6573899 cigarettes are one of the most heavily marketed products in the united states
6573900 now it is up to the government to consider the evidence and think about what it needs to do in terms of advertising and promotion
6573901 this report sends an unmistakable message to our elected officials that they can dramatically reduce tobacco use by children and by adults by passing legislation that would authorize the food and drug administration to regulate tobacco products and by adequately funding their state prevention and cessation programs
6573902 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health

6573920 although most library positions are held by women there is a real opportunity for men as heads of technical libraries and as directors of city public libraries
6573921 mr dana is perhaps the best known librarian in america and has written books and many articles on the subject of this interview this statement was his answer to my question about the library field as a vocation for young men
6573922 the opportunities in this field he continued are sure to increase in number and worth
6573923 a man must be born to library work if he feels called to this field of activity he may look forward to a life of great pleasure but of modest income his position is generally secure and he has an opportunity to assume a place of importance in the community
6573924 i would advise a young man to get a general college training before entering a library school preferably he should spend a year in a library before taking this course to see if his tastes will be satisfied by this field most library schools demand a high school training before entrance
6573925 the lowest salary paid to a trained librarian after leaving school is about 1 200 a year an average salary for an assistant librarian would be about 2 000 a year private libraries pay from 2 500 to 4 000 a year

6574106 from a practical standpoint mmax allows a retail or commercial customer to walk into a community bank and place up to 5 million in a money market account with fdic insurance on the full account balance
6574107 and the funds are only placed in well capitalized banks as designated by the fdic
6574108 pcbb has been very pleased with its experience with the idc deposit program and they are now committed to support this innovation by providing the custodial services to idc deposits customers quality and privacy are of the utmost importance our values are in synch with those of idc deposits
6574109 with all of the uncertainty in the financial markets mmax provides a community banks customers with assurance that all of their deposits will be safe and secure and fully fdic insured
6574110 in addition we recognize the convenience value to bank customers being able to achieve full fdic insurance directly through their own local bank rather than having to open accounts at multiple banks themselves
6574111 our customers money market funds will only be spread among highly capitalized financial institutions
6574112 but in real terms their money market account is accepted and distributed right here at home so the process is seamless to the saver the two major issues are the customers convenience one stop shopping and full fdic insurance protection for their funds
6574113 our participation in mmax will enhance the banking experience of our customers and allow them peace of mind in knowing their funds are safe and secure

6574179 the raider organization the national football league and the world have lost a great man
6574180 he is as prominent a sportsman as the world has known
6574181 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6574182 this is deeper than head of the union passing away and its deeper than an ex player this is missing someone that is and was like family its a tough day for all of us
6574183 from what i hear he was a pretty good player
6574184 he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy
6574185 we loved him and he loved us we will miss him
6574186 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6574187 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children
6574188 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6574189 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6574190 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6574191 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6574192 we label guys prospects or fourth outfielders or 4 a guys or injury prone like with luddy
6574193 he wanted me to know what he was doing how hard he was working how committed he was to find a place that would give him a chance
6574194 id like to think they were the results of playing the game hard or freak accidents to be injury free for three years in a row now
6574195 just proving to myself i could do this is edifying up until last year i didnt know if i could do it or not i hadnt been given the time so last year finally when i did get it i felt like yeah i can
6574196 thats all you can say we got a guy who was big and strong who had a lot of potential and we took a chance most of the time those dont work

6574238 youre playing in very different emotional territory with the olympics
6574239 if youre a 41 year old mom and you win the 50 meter freestyle which is the creme de la creme of speed
6574240 it takes too much attention off of why you did what you did and what you hope to do with it and makes it just about the performance

6574303 sailors have their favourite sails it is quite important that if they do rip a sail they get it back for the next race

6574305 hopefully we will do a good job for everybody but you are only as good as your last job i dont think it is going to push us to the next level
6574306 hopefully they are going to tidy up the area because it has got completely run down
6574307 we look at the olympics as an enormous free marketing campaign
6574308 it is going to bring tens of thousands of people to the area the amount of money people are going to spend on food drink transport and accommodation is going to be extensive
6574309 when we developed marinas in other areas which were not so affluent we found these areas have been lifted
6574310 progress and some very significant progress is being made in all aspects of our legacy drive

6574324 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
6574325 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6574326 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6574327 you know hes got a longer track record than that

6574340 off the ice there isnt a finer person his effort and production as a hockey player was nothing short of triumphant and even today his dedication to the community is incomparable we are proud to have adam join his fellow 1994 stanley cup champion teammates mike richter mark messier and brian leetch as well as legends rod gilbert and eddie giacomin as his number is raised to the rafters of madison square garden
6574341 rangers history is enriched by players like andy bathgate and harry howell who laid the foundation for what a rangers player should be

6574344 ive had bad experiences in the past i just want to shape my curls
6574345 i dont want pyramid hair and please dont cut more than a few millimeters off the longest layers

6574347 but as long as i get a good cut im happy
6574348 with a computer our customers can load the bread the night before program a finish time and get a perfect slice of toast when they awaken
6574349 what i like about it is its got a hidden agenda it looks as if its about listening and joining with allies except the idea here which mccain cant say but i can is to essentially kill the un nobodys going to walk out of the un theres a lot of emotional attachment to it in the us how do you kill it you create a parallel institution

6574365 a member of the public was walking in castings avenue when she saw the car swerve and then noticed a child banging on the back window and shouting stop mummy driving stop mummy driving
6574366 she ran towards the car which had stopped and the witness opened the rear door and took the child out she shouted for the accused to stop but she continued to drive in an erratic manner
6574367 she careered over the carriageway mounted the pavement and hit a fence a concerned bystander contacted the police and another motorist noted the numberplate
6574368 she has very little recollection of that day she is ashamed and upset and is quite often in tears during our conversations
6574369 there has been social work intervention and the child has now been placed with her parents she can only have supervised contact with her daughter now
6574370 you endangered yourself and members of the public and you had your five year old child in the car exposing her to danger

6574377 i must emphasise that there is absolutely no evidence of collusion on energy prices but it is a case of follow my leader i would expect that in a truly competitive market the companies would try to compete away the difference off each other but that would not appear to be the case
6574378 global demand for all types of energy has risen steeply and supplies of finite resources like oil and gas are under intense pressure
6574379 the country now relies on energy imports and the prices we all pay for electricity and gas are ultimately determined by the law of supply and demand in a global economy

6574382 we are still looking for more improvement but this is massive in terms of the number of youngsters who passed five gcses without english and maths which was nearly 50 per cent of the school compared to 29 per cent last year
6574383 this is a process that is already under way but theres no doubt we have to accelerate that progress
6574384 he has obstructed the administration of justice he has erected a multitude of new offices and sent hither swarms of offices to harass our people he has kept among us standing armies without the consent of our legislatures he has effected to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power he has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution
6574385 it the market crash of 1929 was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
6574386 ill tell you anything you want to know about mark pavelich ive got some stories
6574387 first of all you know what i like about them as soon as you get off the plane everythings already done someone meets you and gives you an envelope that has your itinerary your transportation even your money
6574388 if i phone him he answers right away if i e mail him he answers right away hes an aggressive type a personality but you kind of have to be in his job
6574389 he likes what he does and wants to be able to make some money doing what he likes
6574390 a lot of americans dont realize that you cant come up here and get paid without a work visa its unfortunate but whats pavelich going to do about it
6574391 i pavelich called his manager like fifty times and they wouldnt answer so i finally flipped out and immediately the message gets posted on the internet
6574392 ive never had a problem with him because im straight up and honest with him he speaks his mind and he likes other people who do the same it pisses some people off but you always know where you stand he likes what he does and hes a f ing scrapper man

6574396 softball like vermont politics is built into the foundation of small towns and rural community and i hope this is an event to celebrate those components that are still making our state strong today
6574397 this challenge is our chance as gubernatorial candidates to escape the partisan politics that often confuse campaigns and to remind voters that we all have the same goal which is to strengthen the state we all love and lead it forward to a better tomorrow
6574398 its a new and exciting way for the candidates to interact we wanted to show our support for the effort anyway even though the governor cant be there
6574399 basically it will be a huge bucket of gloves and an old fashion style vermont ball game
6574400 i hope that the event in some way can create some interest in the election and bring us back to the idea that its not about fighting between democrats republicans and independents
6574401 its not a typical thing where its one team against another
6574402 its just all of us who are working on campaigns and excited about the election playing ball together we are all trying to do what we think is best for the state
6574403 we will look into it we have a formal complaint the possibility is we will take an enforcement action
6574404 san jose p d told them that scotts valley police had the vehicle impounded and they needed to come talk to us

6574435 after recently being asked to reassess my retirement ive decided to join englands squad after careful consideration
6574436 its something i have been thinking about for a period of time and due to recent injuries the opportunity has arisen for me to play a role in this series
6574437 i decided to retire from englands one day team for a number reasons one being the amount of time i was spending away from my family
6574438 now that my family is settled and my bowling is settled i feel i have something to offer
6574439 having missed out on selection at various times this year i am well aware of the disappointment that comes from not being a part of the england dressing room
6574440 with that in mind i want to be a part of the team and if that means bringing myself out of retirement to play a role in this series then im happy to do just that
6574441 at the moment my focus is on doing well against south africa and im not looking beyond that
6574442 after the high of the test series it has been very difficult to maintain the levels we reached

6574451 we were curious about what they were going to do during the olympics so our testing was tailored for that
6574452 we were interested in whether there was going to be different filtering policies for those in the media center and other places in beijing and other places in china the answer seems to be no and thats interesting
6574453 i dont know how they decide to choose one versus another
6574454 i let him win hole after hole with pars and thats not going to get it done when you let him do that
6574455 i dont want to make it sound like i gave it to him though he deserves the credit he played better than i did
6574456 i cant believe im standing here with an olympic silver medal and im p ed off
6574457 its not what i wanted but ill take it i had to get the lead back a few times and in the end it was not enough
6574458 it hurts and im upset i came here to achieve a lot more
6574459 it was a tough competition but i didnt have any doubts that i could win
6574460 theres a lot of people who dream of competing at this level and ive come a long way since last year but i have to keep improving
6574461 this is my first major medal outdoors and i dont want to be content with silver theres another four years for the next chance i will go on to london
6574462 this is the turning point of my life my dream has been realised and ill be even better in the future
6574463 its all about dispelling some of the mystique of competing at the olympic games
6574464 for example taking a group of young amateur boxers to the boxing venue to experience what it is like to have 13 000 people in the crowd is something unprecedented the more we can do to prepare people for that sort of environment the better
6574465 atlanta was my first games and it was but both daunting and exciting
6574466 but once you get past the initial feeling of being star struck and overwhelmed it has to be back to business as usual
6574467 the republican party has never ever contacted me theyve never talked to me never written to me never communicated in any fashion just what you have said
6574468 i intend to run i intend to be the governor for the next 2 1 2 years and i intend to run for reelection
6574469 what that does is show up in the five year survival rate
6574470 if you find a degenerative condition like cancer earlier firstly treatment generally tends to be more successful but also you tend to influence that five year survival effect anyway because you find the disease earlier
6574471 no one else is expected to work for free except for musicians and software developers for some reason
6574472 its telling me the long term up trend is still intact
6574473 stocks are very low demand is holding up and non opec supplies remain very disappointing
6574474 in this type of environment the scale of the move down in prices was really looking overdone
6574475 players taking a net bearish position since late july according to commodity futures trading commission data
6574476 clear rules that if domestic production of raw cane sugar is inadequate the import quota for raw cane sugar can be increased but the quota for refined sugar cannot unless additional imports of raw sugar fail to relieve a domestic sugar shortage
6574477 the usda action on august 6 which left the raw sugar quota unchanged ignored these rules
6574478 said one usda official because the under the new sugar program under the new farm bill does not become effective until oct 1
6574479 we probably have enough raw sugar but even if we didnt weve had this constraint on refining capacity because of the plant that blew up in georgia
6574480 so getting more raw sugar in all that does is just exacerbate the strain on refining capacity and probably doesnt increase the production of refined sugar in the short term
6574481 if they had just increased this years refined sugar quota which ends sept 30 we would not have complained
6574482 theyre very clear about it theyre letting in refined sugar today to meet demand tomorrow
6574483 increasing the amount of refined sugar that can enter during october 1 december 31 2008 without first increasing the raw trq for that period above the bound minimum level usda has done an endrun around the intent of congress thereby achieving what congress prohibited
6574484 the dollar really just got kicked in the teeth today
6574485 its not only crude oil we saw basically all the commodities up sharply
6574486 right now it sort of feels like we do have a bottom here in the market

6574506 automatic mental associations have the potential to distort peoples perceptions of reality
6574507 biased perception of the information provides the basis for future decisions leading them in one direction or another
6574508 the distorting influence of perception on reality is particularly pronounced when the information is ambiguous and in the political domain we often have to deal with ambiguous information
6574509 what these guys did thats particularly nice is follow people through the process
6574510 the basic structure of what theyre talking about could apply to political and social decisions
6574511 its much easier to create a negative association technically its possible to create a positive association but you need to work much harder
6574512 from the perspective of a voter who doesnt want to be a slave of their automatic mental associations our study can inform people of how their mind works and resolve the unawareness of unawareness
6574513 you can practice changing your cognition and being a little more thoughtful about how you approach things

6574567 im very happy to have curt back as he is one of the leagues top players
6574568 curt is a finesse player who has a strong connection with tracey kelusky they balance well off each other they are both finishers good goal scorers and have intelligent lacrosse minds
6574569 he is probably the most sought after player in our league right now for upcoming offensive talent
6574570 theyre going to focus on people looking for something to buy
6574571 they had to limit their scope and this is where theyre going to start
6574572 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6574573 most teachers hold themselves accountable they didnt go into teaching to make money they dont have seven houses
6574574 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6574575 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6574576 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6574577 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6574578 theres probably more complexity on the chip than they expected

6574586 our goal is to get them to fall in love with aperture but were perfectly happy to have them using other tools as well
6574587 these guys are working under incredibly tight deadlines and there are situations where theyre panicking
6574588 we can really say weve made significant inroads in this segment
6574589 particularly in delivering a quick editing workflow that can truly keep up with these guys
6574590 you see what these guys really need and what they go through and as a product manager its been amazing to spend that much time absorbing how people respond to our current product its worth more than a big stack of market research papers just to be able to work with these photographers
6574591 what interesting or out of the ordinary things have you ever done to get connected to the internet and or company network when working remotely
6574592 had to climb on my mothers roof once it was so fun i actually saw a naked neighbor girl
6574593 drove 15 miles away from old faithful geyser to achieve a complete internet connection due to static from geyser emissions energy
6574594 driven to the local coffee shop and purchased a muffin to use their wireless
6574595 had to hack into a phone line at a hotel to get dial up to work many years ago
6574596 i have plugged my laptop into a hospital ethernet line because the wireless was down
6574597 i have researched hotels that do not provide internet but are nearby wireless hubs to get connection freely
6574598 i went up to the top of a mountain and worked for a week from a tent
6574599 logged into hotel conference rooms to get the connection for free
6574600 paid for a cab ride while i worked on the internet
6574601 plugged into electricity from the city of seattle that was on a pole on the sidewalk but only for a few minutes
6574602 held my laptop out a window to get the wi fi next door so i could send an important email
6574603 sat outside an airport for 4 hours so i could use the free wireless across the street
6574604 ive done a lot of crazy things but ill never be able to admit it or id lose my dignity
6574605 moved throughout my home because of connection problems i found myself sitting in a ducky chair in my toddlers room because that is where i got the best connection
6574606 i think a laundromat is the strangest one i ever hooked up to
6574607 its way too early to talk about this being a viable product category
6574608 im not sure how much of a market there is for them particularly with subnotebooks like macbook air with larger keyboards and displays getting thinner and lighter and you can get some real work done on say an iphone or a nokia e series smart phone
6574609 the eee pc has successfully explored user segments that have been ignored by other notebook vendors
6574610 for example a lot of kids use their parents notebooks but they are just too heavy to carry to school but at two pounds kids can easily put ultraportables in their backpacks
6574611 initial response to our product has been great and after making changes based on feedback along with adding new features we feel the product is ready for prime time
6574612 weve added a handy saved search feature so users can now easily keep track of their favorite searches and get updated results
6574613 additionally a useful and fun tool is our new buzz graphs feature which allows visitors to see the popularity of various terms within the online community space as well as refine terms by category and share the results with colleagues
6574614 twing com searches across real conversations between real people in the forum space forum search can now take its place next to blog search as an important tool for users to seek out and participate in online social spaces
6574615 online forums are an established yet growing medium people have been using even prior to blogs and social networks
6574616 but those who seek out online discussions to ask questions seek and offer advice and so on havent had an effective means to seek out these spaces until now our goal is to help people find appropriate venues to participate in discussions by providing both a forum search and a directory resource
6574617 it appears that more time or resolution to the two companys problems may be needed before stocks can resume their uptrend
6574618 fannie and freddie worries and rumors about lehman and a pulled credit line seem to be sending money back out of the financials and back into commodities
6574619 now we all have to wonder once again just how bad this credit crisis will get and which bank is going to be the next one that comes tumbling down how bad are things at fannie and freddie and will that mean that money will run to oil for cover
6574620 we were able to take on all these concerns over freddie and fannie and lehman brothers and we have the market which rallied back from its lows
6574621 that as bad as things are in the financials in the economy things are not as bad as the financials make it seem
6574622 the level of claims may not be at recession like levels yet it is elevated enough to continue to feed concerns about rising unemployment and the residual effect on consumer spending activity
6574623 we dont allow controversial or political advertising in our concourse and this was both
6574624 it is content that is considered objectionable in a safe and secure environment and we got a lot of complaints about it
6574625 its time to get serious about reducing the nuclear threat
6574626 nuclear weapons are scary and thats why we need to pay attention to them
6574627 but to say that the billboard is anti mccain is ludicrous in fact both mccain and obama largely agree with us that we need to rid the world of nuclear weapons these are not attack ads they are a strong reminder to both candidates that this is a very serious issue they need to address northwest airlines is trying to censor free speech and i dont think thats their role
6574628 under no circumstances shall displays embody controversial social moral political or ethical issues
6574629 advertising messages shall be in good taste professionally developed and presented in a manner that enhances the image of the airport
6574630 while no one has complained yet my first response would not be to take it down
6574631 i will pit my judgment on foreign policy over the last five years against john mccains any time any time
6574632 and i think an objective analysis will say that ive been right a lot more than he has for all that time that hes spent in washington
6574633 that doesnt mean though that i know everything ive got to have good smart advisers around me i already do
6574634 my mother taught me that if you dont have anything good to say about anybody you just shouldnt say anything
6574635 i will say that the kind of politics thats all about division and resentment and making people mad at each other hasnt gotten us very far
6574636 it may help you win elections but it sure hasnt put more income in the american family budget it hasnt brought down gas prices it hasnt made college easy to finance
6574637 who does something like that what kind of values are those to make stuff up about people
6574638 protective orders which govern the exchange of information outside of a public docket are obtained pursuant to a good cause standards
6574639 when such information is filed with a court however it becomes part of a public document subject to the right of public access absent showing a compelling justification and a clearly defined and serious injury
6574640 took place so long ago that there is no likely reason their disclosure would cause competitive disadvantage
6574641 litigants may not seal information merely because public disclosure will be embarrassing or will otherwise reflect poorly on them
6574642 we trust the court can find a way to protect the companies trade secrets without blocking all information on the allegations in this case
6574643 wed also hope that in reviewing our motion the court decides that providing trade secret protection to evidence related to illegal business practices and behavior would be adverse to the public interest
6574644 defendant intended for customers to believe its statements and representations about the defective iphone 3gs and to trust that the device wastwice as fast at half the price
6574645 immediately after purchase plaintiff soon noticed that her internet connection receipt and sending of e mail text messages and other data transfers were slower than expected and advertised
6574646 the defective iphone 3g appeared to connect to the 3g standard and protocol less than 25 of the time additionally plaintiff experienced an inordinate amount of dropped calls
6574647 defendant expressly warranted that the defective iphone 3g would betwice as fast and would otherwise perform adequately on the 3g standard or protocol
6574648 the defective iphone 3gs do not conform to these express representations because they fail to connect and or adequately maintain a connection to the 3g standard and or protocol

6574654 to combat dismal click through rates of traditional advertisements these features emulate widgets and encourage users to increase member adoption viral growth and brand interaction
6574655 while costly risky and foreign to brands the biggest missed opportunity for brands in social networks is to become part of the community interact and build real relationships
6574656 although we should expect interaction rates and viral spread to increase with engagement ads brands should wait and see how these ads click through rates perform
6574657 this announcement helps to set in place how online marketing will start to evolve
6574658 widgets have already become advertising units and now these advertisements are starting to become widgets
6574659 facebook must develop a client solution that will help optimize these tools with professional services based on data results and demographic information
6574660 marketers cant afford to experiment with their brand without the help of a trained and experienced group of social marketers provided by the platform
6574661 the comments around the ad dramatically increase engagement with the unit as the highly visible comments provide an opportunity for users to simultaneously draw attention to the ad by drawing attention to themselves
6574662 while this could backfire if comments degrading the advertiser are abundant the ad comments powerfully take advantage of facebooks social dynamics to draw attention to an ad in a way that is impossible without the social graph
6574663 this program is created to breakdown our cultural social paradigms and educate all especially the communities that suffer the most from environmental injustices the inner city who normally miss the green education on how to advocate for a clean healthy environment
6574664 for all schools to have green ambassadors around the world who are agents of change and the voice of the environment

6574668 we are tired of the myths about inner city kids and their apathy towards the environment
6574669 young adults are creating their own stewardship model by teaching each other pooling their resources strengthening their community vision and inspiring people to change youth need to see that they are an influential and vital part of the community the youth of los angeles are the next generation of leaders if they are not included in the community when they are young they may not stay in the community to be the leaders of the future these thoughts were recently expressed by sabina ibarra a youth participant in the leadership clinic green ambassadors and a student at environmental charter high school in lawndale ca
6574670 our strategy through all of our programs is to provide experiences for the green ambassadors to acquire knowledge and develop the skills that will not only help them in this program but also provide them with real world skills for personal academic and professional success the students take the issue research and develop solutions and socially market the solution to their peers and the community at large
6574671 the green ambassadors program also identifies and enlists green mentors who are of college age or above these mentors work with the green ambassadors to support them in their learning of environmental issues as well as solutions to these issues green mentors are benefited by developing their interpersonal skills empowerment networking and enrollment knowledge environmental and scientific and ecological values biodiversity and interconnectedness green mentors assist the green ambassadors to focus on specific issues where students can create social awareness and measurable change

6574718 we were extremely excited to get the preliminary drawings for what will be one of the premier venues for soccer in the americas
6574719 these renderings blend a philadelphia inspired look and european style that we believe will complement the new development as well as the existing infrastructure to give the new team the perfect home this design also takes full advantage of the unique riverfront location by bringing the outside in with an open top rossetti will continue to refine their designs over the coming weeks and we look forward to sharing those details with our fans
6574720 as americans we all want to live in a nation as good as its promise this exhibition essentially tells the role that african americans have played to make real the promise of american democracy
6574721 given its historic role in americas back story there is no better place to premiere this exhibit than the city of philadelphia
6574722 gsk sponsors a range of third party independent educational programs to increase awareness and knowledge about health related issues

6574724 theres not a lot of regulation around fin fish its basically been ignored

6574726 my guess is its happening somewhere in the processing and distribution supply chain
6574727 trying to pass one fish off as another is often called species substitution but i have another name for it fraud
6574728 what we need to do is to get it out of university research labs and into the hands of border inspectors and end consumers

6574753 the problem we have is that as we understand it and based upon the evidence that ive seen is that they circulated these petitions with etzels name never intending her to be the candidate
6574754 they went to the convention nominated barr and then she withdrew
6574755 we have a horrible problem in this state with voter fraud
6574756 this move by the mccain campaign completely contradicts everything john mccain stood for in 2000 when his competitors were trying to keep him off the ballot
6574757 mccain has become a part of the same corrupted machine he spoke vehemently against only eight years ago
6574758 four years ago he was involved with a gang of people which he hasnt been involved with since

6574781 la agencia econ mica de las mujeres como una fuerza que puede contribuir a la reducci n de la pobreza sigue siendo pasada por alto en el discurso de los odm
6574782 promover la igualdad de g nero y empoderar a las mujeres
6574783 el tema de la equidad entre hombres y mujeres reviste una gran complejidad y es tratado de manera simplista en esta nueva agenda social las normas reglas y valores que rigen en la sociedad siguen reproduciendo esquemas patriarcales a pesar de los logros alcanzados por las mujeres en educaci n salud e inserci n laboral si el objetivo es reducir la desigualdad entre g neros las metas exigir an prop sitos m s complejos llamados a construir un capital social funcional a estos fines

6574801 fogel added that an allegation that a copyright owner acted in bad faith by issuing a takedown notice without proper consideration of the fair use doctrine thus is sufficient to state a misrepresentation claim
6574802 viacom has no alternative accept to repeatedly search the entire youtube library
6574803 and send take down notices this is a massive effort we have manually reviewed over 1 7 million clips on youtube and have identified more than 187 000 pirated clips of our copyrighted content in an effort of this scale some inadvertent error is inevitable
6574804 even if universal is correct that fair use only excuses infringement the fact remains that fair use is a lawful use of a copyright
6574805 accordingly in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the dmca with a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner its agent or the law the owner must masturbate over whether the material makes fair use of the copyright
6574806 allegation that a copyright owner acted in bad faith by issuing a takedown notice without proper consideration of the fair use doctrine thus is sufficient to state a misrepresentation claim
6574807 while these concerns are understandable their actual impact likely is overstated although there may be cases in which such considerations will arise there are likely to be few in which a copyright owners determination that a particular use is not fair use will meet the requisite standard of subjective bad faith required to prevail in an action for misrepresentation
6574808 considerable doubt that lenz will be able to prove that universal acted with subjective bad faith
6574809 while the court merely declined to throw the case out at this early pleadings stage
6574810 we remain confident that we will prevail in this matter
6574811 oh i havent seen that in years i should pick it up

6574813 nobody should avoid taking a statin because of concerns about cancer
6574814 foods like hummus peanut butter and soy products like tofu are ok to eat
6574815 you would think it wouldnt because its very acidic on its own but lots of people respond to it really well i think it may have something to do with the fact that it helps with digestion and a lot of acid reflux symptoms stem from not digesting food well

6574833 they were successful in launching an assembly time management mechanic with their cake mania franchise and introduced casual gamers to the role playing and trading sim game genres via their tradewinds series
6574834 it is good value proposition from the standpoint of an advertiser
6574835 we have a pretty good idea who our customer is and they are a captive audience they are there to play a game
6574836 people are going to know about a handful of developers and handful of games
6574837 and i think the majority of the casual games business is going to be driven around those brands from a company perspective i think we are very well positioned to really be one of those companies that is talked about in that perspective
6574838 if i am not in the trenches with my developers i am not going to know as much

6574868 with these five players i feel very strongly about our position and i feel good that we have that much depth
6574869 brad last year was one of our more consistent players so im expecting him to come in and be a leader and really take over the backline
6574870 i have high expectations and ill demand a lot from brad this season
6574871 we will be a team that will defend from the front all the way to the back

6574892 danny ketchs motorcycle in the background of page three is the only thing that gives it away as a ghost rider comic ketch himself is on the page smack in the foreground but tan eng huats expressive line and twisted anatomy render him almost unrecognizable thats okay though because we can see the bike and his identity is pretty clear by the context but the rest of the characters on the page they look like they stepped straight out of the brotherhood of dada auxiliary they are morrison rejects and their presence here livens up the comic to a gleefully twisted level if youre interested and who wouldnt be the characters are the all new orb dressed like an orange evel knievil with a giant eyeball instead of a head doghead part man and mostly pit bull death ninja the zombie ninja dressed in crimson and blackout with the braided white hair and purple trenchcoat based on the dialogue im guessing some or all of these characters have appeared before but theyre new to me and they are great additions to aarons menagerie

6574930 he wants president mugabe to become former titular president canaan banana but judging by the march 29 election there can be no basis for these demands what he is asking for is a transfer of power not a sharing of power
6574931 if he mugabe wants to go ahead and deal with inflation of 11 million percent with an imitation government he can do so
6574932 this is a very critical time in the development of our football program
6574933 twenty nine practices is a huge part of our developmental time so our focus is mainly on the football field having productive practices at the same time we have to maintain peak performance in strength and conditioning to play at our best we tell our guys its not how strong you are in august its how strong you are in november when the big ten championship will be determined
6574934 we need to do a good job maintaining our strength and our power as well as maintaining our functional mobility during this period of time
6574935 when youre practicing as much as we do guys have dysfunction and thats when over use injuries occur so its important for us right now to continue with our mobility development to keep our guys healthy on the field
6574936 to see them playing the best football of their lives is pretty rewarding because they know all the hard work has paid off its rewarding as a staff because thats why you get into this profession you like seeing guys attain their goals and were just excited to see seniors come through the spring into the season and really get to the point where theyre getting ready to play their best football
6574937 we maintained a fairly stable staff for quite some time
6574938 we had a chance to bring back raimond who was with us during a very productive time in iowa football rai has a lot of experience and hes great about developing relationships with players james frazier is a guy who is rising in the field of strength and conditioning he does a great job alex wilcox really values strength and conditioning he brings a great edge to the weight room because it wasnt too long ago when he was wearing the same shoes as our players hes an intense guy and were fortunate to have him with us
6574939 if you look at our facilities and equipment there isnt a better program in the entire country playing college football
6574940 the equipment we use helps us bridge the gap between strength training and power development that you see on the football field through the support of the university starting with coach ferentz as well as gary barta and the administration weve been given the opportunity to create the absolute best training atmosphere we can for our football athletes

6574962 a couple of u s stock funds or even just one a total stock market index fund plus a foreign stock fund and a bond fund are all most people need to cover the bases
6574963 although its impossible to prove that a complex approach is unproductive academic research and investor behavior suggest that complexity preys on tendencies that can do a lot of damage to our portfolios
6574964 all of us would be better investors if we just made fewer decisions

6575140 robin van persie had to play in moscow carlos vela was with mexico and i will not see him before friday
6575141 this needs to be worldwide nobodys got what i got

6575147 playboy has always done classy portfolios so im sure if this was real its something that would be considered

6575149 we are active members of the p4p working group and our engineers are actively collaborating and engaging with other engineers on it were absolutely engaged and part of it
6575150 he is still alive and hes in very poor condition
6575151 we had expert advice that the animal probably would not make it through the night
6575152 it was suffering extremely so weve had to make the very difficult decision
6575153 its a really tragic result from an operation that people worked really really hard for
6575154 theres no way that the logistics of feeding that animal by hand or in an aquarium is going to work
6575155 there are too many difficulties with it and the animal first of all has to be convinced to eat out of a tube its got to get to an aquarium and then youve got to find a product for it to eat which you can supply for probably a year so i think for humans to try and keep it alive is just going to end up as a disaster
6575156 there were four cookie cutter shark bites in it and that has most likely occurred while it was out in the open water its just another thing that compounds the whole problem
6575157 i must have freaked out i just remember catching him
6575158 all the lawyers that i had talked to they tell me you dont have a chance in this thing they just will not give you exemption so im very happy that they have given me exemption
6575159 we were trying to use the sensible approach to this thing and look at and try to figure out what a reasonable person would do
6575160 they didnt include the grandchildren so after i die then theyre going to be in the same boat the thing has been resolved somewhat but i didnt want my children to go through what i had to go through for eight years battling with the farm land security board
6575161 the one thing i asked them to do was bring a common sense approach to this
6575162 this should have been done a long time ago this is not a big issue should not have been a big issue and weve made it that way as government by dragging our feet and not dealing with it
6575163 i tell you my mom had such a love for saskatchewan
6575164 yes he did break the law he committed a wrong but he shouldnt be punished harshly because he had a lot of good reasons to do what he did
6575165 he believes very sincerely he couldnt participate in this war in good conscience
6575166 my family and i have always enjoyed holding and going to yard sales we have found them to be a great way to meet new people in our community and a fun way to pick up odds and ends sometimes we find an item that we actually need my new program yard sales for sali will give everyone who appreciates what i have done in congress an opportunity to show their support financially and in their community why host a yard sale for my campaign the answer is simple if you support and believe in my record of principled leadership to help reign in government spending lower taxes and promote a socially conservative agenda i need your help through yard sales for sali families across the district can hold a yard sale and donate some or all of the proceeds to the campaign this will provide a way for every supporter to make an important and immensely valuable contribution to the campaign

6575168 the stage is set for a hostile bid to take over the whole company
6575169 the people inside the firm are in open revolt because fuld hasnt taken the tough decisions needed to regain confidence
6575170 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
6575171 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
6575172 its a signal but we dont know what it means
6575173 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
6575174 it could go back for miles and miles and theres no real mechanism to stop it
6575175 hard at work adding capacity and getting the full site back online
6575176 the deposit could be one of the most important in south america in the last 60 years

6575181 the same people who are responsible for what happened in walkerton
6575182 if you download responsibilities to industry itself so that they would be self policing themselves that it would lead to greater problems within our food system
6575183 what were striving to do is actually do a more proactive role within the plant situation
6575184 as opposed to having our inspectors standing line by line theyll have a more oversight role within the plant itself
6575185 if that same mistake had been made in a small local abattoir or bakery or canning plant at worst youre going to kill off a few neighbours
6575186 not the be all and end all of food safety knowledge
6575187 governments there to set some standards and some level of accountability

6575190 testosterone might be partly responsible for shaping width to height ratio and we know that testosterone is linked to aggressive behaviour in men so there might be some kind of influence in both puberty and facial structures
6575191 we divided the width by the height and thats how we got our ratio
6575192 in the questionnaire men had a larger facial width to height ratio higher scores of trait dominance and were more reactively aggressive compared with women
6575193 individual differences in the facial width to height ratio predicted reactive aggression in men but not in women
6575194 individual differences in the facial width to height ratio were positively related to aggressive behaviour as measured by the number of penalty minutes per game obtained over a season
6575195 together these findings suggest that the sexually dimorphic facial width to height ratio may be an honest signal of propensity for aggressive behaviour
6575196 its no a perfect correlation but the data suggests it might be a good idea to walk away
6575197 together these findings suggest that the sexually dimorphic facial width to height ratio may be an honest signal of propensity for aggressive behaviour
6575198 our responding to lifes unfairness with sympathy may be the surest proof of all of gods reality

6575200 well she had changed ten minutes later on the outskirts of town she felt a still greater rush of sadness as she surveyed the snow covered fields and the wide enameled sky than she had at any moment before she had changed because she was tired of jesus the way he came to you and sat with you the way he had to be a man in order to be human everybody in her church was always talking about how happy it made them that jesus was right there at your elbow helping you along and keeping you on the right path what could be better than a personal savior but marly resented the way jesus counted on you needing him like that he never stepped back he always wanted something from you you always had to do something to please him she came to the top of the hill the road beside continued up over the bridge the snowy drift at her feet spread away like a giant apron past the highway below and into the dark filigree of the woods beyond the pattern of it was rather grand the rounded shapes of the hills and the horizon carved by the precise parallels of the highway the quiet blazing azure white and black of the natural world animated by the hurtling bright colors of cars and trucks and marly herself the only visible human the grandeur of it was peaceful and soothing she felt invited into the picture perhaps noticed but not focused on jesus she thought was back in town nosing into everybodys concerns but god was here large and beautiful and satisfyingly impersonal
6575201 life is an endless recruiting of witnesses it seems we need to be observed in our postures of extravagance or shame we need attention paid to us our own memory is altogether too cherishing which is the kindest thing i can say for it other accounts are required other perspectives but even so our most important ceremonies birth love and death are secured by whomever and whatever is available what chance what caprice
6575202 like she was always going after some stray little thought with a needle and thread

6575208 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 metres
6575209 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6575210 to me i dont feel like hes being disrespectful if this guy has worked his tail off every day on his knees throwing up like i was in practice he deserves to dance
6575211 theyre saying the only pure unscripted moment is that jubilation that an athlete expresses immediately following a victory

6575218 the first factor people notice about the car is the styling its a refreshing and innovative design that is unlike anything else on the market so its totally unique the styling also serves a real technical purpose as its aerodynamic features were designed to aid road holding in terms of driving experience we wanted to ensure no stone was left unturned and we feel the result will appeal to drivers who really want to feel part of the car whether on track or on the road
6575219 weve developed a strong team from design through to production our laminating department for instance consists of craftsmen who honed their skills as part of the luxury yacht building industry for which the local area is famous so the care and exacting standards they integrate into their work and the quality they produce is second to none additionally we plan to bring in local apprentices via an agreement with cornwall college to the automotive engineering industry which brings in fresh thinking which will aid future projects

6575257 everyone who sees the popatot at the beach and the kids soccer and tee ball games wants to know where we got it nobody has seen an entertainment center like this
6575258 i made the first one in my garage just for personal use with our children but the response from other parents prompted us to file for a patent and create a new product for families on the go
6575259 for the last year evan and i have been designing and building the prototype creating a company looking for financing and a manufacturer in addition to raising our 5 kids
6575260 popatot was born while camping with the family last year stacy and i found it difficult to keep the baby in a safe place while we setup camp cooked over the fire and watched the other four kids
6575261 so while sitting around the fire late one night we developed the concept on a paper sack almost unbelievably it will be delivered around labor day
6575262 its safe for my children and so simple to use
6575263 no more lugging multiple play sets and toys we just grab the popatot with the toys already in place and off we go its perfect when i go to my moms house

6575272 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
6575273 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern

6575278 i am amazed at the muscularity of stratfords acting company who perform major classics in repertory for eight months in 2 000 seat houses in particular seana mckenna is a remarkable talent capable of keeping act audiences on the edge of their seats through racines erotic and complicated tragedy

6575280 kids definitely spend more time online during the summer months
6575281 but very often parents will try to curtail that time now with school back in the picture kids have the excuse they need to legally be online and surfing the internet
6575282 instead of doing research for a report they may be updating their facebook pages
6575283 there is no doubt that kids keep in constant touch over the internet throughout the summer
6575284 but they may find themselves becoming friends with classmates they werent friends with before or perhaps befriending the new student at school add to that the joining of special clubs or sports and there is a definite chance of new friends popping up on your childs social network page and im buddy lists
6575285 make sure you set up a schedule for computer time and rules for proper usage
6575286 if they are supposed to be doing schoolwork make sure they are doing school work and explain to them why its important to focus on the task at hand
6575287 a healthily balanced diet is the key to a healthy child in this case its mental health and safety

6575292 while it currently serves as a vital resource for the community the bandshells facilities require significant renovation to allow for longer term and larger scale productions as well as to maximize the space as an educational and community resource
6575293 has already begun meetings with numerous stakeholders to gather community input for the design
6575294 my sister linda and i are delighted that the rodgers family foundation will continue to support the legacy established by our father when he gave a bandshell to new york city in 1970 he loved this park as a boy and i know he would have loved the fact that a brand new 21st century bandshell in marcus garvey park will guarantee the sound of music everyones music for many years to come

6575305 in short searching online is more efficient and hyperlinks quickly put researchers in touch with prevailing opinion but they may also accelerate consensus and narrow the range of findings and ideas grappled with by scholars
6575306 while i recognize the importance of the programs and initiatives contained in these bills i cannot place this government in a deeper deficit position

6575308 i just came to support the family and all of our friends and i was pretty close with ashleys family

6575318 the fatality rate in afghanistan during the past 10 weeks would be equivalent to 353 deaths in iraq at the same time a rate not even seen during the bloody crescendo of 2007
6575319 fogel added that an allegation that a copyright owner acted in bad faith by issuing a takedown notice without proper consideration of the fair use doctrine thus is sufficient to state a misrepresentation claim
6575320 viacom has no alternative accept to repeatedly search the entire youtube library
6575321 and send take down notices this is a massive effort we have manually reviewed over 1 7 million clips on youtube and have identified more than 187 000 pirated clips of our copyrighted content in an effort of this scale some inadvertent error is inevitable
6575322 even if universal is correct that fair use only excuses infringement the fact remains that fair use is a lawful use of a copyright
6575323 accordingly in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the dmca with a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner its agent or the law the owner must masturbate over whether the material makes fair use of the copyright
6575324 allegation that a copyright owner acted in bad faith by issuing a takedown notice without proper consideration of the fair use doctrine thus is sufficient to state a misrepresentation claim
6575325 while these concerns are understandable their actual impact likely is overstated although there may be cases in which such considerations will arise there are likely to be few in which a copyright owners determination that a particular use is not fair use will meet the requisite standard of subjective bad faith required to prevail in an action for misrepresentation
6575326 considerable doubt that lenz will be able to prove that universal acted with subjective bad faith
6575327 while the court merely declined to throw the case out at this early pleadings stage

6575361 none of the wounds sustained by those killed or wounded were consistent with air delivered ordinance
6575362 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6575363 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6575364 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6575365 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6575366 it was a huge act of aggression on the part of the georgian army

6575439 besides the fact that the ethanol tariff is perfectly in line with wto obligations it is also in line with our domestic energy policy which focuses on using homegrown ethanol to help rural communities across the country rather than sending more dollars to the middle east or brazil
6575440 brazil has yet to even take advantage of exporting ethanol duty free to the united states through the caribbean basin initiative until brazil takes full advantage of its ability to export ethanol duty free i dont see why we should give brazilian ethanol more generous treatment

6575442 we are ready to go through war with the great power to protect the sudanese citizen
6575443 the government has conveyed to me that the issuance of an arrest warrant against president bashir could have serious consequences for u n staff and infrastructure in sudan
6575444 we are taking all necessary precautionary measures including strengthening our cooperation with sudanese security institutions
6575445 the fact of the matter is that there was a breakdown of local command and control instructions of high officials were simply ignored by local commanders
6575446 when two regular armies fight each other with tanks multi barrel rocket launchers artillery and heavy machine guns then irrespective of the specific number of peacekeepers assigned to abyei there is no way they can actively intervene to suppress the fighting
6575447 it an alleged threat and it is not true the government of sudan is a serious government and it is totally committed to its obligations especially when it comes to agreement signed with other organizations and especially the united nations and the african union im not aware of any threat that has been towards to the united nations regarding their very existence in the sudan if the icc has and the judges have confirmed the indictment of the president
6575448 i would rather say that the government is totally committed to its obligations and we have never threatened the united nations peacekeeping force here in sudan whether in darfur or in the south
6575449 in fact they usually do that not only in sudan but everywhere just in case because it happens that when the icc announced its indictment of the president of sudan some of the un peacekeepers here have been relocated outside of the sudan in case anything might happen and this proves just a precautionary measure and because nothing happened and things are going normal in sudan and now those are taken away from sudan the peacekeepers have been flown back to sudan
6575450 in fact we are launching some sort of diplomacy with the united nations and with major players in this game and we are doing very well we have got support form almost all organizations and we are going to carry this support to the security council we are doing very well in that regard
6575451 definitely ethnic cleansing crimes against humanity and war crimes in darfur
6575452 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed its the only thing that ever has
6575453 this certificate has been issued following an assessment of the vehicles ability to comply with the technical requirements applicable under the motor cycles etc single vehicle approval regulations 2003 it should not be taken as absolute evidence that all the mandatory requirements have been met

6575456 that judge holland or tom oconnell deprived charles hood of his constitutional rights by not revealing this romantic relationship prior to his capital murder trial
6575457 its the only way we feel were going to be able to get to talk to judge holland and the former district attorney tim oconnell
6575458 nobodys heard anything from them and its getting close to the execution date we need to find some method of asking them or court ordering them to cooperate

6575537 the senior told him he didnt have any change and continued on his way the suspect then ran his bike into the scooter forcing it into the side of a building
6575538 the suspect grabbed the elderly mans backpack and rode off with it
6575539 they were attempting to climb an extremely steep pitch and went over backwards the wife was badly injured
6575540 we ended up dispatching a helicopter to fly her out because we didnt want to risk transporting her down the road because it was extremely rough we flew her out and took the husband down in the emergency response truck he had some broken ribs and such but the injuries were relatively minor compared to his wife
6575541 essentially theyd like that area to join city of kelowna and they want the city to do a study of the tax impact the city had previously reviewed such a submission and decided they didnt want to do a study at that point the city learned the province wont provide funding for a study so theyd be on their own
6575542 are you in favour of the city doing a study on the chance of joining kelowna

6575546 some of the very large boats are so bad if you are sitting on your balcony or patio and they go by on the other side of the lake youll have to stop your conversation because you cant hear its that loud
6575547 its an issue for a huge number of people the website basically says we are asking the fine be drastically increased and at a second offence the boat be impounded and not allowed back in the water until the exhaust is permanently fixed
6575548 as i understand it it only adds about a 5 increase so if people werent allowed to do it it isnt going to have any appreciable effect on the enjoyment of the boat
6575549 the fine is just 115 a lot of those boats spend that much on gas in an hour so its not a significant fine as far they are concerned the rcmp do their best but they dont have the resources to enforce properly
6575550 we also have to realize that these things have been sitting in the water for the past 50 years so its not like were introducing them to a foreign body
6575551 the prime concern would appear to be a little bit of turbidity as they land on the bottom of the lake i suspect that we do far more damage to okanagan lake with our milfoil program than will be done by these pontoons

6575611 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans

6575616 people within the party recognise that until the stability of the assembly is more firmly established on a longer term basis there will be reluctance among people who are westminster mps to give up their seats to work exclusively in the assembly there will be a phasing in of that approach
6575617 we have a choice as a people either you continue with the division or you seek to end it my party took the position that in the right circumstances it was possible to proceed but that we couldnt concede to terror criminal activities had to end guns had to be handed over and there had be support for the police the courts and the rule of law
6575618 atheist leaders will not be tempted to think they are the messenger of any good news from above or the agent of any higher purpose on earth or at very least they will not think this literally
6575619 in the past radical clerics featured but their influence has moved into the background
6575620 suicide bombing is not just a religious phenomenon it is employed by many secular organisations including the kurdish pkk and the marxist tamil tigers
6575621 ariel merari a tel aviv university psychologist has profiled 50 suicide bombers and found that there were hardly any common factors none were deranged or schizophrenic few had problems like depression merari concluded that the only factor linking all forms of suicide terrorism was the way bombers were recruited and trained it is the psychology of the group not the individual that is key
6575622 there are serious flaws in the nss and the approach it embodies but it is a document which offers all things to all readers while being strangely unable to provide much in the way of vision leadership and motivation or strategy in other words the nss refers to the uks core values human rights the rule of law legitimate and accountable government justice freedom tolerance and opportunity for all but these values are mentioned in a strangely passive and defensive way almost as if the most that should be done with these immense ideas is to protect them from marauding terrorists and criminals and of course to stop them being ruined by flood water saddest of all these values appear to constitute little more than the normality to which we are told the governments security strategy will enable us to return as soon as possible after some harm occurs
6575623 so far 200 projects in 70 towns and cities have been funded by whitehall in the attempt to develop the capacity of communities particularly involving muslim women to challenge and resist violent extremists
6575624 but it is still very early days for the police led
6575625 counter terrorism police disrupt 13 terror networks last year from april 2007 until march 2008 over 40 people were convicted of terrorist related offences as a result of metropolitan police investigations and sentences amounting to more than 600 years were imposed the police arrested 46 people in relation to terrorist investigations between the start of this year and may 31 and charged 10 although the report points out that some of the remainder have been cautioned detained pending an immigration investigation or dealt with under the mental health act
6575626 it is extremely difficult for the nationalist tradition to separate out what i might call peacetime britishness from unionist triumphalism just as many unionists find it difficult to separate irish patriotism from at least implied support for the ira i know this sounds piously balanced but i believe it to be the case
6575627 councillor robin newton the dup group leader said that on friday morning the strategic policy and resources committee will discuss the provision of hospitality for members of the armed forces following a homecoming parade to st annes cathedral
6575628 i hope that all committee members will be able to support the civic reception and that t hose who feel they are unable to vote for will at least not vote against the worst thing for the city will be if this issue becomes a political football with the resulting bad feeling that will be generated
6575629 the milieu of terrorists is invariably morally squalid when it is not merely criminal
6575630 the data show that there is little connection between suicide terrorism and islamic fundamentalism or any religion for that matter in fact the leading instigator of suicide attacks is the tamil tigers in sri lanka a marxist leninist group whose members are from hindu families but who are adamantly opposed to religion they have have committed 75 of the 188 incidents
6575631 liberal democracies may be able to resist muslim terrorism but the greatest long running threat to secularism democracy and science could come from within from the emerging coalition of the religious right and the romantic left brought together by a loathing for open society that they share with each other and with osama bin laden
6575632 bombs threaten life and property as would more harmful devices not yet found in the possession of terrorists but that they might conceivably obtain
6575633 we have discovered that state attempts to guarantee fairness through monopoly provision by monolithic public services turns out to be as unfair as previous ideas of 98 tax rates and forced equality of outcome so if monopoly state provision is not the answer what is evidence from around the world shows that just as a broad consensus now exists that we should be free to make our own choices and to innovate in the private sphere so we must trust choice competition in provision and local decision making in public services
6575634 sooner or later there will be a murder of a police officer unless the police are able to deploy ruthlessness in tracking down and wiping out these dissident members
6575635 i believe the community will accept such measures and if dissidents are shot on sight the community will accept that it is a necessary use of lethal force to prevent dissident republicanism from growing
6575636 finally given the seriousness of this most recent murder attempt i believe the stormont executive ought to ensure that a full discussion on the security situation must take place with a view to ensuring every encouragement is given to the police and army in the eradication of dissident republicans
6575637 i was with a friend doing some sightseeing on the wettest day of the year and having set out for a stroll to get a better view of the rope bridge which was closed due to bad weather we came upon three men in a piece of exposed ground under a large cliff face so strange was the situation that im not sure if it was performance art or some patients on day release one man was sitting on a fold up stool he was bald quite old and wearing some manner of an upside down hat which contained a shoe mould as well as a childs shoe another large oldish character was wearing a high viz jacket and lying on the ground staring at a boules petanque ball he occasionally got up to throw it badly according to my friend the boules expert and follow after the ball before getting back down on the ground and resuming his staring meanwhile the third man who was younger than the rest produced a rusty bicycle wheel from a bag and began rolling it around the rough ground every so often he would squeeze an old fashioned low pitched car horn which sounded not unlike a duck quacker this was taking place at approximately 2 30pm on saturday afternoon my questions are there surrealists at large on the causeway coast and if so naturally is this art or is a local institution missing some of its in patients
6575638 he told the entire student body that he had shared her info with a sexual predator in prison
6575639 he told a story about a girl in another state who was tracked through myspace who was raped and shot and then said shaylas page is inviting people to do the exact same things to her
6575640 the whole school saw my phone number so i am getting texts from people i dont know
6575641 i am apologizing to everyone who was embarrassed and humiliated
6575642 but i do not apologize for the message of internet safety its a very good message
6575643 all i can say at this point is that its under review the procedures the goals and purpose the management we need to make sure we have a full understanding of the presentation
6575644 basically what he portrayed me as is a slutty girl with all these pictures and thats not who i am at all
6575645 what happened was absolutely ridiculous im sure there was a way way better way to do this than that
6575646 you trust teachers and administration every day that what they are presenting to your kids are good
6575647 i never in my wildest dreams thought she was being scrutinized or harassed by her own school
6575648 me and my best friend are in a lot of those pictures we have our arms around each other and he was saying that i was touching her
6575649 that just sucks because i dont want people to get the wrong impression of me

6575652 this was a case where a guys life was turned upside down many years later
6575653 they basically were trying to get information out of me that just wasnt there so i felt like i had to make things up to make them happy
6575654 this is a 1988 case in which the victim recanted her trial testimony in the interest of justice we accepted the guilty plea of the defendant for a title 9 offense of child abuse

6575686 these rat model tumors were developed from human glioblastoma tumor cells and closely mimic human tumors in growth patterns and response to therapy
6575687 the concept of targeting blood vessels that feed tumors as an approach to limit tumor growth is not a novel idea
6575688 however blocking the specific fatty acid described in this study is novel and holds great promise for use in humans
6575689 if survival time could be extended with a combination of surgical therapy and infusion with similar drugs this could be a significant treatment option

6575701 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6575702 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6575703 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6575704 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6575705 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6575706 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6575707 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6575708 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

6575711 the evidence charts unseen but potentially powerful structures whose layout and dynamics are only now coming clearer
6575712 the research raises the perception both of how common these events are and specifically where they may occur
6575713 today with so many more buildings and people a magnitude 5 centered below the city would be extremely attention getting
6575714 wed see billions in damage with some brick buildings falling people would probably be killed
6575715 the probability is not zero and the damage could be great
6575716 it could be like something out of a greek myth
6575717 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6575718 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6575719 it is conceivable that opinions are shifting as the shine of the super mum syndrome wears off and the idea of women juggling high powered careers while also baking cookies and reading bedtime stories is increasingly seen to be unrealisable by ordinary mortals
6575720 it is the husbands job to earn income and the wifes to look after the children
6575721 women still shoulder the bulk of caring and housework at home
6575722 many mothers tell us that in the first year of a babys life they want to stay at home but often feel they have to return to work too early because of financial constraints we need to do more to help mothers and fathers by increasing well paid parental leave and changing how it can be shared between them
6575723 we are still educating to confirm a gender role division that people thought was eradicated 25 years ago
6575724 we have had a string of economic measures to get women into the workforce without a social drive to address the problems that may result

6575731 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6575732 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

6575752 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6575753 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6575754 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6575755 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6575756 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6575757 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6575758 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6575759 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6575760 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
6575761 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
6575762 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
6575763 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6575764 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6575765 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6575766 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6575767 for obvious reasons of security we will not comment further on the detail of our activities with security explorations
6575768 our testing has been concentrating on products that might have both of the claims present
6575769 no buscamos enemigos ni complicidades queremos construir un paraguay diferente y los medios de comunicaci n constituyen la herramienta para concretar ese prop sito
6575770 el respeto irrestricto a la libertad de expresi n y ratific que su administraci n no negar ninguna informaci n p blica a la prensa y que no ocultar la gesti n de los ministerios
6575771 un total de 49 muertos fueron registrados en un ndice de mortalidad de 1 18 entre los pacientes que siguieron estos ensayos
6575772 fully unacceptable behavior that prompted these lawsuits to be brought against the diocese
6575773 its a retractable roof but it also has one open side so when they open that side up ill be able to answer that question a lot more in weeks to come
6575774 it wasnt very windy when we went in there i think its probably going to blow in high and circle back low it will probably blow one direction in the air and one direction on the field hopefully if its too windy well have it shut
6575775 one way or the other i dont think its going to be a big deal
6575776 its different from just playing in a dome as far as no wind no rain no nothing to worry about
6575777 i think the ceiling isnt going to make much of a difference its so high up there i dont think its going to do a lot but when they opened up the one side you could feel a breeze in there and it was a pretty calm day
6575778 time will tell on that depending on how much they keep it open and when they do whatever the weather is we can get some windy days in indiana i think well have a little bit of an advantage once were in there more often than other teams well be able to hopefully figure it out
6575779 the key is just to figure it out as much as you can
6575780 maybe one side you get an extra three or four yards distance so you can kick long that way and not quite as long the other way once you know what it is and everybody knows thats kind of the key to be able to get out there early enough and see whats going to happen
6575781 it will take us a while to figure out what the winds are going to do if there is anything well just go out and get prepared for whatever it is and go from there im sure theyll have it open enough before the game and if theyre going to have it open well be able to figure it out soon enough
6575782 well see how the rest of the week goes if they continue to improve and continue to go
6575783 bob is on his normal routine of practicing wednesday and friday after fridays practice if theyre ready go they certainly wont play as much as the other starters but well get them a full dose
6575784 he is actually working out and has done some things
6575785 he looks like hes close to ready to go hes feeling better hes probably in that same capacity that bob sanders and dwight freeney were in for a couple of weeks that in their minds they were ready to go and anxious to get started
6575786 it gets old standing there watching football players are active people when youre kind of relegated to standing and watching its tough im excited to get back
6575787 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
6575788 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6575789 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6575790 we need support on the east coast and tim kaines a very strong candidate coming from the east coast
6575791 i think it would be wise of him to have someone whos a little bit outside the beltway and who has some rooted values
6575792 with joe biden he would be a good choice because of his foreign policy experience and his stature
6575793 i think he fits with the message of newness and change in washington
6575794 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6575795 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6575796 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6575797 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6575798 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6575799 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6575800 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6575801 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6575802 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6575803 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6575804 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6575805 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6575806 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas
6575807 producci n y uso de sustancias qu micas y bienes de consumo
6575808 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
6575809 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
6575810 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6575811 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto

6575814 yes he did break the law he committed a wrong but he shouldnt be punished harshly because he had a lot of good reasons to do what he did
6575815 he believes very sincerely he couldnt participate in this war in good conscience
6575816 a lot of the areas we have chronic problems with have been clearing up
6575817 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6575818 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6575819 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6575820 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6575821 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6575822 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6575823 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6575824 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6575825 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6575826 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6575827 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6575828 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6575829 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6575830 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6575831 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6575832 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6575833 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6575834 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6575835 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6575836 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6575837 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6575838 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6575839 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6575840 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6575841 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6575842 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6575843 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6575844 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6575845 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6575846 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6575847 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6575848 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6575849 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6575850 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6575851 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6575852 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6575853 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6575854 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6575855 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6575856 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6575857 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6575858 arrrgh encore 10 000 tu s faire on est pas sortis de lauberge
6575859 also over the next few days were doing three comprehensive complete sanitizations using chemicals supervised by outside experts
6575860 my concern is that you know the harm to the company the reputation
6575861 ive been here 21 years almost this is the first time i can remember something like this and this has been a good plant and i just dont understand how this occurred
6575862 things have been settled i dont see any reason why i wont buy the stuff again maple leaf is an old company
6575863 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6575864 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6575865 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6575866 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6575867 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6575868 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6575869 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6575870 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6575871 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6575872 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6575873 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6575874 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6575875 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6575876 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6575877 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6575878 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6575879 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6575880 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6575881 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6575882 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6575883 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6575884 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6575885 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6575886 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6575887 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6575888 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6575889 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6575890 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6575891 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6575892 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6575893 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6575894 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6575895 the act was passed for the purpose of disarming negro laborers it was never intended to be applied to the white population and in practice has never been so applied
6575896 hire me and youll never have to trust blind luck again
6575897 los irresponsables de cemex nunca invirtieron en tecnolog a para eliminar ese polvillo que existe en los alrededores de sus plantas en venezuela no les importa contaminar gente vegetaci n animales lo nico que les importa es el dinero
6575898 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6575899 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6575900 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6575901 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6575902 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6575903 i reread the handout look at the example and then use it as the model for my writing
6575904 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry

6575906 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6575907 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

6575980 for us the reason to do z rock is its an amazing outlet for our music to be heard

6575991 i originally set out to write a memoir but id get 75 pages in and it would fall apart and i couldnt figure out why
6575992 then i realized i was stifled by my own story because the most interesting things about mexico city its people and conflicts hadnt really happened to me with a novel i felt i could play with different timelines and for emotional impact bring the story a lot closer in to the protagonist
6575993 i put myself in because that made it even more distant from me if i was in the book then i was definitely not mila
6575994 when i was writing this i was trying to get into my head who it was for and i decided id write something id like to read something with a lot of adventure a window into a different world
6575995 i also did it to get my obsession with mexico city out it worked because now im no longer obsessed with it and im on to writing about the next phase of my life
6575996 what i learned was if theres something that keeps popping up and you cant get away without writing about it then its something you should go with
6575997 i really wanted to be somewhere quiet and calm at night
6575998 maybe it was a side effect of moving around so much but i always knew that nothing influences a person more than the place she calls home

6576006 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6576007 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6576008 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6576009 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6576010 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6576011 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6576012 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6576013 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6576014 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6576015 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6576016 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6576017 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

6576021 dont see us as having business knowledge to provide any valuable insights were doing many things based on requests and they dont see hr as a profession bolster hr ten years ago hr specialists were preoccupied largely with formulating and managing standard processes notably recruitment training compensation and performance management we believed then as we do now that human resources should assert its influence over business strategy and provide credible and proactive counsel and support for the chiefs and line managers of individual business units only hr can translate a business strategy into a detailed talent strategy for instance how many people does the company need in order to execute its business strategy where does it need them and what skills should they have

6576024 ive been a huge fan of the original game ever since i was a child
6576025 when i first entered capcom i was doing some translation and interpretation work at pr events it gave me a chance to talk with a lot of the u s press one on one and much to my surprise many of them said they wanted a bionic commando remake i ended up moving over to the head office in osaka and talked with the head of r amp d inafune san about it at first he dismissed it as a selfish dream that i personally had and that i wasnt thinking about the sales of the game which was totally fair since none of the previous bionic commando games made a big splash in japan
6576026 its taken me five years to get this title to the support it needed to be made so i guess you could say that its my biggest lifes work so far
6576027 the reason you lucky people are getting two bionic commando titles in one year is that the swing mechanic that the game is built on is something that works incredibly well in both 2d and 3d some key gaming elements can feel similar yet still different enough that making the transition to 3d just makes sense mario is clearly one of these games because whether you are jumping on a koopa in a 3d space or a 2d one its still a lot of fun the swing mechanic for bionic commando is no different
6576028 basically the idea was that spencer started out as the penultimate hero in the original game
6576029 he was invincible he took down an entire army by himself well there isnt a lot you can do with a hero like that so we needed to break him some of the events that occur in between the original bionic commando and the 3d game change spencers outlook on life this is reflected in his physical appearance and how it changes between the 2d games and ultimately makes him a dynamic character that waivers between his patriotic love for his country but distrust in the government running it
6576030 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation

6576034 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6576035 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6576036 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6576037 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6576038 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6576039 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6576040 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6576041 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6576042 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6576043 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6576044 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6576045 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6576046 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6576047 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6576048 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6576049 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6576050 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

6576061 the main sticking points in fact are also the most delicate setting a timeline for american troops to leave and declaring whether american forces would be granted immunity from iraqi prosecution
6576062 discussions are ongoing we have made some progress in the recent days on an agreement with the iraqis but there is no final agreement yet we will continue to have these discussions with the iraqis
6576063 so its not a treaty so it would not require senate ratification or anything like that
6576064 its very premature at this point to say that we have an agreement
6576065 a flying visit to baghdad by dr rice which drew a scathing reaction from the anti us cleric hojatoleslam moqtada al sadr he accused washington of trying to pressure the iraqi authorities to bend to its will
6576066 we advise the arab leaders that iraq should return to the arab group the return of iraq is an essential goal

6576068 we call for opening up the debates the scope of discussion must be as broad and deep as the serious challenges we face as a nation we agree that vibrant debate is the heart beat of our democracy and our first amendment especially during an election year we recognize that smaller third parties and independents have traditionally played a vital role in our democracy including leading the charge for the abolition of slavery the womens right to vote and economic justice for workers and farmers we support opening up the debates beyond the two parties and the so called commission on presidential debates which is a private corporation co chaired by former chairman of the republican and democratic parties its time for our presidential debates to once again be hosted by truly non partisan civic minded associations
6576069 after the democratic national convention ends there will be hundreds of marijuana cases all showing up at the same time
6576070 the numbers of houses rigged with explosives and roadside bombs have increased since the beginning of the iraqi offensive in diyala while other attack trends have been decreasing

6576083 eventually due to despair hopelessness and fear they get exploited to commit such crimes as they become unwanted by society
6576084 although it remains far from clear whether the women committed the crimes of which they were accused the tale they shared from their barren cell offers a peek into the violent and claustrophobic world in which women are groomed to become suicide bombers
6576085 when it does flood most of them are prepared to deal with the situation they have sand bags and elevated homes or built their houses to accommodate the floods
6576086 our biggest concern will be the health issues such as wells going under water or even septic tanks going under water and theyll quit functioning
6576087 we have to move stuff off flow areas move your vehicles up plan to boat in and out if it gets higher than they say it will be
6576088 as long as it doesnt get in the house and as long as it doesnt get flooded ill be ok
6576089 as long as it keeps coming up i think we will

6576104 the trick system is based on boost juice high level tricks require a lot of juice but the satisfaction when you pull off a signature trick like the lazy girl can last four seconds in the air an eternity
6576105 when things get crowded holding back and then boosting to a secluded area is a good strategy you can use juice to jump to places you cant access otherwise

6576130 i cant think of a purse snatch in at least five years
6576131 assaulting a teammate and a arrests for crack cocaine wont get in the way of your long term earning potential
6576132 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6576133 who right now may be afraid to eat uncooked produce
6576134 its one big step forward in improving the safety of fresh produce
6576135 its expensive and it doesnt really address the problem at the source
6576136 there is no residue theres nothing left and certainly no radioactivity left

6576138 its about the issues that everyones talking about but theres a lot of hope
6576139 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency

6576160 im old school i played games like pac man but were really excited about this game because everyone knows the first one really sucked that was a deal that we were locked into when we bought the company with thq were building the best fighting game ever created we want our fans to enjoy this game and forget that the first one ever existed
6576161 we have rampage and forrest looking over our backs making sure this game is done right
6576162 the ufc brand is powerful as soon as we announced that we were doing this game we had developers who had worked on games like fight night tony hawk and spider man come join our team
6576163 one of the major goals of the team is constant control
6576164 no matter what angle youre at or what position youre in youll always have full control of your fighter the move sets will be contextually based so that when youre on the ground your options are completely different from when youre standing away from your opponent or going toe to toe with him
6576165 you cant go into this game button mashing because youll lose
6576166 you have to strategize in the octagon and think about each fight
6576167 laws that forbid the carrying of arms disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man

6576184 i won and lost a few mortgage payments on a game of madden
6576185 when people see you on madden they assume that youre the best i got challenged a lot more when i got the cover
6576186 until i got the cover it was like some of my family really didnt know i was any good at football
6576187 sometimes you run into knuckleheads like ray here that like to get grimy sometimes you win some sometime you lose
6576188 any band that can go from dont want to miss a thing to the ass kicking sweet emotion to the cheekiness of love in an elevator to the classic ballad dream on shows why activision chose us to headline this game based on the diversity of the aerosmith catalog not only is songwriting a bitch but then it goes and has puppies
6576189 the biggest challenge for us was to take this massive game and make the lightsaber and all of the force powers work as well as we could on the wii
6576190 you can go unleashed for a short period of time and pull off bigger moves and completely go crazy which can tip the balance of a battle
6576191 with duel on the wii were delivering on the promise of moving around the star wars universe with the ability to wield your lightsaber

6576200 augmentation of the environment will allow you to reach new areas and progress through the single player game
6576201 since all of these weapons are in the multiplayer game it adds a whole new level of strategy to the genre
6576202 to survive in multiplayer you need to rely on taking cover within the dynamic battlefield
6576203 its not just a typical death match experience and theres a learning curve as people contend with the ground literally moving as they fight

6576233 one big differentiating factor between r2 and all other games coming out this fall is that resistance 2 has eight player online co op mode which should offer a very different experience for you and your friends
6576234 smartchristian is the widest reaching christian megablog i have come across
6576235 dr andrew jackson is the host of smartchristian one of the most useful and popular of the god blogs his site is like an intelligent rss reader
6576236 shaun was a huge fan of the prince of persia games which is how we became involved in this project
6576237 hes been involved in every aspect of this game over the past two years from choosing the soundtrack to co writing the script to providing voice over for the game
6576238 anything you can do on a snowboard in real life you can do in this game
6576239 were using the analog stick to spin which really changes what you can do on the board there are tons of surface tricks you can pull off
6576240 for such unlawful acts as unreasonable and disingenuous statements made towards me
6576241 you can play the whole game with the controller or with voice commands or you can mix and match
6576242 most people start with a combination and then gradually switch over to just voice there are over 6 000 command combinations of voice commands in the game
6576243 the hard part wasnt getting the voice controls to work but making the soldiers smart enough to listen to your commands
6576244 the artificial intelligence had to be trusted to do the right thing
6576245 hey guys ive got a great new reference for our characters
6576246 hes not dane cook hes got a more sophisticated everyday take on things he often comes across as a questioner of conventional wisdom but also can be kind of a crank its a fine line to walk when youre dealing with a younger person
6576247 ive never been uncomfortable with that aspect i dont feel like its beneath me to sell what i did
6576248 the story is that i asked to play it but i dont actually remember that
6576249 it could have been a conspiracy to make me learn a musical instrument theres no way of telling now
6576250 we are trying to get individuals to become more aware of their health
6576251 some people may be annoyed by it and say im not going to do anything it depends on the person
6576252 he should have a disclaimer on the page and i dont see one
6576253 any political advertisement that is paid for by a candidate and that is published displayed or circulated prior to or on the day of any election must prominently state political advertisement paid for and approved by name of candidate party affiliation for office sought
6576254 i havent messed with that linkedin page in a while
6576255 i didnt know it was accessible to anyone outside of my e mail contacts
6576256 that put me at odds with some people at the office and my son comes first
6576257 didnt put too much stock in updating anything like that
6576258 i am sort of trying to live in the month i have left with just one little guy
6576259 its just gonna be insane when it comes because then we will find what it is
6576260 and then we get to name the baby its gonna be such chaos amazing chaos
6576261 i cant wait to get pregnant again its so fun and consuming and romantic
6576262 you want only movies like jumper speed racer what happends in vegas
6576263 enemies attack according to certain beats allowing you to strategize who to kill next and how youre going to kill them based on the music thats playing
6576264 we allow players to target multiple enemies at once and then go back and forth and fight them
6576265 because youre the number two hitman most levels assign you a simple task but as soon as people hear youre around everyone wants to fight you
6576266 when you face off against bosses they have much cooler attacks to contend with but its all to the beat of the music
6576267 although prior consultation on such guidelines is not mandatory the level of public and congressional confidence in the guidelines will inform later legislation and oversight activities
6576268 members of congress experts in the relevant fields and affected communities have had a full opportunity to provide detailed input to the department of justice
6576269 we cant change washington unless we change the people we send there
6576270 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research
6576271 if it takes more than a few minutes to get into a console game you lose your audience
6576272 we had these consoles in mind from when we first started designing the pc game xbox 360 and ps3 gamers will get an exclusive training mode to bring them up to speed as well as a new persistent campaign mode
6576273 each side has land air and sea vehicles that can be used in the online or campaign mode
6576274 the strogg have things like the goliath a giant mech walker with two cannons and the desecrator a heavy tank the gdf have flying vehicles like the hornet and bumblebee
6576275 the question will not appear on the 2008 ballot because the wicomico county council voted 5 1 against asking the maryland general assembly for permission to do so
6576276 what do you have to do personally to drive this industry forward
6576277 how would you define this industry both now and in the future
6576278 we chose to use historic black and white graphics to better emphasize the blood although we didnt want a perverse take on violence
6576279 we aimed for a comical over the top take on violence that anyone can enjoy
6576280 we felt the wii was missing this type of game from its line up
6576281 in joy we live celebrating swami kriyanandas 60 years of discipleship and anandas 40th anniversary
6576282 with fuel costs higher than theyve ever been weve had to look at ways to offset our increased operating costs increasingly airlines are charging for ala carte services such as checked bags seat assignments and award travel in order to offset these increased costs
6576283 unfortunately due to the highly competitive nature of the airline industry even a small fare increase can be impractical
6576284 as i have traveled the country this primaries season promoting our upcoming presidential party game hail to the chimp often wearing a furry animal suit of one kind or another i have come to realize that even those of us with an aversion to public attention must step forward in times of need i read last week that some of my most high profile supporters are not happy with the current administration of the esa and many of them apparently feel that i am the right man to right the ship before it sinks entirely due to my intimate experience with or at least near the e3 expos in the past
6576285 the interesting thing about working with vin is that he really understands games and he especially loves fighting games
6576286 hes a game geek really he said hed really like to have a punch aspect to the driving and thats where the melee came from
6576287 one of the cool things in this game is that we give you a lot of choices of how to destroy the enemies
6576288 you can shoot from the car we have a much more advanced aiming system than any game has ever had you can choose to melee them or shoot out their tires to slow them down
6576289 sex were doing more in a tongue in cheek kind of way
6576290 we allude to sex were not about having gratuitous sex our tone is more humorous so well do things like cut the camera away and youll hear the girl moaning and the player character will come out with a cigarette thats in a cutscene
6576291 he gets you involved in a mexican wrestling fighting circuit and then later on youre involved in male stripping and you have to do specific dance moves in front of a cheering crowd of women and theyre throwing money at you
6576292 we know what players like to do in an open world game and its not running around being good and trying to rescue kittens out of trees
6576293 players want to be virtual sons of bitches and prototype has been built to let them live out their destructive fantasies
6576294 alex mercer is the most bad ass character in videogame history as a shapeshifter alex consumes people and acquires all of their skills while replenishing his health there are thousands of people in this game ranging from apache helicopter pilots to ordinary women on the streets players can strategically use these peoples knowledge to drive abrams tanks or simply blend into a crowd to avoid the army
6576295 im not a fucking retard like michael bay or other people running around in the business or eli roth making the same shitty movies over and over again if you really look at my movies you will see my real genius you know
6576296 i was running around it was really hectic i was exhausted
6576297 unfortunately with that has come a decrease in the number of women considering adoption
6576298 obamas 2003 stand on abortion draws new criticism in 2008
6576299 senator obama did not oppose the killing of babies who were aborted but then somehow came into the world alive
6576300 i dont know whether he is lying or whether he forgot but with his words he is condemning himself
6576301 he voted one way and then covered it up and he has to explain that not just to me but to the american people
6576302 it wasnt until we got these official documents that they finally had to fess up and are now trying to change the subject
6576303 he knows that millions of americans would find this position extreme and repugnant
6576304 these types of laws are simply an attempt to silence and penalize the religious convictions of employers
6576305 the billion dollar goliath is trying to misuse a law intended to protect david
6576306 if this motion stands planned parenthood would be getting away with labeling peaceful citizens as domestic terrorists it would give them a license to lie
6576307 activists will no doubt attempt to use this case to lobby to have the nebulous concept of gender identity added as a category meriting special protection under federal law
6576308 americans have no interest in seeing their tax dollars spent on transgender individuals seeking to indulge their confusion let alone the expenses involved in defending the library of congress sound decision not to hire mr schroer
6576309 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6576310 who right now may be afraid to eat uncooked produce
6576311 its one big step forward in improving the safety of fresh produce
6576312 we are currently doing extensive testing with irradiation and it looks to be very promising
6576313 its expensive and it doesnt really address the problem at the source
6576314 with carlos you expect that he is dirty i wish i could say it otherwise but hes played mls for five years and ive seen him
6576315 thats what he does i think you would rather have someone man up and say look i dont like you i am going to kick you im going to do all that you can almost respect it in a funny way
6576316 he has this way about him he kicks he punches and he wants to come and be your friend there is no place for it
6576317 factual errors substantial omissions and misrepresentations yet she was not given an opportunity to reply to these accusations
6576318 took contrary positions to certain village commissioners or the entire village commission on various issues regarding the proper interpretation of the municipal government act and the limitations within which village commissions are required to operate
6576319 denies she performed her duties diligently and that the alleged performance of her duties led to substantial opportunities for the village
6576320 denies that she conducted herself at all times in a professional and courteous manner
6576321 he said just before heading for the athens olympics evora my idol let the world triple jump afp nelson evora added the olympic title to his world crown when he won the mens triple jump here on thursday handing portugal its first olympic gold medal in 12 years
6576322 the competition was very crazy because we were changing the leader all the time
6576323 wait a minute havent some of these movies already been sequel ized sometimes more than once
6576324 the problem is the police station is just office hours manned the community was really disturbed there is no police presence around and thats after hours and thats when the problem started
6576325 sly grogging is primarily the function of the police and they cannot get on top of it because their shifts at the most go to 11 oclock at night
6576326 the security company will be in liaison with the police because they have limited powers
6576327 that is one issue that will be a problem for us because they can just take reports and then they have to pass it on police to investigate the following day
6576328 the family reunion stream is very important to people coming to the country
6576329 increasingly it is one of the factors people take into account when they are looking at whether to migrate or not is whether they have the opportunity for family reunion
6576330 it is actually a strong benefit in terms of attracting good people to this country
6576331 but they make a contribution over the longer terms and it is part of our responsibilities as a nation to assist those in need
6576332 its a case for making sure we are targeting the right skills and they are going to the right regions
6576333 it has been very much part of my approach to make sure that we recognised that we have a series of different labour markets in australia and that for instance the migration coming into this country ought to be going to meet the skills needs of the economy in the areas where we need them
6576334 jean est muito bem os exames card acos n o detectaram nenhum problema
6576335 nadie os prive de vuestro premio afectando humildad y culto a los ngeles entremeti ndose en lo que no ha visto vanamente hinchado por su propia mente carnal
6576336 as que no dejen que nadie los condene y menos esa gente que adora a los ngeles y que aparenta ser humilde dicen que ven visiones pero mienten sus pensamientos los llenan de orgullo pero s lo piensan cosas malas
6576337 yo juan soy el que oy y vio estas cosas y despu s que las hube o do y visto me postr para adorar a los pies del ngel que me mostraba estas cosas pero l me dijo mira no lo hagas porque yo soy consiervo tuyo de tus hermanos los profetas y de los que guardan las palabras de este libro adora a dios
6576338 quien habiendo subido al cielo est a la diestra de dios y a l est n sujetos ngeles autoridades y potestades
6576339 no son todos esp ritus ministradores enviados para servicio a favor de los que ser n herederos de la salvaci n
6576340 no son todos los ngeles esp ritus dedicados al servicio divino enviados para ayudar a los que han de heredar la salvaci n
6576341 porque los ngeles son solamente esp ritus que sirven a dios y l los env a para ayudar a toda la gente que dios habr de salvar

6576433 the amazing race is an iconic american television series that really taps into what exploration is all about not only the incredible riches that the world has to offer travelers but the incredible transformative powers that travel brings about in people
6576434 the amazing race is simply the best travel reality format in the world and it will nicely complement our stable of popular travel offerings such as anthony bourdain no reservations bizarre foods with andrew zimmern and samantha browns passport series

6576437 this league is wonderful in terms of opportunities for players and there arent certain criteria that fit this or that i mean talent is one but if you think about it we not only try to find the best players available but the best guy available
6576438 foremost we have to be consistent in taking care of ourselves working hard and getting rest
6576439 hopefully if were working hard enough on the road that means well win some games
6576440 when you have a 20 man plus roster tempers are supposed to flare at times but when it comes to these guys that barely happens and its unique in many ways
6576441 hey if you want a seat on this bus then come now
6576442 i love being around players that conduct themselves as a team
6576443 i also love the fact that my bus is as clean as it was a week before we left
6576444 could you please move back another row i dont want you reporting on some of the things im going to say
6576445 id rather be at home obviously than on the road but with a great bus driver and other people who take care of us our conditions are not too bad
6576446 you cant get crazy with the games we have left
6576447 and you cant worry about where youre at in the stats just about the game at the time
6576448 well todays a little different because we arrived later than we normally do i just put my ipod on and start going through line ups in my head and i talk to catcher alex trezza to not get psyched up about it
6576449 its weird because i would always go up against him when he was coach and i was a player for west liberty state college i think he jumped the fence because he was really excited knowing that this has been one of the highlights of my career so far
6576450 you dont want to interview me because im a playboy interview type of guy
6576451 its a life long dream for me to play in the big leagues
6576452 he is absolutely supportive of what im doing i just try to work on my game each day and he knows that
6576453 with a long season like this youre going to have experiences with your teammates on and off the field but if you can soak in both the bad and the good you will progress and get better
6576454 b j weed who in the hell would name their kid that
6576455 well when you throw bread like that six million birds will come
6576456 we were up against a good arm tonight and we showed that wins are tough to come by against a guy like that
6576457 its been tougher on my wife because she wants to be around me more often
6576458 since shes off from school during the summer shes been able to stay wherever i travel the only hard thing is not getting to spend as much time with her as id like because im busy with baseball
6576459 its really tough not being able to see my wife and 16 month old daughter
6576460 especially when you have a bad game and you need someone for support or someone to make you laugh i just look at the picture of my daughter to try and refresh my memory of all the things im missing back home in delaware
6576461 but even if i get to see my daughter for an hour it makes me happy until the next day off
6576462 i want to make sure they are as happy as possible because that makes me a better baseball player
6576463 i find it more difficult every day leaving my three children back home
6576464 i just cant imagine when we go to quebec and ottawa how im going to deal with not having them by my side
6576465 i love everybody on this team and i just hate to see us lose man
6576466 we need to stay focused right now because this is why were here to play dominant baseball
6576467 lets motherfuckin go its all or nothing right here guys
6576468 i threw a fastball down the middle and he caught it
6576469 our team played their asses off for four games straight
6576470 the idea of a national center for the american west is very compelling so much so that we at the autry have received an unbelievable outpouring of support from across america people realize its the creation of something very new that is to combine two extraordinary collections the autry and the southwest museum without a doubt the second most preeminent native american collection in america with the broadest array of art and artifacts about the american west together the collections tell the distinct stories of diverse cultures but more importantly of how all of those cultures myths and histories are interwoven and have affected one another
6576471 under the guidance of mrs jackie autry and the autry museums executive director john gray the merger creates the autry national center
6576472 jackie autry wants to take the entire southwest museum over to a wing of our current museum
6576473 the amazing race is an iconic american television series that really taps into what exploration is all about not only the incredible riches that the world has to offer travelers but the incredible transformative powers that travel brings about in people

6576475 im not sure im not sure im trying to get treatment this week and im feeling better every day
6576476 its going to end up being up to coach bill belichick and what he wants to do but i think hes been coaching long enough to understand that the first game in september is whats going to be important for us
6576477 shawn is going to give it a go and well just see how he does
6576478 were going to try to keep good communication with him during the game and give him an opportunity to play

6576489 do i think homeless people are bad no but theyre here because its easy and because we werent enforcing public order crimes weve received a mandate from the citizens to clean up the city and take back the neighborhoods so here we go

6576512 it s remarkable how well the market has held up
6576513 all three reports tend to indicate that we re bottoming out but that there is no real end in sight and that s what i think the market has to get used to
6576514 about 75 percent of the actual renovation and work for the renovation has been completed its noticeable our classroom and throughout the building you will notice significant changes it will improve the instructional climate throughout craig high school
6576515 its a major overhaul its almost like getting a whole new building
6576516 much of the infrastructure that craig high school had wiring lighting heating and ventilation was all the vintage of when we opened in 1954
6576517 in the guidance office we have new windows which will be nice we struggle with being too hot or too cold so hopefully that will help that and we have a new ceiling new lights
6576518 i think its just going to be so much better for our physical education for our athletics and quite possibly sometime in the future for our community as well

6576566 ive got sites on guys who maybe are not ready now but by the fourth or fifth ballgame they will be
6576567 and i think all of those guys fall under that maybe one or two might play earlier maybe special teams
6576568 its always nice to have the coaches watching you but i try to keep in mind what my role is on this team i am a freshman
6576569 and i need to perform well i really need to prove myself nothings going to be handed thats for sure

6576574 searels is on him but he can handle it a lot better than before he seems to be like hes more mature and more focused on getting the job done doing it right stop making up excuses and lets go i think hes really made a lot of strides in that way
6576575 so the israelites examined their food but they did not consult the lord then joshua made a peace treaty with them
6576576 there is way that seems right to man but in the end it leads to death
6576577 i brought you out of egypt into this land that i swore to give your ancestors and i said i would never break my covenant with you for your part you were not to make any covenants with the people living in this land instead you were to destroy their altars but you disobeyed my command why did you do this they will be thorns in your sides and their gods will be a constant temptation to you
6576578 after that generation the one who refused to follow gods command died another generation grew up who did not acknowledge the lord or remember the mighty things the lord had done for israel
6576579 for since our friendship with god was restored by the death of his son while we were still his enemies we will certainly be saved through the life of his son so now we can rejoice in our wonderful new relationship with god because our lord jesus christ has made us friends with god
6576580 now most people would not be willing to die for an upright person though someone might perhaps be willing to die for a person who is especially good but god showed his great love for us by sending christ to die for us while we were still sinners

6576621 the recent clinical trial showing ezetimibe whose trade is zetia and is part of the combination anti cholesterol pill known as vytorin may have increased cancer incidence and deaths has sparked interest in possible causes the trial known as the seas trial was an effort to show the combination pill reduced heart disease ezetimibe is unique in that it inhibits cholesterol absorption as opposed to removing cholesterol from the blood like statins but ezetimibe also inhibits absorption of dietary plant sterols and one plausible theory is that the reduction in sterol absorption in the patients in the seas trial may have increased their risk of contracting cancer
6576622 fda is investigating a report from the seas trial simvastatin and ezetimibe in aortic stenosis of a possible association between the use of vytorin a combination of simvastatin plus ezetimibe and a potentially increased incidence of cancer

6576662 so everyones saying obama should fight back against mccains smears how should we go about doing that
6576663 i think ill have my staff get to you its condominiums where ill have them get to you
6576664 why wont the media ask what cindy mccain is hiding why wont she release her tax returns in his famous
6576665 boy how times have changed eh from the concept of a candidates wife having a quote respectable republican cloth coat unquote to cindy mccain you think maybe cindy mccains worn a mink coat or two in her life the republicans have become the true elitist party as evidenced by cindy mccain trying to hide her enormous wealth from the public how is it that mr straight talk mccain cant even get his own wife to release her tax returns
6576666 no wonder john mccain doesnt get it about the effects of the bush economic policies on average americans it was just reported that his wife spent three quarters of a million dollars in just one month on her credit cards this isnt exactly an average american family i keep wondering why the media doesnt ask very simple questions to show what an out of touch elitist john mccain really is questions like so how many houses do you and your wife own senator mccain the average voter would be astonished at the answers to easy questions like that if of course they were ever asked
6576667 in arizona the only way to get around the state is by small private plane
6576668 yesterday john mccain was asked again what do you think about the economy he said i think the economy is fundamentally strong now this puzzled me i was confused what he meant but then there was another interview where somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have and he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and they said at least four at least four now think about that i guess if you think that being rich means you make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then it is not surprising that you think the economy is fundamentally strong but if you are like me and youve got one house or if you are like the millions of people struggling now to keep up with your mortgage payments you might have a different perspective by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes
6576669 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6576670 were delighted to have a real estate debate with barack obama
6576671 its a frickin mansion he doesnt tell people that you have a mansion you bought in a shady deal with a convicted felon
6576672 the reality is they have some investment properties and stuff its not as if he lives in ten houses thats just not the case
6576673 the reality is they have four that actually could be considered houses they could use
6576674 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
6576675 did i hear you correctly did you say halibut ears as in halibut the fish and ears you hear with
6576676 mother teresa convinced cindy to take two babies in need of medical attention to the united states one of those babies is now their adopted daughter 16 year old bridget mccain
6576677 with mother teresas encouragement she brought her fourth child bridget home
6576678 when i disembarked carrying bridget john said under his breath wheres she going
6576679 i brought home a baby without telling him and he not only took it in stride but loved it immediately embracing bridget who shares johns very dry sense of humor so she and her dad do pretty well together if i hadnt taken bridget out i think she would have become a prostitute or worse died
6576680 cindy mccain did not ask mr gosinski to misrepresent any facts in the adoption proceedings for bridget mccain said attorney john dowd in a statement specifically cindy mccain did not ask mr gosinski to testify that bridgets father had died in a rickshaw accident as he has alleged
6576681 five days later we met our new daughter nicki at the l a airport wearing the only clothing cindy could find on the trip back a 7 up t shirt she bought in the bangkok airport
6576682 they send wagons around each day to collect the dead
6576683 i knew her medical problems were easily treatable but she was female in a country where little girls arent valued
6576684 i guess i just kind of went and stood in their face and wouldnt take no for an answer finally about five days before i was supposed to leave i got my permission
6576685 i have to admit i wasnt crazy about the idea at first
6576686 but this was something cindy wanted to do but the whole family has taken to this little kid
6576687 she has these big black eyes and this thick cap of black hair im really happy about the adoption
6576688 john was really a good sport about the whole thing
6576689 i mean he had no warning at all until i called him
6576690 the real risk is we do what weve done for the last 30 years which is nothing
6576691 people point to 4 as a tipping point but 3 is where it got voters attention
6576692 we really want to make sure that the teachers are well armed to do this
6576693 one of our new modules is rocketry and propulsion the kids live for things like that when the teachers were there with the rockets in the park they were just so on fire and so engaging
6576694 in designing these modules we said we have to include the science and the math but make it hands on as well
6576695 we want to give them the opportunity to see and experience it
6576696 we said lets teach them the theory and the overall learning behind what they do and see in their own lives
6576697 theres that direct link and that understanding of why things work the way they do in terms of the rocket why does it propel up and whats the math behind it
6576698 its all about the stuff in a kids backpack and all the things they care about
6576699 what is the science and math behind an ipod or their cellphone
6576700 i think what were finding is if they havent been exposed to a particular field when they get into high school students receive through word of mouth or their peers that its hard or that its too difficult

6576708 the book you are about to read deals with what i believe to be the most serious crime ever committed in american history the president of the nation george w bush knowingly and deliberately taking this country to war in iraq under false presences a war that condemned over 100 000 human beings including 4 000 american soldiers to horrific violent deaths
6576709 see whats in front of me completely uninfluenced by the clothing reputation hoopla conventional wisdom etc put on it by others
6576710 threaten ed the world with horrible poisons and diseases and gasses and atomic weapons
6576711 exploring ways of using these to target the united states
6576712 iraq probably would attempt clandestine attacks against the u s homeland if baghdad feared an attack that threatened the survival of the regime were imminent or unavoidable or possibly for revenge such attacks more likely with biological than chemical agents probably would be carried out by special forces or intelligence operatives
6576713 not your war or my war or americas war but george bushs war
6576714 people are finally realizing that this russian situation has the potential to be bad for a very long time
6576715 the russians have shown evidence that theyre willing to cut off energy supplies to advance their aims there is concern that they are now going to be much more assertive in that area
6576716 if military activity heats up again pipeline flows into europe could be disrupted and that would affect the united states as well
6576717 this is probably about it in terms of a retail gas drop we may be a few cents away from the august bottom
6576718 the slide in the dollar has taken some of the wind out of the bears sail in the energy complex
6576719 terrified of allowing western countries to build any kind of cushion for the unexpected because it has the potential to return prices to normal or sustainable economic levels
6576720 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools

6576722 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success

6576730 we have been made aware of a security breach at the offices of an external contractor involving the loss of personal information about offenders in england and wales
6576731 a full investigation is being conducted police and the information commissioner have been informed
6576732 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
6576733 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
6576734 its a signal but we dont know what it means
6576735 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
6576736 it could go back for miles and miles and theres no real mechanism to stop it
6576737 as a result of thunderstorms moving within five nautical miles of sydney airport it is expected that some airlines may experience disruptions to flight schedules

6576746 sorry that you lost your files here s some fruit to make you smile ooo ha
6576747 for all the talk about changing the electoral map the core of it is still the same right here
6576748 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6576749 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6576750 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama
6576751 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county
6576752 the problem we have is that as we understand it and based upon the evidence that ive seen is that they circulated these petitions with etzels name never intending her to be the candidate
6576753 they went to the convention nominated barr and then she withdrew
6576754 we have a horrible problem in this state with voter fraud
6576755 this move by the mccain campaign completely contradicts everything john mccain stood for in 2000 when his competitors were trying to keep him off the ballot
6576756 mccain has become a part of the same corrupted machine he spoke vehemently against only eight years ago
6576757 which of savannahs call ups this season do you think will make it to the bigs first

6576764 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6576765 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6576766 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6576767 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6576768 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6576769 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6576770 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6576771 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6576772 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6576773 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6576774 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6576775 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6576776 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6576777 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6576778 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6576779 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6576780 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6576781 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6576782 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6576783 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did

6576785 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6576786 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6576787 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6576788 this is a planning took where all things are going
6576789 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6576790 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6576791 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6576792 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6576793 statistically speaking its one of the if not the hottest topics in many years
6576794 in a single day nearly 35 000 frequent fliers read about this topic and nearly 600 have added comments thats a lot of buzz for a single topic
6576795 with so much bad news breaking lately travelers have become pretty inured to the next fee the next service cut the next frequent flier devaluation the next flight cancellation
6576796 in that context any response at all is noteworthy and the reaction so far to uniteds suspension of meal service on some international flights has been vociferously negative
6576797 our clients are certainly not pleased with the barrage of fees and unbundling most evident at united
6576798 this is not necessarily new just the latest in a long line of claw backs of services and amenities that were once complimentary
6576799 the snack boxes are fine to purchase if the flight is 3 or 4 hours but a trans atlantic flight is another story
6576800 i suspect this is all about cutting the staff on the plane to faa minimums and the way to do this is to cut out all the meal service
6576801 it boggles my mind to think that they are not going to be serving meals in coach on trans atlantic flights
6576802 as far as the removal of meals in domestic business class united seems to be intent on alienating its loyal most profitable customers with this nickel and diming im fed up enough to be very seriously considering switching my loyalty to alaska
6576803 and from a business standpoint its highly profitable for the airlines so recasting meals as an extra cost item naturally strikes many as nasty and mean spirited the prevailing sentiment is that united has simply gone too far in the wrong direction
6576804 i find it amusing that such a big deal is being made over such a truly insignificant issue
6576805 im continually amazed that food on an airline is a bigger issue to people than routing aircraft types schedule and frequency i think the bottom line in this case is that its one more thing being removed and people are fed up with it i would honestly rather see them scale back in areas like this to preserve their ability to fly more often to more places
6576806 i would pay extra for selective and better service as long as the main perks are staying upgrades priority boarding bag check and just an overall feel of an airline going an extra step to accommodate me i am fine
6576807 when we purchase a ticket we are purchasing transportation from point a to b the amenities we enjoy were simply marketing tools from an era seemingly long gone
6576808 by adopting such a strategy united has essentially abandoned a competitive posture versus parallel carriers in the market
6576809 once revenue deteriorates the result will just be the next round of enhancements and further erosion it is a slippery slope littered with the carnage of others
6576810 i think united should look at virgin americas model of food service use an in seat electronic ordering system to request specific meals it drives revenue it keeps passengers happy passengers get to eat when they want to

6576814 it would have been a snub to william and harry to have left their girlfriends names off the guest list
6576815 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6576816 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6576817 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6576818 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6576819 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6576820 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6576821 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6576822 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6576823 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6576824 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6576825 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6576826 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6576827 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6576828 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6576829 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6576830 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6576831 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6576832 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6576833 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6576834 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6576835 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6576836 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6576837 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6576838 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6576839 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6576840 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6576841 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6576842 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6576843 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6576844 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6576845 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6576846 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6576847 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6576848 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6576849 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6576850 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6576851 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6576852 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6576853 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6576854 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6576855 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6576856 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6576857 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6576858 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6576859 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6576860 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6576861 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6576862 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6576863 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6576864 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6576865 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6576866 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6576867 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6576868 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6576869 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them

6576879 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
6576880 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
6576881 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries all together
6576882 that is potentially a world changing event this is the closest weve had to something being commercially available in this class
6576883 i actually started thinking about it making europes ryder cup team around the open but then i wasnt playing great and its not good to think about that when you are not playing well
6576884 i really want to make the team especially after how the last year and a half has gone i feel like i have my old game back after last week he took a week off and these two weeks could be really exciting for me this is what we play for
6576885 it must have been three oclock when i got to sleep i had a coffee at dinner and there must have been rocket fuel in it
6576886 i wasnt as rested as i would have liked but i got away with it i didnt play particularly well but i guess i managed it well
6576887 when you are a pro you learn how to make the most of your game when you are not tip top
6576888 what they dont expect is for the government to keep a record for 15 years of their comings into the country this database is in a sense worse than a watch list
6576889 at least in the watch list scenario theres some reason why the name got on the list here the only thing a person does to come to the attention of dhs is to lawfully cross the border the theory of this data collection is track everyone just in case
6576890 new technology and systems designed to enhance border security or identify other violations of law
6576891 there was absolutely no way they should have the entire database
6576892 once you have data in a database you dont need it lends itself to unauthorized use
6576893 the tests reveal delays but those are developmental delays not permanent failures
6576894 why dont you set your sights on the next iep ask them to take the numbers off the table ask them to think creatively and openly they dont actually need the tests

6576898 major league baseball and the media they want instant replay and were going to have instant replay so if it delays the game then theres nothing we can do about it

6576944 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement

6577155 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we are all meant to shine as children do we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us its not just in some of us its in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others
6577156 um please dont let me profess my undying love to dr koffran as im going under okay promise me
6577157 obama verspricht dass er anders ist er ist aber nicht anders deswegen muss es die amerikanische ffentlichkeit interessieren es geht nicht darum ob die ausl ndischen medien f r obama wichtig oder unwichtig sind sondern darum dass obama das versprechen abgegeben hat dass er sich anders gegen ber dem ausland verh lt und er tut es nicht
6577158 niche access may be granted to some such as mexican reporters whose country has produced a sufficient number of american voters although lack of access is the press corps primary complaint it is a serious problem only when correspondents are trying to reach the highest levels of government
6577159 my book explains quite well i hope there is nothing that he von marschall wrote in the article that wouldnt have been assumed if he had read the book
6577160 go and ask mr obama for an interview and he will say how many votes do i get for it he is a man who is trying to become the president of the united states and therefore he is trying to attract american voters
6577161 i am talking about what the team is for next year what the core fundamental of the team is that it is an american team with a base of american riders
6577162 we are going to be continuing with at least 12 to 15 of the guys we have this year they will be the core not necessarily the stars but the core we are proud that we have gotten them to the point where they can handle the high level of racing we are going to
6577163 when it comes to founders we know we are usually going to see something odd
6577164 in some cases they are exorbitantly paid and in others they are paid miserly
6577165 its funny if i dont get on the team its gone but if i make the team its going to come right back up again
6577166 its kind of a double edged sword but its nothing im not going to talk about i think the pga is comfortable with me
6577167 the pga of america could care less about winning it honestly they pick a site where theyre going to have the senior pga the pga and the ryder cup which means less money they have to pay out to get more money
6577168 and from what ive heard the whole week is extremely long
6577169 jeez lady you are pretty close to maxing out on how much you are allowed to get in financial aid from the two degrees you already have
6577170 the programmes are going well but we have a lot to do to ensure quality of services it is more than a matter of blocking transmission the health of the mother of the family has to be linked to the care services available
6577171 in swaziland there are 154 sites providing pmtct services that is coverage of 71 percent and this is quite encouraging government is intending 100 percent coverage by 2011
6577172 swazis are hard on a woman who is hiv positive a woman has to choose between secrecy and the health of her baby and her own health
6577173 because of swazi culture it is not possible for her to hide her condition from her family a man can take arvs in secret a woman is more exposed it is because of the breastfeeding issue
6577174 depending on affordability and safety conditions they can use formula otherwise mothers are counselled to continue with breastfeeding but complement this with culturally acceptable nutritious local foods for the baby
6577175 if you stop breastfeeding earlier than six months and begin formula feeding the tendency we found is that the woman will mix breastfeeding with formula feeding which is dangerous in terms of transmission
6577176 the best available option for resource constrained countries like swaziland is exclusive breastfeeding for six months
6577177 at home they would want to know why she is not allowing other women in the family to breastfeed her baby
6577178 secondly she has to wean the baby after six months and swazis do not understand why the baby should not be breastfed for two years
6577179 the husband and the family say oh you are hiv positive you brought this disease into our house there is still a stigma and you cant run away from that
6577180 i would say swazis are cruel to women who are hiv positive they think a man cannot transmit hiv to a woman that women are carriers of hiv aids
6577181 they are able to carry out far more seasoned tactical operations than they had been recently and were paying the price
6577182 none of the wounds sustained by those killed or wounded were consistent with air delivered ordinance

6577196 injuries are a part of the game and every athlete at some time has to deal with the prospect of getting hurt
6577197 i dont think theres anything that he needs to redeem himself for at all
6577198 he was just basically a player who was unfortunate and got hurt now hes healthy and i think hes looking to get back up there and give the yankees everything that he has
6577199 seven of the existing 17 northern spotted owl sites are found in the eis to be of low potential for persistence
6577200 the cocktail party effect or the cocktail party problem is the problem that humans have similar to what humans have when theyre trying to hear out or listen to a speaker when that speaker is embedded in a lot of broad band noise such as what you might find at a cocktail party when youre trying to listen to one person and theres a lot of diffuse sound around you
6577201 turns out that birds can do exactly the same thing and so birds if theyre having a problem communicating with one another they can change their spatial position and improve their communication effectiveness pretty easily
6577202 birds do that monkeys do that its called the lombard effect
6577203 my main goal is to look at the effects of background noise on their vocal behavior
6577204 as those noise levels are raised how do whales adjust for that and what i found is that they do increase their call level
6577205 does it increase stress or does it make it more difficult to communicate with members of your pod which are related to be together is essential to your survival even if theyre able to raise their voice there might be costs associated with that
6577206 he used that as basic musical material to literally take what he viewed as the music of the finest musicians on the planet and translate it into something that human instruments could play

6577210 which found that nasas 22 project technology development program is making progress toward its goals to support the agencys moon effort but there was room for improvement particularly in communicating the risks and human health factors associated with new technologies as well as with longer term projects aimed at reaching past the moon to mars and beyond other hurdles include federal budget limitations and shifting requirements of nasas constellation program overseeing the lunar lander and its heavy lift ares v rocket technology development program but that technology is necessary for future human exploration
6577211 even the most talented of engineers and scientists will find it difficult to make forward progress without the necessary tools to do so
6577212 we hope that this report will help to strengthen that road to the future not cause it to be questioned
6577213 we are trying to get individuals to become more aware of their health
6577214 im big and beautiful and doing my best to keep my stress levels down so i can stay healthy

6577223 the pacific is developing its comparative advantage as a location for international criminal activities such as people smuggling drug production and arms trafficking
6577224 the pacific is sharply divided between islands that are functionally literate and those that remain basically illiterate
6577225 we will be long term partners with the region on the condition that our investment in these areas is met through these development partnerships and resulting in measurable achievements there is no blank cheque here
6577226 these schemes will no doubt benefit the individuals lucky enough to be selected to participate but even the high guest worker numbers would not help the employment problems of png fiji and the solomon islands
6577227 the pacific can only avoid looming economic social and political crises if its large economies dramatically reform their policies to encourage substantial employment creating growth
6577228 this case suggests facial transplantation might be an option for restoring a severely disfigured face and could enable patients to readily integrate themselves back into society

6577236 we hope that this report will help to strengthen that road to the future not cause it to be questioned
6577237 the early reports werent really clear enough to act on
6577238 but soon we had accumulated dozens of missing persons reports were still trying to get an exact count but we know for sure that a lot of people arent where theyre supposed to be
6577239 i am not aware of any missing staff or faculty
6577240 we see a clear pattern that sadly is all too familiar
6577241 at first it seems that someone has just wandered off or perhaps is in the bathroom or taking a phone call then several people are unaccounted for gradually it becomes clear that youre being picked off one by one by some kind of undead or demonically powered supernatural creature

6577246 with innovation comes risk but also reward if you are successful
6577247 they were successful in launching an assembly time management mechanic with their cake mania franchise and introduced casual gamers to the role playing and trading sim game genres via their tradewinds series
6577248 it is good value proposition from the standpoint of an advertiser
6577249 we have a pretty good idea who our customer is and they are a captive audience they are there to play a game
6577250 people are going to know about a handful of developers and handful of games
6577251 and i think the majority of the casual games business is going to be driven around those brands from a company perspective i think we are very well positioned to really be one of those companies that is talked about in that perspective
6577252 if i am not in the trenches with my developers i am not going to know as much
6577253 it is a good viewpoint to see the world as a dream when you have something like a nightmare you will wake up and tell yourself that it was only a dream it is said that the world we live in is not a bit different from this
6577254 its going to be a stretch for democrats to take virginia regardless of who is on the ticket because we havent voted for a democratic president since 1964

6577258 the occ is essentially saying that if banks cant trick or cheat consumers they wont be able to offer credit
6577259 it is outrageous that the federal regulator overseeing the banking industry is so out of step with the needs of millions of americans unfairly trapped in debt by abusive credit card practices
6577260 better disclosure of unfair practices is not real consumer protection
6577261 consumers should have the confidence of knowing that their interest rates wont skyrocket if the bill or payment gets lost in the mail
6577262 the occs argument that credit will dry up unless banks can engage in questionable lending practices sounds eerily similar to the arguments made by the mortgage industry right before the current foreclosure crisis
6577263 the mortgage meltdown demonstrates the importance of ending abusive lending practices when warning signs arise we urge the federal reserve board to adopt these critical protections against unfair credit card practices
6577264 oh no vanderbilt is practically the tb capital of the world youd be surprised
6577265 delivering a commencement address is a great responsibility or so i thought until i cast my mind back to my own graduation the commencement speaker that day was the distinguished british philosopher baroness mary warnock reflecting on her speech has helped me enormously in writing this one because it turns out that i cant remember a single word she said this liberating discovery enables me to proceed without any fear that i might inadvertently influence you to abandon promising careers in business law or politics for the giddy delights of becoming a gay wizard

6577273 im 100 percent sure this is true mushroom its true mushroom not poison
6577274 you shouldnt eat mushrooms that youre not absolutely certain are edible
6577275 most mushrooms are really harmless and theyre actually beneficial for the ecosystem
6577276 this year we are seeing lots of mushrooms but that does not mean that there are any more fungi than usual
6577277 the mycelial nature of fungi makes them very hard to detect and study in nature most of the time we have no idea where the fungi are how big they are how long they live and so on
6577278 it is only when the fungi produce a mushroom that we get a sense of where the fungi are mushrooms are ephemeral but the mycelium can be very long live
6577279 for example this year chanterelles an expensive and delicious kind of wild mushroom came up in my backyard in upton mass
6577280 i am positive that this is the first time this has happened during the eight years that i have lived in my house i would have noticed because one i am a mycologist and two i like to collect and eat chanterelles the question is were the chanterelles there all along living as a mycelium in the soil and waiting for the right conditions moisture to make mushrooms or did they just arrive as spores and establish a mycelium this year mushrooms are very mysterious organisms and that is one reason why i like to study them
6577281 this is no longer 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia when a great power invaded a small neighbor and overthrew its government
6577282 the big difference which cant be overlooked is that the united states and the european union are intervening in the tensions between georgia and russia
6577283 in 1968 you couldnt say that about czechoslovakia washington and all of western europe accepted the situation as it was and they accepted the idea that czechoslovakia belonged to the soviet sphere of influence
6577284 yesterday on august 20th 1968 at around 11 p m forces from the soviet union the polish peoples republic the german democratic republic the hungarian peoples republic and the bulgarian peoples republic crossed the state border of the czechoslovak socialist republic
6577285 this happened without the knowledge of the czechoslovak president the head of the national assembly or the prime minister and the first secretary of the central committee of the communist party of czechoslovakia and its official bodies
6577286 in these small studios there were people from czechoslovak radio and they were broadcasting for a number of days underground
6577287 they were getting news from all over prague people destroyed the names of the streets on the walls of prague it was difficult for the soviets to know where they exactly were and that brodcasting continued for a number of days
6577288 i remember the most famous athlete emil zatopek he was going from one tank to another tank and he was discussing the situation with the soviet soldiers
6577289 some of them didnt feel well you could see it they expected people with weapons fighting and now they could see just regular people who were trying to persuade them that there was nothing going on against the soviet union or that someone here in czechoslovakia wanted to start a third world war it was fascinating it was fascinating what people were doing and there was unbelievable courage
6577290 its a big mistake that your newspapers and magazines dont write the truth
6577291 if they wrote the truth you wouldnt need to come here there is no counterrevolution here as your papers write
6577292 everybody in the country was asked this wonderful question do you agree or disagree with the brotherly help of the soviet union and the warsaw pact countries and you knew quite well what that meant
6577293 you could say well i thought that they shouldnt be doing it but i was wrong and i now agree with invasion and you could keep your job in case you were a party member you were still a party member
6577294 not only you but your kids eventually could not enroll into university and you were either expelled from the communist party or crossed out if you were crossed out you still had a chance eventually to rejoin the party but if you were expelled that was the end both my parents were expelled from the communist party
6577295 it remains to this day a big trauma its a big problem which most people had to cope with but these are mostly people who come of age during the husak normalization for the younger generation the events of 1968 are truly a chapter in history which they can learn from or not but its not a personal issue for them theres a big generational difference
6577296 one of the concerns weve had all along with belarus has been its holding of political prisoners
6577297 and obviously theyve released the last of them and thats going to be an important step in terms of how we look at the future of the relationship between the united states and belarus
6577298 i dont know but we certainly hope belarus will look westward
6577299 but that again is something that is going to have to be determined by the belarusian authorities its hard to say what theyre thinking but again we view very positively the fact that these prisoners were released
6577300 president bush expressed to prime minister gilani the united states strong commitment to working with the prime minister and the government of pakistan to address the ongoing battle against extremists and to assist pakistan through its current economic situation

6577317 in the future if those young offenders want to apply for a job their employer will not look at quantity of marijuana they will only look at the conviction
6577318 in respect of instances where judges discharge any offender it is their prerogative to make those decisions
6577319 it wont be prudent to make a generalised comment on where the judges use their prerogative
6577320 i think the question of penalty for drugs should look at carefully and very soon
6577321 teachers and teacher organisations such as trade unions have an obligation to defend democracy posturing at conference without the follow up action based on conviction and commitment would be as hollow as the president of china advocating in defense of democracy
6577322 we have moved from producing smart citizens to producing good citizens
6577323 what value do we place on a child who has scored the highest marks and topped his or her class at all levels but goes on to be a self serving and greedy individual versus an average child who did not do as well but passed spending a life time helping the less fortunate and giving them hope
6577324 which of the two would you consider the better citizen
6577325 i think most students who have passed through our education system have fared well and made a positive contribution to our evolving democracy
6577326 of course there are always exceptions to the rule and in fijis case students such as rabuka speight and bainimarama come to mind

6577334 weve really upgraded our accounting and record keeping systems and now have a better handle on what leagues are costing us
6577335 i suspect that weve been in this range for some time
6577336 if were going to have anywhere close to a balanced budget we had to look at fees to see if there were any opportunities to obtain additional revenue

6577360 i know you like her a lot but i dont need you saying anything about how she plays okay im a 3 and shes a 7 okay its going to be tough for me and i dont need you making all sorts of noise
6577361 i didnt mean anything by it i just though she made a really nice shot i mean you shoot well too
6577362 i dont need you helping her in any way okay i need you to leave
6577363 stop stop shooting i need you to stop shooting i dont know how many points youve made
6577364 i made the seven ball on the break im shooting the five ball now that would mean i have 1 point for the ball on the break and 4 points for the 1 through 4 for a total of five points
6577365 yes you can count the balls and just add them up right nine ball is 2 points everything else is 1 point unless its a scratch
6577366 thank you im terrible at math if you can believe it
6577367 theres something wrong with this scoresheet it says youre only going to 48 points arent sevens supposed to go to
6577368 yes it does you however only have to go to
6577369 yes i think they shortened the races for the mini tournaments because they didnt want the matches to take too long youve played mini tournaments before havent you
6577370 err well um i dont think so im going to ask the referees
6577371 i guess youre right the races are right they are shorter for mini tournaments
6577372 im going to have to ask you to leave you guys are not allowed to talk to her okay shes a 7 and im a 3 this is very difficult for me and i dont want you talking to her at all
6577373 some people tell me i take the game too seriously
6577374 do whatever you think you need to do to win
6577375 oh trust me i care there is nothing i love more than playing well and im not doing that at the moment so i care very much im just less vocal about it than you are
6577376 oh youre just giving me the game thats so nice of you
6577377 no really thats so really sweet of you to think of me like that
6577378 me conceding the ball has nothing to do with sweetness and more with the fact that i am irritated at my own carelessness in both playing this game and keeping track of the score
6577379 thats great that you think i dont play bad at all
6577380 yeah i mean you really need to learn defense you play terrible defensive shots and you cant control your cueball
6577381 well just learn to play defensive shots and someday you could be good player maybe even a killer player
6577382 but its pretty obvious even if she was sandbagging theres no way she could beat you in an even race how could she not see that

6577404 i told he to look so htats what shes doing
6577405 we wanted to see the neighborhoods so the teachers can get a better understanding of where the students are coming from and where they go home to
6577406 weve got to also understand that just because someone is considered poor it doesnt mean they dont have an enriching life
6577407 based upon some of the surroundings theyre in its a challenge just to get to school considering all the things they have to face in their neighborhood

6577410 reducing young peoples access to tobacco products is an important public health strategy which aims to reduce the number of young people who take up tobacco smoking and die as a result of their addiction
6577411 while results of recent monitoring show most tobacco retailers act responsibly some retailers continue to sell tobacco products to young people
6577412 retailers and their employees can face prosecution and large fines if they sell tobacco products to young people and both can incur a maximum fine of 5500 if they have sold tobacco products to a person under the age of 18 years
6577413 we encourage all tobacco retailers to act responsibly and avoid potential prosecution by always asking for id if they think a person is under the age of 18 years and training their staff to always ask for id

6577426 mike wallace and 60 minutes are here for this is the funniest thing ive ever heard
6577427 things like this make a it a little tough to concentrate
6577428 i just told him i didnt have enough confidence to use her in tight games
6577429 i first became aware of ila a couple of years ago when she was at southern california college
6577430 i told him i could find a place for him in my organization but it definitely wouldnt be as a scout

6577456 council doesnt want to know about it it says its not their problem but thats not good enough
6577457 the trees need to go or at least need heavy pruning
6577458 i was following a truck and saw a tree coming down the truck swerved off the road but the tree hit the front of it
6577459 i had my daughter in the back seat and was sitting there when a second tree came down on our car
6577460 we were trapped there for a while and needed the police to get us out of the car
6577461 my car was a write off it was sheer good luck we got out of it without being seriously hurt
6577462 but that may not be the case next time something needs to be done sooner than later before another tree comes falling down
6577463 its a main road which is technically the responsibility of the rta
6577464 but we do the works on it for the rta
6577465 council will take on board mr hamers concerns and investigate the health of the trees in question

6577469 other services will go under if we dont see change early next year
6577470 we support the funding model endorsed by the national union of students which is a hecs style model that allows students to pay as they can rather than up front

6577473 i have no doubt over the last eight weeks given some of the media articles we have suffered brand damage
6577474 that people read something and say this but a few days later they say well we understand that qantas has a great reputation
6577475 theres a perception now being created of a lot more problems with qantas than there is in reality

6577481 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
6577482 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
6577483 its a signal but we dont know what it means
6577484 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
6577485 he missed the first half of the competition through injury but he has been a massive bonus for us since his return having the first round off he means he has come back fresh
6577486 his scrummaging and strength as well as his go forward work around the paddock have really helped the team
6577487 we did lose to them twice but they were close games it would be good to get a win and its do able but we need to be on our game
6577488 obviously the grand final is the goal but this is one of the games we have been working towards to be in this game and have the chance for the home grand final we are really looking forward to it
6577489 there is no one area where we can say we have it over them our forwards are even and our backs are even
6577490 in the first round against them we had our opportunities but we didnt take them and then it was one bad read that cost us in the second we werent travelling well injury wise and and things didnt go our way
6577491 for us it is a matter of taking our opportunities and getting points when we get the field position whether that be three points for a penalty or five for the try
6577492 for the club it would be great to get a home grand final at ashwood park in our first year out there but in saying that if it has to be in dubbo we have had success over there in the past as well
6577493 it the collection is amazing im dumbfounded that i hadnt made an effort to visit here before i think these guys have set up the best fossil and mineral museum in the country
6577494 its been amazing to see such a collection with such depth this is not just a few pretty rocks there are few collections like this in the world
6577495 this is easily the best collection in australia and probably the best in the southern hemisphere
6577496 i hope this can form the basis to build the collection on
6577497 it would be a real shame if the collection just stayed as it was its a bloody good start and hopefully more will be added over the next century or so
6577498 its been fantastic i always enjoy hosting experts from around the world and showing them that australia does have the best museums
6577499 vytorins effectiveness has been in doubt and now its safety is questionable

6577504 i have been fortunate to have played in europe i have played in japan i have gone a lot of places around this continent asia the one thing that kind of brings people together is watching the sport coming to see the guys competing against each other
6577505 we want to do it in the right way we want people to respect us and we want to show respect it is called mutual respect
6577506 they tried to reach a compromise solution but it is too early to say they reached an agreement about all issues
6577507 the iraqi government wants as a sovereign country to be the master of the law in iraq
6577508 there needs to be a strict timetable otherwise these forces will stay forever not having a timetable means they will never leave
6577509 the negotiators have made really really good progress they are satisfied with where they are
6577510 but obviously it is going to be the prime ministers call so this is a chance for me to sit there with him
6577511 we are redoubling our efforts to bring this to a final and successful conclusion
6577512 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people that respects iraqi sovereignty that allows us to lay the kind of foundation that we need to make sure that we complete the work that weve all sacrificed so greatly to see accomplished
6577513 it will be an excellent agreement when we finally have agreement

6577519 needless to say everyone is excited about getting the regular season underway
6577520 we have had a good set of practices to start off the year and hopefully we will have a good showing against portland state
6577521 if youre going to set a comic in 1959 because you want to evoke a certain feel its frustrating that murphy ignores whatever else is going on during that period anyway its a minor point but one that bugged me
6577522 theres no commenting on the politics of the sixties theres nary a nod or wink to the audience about any retro cool pastiche and theres nothing to imply that theres anything more to it than whats presented in fact if i hadnt been told otherwise i could swear that the book was reprinting actual 1960s material
6577523 remarkably liberated for 1959 and it doesnt ring terribly true
6577524 theres two fisted action adventure double crossing and the requisite sexual tension murphy doesnt bother with digging too deep into the actual culture of 1950s vegas but thats okay this book is more to have some fun with guys wearing tiki masks thwarting crime theres nothing wrong with that

6577530 if it wasnt for the olympics they wouldnt be coming here and i wouldnt be doing any work for them
6577531 the work we are getting here is literally the tip of the iceberg
6577532 they could either use us or just use the premises over the period of the olympics
6577533 sailors have their favourite sails it is quite important that if they do rip a sail they get it back for the next race
6577534 it is really nice to be involved with an olympic venue and we will certainly be flagging it up
6577535 hopefully we will do a good job for everybody but you are only as good as your last job i dont think it is going to push us to the next level
6577536 hopefully they are going to tidy up the area because it has got completely run down
6577537 we look at the olympics as an enormous free marketing campaign
6577538 it is going to bring tens of thousands of people to the area the amount of money people are going to spend on food drink transport and accommodation is going to be extensive
6577539 when we developed marinas in other areas which were not so affluent we found these areas have been lifted
6577540 progress and some very significant progress is being made in all aspects of our legacy drive
6577541 i am a great believer in the olympics but you have to be so careful that certain decisions arent made which step on the little man and on that guy who has been paying his rent all those years
6577542 the white house has been seeking to formalize in law and regulation some of the aggressive counterterrorism steps it has already taken in practice

6577551 as farfetched as it sounds theyre changing american society piece by piece through muslim benevolent civil rights organizations and by capitalizing on our unwillingness to stand up for the ideals of the republic
6577552 its no different than any middleman who buys a piece of real estate and flips it
6577553 if honda had told mr js the city was in the background mr js would have far preferred to deal with the city
6577554 they could have gotten more money they also could have gotten some favorable tax treatment
6577555 they would have had that property cleared and integrated as part of the dealership within less than two weeks
6577556 what drives sales in the car business is having enough models and trim lines and options and accessories when the customer comes on the lot
6577557 would never have agreed to pay the purchase price without the citys agreement to finance that acquisition
6577558 they presumably got a price they were satisfied with or they wouldnt have agreed to sell
6577559 its right there at the entry of the auto mall
6577560 i could see how from a planning perspective there would be a strong interest on the citys part to close it down they would need to find someplace else and that would be tough
6577561 i can understand why the city would very much want to get rid of that
6577562 but everyone knows that destruction locks are terrible for farming right
6577563 all the lawyers that i had talked to they tell me you dont have a chance in this thing they just will not give you exemption so im very happy that they have given me exemption
6577564 we were trying to use the sensible approach to this thing and look at and try to figure out what a reasonable person would do
6577565 they didnt include the grandchildren so after i die then theyre going to be in the same boat the thing has been resolved somewhat but i didnt want my children to go through what i had to go through for eight years battling with the farm land security board
6577566 the one thing i asked them to do was bring a common sense approach to this
6577567 this should have been done a long time ago this is not a big issue should not have been a big issue and weve made it that way as government by dragging our feet and not dealing with it
6577568 i tell you my mom had such a love for saskatchewan

6577573 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses close sources linking to this item
6577574 i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally
6577575 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
6577576 the price of pet food has gone up for veterinarians their overhead has gone up so theyre charging more for their services as well
6577577 bringing them here is the last step ive talked to people who are living out of their cars before theyre willing to give up their pets they become like family members and its an incredibly difficult thing for people to do
6577578 we dont know what shape that will take at this point but we do know that even the cost of pet food is a hardship for many people these days

6577587 but i realized i am someone living with aids and this is important to me

6577591 the leading economists of the day feared that if workers understood marxist theory the working class would realize how badly they were being exploited
6577592 fearing this might lead to revolutionary fervor economists sought to recast economic theory to neutralize the marxist critique they limited their neoclassical theory to looking at innocuous issues such as how prices change they also sought to prove that everyone gets paid exactly in accordance with their net contribution to society implying that workers arent exploited and that is no basis for workers to claim a fairer share of the pie

6577596 even though i took them with one of the most popular profs at the university a guy who always won undergraduate teaching awards i hated them i found them so far removed from real life and it seemed like the only thing economics was good for was to argue against my political views for me there were other considerations beyond shifting supply and demand curves like social justice but there was absolutely no discussion in class about those kinds of issues

6577659 that organised retail store shopping in india is an experience akin to a nightmare is no secret from dirty stores to poorly merchandised goods to indifferent retail personnel the list is endless yet most retail stores seem to draw consumers as the other choice available is a bigger nightmare called kirana stores even some of the leading retail stores fail to take into account customers preferences as they are yet to get down to the concept of retail designing on parameters ranging from accessibility location window display facade staff packaging decorative amp props ambiance and interiors retail stores do not consider the likes and dislikes of their target consumers even if it werent a rupee here or there wouldnt make much of a difference to me id rather pay for retail calm than gain a rupee and face chaos that gets to me

6577694 i f i were obama i dont know if id be hurling around the word bigot given some of the things that obama himself has said in the past for example if corsi the fringe bigot you know what would you call a guy who openly complained about white folks greed
6577695 i dont think obama ought to be hurling around words like bigot given the things that hes said himself

6577723 this camp has been a little bit different for joel he is a little more intense and focused than past camps hes been a pro for a long time so he trains the same way every time but this camp he is more dedicated more intense and training really hard for marquez
6577724 joel has fought guys that were as good and well proven as marquez in the past marquez is a great fighter but so is joel he is preparing like he normally does against a great fighter he doesnt get nervous or over excited or anxious its just a fight for him this is his job and he is doing what he has to do to be prepared for september 13th
6577725 the trick is to eat but not over eat so you have to control portions joel eats very well three maybe four times a day and if im not looking maybe five the trainer said with a wink i dont believe in starving fighters i started cooking at training camp because it was cheaper for me to cook than to hire a chef i dont cook really fancy i just cook simple meals that are healthy joel really likes chi cken salmon steamed vegetables and once in a while i make pasta but i only use whole wheat or brown rice pasta we dont eat any junk food just a clean diet because he has to burn more calories than he takes in
6577726 weve been watching films and marquez is an excellent fighter i think its going to be a great fight joels weight is good training is good but we dont want to be on weight too soon because i like to have my fighters be able to eat right up until the time of the weigh in and bring them down slowly
6577727 we have been working really hard in the gym juan has been lifting more weights to focus on gaining strength and muscle we have changed his diet as well he has been eating more carbohydrates to gain the extra weight moving up in weight is a very difficult process for juan because he is a natural 126 pound fighter and normally fights at 130 pounds so he is going up even more the weight is definitely an advantage for casamayor because after the weigh in juan will not gain that much weight he will probably fight around 142 pounds at the most and casamayor will definitely go up more than that
6577728 we have a different relationship than i have with my other fighters it is more than just fighter and trainer he is more than just my fighter juan is one of my best friends my job is to prevent mistakes for juan so i am being very careful with his diet and his training to make sure he is 100 percent ready so that nothing will go wrong on september 13th
6577729 camp is going well and he is working hard as usual were always confident that we will be successful in a fight because we put so much into our preparation and know it will pay off in the end we like to cover the bases so that theres nothing left for us to be surprised with when we get into the ring with our opponent
6577730 basically we are doing some of the things we worked on in preparation for the first fight only this time around with a lot of practice were able to do them better i think vernon will bring more pressure so were definitely going to be pulling out some new moves
6577731 our relationship is like a triangle we all have our own strengths so each one of us takes care of our own corner and it just works were like a pyramid
6577732 i dont mind coming to atlanta because that is what vernon wanted and it fit my schedule i think psychologically its good for vernon too as he was away from home too long for his last camp and probably suffered from some emotional burnout besides its not too far from florida and i go home on the weekends it sure beats going to california which i absolutely will never do again mcgirt travelled to big bear california to train fernando vargas for his fight against fitz vanderpool in 2003 and returned to another california camp in 2006 to train joel casamayor for his second fight with diego corrales my comfort zone is the east coast
6577733 i turned pro on january 17 1976 and on january 18 i knew i wanted to be a trainer
6577734 even when i was fighting i was always in the gym helping amateurs when people ask me if i think i was a better fighter or trainer i lean towards trainer although most say fighter because i was a world champion because i love tea chi ng and helping people working with fighters is my passion it gives me great satisfaction wat chi ng them succeed
6577735 listen the fighters say there is nothing to do in vero but vernon s got me out here in the middle of nowhere
6577736 it is so dark at night that i am afraid of being outside by myself i have to ride around in my car if i want to smoke a cigar
6577737 the most devastating thing for a fighter is to lose to a guy you know you should never have lost to in the first place
6577738 that alone lights a fire inside of you my job is to maintain that fire inside of vernon and make sure that it doesnt ignite to a five alarm disaster or on the flip side burn out entirely we dont talk much about the first fight if he brings it up cool but it is not necessary to dwell on what happened i just have to get him ready to not let it happen again and for vernon whose boxing skills and experience have proven themselves to be superior to moras skills it is keeping him mentally relaxed up until fight time that counts the most
6577739 for his first fight against mora vernon was in camp too long almost three months he over trained and peaked early there were days when he should have taken off and he did something anyway whether running an extra mile or shadow boxing a few rounds when vernon beat picirillo and baldomir he had six week camps for both fights and he looked great we have a set plan and schedule now and he is sticking to it which makes my job that much easier
6577740 i get a different kind of nervous feeling when my son fights than when the other fighters i work with get in the ring with my son its as if i am getting in the ring with him and i almost get the same feeling as when i was fighting but whether it is fighting training or training my son the same thing happens every time once the bell rings the nervousness is gone and it is time to fight

6577764 but mccain is seen by most voters as better on foreign policy and much more likely to be an effective commander in chief that may explain why hes been hammering obama on the iraq war all the while denying that hes calling obamas patriotism into question
6577765 obama is pivoting toward a more combative style rebuking the republicans for habitually turning differences over policy into questions about patriotism a habit he said john mccain has readily embraced
6577766 yet the mccain campaign continues to run ads attacking obama on a personal level belittling him as a shallow celebrity and describing him as fussy hysterical or testy
6577767 heres my other question of the moment because barack obama went on vacation because john mccain seemed to have the stage to himself with very aggressive advertising the gap has closed considerably between the two mccain seems to be surging has barack obama lost his momentum
6577768 no no look right now right after the conventions right after labor day is when voters start paying attention i see right after the conventions a break out for senator obama so i think the stars are lining up for us once again

6577814 so you pitch the hay off and it went downhill instead of other type barns where it went up so that was a labor saving part
6577815 we started out on the roof and would do a section or two every year

6577833 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
6577834 its a signal but we dont know what it means

6577842 honestly when it was going on i had no fear

6577848 the market would have responded positively to a signal by the company to buy back some shares at a depressed price which would have supported its comments about the long term robustness of the business
6577849 oz minerals has said it is pursing acquisitions but the market is concerned about the current management strategy adding value to any acquisitions it may make

6577853 until he drops his environmental program n0bama is only shedding crocodile tears when he talks about how high gas prices are hurting americans his real goal is 6 or 7 gasoline as a matter of policy

6577866 john mccain has seven homes theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america you dont have to be a nobel prize laureate economist you just have to have a little bit of a sense of what ordinary people are going through to understand that we cant afford eight more years or four more years or one more year of the failed economic policies that george bush has put in place
6577867 nearly all men can stand adversity but if you want to test a mans character give him power
6577868 vindicated i feel great i feel amazing i just won a gold medal
6577869 it was hard and this win wasnt just down to my goal
6577870 it was only achievable with the team we have and that we played for each other
6577871 but i feel stronger in the end i know it sounds crazy but im glad i went though it i learned a lot about myself
6577872 i asked two questions do you want to win yes do you need goalkeepers to win yes
6577873 we had to move on and this day you could see that we did it
6577874 this is such a reward for nine months of hard hard work and soul searching after the world cup
6577875 i have no idea why we cant win a final
6577876 its something im gonna keep asking myself for a long time you keep asking what you did wrong
6577877 again we had a chance to win the gold and again we let it slip away its hard to say why that keeps happening to us
6577878 we are not looking at the results but on how we play
6577879 soccer is not a matter of 1 0 or 2 0 its the way to find out the rhythm the match against norway is our key point in the tournament we found out our weak points and improved it thats why we stand here with the gold medal
6577880 i think i was leaning to my left waiting to dive to the left because the whole goal was open
6577881 and she ended up going right and i luckily kept some of my weight on the right
6577882 i dont understand why the ball wouldnt go in in so many games before we were able to score easily but today it wasnt the case
6577883 i just knew that i had to keep it low strike it hard and it went in
6577884 we said dont worry about making mistakes just go out there and play with confidence and be brave you could feel it every minute of that second half and in overtime we felt strong

6577886 a phrase in the three sentence draft statement that would have required both sides to renounce the use of force
6577887 despite the fact that he is adored in the west as an architect of democracy and credited with ending the cold war georgians cannot bear their president
6577888 get out of georgia we dont want trouble here shevardnadze is our friend
6577889 loudly proclaiming its support for georgias territorial integrity in the battle with russia over georgias separatist enclaves
6577890 may have felt that his military after several years of u s sponsored training and rearmament was now capable of routing the ossetian separatists bandits in the official parlance and neutralizing the russian peacekeepers
6577891 immediately transform the conflict into a direct confrontation between a democratic david and an autocratic goliath making sure the sympathy of the western world would be mobilized for georgia
6577892 at the end of the day that the west would come to his assistance if he got into trouble
6577893 pupils personal development including their spiritual moral social and cultural development is outstanding
6577894 not really we are jubilant its a triumph a fantastic day for summerhill the government has persistently refused to acknowledge the individual philosophy of the school such as that children can learn just as well out of the classroom we feel vindicated
6577895 it was tense before this latest inspection all the same though
6577896 we all have a say in how the school is run its like another family that takes care of you
6577897 you can do whatever you like as long as you are not affecting anyone else
6577898 the democratic process used to manage the running of the school provides pupils with outstanding opportunities for personal development
6577899 there is a growing movement towards child participatory types of education their words pave the way for others to copy our model its a recognition that it works on the other hand just as you think education is getting more humanised a government minister will say its all about performance performance performance ill always view them with deep suspicion
6577900 summerhill was an environment so isolated from the outside world that at times it was almost a childish illusion
6577901 everyone seemed to trust and respect each other there was nothing i had to do there was never a moment when i felt alone so i was able to be alone without being lonely nothing was there to prevent me from dealing with and sharing emotions of anger sadness or happiness
6577902 the democratic education we had made me aware of the need to behave responsibly and to problem solve tactfully
6577903 summerhill has prepared me well for a career in stage design i need to reflect emotionally on the storylines and to communicate well
6577904 ill never forget the schools dispute with the government i arrived in 1999 in the middle of it when summerhill was threatened with closure i could feel a huge anxiety coming from every corner of the school
6577905 i remember going back to my room at bedtime and sitting with my roommates sophie hester and natali we sat in a circle and cried we didnt want summerhill to close down who wants their home to be taken away
6577906 four years ago i didnt think it would happen but now i am pretty sure it will
6577907 i am definitely focusing on my own thing but in my opinion the phish thing is pretty likely at this point because people are so healthy and enthusiastic about it among the band members the vibe is really good
6577908 i dont know exactly but soon enough well have a better idea
6577909 come together to enrich the bands life and our life
6577910 you felt like watching phish perform was part of something you did together with the band thats unique in art and music

6577941 steve had dreams of being a great person like shakespeare and einstein who are well known throughout the centuries every time i would make a computer he would want to sell it and the fourth one was the apple ii
6577942 ive been at the bottom of org chart ever since apple started
6577943 i was employee number one i sometimes go into an apple store occasionally ask for the employee discount and they ask whats your number

6577946 the communists hold that fascism can be beaten by alliance with sections of the capitalist class
6577947 rather than releasing a totally new and updated standard this is a revision of 1

6577949 web alive will help businesses deal with one of the major drawbacks of most communication technologies today the ability to give users a real life experience that is more interactive and intuitive
6577950 i would say we have doubled the size of the uk office and added probably five new desks for our expansion but already were finding that too small
6577951 in the first year we did something like 500 000 and almost got to 1m and then it has doubled every year
6577952 we are running at about 5m for the uk and it is thought that next year we will be looking at about 6 5m
6577953 we are building up to a major september launch the uk sme market is just waking up to the efficiencies to be gained from inventory or stock control and asset management

6577955 so you might potentially make 120 per cent margin on wasp
6577956 weve been pumping and storing co2 underground in norway for more than 10 years but it is capturing the co2 that is the costly part of the process and the area where there is still some way to go technically
6577957 you need different chemicals depending on the type of fuel you are burning and you need to change the process and the technology
6577958 the flue gas from natural gas for example contains around six per cent co2 while that from coal can be 12 per cent so you need a different approach
6577959 just as britain invested in the north sea in the 1970s to transform our energy prospects through oil production we must today make a similar investment in renewable technologies to harness britains vast renewable energy resources combined with major reductions in energy consumption
6577960 a massive part of the problem with the governments energy strategy is that at the moment you have lots of different departments dealing with it and that results in some of the splits weve seen between berr and defra
6577961 thats why the olympic delivery model is so interesting because you have berr and the department of culture and sport working together on the project under one authority
6577962 the first question organisations need to answer is whether their turnover rates are outside the norm and need addressing

6577981 what weve seen in recent times is that the price of the australian sedans has increased by about 8 500 as a result of currency movements whereas the tariff is worth about 600

6577997 the main sticking points in fact are also the most delicate setting a timeline for american troops to leave and declaring whether american forces would be granted immunity from iraqi prosecution
6577998 discussions are ongoing we have made some progress in the recent days on an agreement with the iraqis but there is no final agreement yet we will continue to have these discussions with the iraqis
6577999 so its not a treaty so it would not require senate ratification or anything like that
6578000 its very premature at this point to say that we have an agreement
6578001 a flying visit to baghdad by dr rice which drew a scathing reaction from the anti us cleric hojatoleslam moqtada al sadr he accused washington of trying to pressure the iraqi authorities to bend to its will
6578002 we advise the arab leaders that iraq should return to the arab group the return of iraq is an essential goal

6578018 in most cases the infection is pretty mild people might not even be aware they have it
6578019 they might have a mild flu like illness maybe some mild abdominal pain and diarrhea
6578020 i think if people have eaten any of these foods but feel perfectly well they have nothing more to worry about and the vast vast majority of people who have eaten these products will not get sick
6578021 those would be the manifestations of the severe form of the disease when it happens and its fortunately not common but when it happens it can be a very serious life threatening disease
6578022 it can be as short as a few days but it can my be as long as a couple of months complicating investigation of an outbreak because its very difficult for people to remember what theyve eaten a few weeks or a few months before
6578023 and certainly the food they ingested weeks or months before is not likely to be around in order to do cultures to determine the source
6578024 biostar motherboards offer unparalleled value for money excellent features and consistently achieve great reviews for their award winning performance

6578049 discussions are ongoing we have made some progress in the recent days on an agreement with the iraqis but there is no final agreement yet we will continue to have these discussions with the iraqis
6578050 so its not a treaty so it would not require senate ratification or anything like that
6578051 its very premature at this point to say that we have an agreement

6578056 i have no doubt over the last eight weeks given some of the media articles we have suffered brand damage
6578057 that people read something and say this but a few days later they say well we understand that qantas has a great reputation
6578058 theres a perception now being created of a lot more problems with qantas than there is in reality

6578078 voters care a lot more about candidates personal ethics than about how many houses or residences or doghouses that john and cindy mccain own
6578079 the reality is that barack obama purchased his million dollar mansion in a shady deal involving a convicted felon and it raises questions about his ethics and judgment
6578080 when i bought the first one my husband who is not a beach person said oh this is such a waste of money the kids will never go
6578081 then it got to the point where they used it so much i couldnt get in the place so i bought another one
6578082 purchased for investment and are available for personal use by the mccain family
6578083 it wont go there today but certainly over the next two or three days we could see the australian dollar higher again
6578084 its more a weaker us dollar stronger commodities story than anything else

6578123 saying he wanted to kill himself doesnt make him nuts it doesnt make him crazy
6578124 its what people do when they dont want to let somebody go it doesnt surprise me at all that the mental health people let him go he wasnt crazy he was a stalker
6578125 officers who dont receive training dont know and dont understand the statute
6578126 they failed to realize this wasnt a mental health case
6578127 stalking is all about power it is all about control telling somebody if you leave me i will kill myself is the ultimate form of power and control it makes the victim feel responsibility for the other persons life
6578128 you have to ask probing questions and look at the overall picture
6578129 stalking is not a one time crime it is a pattern of behavior you a police officer may be sent to investigate a minor thing like my tire is slashed when you ask questions you may learn this has happened several times before
6578130 my husband keeps calling me and telling me hes going to kill himself im afraid to go there hes crazy i dont know whats going to happen because then i get freaked out like im going to be hurt but he does like stalk me at work

6578189 an ambassador is known for two things 1 the finesse of his diplomacy and 2 the depth of his comprehension of his governments purpose
6578190 first his king has absolute authority second he is sent not to favorable allies but to a kingdom in rebellion the most difficult of all diplomatic missions third his message is an authoritative demand to repent and be reconciled
6578191 it is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in the garden it grew and became a tree and the birds of the air made nests in its branches
6578192 herald announces an event the event is announced as true of course and in fact as very important for the hearers especially for those who have not heard it before if it were not true the herald would not be raining his or her voice yet no once is forced to believe what the herald reports is not permanent timeless logical insights but contingent particular events if those events are true and if others join the herald to carry the word along they will with time develop a doctrinal system to help distinguish between more and less adequate ways of proclaiming but that system those formulae will not become what they proclaim
6578193 the truth claim of the herald or witness must remain thus non coercive if it is to be valid you never have to believe it for that there are two reasons first because the message concerns a contingent particular event within the challengeable relativity of historical reporting it will always be possible to believe that the exodus and sinai or the resurrection and ascension did not happen but were imagine later or were misreported secondly you do not have to believe it because the herald has not clout he or she cannot bring it about that if you refuse to believe you must be destroyed or demoted in fact it is the herald who is vulnerable not a full citizen

6578200 we have been and are working closely with the obama campaign to make sure we have an exciting and unified convention
6578201 our delegate whips along with the obama delegate whips are a part of a team that will be on the floor of the convention to make sure delegates have everything they need whether thats answering questions or passing out signs during hillarys speech the whips are a traditional part of every conventions floor operations
6578202 they threw her up in the air when she came down she was hurt
6578203 the information we have is she went limp when she was caught
6578204 lauren died doing what she loved cheerleading and being with her friends
6578205 we hope her death will shed light on the inherent risks of cheerleading and we hope that additional safeguards are taken to insulate against those risks
6578206 the basic question that has to be asked is what is the role of the cheerleader
6578207 is cheerleading an activity that leads the spectators in cheers or is it a sport
6578208 if the answer is to entertain the crowd and to be in competition with other cheerleading squads then there must be safety guidelines initiated
6578209 do you know if he stayed up to watch the beach volleyball game last night
6578210 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6578211 most teachers hold themselves accountable they didnt go into teaching to make money they dont have seven houses
6578212 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6578213 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6578214 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6578215 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues

6578219 the problem is the police station is just office hours manned the community was really disturbed there is no police presence around and thats after hours and thats when the problem started
6578220 sly grogging is primarily the function of the police and they cannot get on top of it because their shifts at the most go to 11 oclock at night
6578221 the security company will be in liaison with the police because they have limited powers
6578222 that is one issue that will be a problem for us because they can just take reports and then they have to pass it on police to investigate the following day

6578226 every gun that is made every warship launched every rocket fired in a final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed those who are cold and are not clothed
6578227 a well regulated militia composed of the body of the people trained in arms is the best most natural defense of a free country
6578228 in this springtime of hope some lights seem eternal americas is
6578229 a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people
6578230 im a great believer in luck and i find the harder i work the more i have of it
6578231 government is not reason it is not eloquent it is force like fire it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master
6578232 those who want the government to regulate matters of the mind and spirit are like men who are so afraid of being murdered that they commit suicide to avoid assassination
6578233 arms in the hands of citizens may be used at individual discretion in private self defense
6578234 i find it could have been managed in fifty six
6578235 f you to which the attendant said ahh for that sir you will need to get back in line
6578236 my car has power locks and power windows and i was pushing the buttons to try to get out but nothing
6578237 i stopped pushing buttons and tried to figure out what else i could do when the doors suddenly unlocked and the window came down
6578238 that does not mean that we will never look to turn teams playing the ball in behind defences is a good way of stretching the game and allowing the team more space in which to pass the ball and when you have players with the pace of anthony thomas and mitchell cole you have to use the weapon of the space in behind

6578240 but the pleasure isnt owning the person the pleasure is this having another contender in the room with you
6578241 but we know thats not the case as you are a talker
6578242 surprise you should know this everytime we come here same story
6578243 we hit this everytime we come in and usually you all clean it out and tell us to make sure we let the warm sudsy bath water soak in her ear while in the tub which we do
6578244 shove some dial soap up your ass that should fix ya
6578245 the hardest part i think is the recognition of the mundanity of your own life its all very well to have a mundane life when youre just living it yourself you know the fact that you wanna go get up and xerox something the fact that you you know wanna go grab another cup of coffee and thats fine when youre doing it in your own mind but when someone else is observing you doing it you realize what a waste
6578246 punches in bunches stay off the ropes move your head hands up
6578247 this camp has been a little bit different for joel he is a little more intense and focused than past camps hes been a pro for a long time so he trains the same way every time but this camp he is more dedicated more intense and training really hard for marquez
6578248 joel has fought guys that were as good and well proven as marquez in the past marquez is a great fighter but so is joel he is preparing like he normally does against a great fighter he doesnt get nervous or over excited or anxious its just a fight for him this is his job and he is doing what he has to do to be prepared for september 13th
6578249 the trick is to eat but not over eat so you have to control portions joel eats very well three maybe four times a day and if im not looking maybe five the trainer said with a wink i dont believe in starving fighters i started cooking at training camp because it was cheaper for me to cook than to hire a chef i dont cook really fancy i just cook simple meals that are healthy joel really likes chicken salmon steamed vegetables and once in a while i make pasta but i only use whole wheat or brown rice pasta we dont eat any junk food just a clean diet because he has to burn more calories than he takes in
6578250 weve been watching films and marquez is an excellent fighter i think its going to be a great fight joels weight is good training is good but we dont want to be on weight too soon because i like to have my fighters be able to eat right up until the time of the weigh in and bring them down slowly
6578251 we have been working really hard in the gym juan has been lifting more weights to focus on gaining strength and muscle we have changed his diet as well he has been eating more carbohydrates to gain the extra weight moving up in weight is a very difficult process for juan because he is a natural 126 pound fighter and normally fights at 130 pounds so he is going up even more the weight is definitely an advantage for casamayor because after the weigh in juan will not gain that much weight he will probably fight around 142 pounds at the most and casamayor will definitely go up more than that
6578252 we have a different relationship than i have with my other fighters it is more than just fighter and trainer he is more than just my fighter juan is one of my best friends my job is to prevent mistakes for juan so i am being very careful with his diet and his training to make sure he is 100 percent ready so that nothing will go wrong on september 13th
6578253 camp is going well and he is working hard as usual were always confident that we will be successful in a fight because we put so much into our preparation and know it will pay off in the end we like to cover the bases so that theres nothing left for us to be surprised with when we get into the ring with our opponent
6578254 basically we are doing some of the things we worked on in preparation for the first fight only this time around with a lot of practice were able to do them better i think vernon will bring more pressure so were definitely going to be pulling out some new moves
6578255 our relationship is like a triangle we all have our own strengths so each one of us takes care of our own corner and it just works were like a pyramid
6578256 i dont mind coming to atlanta because that is what vernon wanted and it fit my schedule i think psychologically its good for vernon too as he was away from home too long for his last camp and probably suffered from some emotional burnout besides its not too far from florida and i go home on the weekends it sure beats going to california which i absolutely will never do again mcgirt travelled to big bear california to train fernando vargas for his fight against fitz vanderpool in 2003 and returned to another california camp in 2006 to train joel casamayor for his second fight with diego corrales my comfort zone is the east coast
6578257 i turned pro on january 17 1976 and on january 18 i knew i wanted to be a trainer
6578258 even when i was fighting i was always in the gym helping amateurs when people ask me if i think i was a better fighter or trainer i lean towards trainer although most say fighter because i was a world champion because i love teaching and helping people working with fighters is my passion it gives me great satisfaction watching them succeed
6578259 listen the fighters say there is nothing to do in vero but vernons got me out here in the middle of nowhere
6578260 it is so dark at night that i am afraid of being outside by myself i have to ride around in my car if i want to smoke a cigar
6578261 the most devastating thing for a fighter is to lose to a guy you know you should never have lost to in the first place
6578262 that alone lights a fire inside of you my job is to maintain that fire inside of vernon and make sure that it doesnt ignite to a five alarm disaster or on the flip side burn out entirely we dont talk much about the first fight if he brings it up cool but it is not necessary to dwell on what happened i just have to get him ready to not let it happen again and for vernon whose boxing skills and experience have proven themselves to be superior to moras skills it is keeping him mentally relaxed up until fight time that counts the most
6578263 for his first fight against mora vernon was in camp too long almost three months he over trained and peaked early there were days when he should have taken off and he did something anyway whether running an extra mile or shadow boxing a few rounds when vernon beat picirillo and baldomir he had six week camps for both fights and he looked great we have a set plan and schedule now and he is sticking to it which makes my job that much easier
6578264 i get a different kind of nervous feeling when my son fights than when the other fighters i work with get in the ring with my son its as if i am getting in the ring with him and i almost get the same feeling as when i was fighting but whether it is fighting training or training my son the same thing happens every time once the bell rings the nervousness is gone and it is time to fight
6578265 i am a girl i have a blog therefore i have an opinion on the satc movie
6578266 i cant believe that millions of women including us are paying for this
6578267 i will sing of the lords great love forever with my mouth i will make your faithfulness known through all generations

6578282 hopefully a bigger and stronger digitallife will return in 2009
6578283 as the states financial contributions to higher education are lessened the need for private support grows increasingly strong
6578284 we like to think of ourselves as on the cutting edge of safety
6578285 the initial response should be going after the shooter and bypassing anybody whos injured because we have to stop further harm
6578286 it was nice to see the second team thought more tactically
6578287 it may not be correct to train that way when its not realistic
6578288 we need to make sure theyre capable of being flexible
6578289 be prepared to share second degree cooties with someone who wrote himself a movie role where he is fully frontally nude and also is obsessed with muppets
6578290 ah but a human would have simply observed the potential qualities that might deem them narcissistic and admit that perhaps they tend to struggle with these aspects yet strive to remain true humble and giving but the narcissist is forever in denial cultivating their fragments of shattered reflections to convey illusions to your brethren you are drowning
6578291 yes i would like to receive such information and offers only from degree deodorant
6578292 how do you get to be a cfo without understanding the value of a couple hundred dollars
6578293 i put it on my bookshelf next to 2007 2006 and 2005 notebooks
6578294 did you use any of those notebooks to lead the company to set direction measure results and focus team members activities
6578295 desde diciembre del 85 a junio del 86 fueron meses m s que de actividades de pensar reflexionar y orar tambi n de sufrir el marco humano de todo esto fue la familia de mi hermano llevaba a os en el paro pero iba adelante all me refugi y me acogieron con todo cari o me acompa aban me mimaban procuraban animarme si no hubiera sido por ellos puede ser que me hubiera destrozado y cuando ni la oraci n y trato con dios ni el amor de mi familia lograban sacarme del pozo en el que estaba hundido entonces tomaba un autob s llegaba hasta el pueblo costero de mazag n me bajaba y hac a los 19 kil metros de vuelta andando de este modo me desfogaba me aquietaba me cansaba f sicamente y luego con una ducha me sent a como nuevo que tuviera que hacer esto casi d a por medio es la se al m s evidente de lo mal que estaba

6578298 web 2 0 the guy behind the oreilly publishing empire whose books most of us internet geeks own at least a few of
6578299 they set the sentences for july 30 because theyre trying to avoid the appearance that this has to do with the protest permit but thats all that this is about
6578300 the resolution of these protests were through dialogue and communication
6578301 this is the way we like to deal with things in chinese culture chinese culture always emphasizes harmony
6578302 these new protest parks are really old wine in new bottles
6578303 you get two results you either dont get permission or youre intimidated into withdrawing your application
6578304 our position is that the responsibility for the order for which our clients are being prosecuted has not been established
6578305 there is no proof at all that they knew that their men were going to shoot these clergymen

6578307 we have been and are working closely with the obama campaign to make sure we have an exciting and unified convention
6578308 our delegate whips along with the obama delegate whips are a part of a team that will be on the floor of the convention to make sure delegates have everything they need whether thats answering questions or passing out signs during hillarys speech the whips are a traditional part of every conventions floor operations
6578309 these actions would ensure that low power auxiliary operations do not cause harmful interference to new public safety and commercial wireless services in the band

6578312 xbox is a natural partner to help us reach out to youth voters

6578316 im big and beautiful and doing my best to keep my stress levels down so i can stay healthy
6578317 thats big not lazy not a glutton and certainly not deserving of the pompous poisonous disrespect served up daily to those of us with more bounce to the ounce
6578318 the state will feel good about itself for offering something and the person of size will end up paying 300 a year for the bad luck of having a chronic disease his her state sponsored insurance program failed to cover in an appropriate and meaningful fashion

6578320 vancouver is a year and a half away you have to have heart soul and mind to be in the olympics ive left all doors open

6578322 when i pulled up a crowd of people surrounded the car and stared as if they were seeing extraterrestrial beings

6578324 my daughter took the right decision at the right time
6578325 the piece was sent to advertising agencies direct marketers large businesses with those in house types of titles and last but not least the printing industry
6578326 the ncaa has graciously agreed to take another look at this case
6578327 if this matter is not resolved via the ncaas administrative process
6578328 in the conversion path thats not good but should those readers be looking for additional information elsewhere you want to make it available
6578329 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6578330 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6578331 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6578332 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6578333 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6578334 the chinese army again fired on a crowd on monday august 18 in the kham region in eastern tibet
6578335 he clearly stated that we had no specific information on the number of casualties
6578336 we have been told that there have been casualties but we are not able to verify what casualties means whether people have been killed or whether they have been injured
6578337 reliable witnesses say that 400 people have been killed in the region of the tibetan capital lhasa alone
6578338 killed by bullets even though they were protesting without weapons their bodies were never given back to their families if you consider the whole of tibet the number of victims is obviously higher
6578339 ten thousand people have been arrested we dont know where they are imprisoned
6578340 a project of long term brutal repression is under way
6578341 but we were quickly disillusioned our envoys came up against a wall there was no opening

6578346 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

6578352 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6578353 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6578354 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6578355 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6578356 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6578357 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6578358 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6578359 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6578360 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6578361 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6578362 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6578363 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6578364 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6578365 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6578366 so that in humility and constancy with perseverance to the end i may know god in this vocation whereunto though unworthy i am called
6578367 i have on my feet some bells that remind me when i walk who i am and to whom i belong i have never heard sweeter music than this
6578368 the plain reason of our standing here is religion not treason
6578369 this very day which is the festival of st andrew i was informed by superior authority that tomorrow i was to end the course of this life god grant that i may do it to the imitation of this noble apostle and servant of god and that with joy i may say rising off the hurdle salve sancta crux
6578370 my sins are great i confess but i flee to gods mercy my negligences are without number i grant but i appeal to my redeemers clemency i have no boldness but in his blood his bitter passion is my only consolation
6578371 god grant us both his grace and blessing until the end that living in his great fear and dying in his favour we may enjoy the other for ever salute all my fellow catholics and so without further troubling you my sweetest benefactor farewell
6578372 i am innocent of any such crime i have no occasion to tell a lie it is a case where my soul is at stake
6578373 if to be a catolic only if to be a perfect catholic be to be a trator then i am a traitor
6578374 we are so a stuff white people like post right now
6578375 a home for collecting and communicating your daily data begin tracking anything you can count and display the results immediately or just look around and see what other members are recording
6578376 it was great of the president to speak about the issue
6578377 dont fear resist and do not compromise on that it is a danger not only to the believers but to the whole of africa it is bad if our children become complacent and think that people who are not in order are alright
6578378 when he speaks in this manner to the bishops it will energise the resolve against homosexuality
6578379 the anglican church is facing significant challenges but i would like to assure you that the church is steady
6578380 it was great of the president to speak about the issue
6578381 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

6578383 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6578384 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations

6578400 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6578401 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6578402 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6578403 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6578404 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

6578420 ho pensato che quando si incontra una persona quellincontro crea cose nuove d vita a pensieri riflessioni sentimenti azioni che appartengono solo alle due persone che si sono incontrate lamore che circola tra loro deve essere sempre vissuto tutto in ogni momento fino in fondo perch lamore quando circola quando viene vissuto leggero e fa sentire leggeri ma se viene bloccato se non lo si vive diventa piombo

6578428 how does the system work that led me to have an orientation to ask hardheaded questions during my formative years there was still ideological competition between a social democratic or even socialist agenda and a free market milton friedman agenda i think it was natural for me to ask questions of both sides and maybe try to synthesize approaches
6578429 reagans central insight that the liberal welfare state had grown complacent and overly bureaucratic with democratic policy makers more obsessed with slicing the economic pie than with growing that pie contained a good deal of truth
6578430 i like to think of him as a university of chicago democrat

6578433 we have found that most violations stem from a few common mistakes that can be for the most part easily avoided
6578434 we hope to educate the community of commercial distributors redistributors and resellers on how to avoid violations in the first place and to respond adequately and appropriately when a violation occurs
6578435 too many software projects rely on only one or a very few team members who know how to build and assemble the final released product
6578436 such knowledge centralization not only creates engineering redundancy issues but it also endangers gpl compliance which requires you to provide build scripts
6578437 this is dallas countys first good look at lowell cannaday the dallas county republican party and the type of campaign theyre going to run and its not pretty while sheriff valdez has been working tirelessly to save taxpayer money without compromising public safety the dallas county gop and lowell cannaday have been shopping for a chicken costume the sheriff is scheduled for four joint public events with mr cannaday which are even listed on cannadays own website this desperate and dishonest stunt is beneath anycandidate for office and lowell cannaday should be ashamed dallas countyvoters deserve better than this from a candidate for sheriff mr cannaday owesdallas voters an apology
6578438 lowell cannaday and dallas republicans have proven again that when you get caught in a lie your chicken comes home to roost
6578439 before wasting time with chicken costumes the dallas county gop and lowell cannaday should have taken the time to review their own campaign schedule which includes four debates with sheriff valdez

6578445 people most in need of a clear and explicit warning regarding ssl certificates are inexperienced users and those are not very likely to understand the error message that firefox 3 is displaying a large portion will simply be scared away thinking that the web site is broken

6578449 i have a couple of numbers for you the first number is the undertakers dealing with the body
6578450 at that point i believed one of my family was dead i said what happened whats going on but they put the phone down on me
6578451 then after 10 seconds they rang again to say it was a mistake
6578452 obviously to emirates putting a family through absolute hell is worth nothing it is an unbelievable feeling to think one of your loved ones has died
6578453 it is important the we do not impede on a womans right to choose having an abortion is a very personal issue this is why i believe it must be legalized yet monitored closely and not a procedure that is encouraged
6578454 if you look at the nations that made abortion illegal after it had been legal for years now those countries are loaded with homeless children whom are raped sold murdered they steal and prostitute themselves all so they can manage to live the stories are repeated over and over in brazil and romania we cannot let this happen in the us this is why abortion must remain a legal procedure we cannot put the burden on the unwanted child that is a fate worse than death
6578455 chanel spends the day with mops brooms and vacuums hard work is rewarded with cupcakes and sprinkles
6578456 i am very happy with the new layout of the game its features and the tourney structures
6578457 the tourneys are password protected meaning affiliates have to create a new account or log into their existing one in order to obtain the password which not only drives in new affiliates but significantly increases activity from both old and new affiliates
6578458 as always these tourneys are designed to increase exposure and productivity to our sponsors while providing a source of entertainment for the industry
6578459 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6578460 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6578461 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6578462 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

6578465 dont make em like that anymore can i interest you in a new oven sir
6578466 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6578467 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6578468 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6578469 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6578470 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6578471 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6578472 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6578473 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6578474 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6578475 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6578476 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6578477 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6578478 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6578479 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6578480 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6578481 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6578482 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6578483 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6578484 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6578485 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6578486 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6578487 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6578488 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6578489 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6578490 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6578491 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6578492 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6578493 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6578494 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6578495 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6578496 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6578497 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6578498 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6578499 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6578500 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6578501 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6578502 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6578503 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6578504 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6578505 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6578506 who are open to doing something on the production side
6578507 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6578508 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6578509 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6578510 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6578511 according to materialists beliefs along with the rest of mental life are caused or determined by neurophysiology by what goes on in the brain and nervous system neurophysiology furthermore also causes behavior according to the usual story electrical signals proceed via afferent nerves from the sense organs to the brain there some processing goes on then electrical impulses go via efferent nerves from the brain to other organs including muscles in response to these signals certain muscles contract thus causing movement and behavior now what evolution tells us supposing it tells us the truth is that our behavior perhaps more exactly the behavior of our ancestors is adaptive since the members of our species have survived and reproduced the behavior of our ancestors was conducive in their environment to survival and reproduction therefore the neurophysiology that caused that behavior was also adaptive we can sensibly suppose that it is still adaptive what evolution tells us therefore is that our kind of neurophysiology promotes or causes adaptive behavior the kind of behavior that issues in survival and reproduction now this same neurophysiology according to the materialist also causes belief but while evolution natural selection rewards adaptive behavior rewards it with survival and reproduction and penalizes maladaptive behavior it doesnt as such care a fig about true belief we must suppose therefore that the belief in question is about as likely to be false as to be true the probability of any particular beliefs being true is in the neighborhood of 1 2 but then it is massively unlikely that the cognitive faculties of these creatures produce the preponderance of true beliefs over false required by reliability if i have 1 000 independent beliefs for example and the probability of any particular beliefs being true is 1 2 then the probability that 3 4 or more of these beliefs are true certainly a modest enough requirement for reliability will be less than 10 58 and even if i am running a modest epistemic establishment of only 100 beliefs the probability that 3 4 of them are true given that the probability of any ones being true is 1 2 is very low something like 000001 7 so the chances that these creatures true beliefs substantially outnumber their false beliefs even in a particular area are small the conclusion to be drawn is that it is exceedingly unlikely that their cognitive faculties are reliable but of course this same argument will also hold for us if evolutionary naturalism is true then the probability that our cognitive faculties are reliable is also very low and that means that one who accepts evolutionary naturalism has a defeater for the belief that her cognitive faculties are reliable a reason for giving up that belief for rejecting it for no longer holding it if there isnt a defeater for that defeater a defeater defeater we could say she cant rationally believe that her cognitive faculties are reliable no doubt she cant help believing that they are no doubt she will in fact continue to believe it but that belief will be irrational and if she has a defeater for the reliability of her cognitive faculties she also has a defeater for any belief she takes to be produced by those faculties which of course is all of her beliefs if she cant trust her cognitive faculties she has a reason with respect to each of her beliefs to give it up she is therefore enmeshed in a deep and bottomless skepticism one of her beliefs however is her belief in evolutionary naturalism itself so then she also has a defeater for that belief evolutionary naturalism therefore the belief in the combination of naturalism and evolution is self refuting self destructive shoots itself in the foot therefore you cant rationally accept it for all this argument shows it may be true but it is irrational to hold it so the argument isnt an argument for the falsehood of evolutionary naturalism it is instead for the conclusion that one cannot rationally believe that proposition evolution therefore far from supporting naturalism is incompatible with it in the sense that you cant rationally believe them both

6578531 the plane was wobbling from one side to another then i began to suspect we would crash i dont know what happened next i was in a sort of river and saw people smoke explosions which i think woke me up
6578532 we are not in the mood of slamming the door shut
6578533 russia needs bilateral cooperation to a no greater degree than nato i believe that our nato partners need support from russia including that for its operation in afghanistan and to a far bigger extent
6578534 as any contacts with that organization would help solve a series of major problems
6578535 attack cindy she owns the homes i thought he said the wives were off limits
6578536 people are finally realizing that this russian situation has the potential to be bad for a very long time
6578537 the russians have shown evidence that theyre willing to cut off energy supplies to advance their aims there is concern that they are now going to be much more assertive in that area
6578538 if military activity heats up again pipeline flows into europe could be disrupted and that would affect the united states as well
6578539 this is probably about it in terms of a retail gas drop we may be a few cents away from the august bottom
6578540 the slide in the dollar has taken some of the wind out of the bears sail in the energy complex

6578542 you train your whole life and you want to win you dont expect to lose
6578543 you dont want it to end this way but its all we could do
6578544 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us

6578550 vindicated i feel great i feel amazing i just won a gold medal
6578551 it was hard and this win wasnt just down to my goal
6578552 it was only achievable with the team we have and that we played for each other
6578553 but i feel stronger in the end i know it sounds crazy but im glad i went though it i learned a lot about myself
6578554 i asked two questions do you want to win yes do you need goalkeepers to win yes
6578555 we had to move on and this day you could see that we did it
6578556 this is such a reward for nine months of hard hard work and soul searching after the world cup
6578557 i have no idea why we cant win a final
6578558 its something im gonna keep asking myself for a long time you keep asking what you did wrong
6578559 again we had a chance to win the gold and again we let it slip away its hard to say why that keeps happening to us
6578560 we are not looking at the results but on how we play
6578561 soccer is not a matter of 1 0 or 2 0 its the way to find out the rhythm the match against norway is our key point in the tournament we found out our weak points and improved it thats why we stand here with the gold medal
6578562 i think i was leaning to my left waiting to dive to the left because the whole goal was open
6578563 and she ended up going right and i luckily kept some of my weight on the right
6578564 i dont understand why the ball wouldnt go in in so many games before we were able to score easily but today it wasnt the case
6578565 i just knew that i had to keep it low strike it hard and it went in
6578566 we said dont worry about making mistakes just go out there and play with confidence and be brave you could feel it every minute of that second half and in overtime we felt strong
6578567 bust an arm or leg and the knitting bones sealed in a wrap of calcium so its stronger than before

6578581 when you have something thats growing this quickly and is providing this much value in the world thats just not the right thing to consider
6578582 you articulated a compelling vision for facebook as an independent company can you envision a in which facebook would be acquired and if so what would that be
6578583 when you have something thats growing this quickly and is providing this much value in the world thats just not the right thing to consider
6578584 freezes and dispenses a layer of cider not water to top the draught beverage
6578585 we have an industry driven board guiding the direction of the center
6578586 what we were setting out to do with many flags
6578587 the thomaston communitys support of education in this facility has been overwhelming
6578588 i hope this is just a start of the many flags project
6578589 is going to fix part of what is broken for us
6578590 llevaba seis a os preso entonces conoc a dos presos pol ticos en la prisi n de quivic n los admir por su postura y por la forma con que se comportaban con la poblaci n penal com n ellos ense aban y yo me acerqu comprend que los que eran verdaderamente guapos valientes eran los presos pol ticos los que luchaban y compart an el ideal de la libertad cuando sal de la c rcel en 1999 tom una decisi n si volv a a la c rcel ser a por ser como ellos yo ten a que crecerme para ser un luchador por la libertad como ant nez lo sigo intentando
6578591 im going to let the campaign speak for the campaign
6578592 if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6578593 were delighted to have a debate on judgment with barack obama who bought his own million dollar mansion in a shady deal with a convicted felon sen obama is obviously frustrated and abandoning his politics of hope for negative personal attacks
6578594 i will put my judgment on foreign policy over the last five years against john mccains anytime anytime
6578595 i think an objective analysis would say ive been right a lot more than he has for all his years in washington
6578596 we also had to write an accompanying report that deconstructed everything in the movie and how it helped the environment
6578597 a violent education corporal punishment of children in u s public schools
6578598 every public school needs effective methods of discipline but beating kids teaches violence and it doesnt stop bad behavior
6578599 corporal punishment discourages learning fails to deter future misbehavior and at times even provokes it
6578600 minority students in public schools already face barriers to success
6578601 by exposing these children to disproportionate rates of corporal punishment schools create a hostile environment in which these students may struggle even more
6578602 he took me into the office and gave me three licks he made me hold onto the wall and he paddled me it hurt for about two hours it felt like fire under my butt
6578603 the other kids were watching and laughing it made me want to fight them when you get a paddling and you see everyone laugh at you it make you mad and you want to do something about it
6578604 what made me so angry hes three years old he was petrified he didnt want to go back to school and he didnt want to start his new school i was so worried that this was going to constantly be with him equating going to school with being paddled
6578605 i went into the principals office he gave me a chair and said hold onto the chair the paddle had holes in it then he just did three swats i was hit on my buttocks there were holes in the paddle to make it go faster it hurt very much there were definitely red marks and then swelling almost welt like markings it didnt last for more than a couple days it left me feeling very humiliated i think there were several levels of emotion physical pain mental humiliation and being a female at that age it was like there was this older man hitting me on the butt thats weird even at that age i knew it was inappropriate
6578606 ive heard this said at my school and at other schools this child should get less whips itll leave marks students that are dark skinned it takes more to let their skin be bruised even with all black students there is an imbalance darker skinned students get worse punishment
6578607 i see corporal punishment as a form of slavery beating on the slaves was how the headman got them to do something were focused so much on making kids do what we want think about the mental capacity that this kind of treatment leaves our children with we are telling them we dont respect them they leave that principals office and they think they dont consider me a human being that young person loses self respect
6578608 a violent education corporal punishment of children in u s public schools
6578609 i am pleased with our growth in revenue and income during this year customer demand for medical sterilization continues to grow and there is increasing interest in food irradiation the company remains well positioned to take advantage of that interest as food producers recognize the food safety benefits of irradiation
6578610 because apple went to lunch with the schools ibm went to lunch with the companies and atari didnt go to lunch with anybody
6578611 if you care about protecting a womans right to choose and preventing the supreme court from becoming even more of a tool for right wing ideology then barack obama is your candidate and must be our president
6578612 we may have started off on two different paths but we are on one journey now
6578613 and that is a journey that will lead us to the white house on jan 20 2009
6578614 i have done more for senator obama in the last two months than anybody in my position has ever done for a winning nominee and im very proud of that
6578615 the problem we have is that as we understand it and based upon the evidence that ive seen is that they circulated these petitions with etzels name never intending her to be the candidate
6578616 they went to the convention nominated barr and then she withdrew
6578617 we have a horrible problem in this state with voter fraud
6578618 this move by the mccain campaign completely contradicts everything john mccain stood for in 2000 when his competitors were trying to keep him off the ballot
6578619 mccain has become a part of the same corrupted machine he spoke vehemently against only eight years ago
6578620 of course when youre training your whole life to get to the olympics you train for gold

6578623 this is the iraqi governments view and what the government wants
6578624 well have agreement when we have agreement so all of those stories in the newspapers about what the agreement says probably ought to be disregarded until we have an agreement
6578625 there are dates which will depend on the situation on the ground and the decisions of the iraqi government according to security developments and according to the need of the iraqis
6578626 the president and every american wants to see american troops come home but not until the job is done and there is more security more political progress and more economic progress inside iraq
6578627 today condoleezza rice the occupation foreign secretary arrived in iraq to try to put pressure on the government of iraq to accept terms dictated by the occupation to sign this ominous treaty
6578628 he is still alive and hes in very poor condition
6578629 we had expert advice that the animal probably would not make it through the night
6578630 it was suffering extremely so weve had to make the very difficult decision
6578631 its a really tragic result from an operation that people worked really really hard for
6578632 theres no way that the logistics of feeding that animal by hand or in an aquarium is going to work
6578633 there are too many difficulties with it and the animal first of all has to be convinced to eat out of a tube its got to get to an aquarium and then youve got to find a product for it to eat which you can supply for probably a year so i think for humans to try and keep it alive is just going to end up as a disaster
6578634 there were four cookie cutter shark bites in it and that has most likely occurred while it was out in the open water its just another thing that compounds the whole problem
6578635 i know you cant tell but they actually do im a real redhead from the hair on my head to the pubes on my pussy but since its bikini season i shaved them all off after this barbeque im gonna skinny dip in the pool so i wanted my slit to be nice and smooth not only does it look pretty shaved but it feels awesome when the cold water touches my bare lips
6578636 who cares i want to get naked if they talk crap about me its just cause theyre jealous most of the people here know i can be a little wild anyway im an exhibitionist and half of my friends have seen me naked some people think thats slutty of me but i think they secretly wish they could be as comfortable in their skin as i am in mine i look good and i enjoy being naked so why not and my pussy needs some room to breathe too it gets suffocated from being trapped in my tight little panties all day long
6578637 do not underestimate the wit or endurance of your opponent
6578638 there arent too many authors of note who have passed through l a in the last three decades whom connie hasnt interviewed and interviewed well
6578639 this inherently transdisciplinary archive will provide material for research projects for generations of scholars and students
6578640 digitizing these tapes will give students and others an opportunity to hear and watch these outstanding authors for themselves whenever they want
6578641 seeing authors up close like this provides a rich point of view to their work
6578642 drucker believed that a healthy society is run by organizations whose values are shaped by a wide range of disciplines history sociology psychology culture and religion
6578643 in fact drucker once described management books as dreadful trash and suggested that he derived much of his philosophy from novelists such as austen balzac and others
6578644 is a beautiful setting for the tapes to call home

6578650 no es necesario ser muy agudo para presumir con fundamento que los ataques frontales contra codelco buscan generar una opini n p blica contraria a la continuidad de la corporaci n como una empresa 100 del estado
6578651 expresamos nuestro m s categ rico rechazo al car cter sesgado y arbitrario del programa emitido por chilevisi n cuya propiedad pertenece al candidato de la derecha sebasti n pi era quien se ha manifestado favorable a la privatizaci n parcial de codelco chile una vez m s se comprueba la incestuosa relaci n entre los negocios y la pol tica
6578652 no es necesario ser muy agudo para presumir con fundamento que los ataques frontales contra codelco buscan generar una opini n p blica contraria a la continuidad de la corporaci n como una empresa 100 del estado tal como lo hemos reiterado en otras oportunidades la generaci n de una imagen de empresa estructuralmente corrupta ineficiente desordenada y fuera de control es un camino que conduce directamente a su privatizaci n
6578653 ha luchado para que codelco se consolide como una empresa eficiente socialmente responsable proba transparente y competitiva defendiendo su liderazgo en la industria mundial del cobre
6578654 como estamos ciertos que ninguna empresa o actividad humana esta exenta de ser objeto de actos corruptos contrarios a la ley y a sus normativas internas es que en nuestro ltimo congreso nacional ordinario acordamos un mecanismo para canalizar cualquier denuncia fundada sobre actos deshonestos que da en el patrimonio de codelco
6578655 molesta el aprovechamiento pol tico que se busca hacer de codelco pasando por alto hechos objetivos e irrefutables la empresa es dirigida por jos pablo arellano quien es reconocido por todos los actores pol ticos del pa s como una persona con una trayectoria intachable y contraria a cualquier acto de corrupci n el mismo comit de auditoria lo encabeza un director independiente de la administraci n y del gobierno nicol s majluf quien es un destacado acad mico y director de empresas por lo que da plena garant as respecto a las medidas de control interno y a la contrataci n con los m s altos est ndares exigidos a los auditores externos
6578656 aparte de eso codelco es fiscalizada por la superintendencia de valores y seguros la comisi n chilena del cobre y la propia contralor a general de la rep blica cuando ha sido requerida a lo anterior se agregan todas las comisiones investigadoras que se han generado por la c mara de diputados quienes han tenido la tarea de investigar los mismos hechos que denuncia el citado programa de tv llegando recientemente la ltima comisi n investigadora de costos a un informes final consensuado el cual cont en la sala con un amplio respaldo en la c mara por parte del oficialismo y de la oposici n
6578657 ahora aprovech ndose de este programa que se sustenta en gran parte en testimonios de personas que tienen juicios pendientes con codelco se les ocurre que es necesario involucrar a la presidenta de la rep blica para que ella contrate una auditor a internacional realmente no existe una explicaci n l gica m s que un burdo aprovechamiento pol tico funcional al desprestigio de codelco para minar el abrumador apoyo que tiene en la ciudadan a la defensa de codelco como una empresa 100 del estado
6578658 respalda plenamente a la administraci n superior de codelco para que act e con todos los medios legales a su alcance para defender el prestigio y la reputaci n corporativa de la principal empresa de todos los chilenos la reputaci n es un activo intangible de gran valor para cualquier empresa por lo que es un deber ineludible defenderlo ante ataques sesgados y carentes de fundamentos s lidos

6578663 it has molded him into the young man that he has become the coaches up here i mean it is like his second home
6578664 were really excited about the olympics because there are not a lot of athletes from our school that have made it that far
6578665 very excited very very proud that someone from this school is going to represent the alabama school for the deaf that means so much for our school
6578666 im really very honored to go to taiwan im a little nervous too because its very hard for a deaf athlete to get to this point especially from this state
6578667 we look around at the berkowitz center and at all of the buildings that we have had here at the university and so much of whats happened is because of the private contributions of individuals such as the skandalaris family
6578668 i want to say this while im up here greg ianni and the team that put this building together i think you have outdone yourself
6578669 lou anna k simon had a saying when she took over as president and we really act it out here it is team msu part of the team msu that we are so proud of is that we are going to be cheering two marks this year we have an athletics director mark hollis who is just the best and when we were searching for a football coach mark hollis kept pushing back and saying there is one more person we need to interview that person has so much integrity and so much class that he wont even talk with us because he was so committed to the job that he had at cincinnati that in no way even though he wanted to come back here would he compromise his own integrity and what he stands for to talk with us until his season was completed so when i say we have a team of two marks one mark kept it alive so we could get the other mark that shows that you win with good people
6578670 when you talk about leadership you have to look at bob and julie skandalaris true friends very insightful the way they make you think is as appreciated as anything else youve given to me
6578671 as you look at this building i look at it in three ways
6578672 first off i would just like to welcome everyone here
6578673 the skandalaris center connects the past with the present one of the important things that i wanted to do when i came here was to connect all of the past spartans with the present and also have a vision for the future
6578674 when i came here i didnt even know a new facility was being built
6578675 thanks to mark hollis and all the things that he has done for the program since becoming the athletic director
6578676 the recruiting that this building will allow us to do it has already started and you can see that we already have 15 commitments for next years class they are outstanding football players outstanding young people and outstanding students and it makes a difference when they walk in and see the environment that they are going to work in
6578677 on behalf of otis wiley javon ringer brian hoyer and the rest of our teammates we would like to say thank you for your generosity and your donations for this building this is definitely a building of excellence and that is what this program and this team is going to strive for
6578678 i should tell you that we have had seven members of our family go here and graduate from here and part of the reason we always come back to campus is because of football weekends its a great weekend when we get to watch great young athletes like these guys it is just a great experience
6578679 i should say that this thing probably started 30 years ago when greg ianni and i were tracing around the halls of holden
6578680 i have to tell you that i have a picture of spartans as a hard working group
6578681 there are a few people that i would like to thank because they were more important to this project than we were
6578682 there are a lot of people involved in this project
6578683 last i just want to name one more family and that is the demmer family they have been in this community for so many years they have been spartan supporters and they are really the true spartans here to have their name associated with the hall of history is just a great thing for this university and their family and i would just like to thank the demmers for everything that they have done this program
6578684 we have a couple of tractors that went up my street sweeper does not look good at all and a lot of pickup trucks with a lot of damage the heat actually melted the beacon lights on the top and the tail lenses on the vehicles
6578685 we have to wait to release all of the equipment that we can work with but it will be alright

6578687 when you go down to the nitty gritty its warfare for souls that are living in darkness
6578688 its working its actually working and its actually growing by leaps and bounds
6578689 when you go down to the nitty gritty its warfare for souls that are living in darkness
6578690 it is more than just a dream it is a miracle america contains the best things of many nations
6578691 give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free
6578692 what i like about america is that the people are friendly and always helping each other
6578693 we are basically their parents when they come to boise
6578694 we meet them at the airport we take them to an apartment that weve already furnished with donated furniture and food
6578695 it is more than just a dream it is a miracle
6578696 one of the reasons that the public schools in the city have gotten better is because the charter schools exist
6578697 i can tell you one of the reasons that the public schools in the city have gotten better is because the charter schools exist and give parents an alternative and let parents see that you can do something better
6578698 more and more labs are showing that people have the sensitivity for skills that we thought were only expert skills
6578699 it turns out that mere exposure makes an enormous contribution to how musical competence develops
6578700 more and more labs are showing that people have the sensitivity for skills that we thought were only expert skills
6578701 it turns out that mere exposure makes an enormous contribution to how musical competence develops
6578702 i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6578703 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6578704 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6578705 when asked how many houses he owns mccain lost track he couldnt remember its seven
6578706 he couldnt count high enough apparently to even know how many houses he owned
6578707 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
6578708 i cant say enough for everybody pulling together and picking each other up when we needed too
6578709 there are some teams that let each other kind of hangout there alone and our team kind of came back and went out there as a team i cant do it alone and neither can anyone else so i am proud of everybody coming out to play big and play hard like that
6578710 its all about dispelling some of the mystique of competing at the olympic games
6578711 for example taking a group of young amateur boxers to the boxing venue to experience what it is like to have 13 000 people in the crowd is something unprecedented the more we can do to prepare people for that sort of environment the better
6578712 atlanta was my first games and it was but both daunting and exciting
6578713 but once you get past the initial feeling of being star struck and overwhelmed it has to be back to business as usual
6578714 and i dont believe hell was the actual word used lol
6578715 able autistic individuals can rise to eminent positions and perform with such outstanding success that one may even conclude that only such people are capable of certain achievements it is as if they have compensatory abilities to counter balance their deficiencies
6578716 their unswerving determination and penetrating intellectual powers their narrowness and single mindedness as manifested in their special interests can be immensely valuable and can lead to outstanding achievements in their chosen areas
6578717 we are convinced then that autistic people have their place in the organism of the social community
6578718 atheism seems cool and radical so im going to become an atheist

6578722 country energy will build its new facility in a more central location in industrial road adjacent to the harrington industrial area
6578723 while electricity infrastructure in the old zone substation is exposed to the elements parts of the new facility including the control room and switchboard will be enclosed in a modular building that will protect the equipment from weather wildlife and vandalism

6578728 the superindent of insurance shall not establish or approve any increase in rates for the period commencing july 1 2008 and ending june 30 2009
6578729 people should not be forced to say or do things they believe are morally wrong
6578730 health care workers should not be forced to provide services that violate their violates their own conscience
6578731 the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
6578732 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6578733 people should not be forced to say or do things that they find morally wrong
6578734 words in that draft led some to misconstrue the departments intent
6578735 this regulation is consistent with my intent to focus squarely on the issue of conscience rights this specifically goes to the issue of abortion and conscience
6578736 i have a lot of problems with the way this loan was written
6578737 we have been and are working closely with the obama campaign to make sure we have an exciting and unified convention
6578738 our delegate whips along with the obama delegate whips are a part of a team that will be on the floor of the convention to make sure delegates have everything they need whether thats answering questions or passing out signs during hillarys speech the whips are a traditional part of every conventions floor operations
6578739 one of the unique factors is that it is the only one negotiated between the two parties as opposed to the employer imposing it
6578740 they do that in other provincial jurisdictions but the unions havent agreed to it its been imposed
6578741 if they refuse at the first job site they would be tested at every job site they go to
6578742 a huge sweep that has nothing to do with intoxication or impairment and is nothing but a fishing expedition into workers lifestyles
6578743 we know of no drug test that will actually test for impairment
6578744 you can consume drugs hours or days prior to a drug test and still test positive
6578745 theyve been pre access testing for 10 years for major industrial projects in alberta
6578746 i think it would be a little naive to think that all the workers came to the door and demanded this something was conceded in order for the employer to achieve this result
6578747 write it off on the basis that it was mutually agreed to
6578748 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
6578749 a way to tell if a manufacturer sells their own products on their site
6578750 a lot of these cold cases are extremely difficult for the state to prove
6578751 these homicides affected the community greatly back in the 1990s and they continue to reverberate
6578752 we put the best case forward with all the evidence available and we have to rely on the court to make its final decision
6578753 i did what i was told to do then he said i had confessed
6578754 were going to establish some type of protocol so that if something like this would happen again that our clients arent going to be at risk
6578755 the email put people on alert more so than we deemed necessary
6578756 securely wiped by overwriting the files with random data numerous times before deleting them this is not a perfect solution but it is worlds better than the old method of simply unlinking the files directory entries and leaving the data around for any forensic investigator to find
6578757 marcs proven track record of successful leadership in growing internet businesses is extremely relevant to ebuddy and we are delighted to have him on board this appointment is a key part of the team we are building to drive the next stage of our development demonstrating our commitment to accelerating our growth on a worldwide scale
6578758 i believe there is enormous potential to extend the ebuddy brand into new partnerships markets and geographies and im delighted to be working with a strong management team that is as passionate about growth as i am i look forward to lending strategic vision and support to ensure we are meeting our global customers needs whilst building upon our enviable reputation as one of europes fastest growing private companies
6578759 vindicated i feel great i feel amazing i just won a gold medal
6578760 it was hard and this win wasnt just down to my goal
6578761 it was only achievable with the team we have and that we played for each other
6578762 but i feel stronger in the end i know it sounds crazy but im glad i went though it i learned a lot about myself
6578763 i asked two questions do you want to win yes do you need goalkeepers to win yes
6578764 we had to move on and this day you could see that we did it
6578765 its something im gonna keep asking myself for a long time you keep asking what you did wrong
6578766 again we had a chance to win the gold and again we let it slip away its hard to say why that keeps happening to us
6578767 we are not looking at the results but on how we play
6578768 soccer is not a matter of 1 0 or 2 0 its the way to find out the rhythm the match against norway is our key point in the tournament we found out our weak points and improved it thats why we stand here with the gold medal
6578769 i think i was leaning to my left waiting to dive to the left because the whole goal was open
6578770 and she ended up going right and i luckily kept some of my weight on the right
6578771 i dont understand why the ball wouldnt go in in so many games before we were able to score easily but today it wasnt the case
6578772 i just knew that i had to keep it low strike it hard and it went in
6578773 we said dont worry about making mistakes just go out there and play with confidence and be brave you could feel it every minute of that second half and in overtime we felt strong

6578907 but im getting closer every day when i get the go ahead i guarantee ill be back in great shape and hopefully in a position to make an immediate impact for both everton and australia
6578908 the longer you are out the more you appreciate what it means to play at the top level and theres no doubt in my mind ill be back bigger and better than ever the operation went well but the rehabilitation has taken a little longer than id have liked

6578912 when i was a youngster in australia people didnt really rate me but i never took no for an answer and ive always liked to prove people wrong
6578913 but what i point out to people that is exactly the same situation as faced by the hawke keating governments

6578916 the family reunion stream is very important to people coming to the country
6578917 increasingly it is one of the factors people take into account when they are looking at whether to migrate or not is whether they have the opportunity for family reunion
6578918 it is actually a strong benefit in terms of attracting good people to this country
6578919 but they make a contribution over the longer terms and it is part of our responsibilities as a nation to assist those in need
6578920 its a case for making sure we are targeting the right skills and they are going to the right regions
6578921 it has been very much part of my approach to make sure that we recognised that we have a series of different labour markets in australia and that for instance the migration coming into this country ought to be going to meet the skills needs of the economy in the areas where we need them
6578922 but with an ageing population if we dont have strong migration programs we wont have the workforce to support the baby boomers in their retirement

6578939 russias bullish plans unveiled this week to build up to six aircraft carrier battle groups and upgrade its nuclear submarine fleet are part of a worrying trend they provide further evidence that moscows military revival may in time pose some unwelcome challenges for europeans determined to believe the days of east west confrontation are over

6578978 i was really attracted to seeing a program that people could use in their everyday lives
6578979 its certainly different than traditional physical education programs or physical activity programs that are delivered in settings like schools or recreational centers or gyms or health clubs

6578995 we cannot just allow the fighting to go on without end
6578996 we are glad that they are volunteering but we have to keep them in check because we have laws to follow regarding the possession of deadly weapons
6578997 but we are appealing to them not to use force in addressing the problem we need to talk and to take a peaceful approach so as not to affect the civilians in the armm

6579002 now this is exacerbating the already tensed situation the already violent situation in mindanao
6579003 so i would like to call on the national officials to please not exacerbate the already troublesome and alarming situation in mindanao because the net effect will be to again project the philippines in a very negative light at a time when the muslim world is trying to reach out to the west and to the non muslim communities
6579004 you know when we arm civilians definitely we are inviting others to arm themselves
6579005 if we have so many guns then necessarily the situation will get out of control

6579009 there was a supreme court decision in december 2006 the decision is very very clear there is no reason why meralco should refuse the audit from coa
6579010 they were given a franchise by the government which gave them some privileges it is virtual monopoly in their area of franchise so they should be willing to subject themselves to an audit in line with the privileges
6579011 no one is above the law here and i dont have to convince anybody since there is a supreme court decision
6579012 oil is deregulated so there is no regulator power is regulated and the regulator is the erc energy regulatory commission coa can audit a utility firm since it is regulated see there is a distinction so meralco should be amenable to the audit to know if rates are properly fixed
6579013 meralco is trying to take us for fools in making this lame excuse
6579014 no less than the sc in meralco vs genaro lualhati et al gr no 166769 ordered the erc to ask coa to audit meralco
6579015 the erc is thus directed to request coa to undertake a complete audit on the books records and accounts of meralco relative to its provisionally approved rates
6579016 maybe meralco is afraid that coa will find the 2003 rate adjustment to be unjustifiable thus opening the door for consumers to seek a refund of the same
6579017 is for meralco to make a travesty of justice by barring the audit set forth by the sc to determine if its rate increase of 2003 was justified
6579018 the concern for the poor is recognized as a public duty and the protection of those marginalized members of society has always been dutifully pursued by the court as a sacred mission
6579019 we cannot find a legal basis for the coa to conduct an audit of private corporation upon the request of a private entity nasecore without prior consultation with our company and his honorable commission whom we acknowledge to be our sole regulator authorized by the epira electric power industry reform act to act as such dangerous precedent for any person or entity who can now ask the coa to audit the cooks records and accounts of a private corporation or distribution utility like meralco at anytime
6579020 we chr stand by our position that there is no substitute to a peaceful solution
6579021 emotions are indeed high compulsion to get even is blazing and to take actions without regard to cherished moral values are being pressed
6579022 however army soldiers were reminded that they should not be provoked to pursue punitive actions against milf perpetrators beyond the armys treasured moral principles
6579023 we call on the milf leadership to take full responsibility for the criminal acts committed by some elements of the milf and to help bring these elements to justice
6579024 we on behalf of the millions of citizens within the armm who have given us a fresh mandate hereby declare our unequivocal support for the sincere efforts of the national leadership to negotiate and forge an agreement towards genuine and lasting peace in mindanao
6579025 we condemn in the strongest terms the senseless murder of innocent civilians the wanton destruction of properties and the heartless disruption of the livelihood of many of our brothers in mindanao
6579026 when our community is challenged by decisions made and being made by our leaders
6579027 it is a challenge for everyone to respond in a way that reflects our commitment to peace it would be judicious for our government leaders to listen to what the youth have to say
6579028 among these activities have been training of madaris gurus who teach values formation to the youth there have been youth camps that provide muslim and christian youth as well as youth from different religious traditions to come together and forge bonds of friendship youth with talents for news writing have been trained to hone these skills so that they might use the press to promote the ideals of dialogue peace and harmony that are at the core of silsilahs vision and mission

6579040 most teachers hold themselves accountable they didnt go into teaching to make money they dont have seven houses
6579041 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6579042 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6579043 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6579044 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues

6579078 the family reunion stream is very important to people coming to the country
6579079 increasingly it is one of the factors people take into account when they are looking at whether to migrate or not is whether they have the opportunity for family reunion
6579080 it is actually a strong benefit in terms of attracting good people to this country
6579081 but they make a contribution over the longer terms and it is part of our responsibilities as a nation to assist those in need
6579082 its a case for making sure we are targeting the right skills and they are going to the right regions
6579083 it has been very much part of my approach to make sure that we recognised that we have a series of different labour markets in australia and that for instance the migration coming into this country ought to be going to meet the skills needs of the economy in the areas where we need them

6579221 day after day the church offers us the possibility to walk in the company of the saints
6579222 the colors of the spectrum in relation with the light because with their own hues and accents each one of them reflects the light of gods holiness
6579223 how important and advantageous therefore is the determination to cultivate the knowledge and devotion of the saints together with the daily meditation of the word of god and filial love for the virgin
6579224 the period of vacation is certainly a useful time to review the biography and writings of some men or women saints in particular but each day of the year offers us the opportunity to become familiar with our heavenly patrons
6579225 their human and spiritual experience shows that holiness is not a luxury it is not the privilege of a few an impossible goal for a normal man

6579317 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans

6579354 there are 1 25 crore vehicles in maharashtra the carbon dioxide they generate is huge in quantity and that can be compensated with oxygen which can be collaterally generated from the tree plantation we are planning this is a very meagre price we are asking from the vehicle owners
6579355 this means our way of oxygen generation in much cheaper and i dont think there should be opposition to this on the same lines we will levy green cess on the municipal councils and municipal corporations for using the forest resources while providing drinking water
6579356 i am not aware of the nitty gritty of the policy but the government has every right to levy such cess in that case the burden will be on the general public through their water usage bills

6579367 veal shouldnt be a dirty word there is a process of re education that needs to occur british rose veal is something we are happy to endorse
6579368 customer attitude is changing but not fast enough we need to better educate consumers about veal
6579369 our veal is reared outside on grass throughout the summer and housed in winter its as natural as you can get
6579370 there has been a lot of publicity recently about veal so hopefully it will grow in popularity people have to understand that rearing calves for nine to 12 months is not a cruel thing to do at the end of the day veal is just younger beef
6579371 its quite bizarre really some people are happy to eat lamb which are baby sheep but get hot headed about veal
6579372 british rose veal should not be confused with imported white veal meat which causes such controversy
6579373 it is important for the british meat industry and for the animals themselves that the stigma attached to continental veal is not associated with well reared british veal
6579374 these organic dairy calves have a life span of around six months which is more than chickens and most lambs and would otherwise be reserved for the export industry or killed at birth
6579375 there has been a stigma attached to veal theyre not just new born calves theyre six to nine months old and are reared in a high welfare way its a very lean meat with many health benefits at the moment its a very specialist market in the uk so were trying to develop consistency among farmers
6579376 eating british veal would be great for our farmers no farmer wants to export bull calves but there has to be a market for it
6579377 while the plan is well intentioned the answer to saving calves from long distance transport confinement in cruel tiny crates and slaughter soon after birth doesnt lie in encouraging consumers to eat more british meat
6579378 the presidential election is chosen by electoral votes selected on a state by state basis any poll that tries to dumb down the situation by displaying a straight percentage of voters is bullshit

6579433 i have pulled 80 officers from critical positions throughout the rochester police department whether that be in licensing narcotics vice special investigators

6579445 when an inspection period would go beyond lets say a year and a half i think thats really going beyond what regulatory oversight should be
6579446 i gotta tell you something i dont have a great deal of confidence right now when i go to a gasoline station and fill up my car that i am actually getting what i am paying for
6579447 there are programs out there that are weak and unable to deliver the level of inspection that consumers deserve
6579448 when theres a lack of oversight theres a potential a greater potential for abuse
6579449 it would be beneficial to have a national coordination of efforts
6579450 the chance of getting into a top business school is 10 to 15
6579451 if you make good choices during the application process you can up it to 80
6579452 candidates are trying to get into the head of admissions people and tell stories they think we want to hear
6579453 if someone says they are were not getting an accurate version of them its ok to talk about failure but you need to discuss what you learned from it how did you become stronger for it
6579454 look for someone who knows the application process and who knows you well
6579455 mom and dad know you well but they dont know what business schools are looking for
6579456 a lot of schools say its the most important part of the package

6579460 i feel great i just won a damn gold medal
6579461 i really kind of feel that maybe people will get off our back and realize that there is some parity in this game
6579462 i think we missed a big opportunity to support womens sport
6579463 we were getting the best athletes in the sport unlike baseball were getting athletes that are subject to a very good anti doping program unlike baseball and were trying to create a balance on the program between men and women so i think unfortunately softball got caught up in the shotgun blast against baseball
6579464 you know you dont have to be six four finch is 6 ft 1 in you dont have to be 200 pounds we have all different shapes and sizes the sport tests so many athletic abilities from hand eye coordination to speed to agility to quickness were finally at the pinnacle weve finally been established please dont take this away
6579465 weve fought it weve fought it weve fought it for so long
6579466 but on the drive up knowing this could be it you cant fight it anymore
6579467 as a pitcher i think we all want the ball in our hands
6579468 i hold that responsibility being an olympic softball player what more can i do lisa fernandez dot richardson the many greats theyve done so much and now its our turn and what did we do with the torch so yeah you do feel let down those many girls they dont look to the international olympic committee they look to us

6579483 should have been aware of this going on and here hes actively marketing foreign products undermining american made products
6579484 the product the chinese are offering us now its a quality product
6579485 you put a chinese casket next to a york casket or one of these other manufacturers you cant tell the difference

6579491 our previous work produced important data but it involved short term acute interventions
6579492 this study will be the first long term investigation into whether nutritional supplements and aerobic exercise benefit normal but sedentary older people
6579493 obviously were keeping an open mind that it may or may not work we hope that it does work though because these would both be safe and widely applicable interventions that could help us in keeping older people healthy fit and independent
6579494 i guess i just feel my children are not interested in me mom
6579495 they were trashing it so bad the city got onto me i said the city is the one that needs to help me with this
6579496 to say theyre not bothering anyone or doing anything wrong is a misnomer
6579497 do i think homeless people are bad no but theyre here because its easy and because we werent enforcing public order crimes weve received a mandate from the citizens to clean up the city and take back the neighborhoods so here we go

6579516 schools in the formal system prefer not to readmit those who get pregnant while studying even though there is no law barring them
6579517 above all young mothers become adults directly after childhood without the intervening phase of adolescence
6579518 male sexual education awareness and employment skills are equally important if we are to address the problem of teenage pregnancy and single mothers boys will have to be given as much attention as the girls sadly all the national and international funding is for girls focused programme boys are being left out and it is showing negative results already

6579598 ellos los del col n no han hecho y eso har que nosotros alberguemos la certeza como club de que estamos en lo correcto y apegados a la ley de la fifa

6579616 we were right there in the heat of things and then we got crushed by that injury with the influx of new talent that weve got were going to have a lot more depth this fall especially at outside hitter i would suspect that if somebody gets injured we wouldnt drop off much with the players coming off the bench
6579617 with this mix of athletes its going make our practices intense i would expect the competitive nature of those sessions will make them all better players as that type of environment tends to lift everybodys game the intensity at our practices and scrimmages will really help us improve as the season wears on

6579889 you acutally wish we would have started this week well practice on monday which normally wont be a practice day for us one of the reasons is to get the bad practice out of the way when you start class because there certainly is a different mindset different distractions that get you
6579890 we gave them a lot of time off the last two days to recover and we came out today and did what we would do in a normal thursday practice
6579891 we had a good end of the week this week on our game prep and them trying to see what the schedule will be like what the practices will be like and i think that will help us a lot
6579892 it impacts it we really havent finished any depth charts at all we talk about that every day but well probably sit down sunday night and really decide going into the first week
6579893 well be hitting we like to hit yeah well definitely be hitting

6579901 i would say it is thousands its not tens of thousands
6579902 so weve told the campaign they can expect a bill for buses for the extra ordinary effort that we had to put to ensure there was a safe parking place
6579903 and im sure the obama campaign will come by in relation to reimbursing the expenses of the city it would be a political negative if it didnt happen
6579904 when you have an event like that in the city a number of people have to be involved to make sure it is a safe event for everybody
6579905 you know statewide exposure national exposure and whether it is senator mccain or senator obama it is good for the area absolutely
6579906 i would hope every candidate would come through here and wed give them the same response
6579907 and the man in the suit has just bought a new car from the profit hes made on your dreams
6579908 so i told him look man i dont take my clothes off for anybody even if it is artistic and oh
6579909 look mother its my life ok so if i want to live on a beach and walk around naked oh
6579910 oh she has a good looking this and she looks really great here
6579911 i said i was going to call the police and then she went nuts she said she was going to kill me
6579912 i pushed her away and tried to climb back in the truck she slashed my arm twice as i pulled the door closed and she continued to stab the window once i was inside
6579913 now that ive had time to think about things i feel a bit freaked out about what could have happened
6579914 but in absence of a true license number this is the best that we have

6579916 we took a lot of time off the last two days to recover and came out today and did what we would do on a normal thursday practice
6579917 we took about 20 minutes and hit all phases of the special teams and then we work offense and defense on all situations of the game its really a situational practice we finish up with two minute against each other and it was good i think that our players learned a lot learned how we want to prepare on thursday what we expect out of them we are trying to get the idea that this is that last part of the week as we put in the game
6579918 it was good to get the sun out with the two minute being able to execute run full speed when they are tired hot
6579919 we havent had enough sun lately but it certainly helped today
6579920 well definitely be hitting but we want to make it as much like the game
6579921 how we go to pregame meal we have our walkthrough during the day how we approach the locker room and training room well take the field and go through our routine on the field and then try to hit all the situations of the kicking game that will come up and then basically scrimmage our ones versus the twos and threes and some scouts and get the looks that western illinois is going to give us
6579922 we really havent finished any depth chart at all we talk about depth every day but well probably sit down sunday night and really talk about what we have going into next week

6579941 we all hear it everybody hears it why dont we have a big stud
6579942 but if you can get that out of your mind for one second i know its difficult for a lot of people but we think like we have six really really good receivers
6579943 i know everybody thinks were lying and not telling the whole truth that we can win with these guys but we think theres no question in our minds we can win the super bowl with these receivers
6579944 any hike in fuel price will affect everybody in the society this includes workers businessmen and car owners
6579945 even the road side food seller would hike the price of her food the reason is that if she has to take a bus or any other means of public transportation to go to the market to buy foodstuff she would be compelled to pay a higher fare as a result of this she would add the additional cost in transport fare to the cost of preparing the food and this would then lead to higher price for the same plate of food
6579946 for instance if the fare to victoria island used to be n1500 it would surely go up to about n2000
6579947 it affected me even though i was not yet a taxi driver then
6579948 before the hike i used to spend about n270 as my transport fare to and from my office but after the hike my transport fare rose to about n400
6579949 this is because during ex president olusegun obasanjos first tenure as a military head of state between 1976 and 1979 the price of fuel then was 7 kobo and diesel was about 31 2 kobo per litre during the military regime of gen ibrahim babangida when the price was hiked to n7 diesel was still sold for about n2 50 or n3 still cheaper than fuel
6579950 the price of diesel has gone up to n160 per litre
6579951 i believe that what the government has done is to increase the price of diesel in order to make up for the subsidy on the price of fuel
6579952 so which subsidy are they telling us they want to remove
6579953 my position is based on the fact that diesel kerosene and petrol are all derived from the same source they are petroleum products
6579954 how can the rich man be adversely affected by the hike in fuel price when he probably gets free fuel or fuel allowance from his office
6579955 even if the rich man is a private businessman all he would do is simply to increase the price of his own goods or services and this is why the prices of all other goods and services would also go up
6579956 a lot of revenue could be realised from crude oil when refined and this does not warrant constant increases in fuel prices
6579957 if the federal government could subsidise the importation of rice with n80 billion why will it not subsidise the price of fuel especially in the light of global food crisis
6579958 the people are already crying that the prices of foodstuffs and other consumables are skyrocketing if government removes the subsidy the situation would get worse
6579959 the government should leave fuel subsidy until they are able to fix the power sector a stable power sector would lead to improved income for the people and this would enable them to afford a deregulated price for fuel
6579960 the four refineries we have in the country can only produce 15 million litres of fuel per day whereas the national demand is 30 million
6579961 what this means is that even if our four refineries are producing at full capacity we would still need to import additional 15 million litres to cope with the national demand
6579962 we expect nigerians to come forward and build refineries but unfortunately the response has not been good this is as a result of the non competitive prices at which petroleum products are sold in this country
6579963 it is important that the labour unions understand that the solution to this problem cannot come through strikes nigerians have to understand that before investors would become interested to build private refineries in the country the price has to be attractive and competitive
6579964 it is only when nigerians agree to pay competitive prices for petroleum products that private investors would be willing to establish their own refineries the people have to understand that this is the only way we can bear this brunt once and for all
6579965 what i have discovered as the president general of this union is that the terminal operators always engage in blackmail what they do not have they would say that they have
6579966 this is a great opportunity for us to continue our growth strategy and serve the expanding needs of our clients
6579967 we think the project has significant potential as both ecfcs r and menscs contribute to angiogenesis in vivo which underscores the importance of further study into the potential synergy of these cells in the formation of vasculature
6579968 endgenitor is extremely pleased to have the opportunity to partner with cryo cell international in the development of its regenerative medicine product lines the synergy resulting from cryo cell and endgenitors joint research efforts and complimentary expertise is expected to significantly impact pre clinical development timelines
6579969 we all know that nigeria is richly endowed in terms of human and material resources and should therefore be one of the countries registering spectacular growth and development on sustainable bases
6579970 for example nigeria is currently witnessing a co movement between huge annual public expenditure and deterioration in the welfare of the citizenry in fact nigeria is now being stigmatised as a paradox of a rich nation and poor people
6579971 first there appears to be persistent lack of coordination of policies programmes and activities both within each and among the various agencies of government
6579972 thirdly the level of effectiveness and efficiency of legislative oversight over fiscal operations of government since the re emergence of a representative political system of government in nigeria in 1999 leaves room for improvement

6579979 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6579980 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6579981 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6579982 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6579983 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6579984 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6579985 we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6579986 gene was a true pioneer as one of the few african american leaders of a major union
6579987 he was the equal of owners in negotiations and made the league a better place for all players
6579988 we are deeply saddened and shocked by the sudden and unexpected death of our leader gene upshaw our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife terri and their three sons eugene justin and daniel gene learned he was sick just this past sunday and he died with his family at his side we ask that the media respect our need to begin the process of dealing with this unexpected tragedy and to begin the grieving process
6579989 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6579990 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally
6579991 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6579992 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture

6579996 we know that he had extended contact with the girl whos now 16
6579997 our concern is there may be additional victims because he clearly has no qualms about contacting girls who are significantly underage
6579998 we are not confident that the technical and commercial evaluation process in the short listing of the potential buyers guarantees the selection of the most competent hands to effectively manage the company and thus protect the interest of the employers including our members who have spent most of their productive years in the service of chevron oil nigeria plc
6579999 we are worried about the focus being given to potential buyers that bid in excess of 300 per cent over and above the floor trading price of 202 naira is alarming pengassan as legitimate employees representative find this very disturbing as this clearly implies that the potential buyers are going to incur the incredible bank charges and other related cost of capital to service the loans used to acquire the company this means that the profitability of the company cannot be sustained amongst its peers within the industry which will ultimately impair the companys competitiveness and market shares thereby jeopardising the interest of the employees of the company we have observed that some of the potential buyers do not have the organisational structure to manage the current calibre of employees and to also support the already existing best practice in corporate governance on which the chevron oil nigeria plc workers union prides itself locally and internationally
