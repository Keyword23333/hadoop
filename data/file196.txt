1960000 there we were im president elect and shes going to be the first first lady wholl play a real hands on role in policy it was really something
1960001 when i left office it was pretty damn lonely theres no halfway house for ex presidents one day youre commander in chief and the next day youre history it seemed a waste just to have it be over in a flash
1960002 so i worked on my library got going on my book put the foundation together made a bunch of speeches all over the world and made a lot of money for the first time in my life it was pretty good not like being president but it gave me a lot of freedom
1960003 and then along came the heart thing man that was awful and im thinking that maybe it isnt just my political career thats over its my life just like they say its the wake up call and it got my attention
1960004 we had the best of both worlds i was doing well and doing good shes written her book had that huge advance and was doing great work in the senate
1960005 time was flying by for both of us the president and cheney and rumsfeld were screwin it up everywhere but he gets a second term
1960006 and that was her opening now it was her turn shes got the right experience the will to win great people working for her folks who supported us when i was president polls showed that she could win she really wanted this one
1960007 they all said she was inevitable and sure enough in no time shes the front runner in first place and second place isnt even close double digit leads everywhere and she just keeps getting better and stronger and everyones jumping on board
1960008 meanwhile the republicans are slugging it out slogging through those endless debates and its looking like theyre gonna be a long time sorting it out but we knew it could all be decided for democrats by early february and of course were thinkin its gonna be her
1960009 thats the way it looked early this winter and then things started to get off track iowa we shoulda never gone there the press got all over her for coming in third had a field day with that four days later new hampshire she pulls it off like a real pro
1960010 i was so proud of her so thrilled to see her get this deal on her own terms taking hits getting right back up a comeback kid if there ever was one runs in the family you might say
1960011 then south carolina where she never had a chance of course and the press is down on her and me again she wins big on super tuesday but they treat it like so what and then he begins his run on the table and theyre anointing him and counting her out she wins in texas ohio but hes still getting great press and she cant buy a break
1960012 you know the rest pennsylvania we really thought that might change the momentum indiana north carolina no matter what she does hes still ahead
1960013 and after all wed done for so many folks jobs in my administration putting women and african americans front and center raising money for all those congressional campaigns but a bunch of them peel off because they think hes got the nomination
1960014 wed talked about a quick vacation right after the convention time to let go the last chance to decompress before the big push to november it all looked so right the first woman ever shed have made women proud she knew what she wanted to do but that nomination kept slipping away

1960093 obama is correct in saying that the world is ready for someone like him a messiah like figure charismatic and glib the bible calls that leader the antichrist and it seems apparent that the world is now ready to make his acquaintance

1960250 world interdependence has diffused balance of power considerations and transformed them into a balance of terror
1960251 vernacular discourse articulated a process of dissolving the interiority of the coherent unitary subject
1960252 for the first two decades of the american occupation the short story suffered from a stiltedness of style when written in english but after the authors went through a period of practice in acquiring the idiom excellent writing began to emerge
1960253 themes shifted from social comment to a search for self awareness and personal identification
1960254 we are certainly fortunate that there are now filipinos who can speak to us beautifully in our own language this collection is an admirable testimony to the emergence of another important branch of english literature

1960258 nation building means trying to give a beautiful picture of the country trying not to disturb people not to make them angry by depicting the truth to them
1960259 a growing interdependence of the conditions of economic production and exchange comporting a trend towards uniformity yet this is dialectically accompanied by a new multiplication of cultural diversity equality is never identity what we are seeing now is indeed a growing divergence of cultural identities a search for specificity as the other face of emerging globalism
1960260 literature must at last embark upon its epic role the role of an inner force which firmly welds people in the knowledge of the community of their suffering and desires the awareness of the unity of their striving for a beautiful free life
1960261 the ghost of time past philippine literary criticism in english
1960262 the politics of recognition prrinceton nj princeton university press 1992
1960263 represented an indirect admission by filipinos that they desperately needed american assistance and would for years to come
1960264 along with millions of other americans and filipinos and their common past had ordained both their present and their future
1960265 welcomed the united states as a salutary force for modernization
1960266 to instill in them the values that had made america the greatest society on earth integrity civic responsibility and respect for impersonal institutions
1960267 history is responsible by acceding to their aspirations for sovereignty so soon after conquest the united states spared filipinos a long struggle for independence
1960268 they colonial administrators found in the philippines a society based on a complicated and often baffling web of real and ritual kinship ties the antithesis of the american ideal of a nation of citizens united in their devotion to the welfare of all
1960269 the insertion of colonial bodies into a metropolitan discourse that provides sanction for the politics of colonialism at the same time as it reproduces them
1960270 attempted to tell the story through individuals as they behaved at the time avoiding the tendentious habit of superimposing todays ethics on yesterdays norms
1960271 even at this late stage they were struggling to shape a firm philippine policy proof again that policies are often forged in the heat of crisis rather than in cool contemplation

1960278 the filipinos found it hard to break the habit of special dependence on the united states
1960279 conducive to the dominance of middle class american values american culturalism denotes the intent to rule the world by the imposition of her values safeguarding them when necessary by military occupation and colonization

1960281 a victorian legitimacy to past conquests and in so doing to justify by demonstrating how satisfactory are the relations between filipinos and americans e g lansdale and magsaysay future imperial ventures
1960282 it is a hubristic illusion for americans to imagine that in the colonial era they liberalized modernized or for that matter exploited the philippines in any large systemic or lasting way
1960283 disorder chaos corruption and general ineptitude the themes of political maturity chaos and internal disorder and corruption and inefficiency in leadership all became important elements in the construction of an international identity whose positive sovereignty was continually suspended
1960284 self organization of citizens in contrast to state or government and is rooted in western rational tradition and political culture
1960285 the arena for organizing governance material activities and intellectual moral and cultural aspects of communities
1960286 thus institutions of civil society family clan community neighborhood associations productive enterprises service mechanisms historically utilized the material resources of civil society in pursuit of its ideals and values
1960287 where the political state has attained to its full development man leads not only in thought in consciousness but in reality in life a double existence celestial and terrestrial he lives in the political community where he regards himself as a communal being gemeinwesen and in civil society where he acts simply as a private individual treats other men as means degrades himself to the role of a mere means and becomes the playing of alien powers
1960288 a class in civil society that is not of civil society

1960291 passage from the purely economic egoistic passional to the ethico political moment
1960292 it is not so much the state civil society opposition but rather the capital community opposition that seems to me to be the great unsurpassed contradiction in western social philosophy both state and civil social institutions have assigned places within the narrative of capital community which ideally should have been banished from the kingdom of capital continues to lead a subterranean potentially subversive life within it because it refuses to go away
1960293 the first man who having enclosed a piece of ground bethought himself of saying this is mine and found people simple enough to believe him was the first real founder of civil society
1960294 the standpoint of the old materialism is civil society the standpoint of the new is human society or socialized humanity

1960338 in the 1970s men blamed their inability to perform at such high levels on the aggressiveness of the newly liberated woman in the 1980s naomi wolf blamed it on the unrealistic images in playboy magazine with which real women couldnt compete but the blame for sexual anxieties might be most appropriately laid on a culture in which one is expected to have satisfying sexual relations with an unlimited number of people about whom one does not care and who do not care in return

1960352 the bureau of treasury assured us that the money is deposited in a special account separate from the general fund and it is in fact earning interest however the bot said that no amount has been earmarked for the compensation of marcos victims due to the absence of a law providing for such an allocation
1960353 this delay is undermining the social justice value of a measure that rightfully demands accountability from the state for its past mistakes the immediate passage of the bill is even made more important by the escalation of extrajudicial killings and involuntary disappearances in the country the bills enactment would help end the sense of impunity enjoyed by human rights violators from the military and from the government
1960354 i hope that they would make the passage of the bill a birthday gift to all human rights victims during the martial law
1960355 president gma other government officials and leaders of the majority in congress swore that the bill would be enacted quickly rep nograles said that it would be ratified six weeks after the start of the 14th congress executive secretary ermita said that the bill would be prioritized and enacted during this term meanwhile general esperon denied that the military blocked the passage of the bill and said that the money should be given to marcos victims a statement echoed by national security adviser norberto gonzales recently speaker jose de venecia said that even if the bill was not included in ledacs priority legislation it would still be prioritized
1960356 political will has to be exercised to assure the enactment of the compensation bill
1960357 after what took place during the 13th congress we are compelled to look at these assurances as hollow until concrete actions have been taken to enact the bill
1960358 it is embarrassing that as member of the unhrc we are remiss in our obligation to realize our human rights commitments one our international commitment that a share of the money that was transferred to us from swiss accounts must be given the martial law victims once this is proven ill gotten through due process and two our commitment to legislate this international obligation and constitutional mandate to provide compensation to victims of human rights violations in this case the martial law victims we are seriously studying the possibility of elevating the matter to the council if concrete steps are not taken immediately to enact the compensation bill
1960359 leadership positions in the house of representatives should be open to all members of congress and should be based solely on competence not on gender or sexual orientation there is nothing wrong with a woman or a gay deputy speaker
1960360 the commotion simply means that gender sensitivity workshops should be made mandatory to the honorable members of congress
1960361 in short a woman deputy speaker wont be representing lady legislators alone or for that matter a gay deputy speaker wont represent the gay members of congress in the same manner the male leaders of the chamber wont be representing the male members of congress
1960362 it would be a shame if the elected woman deputy speaker is anti women
1960363 filipino lesbians and gays are legitimate constituents of congress and thus they deserve to be represented properly furthermore any member of congress regardless of sexual orientation has the right to be elected to the leadership positions of the chamber
1960364 congress was not established to represent the heterosexual members of the filipino society this institution is duty bound to represent all filipinos to see congress inflicting upon the public and upon its own members its homophobia is condemnable
1960365 this violates the constitution and laws protecting equality among filipinos
1960366 it is an expression of homophobia there is no such a thing as the third sex it trivializes filipino lesbians and gays making them in language and in substance second class citizens in the country
1960367 we should break this monopoly anything less would not lower the cost of essential drugs in the country
1960368 we should not allow partisan politics especially the 2010 presidential elections to hostage the enactment of bread and butter bills on cheaper medicines
1960369 if it is true that the pharmas have a p1 billion lobby kit then they would capitalize on disagreements between what version should be prioritized
1960370 what members of congress should understand is that no single piece of legislation could on its own lower the price of medicines in a sense a package of legislation is needed to bring down the price of medicines
1960371 what we have so far are measures to amend the ipc introduce fair pricing for philhealth and price control mechanisms
1960372 admittedly these measures would not immediately usher a drastic reduction in the price of medicines but they would still improve access to essential medicines the challenge now is to have the political will to broaden the legislative agenda for cheaper medicines and prioritize these measures
1960373 it was the three way fight between time drug price regulation and amendments to the patents law that killed the cheaper medicines bill during the 13th congress
1960374 the fundamental unity should be passage of amendments to the ipc and the establishment of an effective price regulatory mechanism
1960375 lets not make the situation advantageous to pharmas furthermore let us keep politics off cheaper medicines
1960376 the truth is despite being labeled as cheaper medicines bill no bill filed in the 14th congress could single handedly lower the price of medicines
1960377 a more comprehensive legislation is necessary to bring down the exorbitant price of medicines in the country neither price regulation nor patents amendments could deliver cheaper medicines on its own
1960378 this means that price regulation is necessary to cover essential medicines whose patents have already expired however any mechanism for price regulation would be for naught in the absence of policies that would enforce transparency on the pricing of drugs the state should be able to compel multinational pharmas to reveal their pricing mechanism
1960379 off hand we believe that the board should be headed by the secretary of the department of health not by the dti secretary the primacy of health should be established and our message should be clear public health is not an issue of trade it is a question of human entitlements the role of pharmaceuticals particularly multinational ones should also be limited we believe that having them represented as full members in the board would contradict the mandate of the board
1960380 additionally the more important and strategic agenda is to develop and strengthen a domestic pharmaceutical industry which could support the government in lowering the price of medicines that in turn can only happen by boosting support for traditional and herbal medicines and using this as a platform to establish a fine chemical industry that can actually manufacture and produce medicines
1960381 it was the three way fight between time drug price regulation and amendments to the patents law that killed the cheaper medicines bill during the 13th congress

1960391 this is why im really interested in the pulitzer center it would be nice if the pulitzer center were to get 90 seconds on nightly or morning news
1960392 its not the quality of international news im disgusted with its whats chosen as the story ive always been someone who likes to learn ive been blinded the last couple of years pulitzer center provides an outlet not only to learn about global issues but to write about it
1960393 by reacting to the state sponsored terrorism conducted by slobodan milosevic the united states politically and morally bound itself to achieving stability in the region
1960394 ultimately the solution to ending ethnic violence was to divide the region into several small sovereign nations therefore supporting an independent kosovo is consistent with us policy moreover it is viewed as a means of preventing future conflict and building stability in the region despite recent outbreaks of violence
1960395 the most dramatic difference between the two senators plans hinge on the use of diplomacy and the role of military force in international conflict resolution ultimately the final difference seems to be a matter of change versus a continuation of our current course
1960396 with very few exceptions mccains foreign policy is a continuation of the bush administration ideals of aggressive military spending and deployment non negotiation with enemies and a continuation of the iraq war obama favors more diplomatic solutions and a quick end to the iraq war
1960397 the decision voters make in november will determine the course of american discourse in the world at large and to our relationship with our enemies
1960398 for an extraordinary swindler whose fraudulent acts during the 2004 and 2007 elections have been committed with impunity the sentence is grossly insufficient and insulting
1960399 comelec is clearly treating bedol with a velvet glove proving once again that the commission is coddling election saboteurs
1960400 comelec should have charged him with electoral sabotage which under the election automation law ra 8436 is punishable by life imprisonment
1960401 so why is the commission allowing bedol to get away
1960402 comelec has broad constitutional powers to prosecute cheats like bedol
1960403 akbayan will discuss with the minority bloc in congress including the reform bloc within the majority the possibility of impeaching comelec chair abalos he should be blamed for single handedly demolishing the integrity of the electoral process any attempt to reform the comelec is impossible as long as he is the chair of the commission
1960404 the comelecs capacity to shock filipinos with its incompetence is amazing they could have just done away with this farce and constructed a monument for bedol or they could have just appointed bedol as the commissioner for magic
1960405 four towns actually almost reached a 100 turn out shariff aguak 99 29 datu piang 99 28 percent mangundadatu 99 12 and talayan 99 06 percent
1960406 they are using world health organization data wrongly to cover up a simple fact the breastfeeding rate in the philippines is low because of unhampered and unethical marketing practices of phap members like wyeth abbott and mead johnson
1960407 the philippines is also number four in terms of the number of infants below six months old who are not breastfeeding our breastfeeding rate is the worst comprared with other south and southeast asian countries with 13 of filipino infants never having breastfed at all
1960408 in short due to the aggressive marketing of milk substitutes breastmilk an irreplaceable food for infants and children is marginalized
1960409 19 of under five mortality could be prevented by breastfeeding and that the truth that phap is hiding from the public
1960410 that accounts for 16 000 children every year these lives could be saved if infant formula companies are not in the way of teaching mothers to breastfeed in the first hour of life breastfeeding exclusively for the first six months of life and continuing to breastfeed with appropriate complementary feeding until two years of age
1960411 breastmilk is the most important and an irreplaceable food for infants and children it is safe and it protects infants from infectious diseases it boosts the immune system and stimulates cognitive linguistic and motor development
1960412 yet the rate of breastfeeding in the country is dismally low
1960413 this bloodbath in mindanao has to stop we challenge president arroyo to rein in the hawks in the cabinet and lay down a peace plan for mindanao
1960414 the hawks in the cabinet have won again and the bloodshed in basilan is a testimony to this administrations propensity to sacrifice strategic and long term political solutions in favor of military action
1960415 it is simply impossible and ironic for one hand to work for the signing of the peace agreement while the other hand is busy directing a war in territories where peace is supposedly being negotiated
1960416 no one is contesting the bravery of soldiers who despite the obvious absence of any strategy in this conflict and the lack of ample resources are still fighting in the battlefield but by sending ill equipped soldiers to war the government is committing an unconscionable act insulting in the process soldiers who died fighting for the state
1960417 soldiers also have rights security sector reforms should be institutionalized immediately to protect the welfare of soldiers
1960418 if the government is truly serious about its call for justice and peace in mindanao they should immediately forward the rome statute to the senate for ratification
1960419 in this manner the human rights of civilians in mindanao are protected
1960420 ah nee okee dan is het goed ik dacht even dat je het al die tijd over mij had

1960423 ik weet dat dit lullig overkomt maar ik vind dat het toch gezegd moet worden
1960424 ik weet dat dit bot overkomt dus ik neem je maar vast de woorden uit de mond
1960425 nou volgens mij kan ik zonder problemen 2 maanden op het strand in spanje gaan liggen of me in een grot in peru opsluiten want er gebeurt echt werkelijk geen kloot wat van belang is in de wereld

1960429 beliau hendak berdiri tetapi tidak bisa maka beliau disiram air tujuh kali agar sadar selanjutnya beliau dibawa ke masjid ke atas mimbar
1960430 wahai manusia dunia bukanlah pertemuan kalian denganku akan tetapi pertemuan kalian denganku adalah di telaga demi allah seolah olah diriku melihatnya dari tempat ini wahai manusia demi allah bukan kemiskinan yang aku takutkan atas kalian akan tetapi yang aku takutkan atas kalian adalah dunia kalian berlomba lomba padanya sebagaimana orang orang sebelum kalian juga berlomba lomba padanya maka ia membinasakan kalian seperti ia telah membinasakan mereka wahai manusia bertakwalah kepada allah pada wanita aku mewasiatkan agar kalian berbaik baik kepada wanita

1960433 wahai manusia tidak seorang pun dari kalian yang memiliki jasa kepada kami kecuali kami telah membalasnya kecuali abu bakar aku tidak kuasa membalasnya maka aku menyerahkannya kepada allah taala semua pintu ke masjid hendaknya ditutup kecuali pintu abu bakar ia tidak ditutup untuk selama lamanya
1960434 dari pandangan kedua matanya aku mengerti bahwa beliau menginginkan siwak maka aku mengambil siwak dari tangan abdur rahman dan melunakkannya terlebih dahulu dengan mulutku seterusnya aku berikan kepada nabi saw jadi ludahku adalah sesuatu yang paling terakhir yang masuk ke dalam mulut rasulullah saw
1960435 kata terakhir terulang tiga kali dan tangannya luruh beliau berpulang

1960462 mobile satellite services have the tremendous advantage of being able to cover most of the eus european union territory thereby reaching millions of eu citizens across borders they represent an unprecedented opportunity for all europeans to access new communication services and this not only in metropolitan areas but also in rural and less populated regions
1960463 however these satellite services depend on substantial investment and therefore need simple and swift procedures as well as long term legal certainty this is why the commission in close cooperation with the european parliament and the council of ministers set up in a record time of only 10 months a single eu procedure for selecting interested operators of mobile satellite services there is now one market not 27 in europe for mobile satellite services henceforth the ball is in the camp of the industry

1960482 as he gets older hell appreciate being here more the longer players stay they dont want to leave
1960483 cristiano will now settle down and enjoy his career here
1960484 he has four years left on his contract and hopefully at some point we would like to extend it thats where we are
1960485 i cant deny it was an important issue to keep him here there are very few players who have left me against my will and it is unusual for anybody to want to leave united
1960486 i think cristiano realises that we had a good meeting in portugal that clarified a lot of things
1960487 it was good and i was pleased with it and thats why i felt everything was going to be all right
1960488 were happy cristianos interview was very good and he explained himself perfectly from my perspective
1960489 as i said on wednesday the matter is closed and he is a manchester united player
1960490 he is happy to be a manchester united player and he has always been happy here
1960491 its just unfortunate that the participation of real madrid in the players life that has made it difficult for him
1960492 but the important thing is that we have ended all the stuff about real madrid

1960503 nobody who is against the mill feels like they can talk about it
1960504 this is such a peaceful community we all know each other we all help each other but this mill is dividing us
1960505 meeting for those who really care about paradox residents and our way of life
1960506 rule 1 there has been meetings for those that oppose pi on ridge mill and uranium mining etc these people and their beliefs will not be participants of this private gathering
1960507 rule 2 this is and will not be a debate
1960508 rule 3 law enforcement will be called for breaking these rules
1960509 the notice said it was going to be a discussion but it was a one sided discussion
1960510 i wanted to hear other peoples opinions to get an impression of what people are thinking about the mill the meeting wasnt at all what i was expected and it was very disappointing and insulting
1960511 there are a lot of people who have come to me for things over the years
1960512 i was just asked by a group of people to listen to their views
1960513 i can tell you law enforcement was there because i had a meeting with them on another subject afterwards and they stopped by
1960514 for those to talk that couldnt really feel like they could voice their opinion amongst those who didnt want the mill
1960515 i am really excited about it what a chance it is for our community to have an opportunity like this energy fuels is coming here with big bucks and they are risking big bucks to do it
1960516 they never smoked they werent around uranium and they ate good foods my granddad died early the mill is going to be very responsible
1960517 i question those people what they want to save paradox from
1960518 if they dont like it they have the option to leave i dont like hearing in different articles about how paradox is suffering and people are banding together to save it from the mill some of us are banding together to save our jobs and i am for the mill
1960519 if these rules arent done i will stop the meeting immediately and you will be going out the door
1960520 i know a lot of people got to talking after the meeting
1960521 jack did this and jack did that at first the individual meetings didnt bother me now i would really hope that everyone can get together and talk about the mill in a good fashion i know they can all talk together and express their feelings and live in harmony and i am hoping for that
1960522 i was hurt by the way people treated each other a lot of these people are very close friends with my family jack is supposed to be open minded and he was not open minded what inspired him to bring sheriffs deputies to arrest people for expressing an opinion
1960523 which ever way it goes if they want to be heard by the rest of the world through media they should do that as far as dividing the community i hope it doesnt happen the people mean more to me than the mill or mining

1960548 so be careful not to jump to conclusions before the lord returns as to whether or not someone is faithful when the lord comes he will bring our deepest secrets to light and will reveal our private motives and then god will give to everyone whatever praise is due

1960787 no food no one talking to her or reading her a story she cant even use her hands how could this child be so invisible
1960788 my hope was that she would be able to sleep through the night to be out of diapers and to feed herself
1960789 we were so distraught over her condition we agonized over what to do
1960790 her behavior was different than any child id ever seen
1960791 if you put food anywhere near her shed grab it
1960792 she had a lot of episodes of great agitation yelling flailing her arms rolling into a fetal position shed curl up in a closet just to be away from everyone she didnt know how to climb a slide or swing on a swing she didnt want to be touched
1960793 in my entire career with the child welfare system i dont ever remember a child like danielle
1960794 it makes you think about what does quality of life mean whats the best we can hope for her after all shes been through is it just being safe
1960795 that one is dangerous she cant be with other children
1960796 i guess she wanted to make sure the food was still there
1960797 okay lets put your shoes on do you need to go potty again
1960798 i know my son will never stand on his own will never be able to climb onto a horse you have no idea what your daughter might be able to do
1960799 id like her to at least be able to master a sound board so she can communicate her choices even if she never finds her voice
1960800 i think she understands most of what we say its just that she doesnt always know how to or want to react
1960801 i drive her around in my jeep and she honks the horn
1960802 you got your wormie you ready to go to sleep
1960803 thats okay too for me its all about getting the kisses and the hugs
1960804 left unattended for days with a retarded older brother never seen wearing anything but a diaper
1960805 the home is filthy there are clothes everywhere there are feces on the childs seat and the counter is covered with trash
1960806 is still wearing a diaper and drinking from a baby bottle on going situation worse since last august mom leaves grant and danielle at home for several days in a row while she goes to work and spends the night with a new paramour danielle is never seen outside the home
1960807 its not automatic that because the home is dirty wed remove the child
1960808 and what they found in 2002 was not like the scene they walked into in 2005
1960809 im concerned though that no effort was made to interview the child
1960810 if you have a 4 year old who is unable to speak that would raise a red flag to me
1960811 im not going to tell you this was okay i dont know how it could have happened
1960812 i tried to potty train her she wouldnt train i tried to get her into schools no one would take her
1960813 was that she didnt speak much she talked in a soft tone shed say lets go eat but no one could hear her except me
1960814 miss polly had a dolly she was sick sick sick
1960815 id been sick and it got away from me but i never knew a dirty house was against the law
1960816 he said she was starving i told him me and my sisters were all skinny till we were 13
1960817 she tended to blame her difficulties on circumstances while rationalizing her own actions
1960818 is more concerned with herself than most other adults and this could lead her to neglect paying adequate attention to people around her
1960819 they say i made her autistic but how do you make a kid autistic they say i didnt put clothes on her but she just tore them off

1960880 with todays announcement mit researchers have hit upon a simple inexpensive highly efficient process for storing solar energy
1960881 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
1960882 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
1960883 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
1960884 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
1960885 the scientific community is really going to run with this

1960890 it was to be expected that the levels of ivas would reduce i think the reasons for this are two fold firstly some ips are still not using the new iva protocol and are therefore finding that more and more ivas are being rejected by creditors strict criteria
1960891 secondly although we have experienced the credit crunch for a year now i believe that we are still in the calm before the storm in terms of its effects it can take a while for a person with serious debt to realise that they have a problem
1960892 home repossession is absolutely the last resort for banks our high street lenders are actively helping more people stay in their homes in these difficult times
1960893 we recognise that with rising food and fuel costs people may be finding money more difficult to manage and we urge anyone who is worried about meeting monthly
1960894 the problem will not go away on its own but banks are well placed to help customers plan their finances to keep the whole show on the road

1960914 the launch of hips onto the marketplace was far from smooth with delays and u turns together with a fundamental error on timing
1960915 indeed the debate still rages whether the timing of the launch has had a crippling effect on what is already a rocky time for the property industry

1960984 jika ancaman lompat parti terus mengancam ketenteraman negara ia adalah disebabkan ramai rakyat tahu bahawa pada satu ketika dahulu anwar sebagai pemimpin bn dan kerajaan persekutuan telah memainkan peranan penting dalam menjatuhkan kerajaan negeri pbs yang dipilih secara demokrasi di sabah pada 1994

1960987 inilah yang rakyat mahu beliau lakukan anwar tidak mempunyai mandat untuk menggulingkan kerajaan sekarang yang dipilih secara demokrasi melalui pintu belakang

1961226 oh well the ends justify the means lets not get technical about things
1961227 but zacchaeus stood up and said to the lord look
1961228 then peter said ananias how is it that satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the holy spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land
1961229 when ananias heard this he fell down and died and great fear seized all who heard what happened then the young men came forward wrapped up his body and carried him out and buried him about three hours later his wife came in not knowing what had happened at that moment she fell down at this feet and died then the young men came in and finding her dead carried her out and buried her beside her husband
1961230 therefore whosever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty for sinning against the body and blood of the lord a man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup for anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the lord eats and drinks judgment on himself that is why many among you are weak and sick and a number of your have fallen asleep
1961231 how could you agree to test the spirit of the lord
1961232 doing your job i hired you to do your job and you just said you didnt do it you are fired
1961233 great fear seized the whole church and all who heard about these events
1961234 when they came to the threshing floor of nacon uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark of god because the oxen had stumbled the lords anger burned against uzzah because of his irreverent act therefore god struck him down and he died there beside the ark of god
1961235 saul saul why are you persecuting me i am jesus whom you are persecuting
1961236 i am sending you to them the gentiles to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan to god so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me
1961237 and to the gentiles also i preached that they should repent and turn to god and prove their repentance by their deeds
1961238 i am sending you to them to open their eyes
1961239 i am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light
1961240 i am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan to god
1961241 the whole world is under the control of the evil one
1961242 i have come to seek and save that which was lost
1961243 i am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan to god so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me
1961244 i preached that they should repent and turn to god and prove their repentance by their deeds
1961245 youre billy graham arent you i got saved in your new york crusade years ago and since that day my lifes never been the same im a changed man
1961246 when the people heard this they were cut to the heart and said to peter and the other apostles brothers what shall we do
1961247 this man jesus was handed over to you and you with the help of wicked men put him to death by nailing him to the cross
1961248 peter replied repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins
1961249 peter replied repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of our sins
1961250 with many other words he warned them save yourselves from this corrupt generation those who accepted his message were baptized
1961251 those who accepted his message were baptized and about three thousand were added to their number that day
1961252 they devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and to the fellowship to the breaking of bread and to prayer
1961253 what does it profit a man or woman to gain the whole world and lose his or her soul
1961254 what does it profit a man to gain the whole world gain everything in this earthly life and lose his own soul lose everything in the life to come
1961255 therefore let all israel be assured of this god has made this jesus whom you crucified both lord and christ when the people heard this they were cut to the heart and said to peter and the other apostles brothers what shall we do peter replied repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit the promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off for all whom the lord our god will call with many other words he warned them save yourselves from this corrupt generation those who accepted his message were baptized and about three thousand souls were added to their number that day
1961256 have i done all three things that are outlined here in the book of acts in order to obtain the salvation of my soul
1961257 when the people heard this they were cut to the heart and said to peter and the other apostles brothers what shall we do
1961258 peter replied repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins
1961259 peter replied repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins
1961260 they devoted themselves to the apostles teachings and to the fellowship to the breaking of bread and to prayer
1961261 all the believers were together and had everything in common selling their possessions and goods they gave to anyone as he had need
1961262 all the believers were together and had everything in common
1961263 then peter said ananias how is it that satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the holy spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land
1961264 didnt it the land belong to you before it was sold
1961265 didnt it belong to you before it was sold and after it was sold wasnt the money at your disposal
1961266 selling their possessions and goods they gave to anyone as he had need
1961267 what are the needs of others how can i meet them
1961268 do unto others as you would have them do unto you

1961270 oh whoops miscarried 2 i guess i should get tested done so that i wait another f ing year to get pregnant again and do something to prevent aborting 3
1961271 why conservatives work harder feel happier have closer families take fewer drugs give more generously value honesty more are less materialistic and envious whine less and even hug their children more than liberals
1961272 do as i say not as i do profiles in liberal hypocrisy
1961273 these do as i say liberals dont actually trust their ideas enough to apply them at home
1961274 instead when it comes to the things that matter most in their personal lives they tend to behave ironically more like conservatives than liberals which can only make one wonder if their liberal prescriptions dont really work for them as individuals how can they work for the rest of us
1961275 it is my contention that liberalism and conservatism are not simply political ideologies but represent divergent ways of life
1961276 for those on both sides their political views are just the tip of an encompassing worldview that addresses the biggest questions about life this worldview influences the decisions they make about family work community and life
1961277 looking at data gathered by the most authoritative and reliable academic research centers in the country as well as academic studies published in refereed journals a pattern emerged that has until now been completely ignored when compared to conservatives on a long list of personality and moral traits modern liberals consistently come up short
1961278 liberalism not only leads to social decay but can also lead to personal decay
1961279 liberalism promotes a way of thinking a way of life and a pattern of living that are destructive on many levels

1961295 rumors that barack obama was a secret muslim whose patriotism was questionable first appeared on blogs and in e mail messages
1961296 in march the rumors began to show up in the press though only minimally
1961297 barry baracks nickname was muslim he was registered as a muslim because his father was muslim
1961298 senator obama has never been a muslim was not raised a muslim and is a committed christian
1961299 obama was born a muslim to a non practicing muslim father and for some years had a reasonably muslim upbringing under the auspices of his indonesian stepfather
1961300 interviews with dozens of former classmates teachers neighbors and friends
1961301 was not a regular practicing muslim when he was in indonesia
1961302 motorcycle family who come together and associate with one another and the police have it all wrong
1961303 the olympic games opened in beijing at 8 minutes past 8 00 pm on august 8th 2008
1961304 he hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
1961305 if he wanted to kill senator obama he simply would shoot him with a sniper rifle but then he claimed that he was just joking
1961306 im afraid like all fathers are afraid for their children its like all other sports its more dangerous than playing chess if thats considered a sport but i dont think its more dangerous than horseback riding and riding competitions
1961307 he killed his first animal at 6 he already has scars you dont teach a child to kill at age 6 the role of a parent is to protect their child these parents are not protecting their child they are making him take risks
1961308 i think he has a really great career ahead of him
1961309 als het gouden leeuw project straks eenmaal is afgerond krijgen we feitelijk een prachtig stuk nieuwe openbare ruimte in het centrum van venray dat leent zich prima voor een vergroting van de kermis
1961310 hier zouden overigens geen twintig attracties moeten komen te staan ik denk eerder aan vijf grote
1961311 we gaan dit de komende tijd met de kermisexploitanten en hun bonden bespreken ook moet er nog gekeken naar de kwaliteitsgarantie voor de omgeving een punt waar we de afgelopen jaren op het huidige kermisterrein ook veel energie in hebben gestoken
1961312 of course my dog is trained watch this fido chase that squirrel fido bark at those children fido sniff that other dogs butt see he does everything i tell him
1961313 the choice of acting to provide the time of death

1961315 it is therefore far more plausible to suggest that a liking for chocolate and its effects on mood are due mainly to its principal constituents sugar and fat and their related orosensory and nutritional effects
1961316 it is astounding how all the courts try to evade the question of personhood of a chimp as much as they can
1961317 the question is are chimps things without interests or persons with interests
1961318 i frequently run into cases in which people attack china for its human rights abuses but are unaware that overall things are much much much better than in the past violations of rights are serious and china has a long way to go but its worth noting that its also come a very very long way
1961319 fascism should more properly be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
1961320 maaan it really sucks when special interests co opt the power of government for themselves
1961321 yeah wed better do our best to severely limit the power of government to make it harder for corporations and other organizations to use that power for their own interests
1961322 hold on we have to take a breather here take a closer look at the science and get back to you in five to ten years
1961323 maaan it really sucks when special interests co opt the power of government for themselves
1961324 yeah wed better do our best to severely limit the power of government to make it harder for corporations and other organizations to use that power for their own interests
1961325 love is never glad when others go wrong love finds no pleasure in injustice but rejoices in the truth love is always slow to expose it knows how to be silent love is always eager to believe the best about a person love is full of hope full of patient endurance love never fails
1961326 all of us in the animal welfare community are very grateful to irving animal services the irving police and to the dallas county district attorneys office for their diligence in pursuing and prosecuting this case
1961327 thanks to their efforts dallas county is sending a clear message that animal cruelty will not be tolerated and that those who abuse animals will go to jail for their crimes

1961350 however it is estimated that there are 2 000 2 500 hiv positive cases nationwide
1961351 the prevalence of hiv in afghanistan is currently considered low
1961352 the number of sexual assaults on children in northern afghanistan has seen a significant increase
1961353 in order to safeguard children and babies the interior ministry has begun a series of crackdowns that up to now have generated positive results
1961354 we are trying to find out more about the case
1961355 we are very concerned we have had many cases of rapes in northern afghanistan children are being sexually exploited and we need to protect their rights
1961356 just before our love got lost you said i am as constant as the northern star and i said constantly in the darkness wheres that at if you want me ill be in the bar

1961359 the improvements in quality and coverage of health services in afghanistan since 2002 are truly exceptional
1961360 the number of functioning health facilities has tripled and there has been nearly a four fold increase in the number of out patient visits third party assessments also show a large improvement in the quality of care
1961361 in afghanistan we have seen that health facilities that are run by ngos perform much better than facilities managed by the government
1961362 they have more flexibility there is little political interference which means they can recruit the best qualified staff and they dont have to follow often rigid civil service rules and regulations
1961363 they distribute threatening leaflets to residents warning them not to send their children to school or face the consequences
1961364 we have begun a wide campaign to raise peoples awareness
1961365 peoples responsiveness has increased in comparison to previous years and they have started to protect their schools we have set up councils and weve succeeded in reopening schools in some areas
1961366 since last year when i was attending the third grade our school has been closed we hope it will reopen soon
1961367 im very upset that our school is closed we ask why are schools in other areas open but in our area they are locked we want our schools to be reopened
1961368 its a huge task because we are still facing the problem of looting
1961369 we know that objects are going to pakistan and on to the international market its very urgent work if we dont do something now it will be too late
1961370 people are so poor they are just looking for ways to buy bread we need to open their minds as they dont know the value of their history we have to give them that knowledge and then they will protect it
1961371 hezb e islami and taliban and other extremists might use explosives and blow up this stone
1961372 undoubtedly it is one of the finest in the world of this period
1961373 i dont want just to participate i am going to china to win a medal
1961374 i started my specific training six months ago including a preparation trip to south korea i train six hours a day to develop speed physical training and technique
1961375 i discovered taekwondo 11 years ago and i liked it from the beginning
1961376 when i was a child i saw a lot of martial arts movies i choose taekwondo because it focuses on kicking and i like kicking
1961377 its the first time ever that afghans qualify in any sport for the olympics with their technique and results before they just had wildcards
1961378 now their minds and bodies are ready they will try to do the best for a medal
1961379 afghanistan has never won a medal in the olympics it will be the first one ever
1961380 national team members only receive 16 dollars a month from the government
1961381 narcotics are a big problem in this country if people do sport they dont use narcotics or cigarettes i wish the government would support sport to keep young people away from drugs
1961382 when i got the silver medal hundreds of new people came to do taekwondo all teachers in the clubs were calling me to thank me i hope to do the same after beijing
1961383 this transaction allows medianews to manage its balance sheet during a challenging economic environment
1961384 life is just passing one day starving one day a full stomach
1961385 how do we tackle this problem before it turns into a major fire an epidemic
1961386 to recruit a doctor willing to work with drug users is a nightmare
1961387 but i have heard its a dangerous sickness and can kill you ive heard from some people that its even more dangerous than cancer
1961388 unless sales improve or the industry is willing to accept lower profitability in the future the companies evidently would have no choice but to consider even further spending cuts
1961389 the mission is to regenerate afghanistans historic areas and revive the traditional economy
1961390 were working in the middle of kabul the very centre of the centre and theres just a chance that if you can give some kind of economic underpinning to murad khane an economic purpose an educational purpose it might act as a catalyst for the rest of the city and the rest of afghanistan
1961391 what we need is a patient approach to development here
1961392 i think it has to do with having smaller more discreet projects and if you could replicate that across the board rather than having huge programs which cost hundreds of millions of dollars having smaller lower risk projects then you might achieve something
1961393 if you look at this neighbourhood and other parts of the old city it is absolutely important to keep and preserve these buildings not just because theyre beautiful buildings but theres a connection between the people now and the people in the past
1961394 if you look at the history of afghanistan if you look at the culture that still exists and is expressed in these neighbourhoods it is a quite important and serious project for all afghanistan not just for kabul
1961395 were not taking on the whole world and not trying to change the world overnight
1961396 the only prudent thing to do is to take it one step at a time
1961397 weve been violated we cant live our lives we cant sit we cant sleep at night
1961398 this is just an example among thousands of other cases
1961399 women and girls especially young girls are the most unprotected people of afghanistan they are raped kidnapped and murdered
1961400 she wakes up in the middle of the night screaming
1961401 her arms legs her body she is always tense and frightened
1961402 i have one question for mr karzai if this was your little girl what would you do
1961403 these criminals are never brought to justice because police and government authorities are either involved or they cant handle the crimes
1961404 with criminals and warlords in the political scene we cannot expect justice to be served
1961405 in many cases of violence against children there is a sense of impunity people continue to violate childrens rights without any sense of feeling that they will be held accountable
1961406 i cant think of any country in the world in which children suffer more than in afghanistan
1961407 in all our meetings with children it takes a lot of time to make them smile that to me shows that there is not happiness in their hearts
1961408 even if they had the laws it is impossible to implement
1961409 ultimately we see that newspapers have strong opportunities to enter these new areas of businesses and expect to see a great deal of new activity in this field it will go beyond building a few vertical directories the challenge as the wsj article correctly points out is to get their sales and support activity to scale
1961410 so what i can get that crap on any aggregate browser home page
1961411 not zell whos trying to innovate as fast as he can
1961412 tribunes employees would be a lot better off trying to understand whats really happening to their industry and papers and redirecting their energy toward improving their newspapers and web sites to make them more interesting and attractive to readers and advertisers
1961413 whats happening in the newspaper business is peanuts compared to the hardships being felt in many other industries some journalists with the advantage of having a platform are wallowing in self pity over issues that millions of other workers have faced and are facing
1961414 youre not going to run zell out of the company the bankers may but the rank and file wont
1961415 youd be much better off continuing to create the quality journalism youre so rightly proud of and constantly working to find ways to better serve customers

1961424 marais uses non traditional materials to celebrate a non western cultural tradition no wonder we stop and gape at these beautiful exotic and momentarily disturbing shapes and images
1961425 other garden visitors were surprised to find me on my hand and knees pervertedly looking under the skirts of anja marais
1961426 there was no bigger fan of that show than me im very excited to be able to put a new twist on it
1961427 it is better to lose your pride with someone you love rather than to lose that someone you love with your useless pride
1961428 because it seems that the word tends to be interpreted in a million different ways depending on whos using it and why
1961429 and one would think that as adults we should be above all that but its a tradition something weve learned from our parents or people around us
1961430 i brought you this hope youll feel better soon and if you need anything at all just let me know ok
1961431 it means nothing when we werent speaking i didnt think we would ever go back to being friends again and it took a long time to get back to where we were

1961443 havent you read that at the beginning the creator made them male and female for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and the two will become one flesh so they are no longer two but one therefore what god has joined together let man not separate
1961444 but for adam no suitable helper was found so the lord god caused the man to fall into a deep sleep and while he was sleeping he took one of the mans ribs and closed up the place with flesh then the lord god made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man and he brought her to the man the man said this in now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman for she was taken out of man for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and they will become one flesh
1961445 o well if my marriage doesnt work out ill just get a divorce
1961446 is it lawful to divorce for any and every reason
1961447 why then did moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away
1961448 the disciples said to him if this is the situation between a husband and wife it is better not to marry jesus replied not everyone can accept this word but only those to whom it has been given for some are eunuchs because they were born that way others were made that way by men and others have renounced marriage because of the kingdom of heaven the one who can accept this should accept it

1961455 unless there is a definite evacuation plan they should not build a bsl 4 lab on plum island
1961456 any evacuation plan for an area is whatever evacuation plans are already in place for any purpose such as a hurricane
1961457 we dont modify an areas evacuation plan we dont know the local details
1961458 we dont believe there would be any scenarios requiring evacuation
1961459 pathogens at the lab would be in such minuscule quantities that any scenario that would cause the cells to become airborne the cells would be so dispersed they would not infect people we wont have to evacuate chances of ever having to do that are practically nonexistent
1961460 you cannot have a bsl 4 facility without an integrated emergency management plan
1961461 this is a real issue for local emergency management services they need to be prepared to respond and they need to be prepared to work with homeland security
1961462 i oppose putting the new nbaf on plum island and value dhss assurances the island is not a suitable location for bsl 4 research

1961483 for this we need the political commitment of states international cooperation and the support and good will of the public at large to create and implement a range of intensely practical programmes designed and undertaken in consultation with indigenous peoples themselves
1961484 i observe with concern the human rights violations suffered by members of the charco la pava community such as arbitrary displacement from their lands loss of housing and destruction of agricultural crops and other abuses such as the excessive use of force and detaining of members of the community that have opposed the construction of the hydroelectric project including women and children
1961485 there are around a million indigenous people in colombia belonging to more than 80 different indian american groups with over 60 separate languages nearly all of these groups have been victims of forced displacement or are threatened by it as a result of the internal armed conflict
1961486 in many cases losing their territory and moving into the entirely foreign environment of the cities threatens the very survival of the group and its individual members
1961487 indigenous peoples are among the first to suffer from increasingly harsh and erratic weather conditions and a generalized lack of empowerment to claim goods and services to which other population groups have greater access
1961488 indigenous communities are often the custodians of unique knowledge and skills and the genetic and biological diversity in plant and animal production that may be vital in adapting to climate change approximately 80 per cent of the worlds remaining biodiversity is found within indigenous peoples territories

1961520 i believe that the actions of the local naval command to withhold information of the leakage of the nuclear elements into guam waters over a two year period is inexcusable and unacceptable and as such today i am sending off a letter to the commander of the naval forces in the pacific admiral keating in hawaii for the removal of the local naval command
1961521 i have been updated on the status of the u s s houston incident i was told that the valve leakage has occurred since 2006 which extended the number of locations which were potentially impacted the governments of malaysia and republic of singapore were also informed that the u s s houston made port calls in those countries during this period in addition it is believed that this small amount of weepage from the valve and the subsequent tests of apra harbor by the u s navy indicate that the leakage of water from the submarine did not harm the environment or place the residents of guam or crew in danger i will continue to work to ensure the safety of the residents of guam as well as the sailors on board our nuclear submarine force i have requested and will receive a more comprehensive briefing from the u s department of energy which has shared oversight on the safe operation of the u s navys nuclear propulsion program i also want to further explore how this defective valve went unnoticed during previous maintenance or while the ship was in service
1961522 this resolution expands the range of restrictive measures adopted by the u n security council
1961523 show restraint when granting new public loans for trade with iran to also be vigilant on activities taken by financial institutions with banks based in iran

1961525 the only thing i can say with any certainty is that the nrcs actions continue to send a clear message to all nuclear employees to never challenge any management decisions

1961548 this means striving to push away all distractions that make you think of something other that the prayer itself and warding off thoughts that keep your mind off the purpose of the prayer this is something which differs from one person to another because the extent of waswas whispering insinuating has to do with extent of ones doubts and desires and the heart s focus and dependence on what it loves and its efforts to avoid what it dislikes
1961549 if the heart is corrupted by negligence or insinuating whispers from ash shaytan the worship of the body s faculties will also be corrupted the heart is like a king and the faculties are like his troops who follow his orders and go where they are commanded if the king is deposed his followers are lost which is like what happens when the heart does not worship properly

1961554 trinity was an innocent and random victim of identity theft apparently so were four or five other county residents whose names and addresses were stolen and used as addresses on drug packages

1961556 we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
1961557 we could have gotten the mayor to put the dogs away and consent to a search
1961558 i would have let them stay in a yard by themselves with those dogs
1961559 it really upsets me to think that i dont feel safe in my home if they were to shoot our dog amber i would be outraged
1961560 he was hunted down and shot in the back while he fled
1961561 they didnt deserve to die they dont deserve to be blamed for their deaths

1961573 tell secretary baker that im with you 100 percent we dont want big countries swallowing up small countries
1961574 our theory on that was to try to get them to do the right thing
1961575 it quickly became clear that his intentions were not honorable
1961576 we tried to convince him not to fool around with the rebellion in sierra leone
1961577 at the end of the day the client does what the client wants to do
1961578 they dont pay us to take our advice they pay us to listen to it
1961579 was less than confident that the yemenites were completely good actors

1961592 max winters poems operate in unpredictable ways they sound as if controlled by some prevailing logic and yet the reader is hurled forward line by line into unknown and unexpected worlds as the poems progress they mutate seamlessly they are awash in metaphor bold statements melt into one another constantly changing their terms of play a reader is tempted to ask is it a madman speaking but no upon closer examination we see the reasoning process however bizarre the horseshoe turns the breakaway ride from idea to idea and yet nothing detracts from the wonder of it all these are poems of great adventure and discovery and not just for the reader i suspect but for the poet as well
1961593 if you tolerate this then your children will be next

1961638 the growing change in attitude towards funerals has given us new ideas of how we can design funeral arrangements that celebrate the life of someone departed and as society changes we are changing with them to meet their needs

1961645 we have made several changes to our website so that our policies and guarantees are easily visible in numerous locations across our website eliminating unjust expectations bloomexs business model continually permits them to provide the freshest flowers possible at the lowest price
1961646 through its harmonized network of growers and company owned facilities bloomex is able to provide fresh cut flowers at significantly reduced costs to the consumer
1961647 since bloomex is canadian owned the flowers being shipped to their destination would be in transit for hours instead of days keeping their freshness and longevity wedding flowers have traditionally been a large expense and many couples could not afford real flowers with bloomexs combination of fresh cut flowers exceptionally low prices and new wedding program anyone can enjoy premium floral arrangements for that special day and not break the bank

1961668 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
1961669 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
1961670 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
1961671 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
1961672 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
1961673 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
1961674 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
1961675 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes

1961677 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
1961678 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
1961679 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
1961680 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
1961681 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
1961682 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
1961683 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing

1961688 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
1961689 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
1961690 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise

1961693 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
1961694 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
1961695 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you

1961697 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
1961698 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
1961699 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone

1961705 the part d program has proven to help seniors get access to the prescription drugs they need while holding down costs for beneficiaries and taxpayers
1961706 weve managed to offload an incredible amount of spending onto government but done so in a way that ensures the government cant use its size or regulatory power to cut spending growth or produce a manageable moral health system
1961707 its not at all clear that when people dont buy health insurance they are imposing costs on the rest of us
1961708 would remove the employers incentive to provide coverage and could potentially unravel the current system
1961709 buttress the traditional source of health insurance which is employers
1961710 libertarians may have plenty of other grounds to criticize mccain on but on health care mccain is advocating a libertarian vision
1961711 r ather than creating a special plan just for the 130 000 uninsured why not use the tax money to subsidize the purchase of health insurance plans that already exist in the marketplace isnt that a better use of resources

1961836 these words i have spoken to you so that you do not stumble
1961837 they shall put you out of the congregations but an hour is coming when everyone who kills you shall think he is rendering service to elohim
1961838 and this they shall do to you because they did not know the father nor me
1961839 but i have said these words to you so that when the hour comes you remember that i told them to you and these words i did not say to you at the beginning for i was with you
1961840 but now i go away to him who sent me and not one of you asks me where are you going
1961841 but because i have said these words to you grief has filled your heart
1961842 but i say the truth to you it is better for you that i go away for if i do not go away the helper shall not come to you at all but if i go i shall send him to you
1961843 and having come he shall reprove1 the world concerning sin 2 and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment footnotes 1or confute or prove wrong 22 chr 24 20 neh 9 30 ezek 36 27 mic 3 8 acts 28 25 27
1961844 i still have many words to say to you but you are not able to bear them now
1961845 but when he comes the spirit of the truth he shall guide you into all the truth for he shall not speak from himself but whatever he hears he shall speak and he shall announce to you what is to come
1961846 he shall esteem me for he shall take of what is mine and announce it to you
1961847 all that the father has is mine that is why i said that he takes from what is mine and announces it to you
1961848 a little while and you do not see me and again a little while and you shall see me
1961849 what is this that he says to us a little while and you do not see me and again a little while and you shall see me and because i am going to the father
1961850 what is this that he says a little while we do not know what he is saying
1961851 are you asking one another about what i said a little while and you do not see me and again a little while and you shall see me
1961852 truly truly i say to you that you shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and you shall be grieved but your grief shall become joy
1961853 the woman has grief when she is in labour because her hour has come but as soon as she has given birth to the child she no longer remembers the affliction for joy that a man was born into the world
1961854 and you therefore have grief now but i shall see you again and your heart shall rejoice and no one takes your joy away from you
1961855 and in that day you shall ask me none at all truly truly i say to you whatever you ask the father in my name he shall give you
1961856 until now you have asked naught in my name ask and you shall receive in order that your joy might be complete
1961857 these words i have spoken to you in figures of speech but an hour is coming when i shall no longer speak to you in figures of speech but i shall declare the father plainly to you
1961858 in that day you shall ask in my name and i do not say to you that i shall pray the father on your behalf
1961859 i came forth from the father and have come into the world again i leave the world and go to the father
1961860 see now you are speaking plainly and not using figure of speech
1961861 now we know that you know all and have no need that anyone should question you by this we believe that you came forth from elohim
1961862 see an hour is coming and has now come that you are scattered each to his own and leave me alone

1961948 likewise i express profound concern that the situation is apparently deteriorating and given the presence of an armed police force in the area the situation could worsen and place the lives and physical integrity of the members of the charco la pava community at risk also i have received information that the company is moving forward without the control or supervision of government authorities in light of this situation i urgently appeal to panama to adopt all the necessary measures to 1 protect the rights and freedoms of the affected indigenous communities 2 seriously investigate the alleged violations of human rights and punish those responsible 3 repair any damage caused to the victims and 4 adopt the necessary measures to prevent the reoccurrence of similar acts

1961969 provisions to stem foreclosures are helpful but a greater lift to the economy should come from higher mortgage limits enhancements to the fha loan program and the first time home buyer tax credit
1961970 these are excellent tools that will help buyers get into the market to take advantage of the unprecedented drop in home prices in many areas as well as a wide selection of inventory to make an investment in their future
1961971 buyers entering the hardest hit markets in some cases with multiple bid offers may have put a floor on prices
1961972 in addition rising commodity prices and higher construction costs have resulted in a very unusual market today with existing home prices being less than replacement building costs in some areas home prices are projected to increase 3 to 6 percent in 2009
1961973 builders need to further cut production to help trim inventory however new home sales are expected to bottom around the second quarter of next year with slight gains in the second half of 2009

1962081 iya bu tadi devi dipanggil oleh kelompoknya bunga dan dilabrak bu
1962082 kalau memang ada yang harus marah mestinya saya dong bu yang marah
1962083 ada yang bilang ah bagusan juga hpku udah megapixelnya lebih besar 3g lagi
1962084 trus ada juga yang bilang aku gak nyangka vi ternyata diam diam begitu kamu tuh muna ya
1962085 ibu tahu devi tuh anak yang sabar terlalu sabar malah ada masanya di mana devi tuh harus bisa tegas dan gak langsung mengalah gitu aja
1962086 apa nggak akan muncul lagi walaupun dalam bentuk yang berbeda
1962087 ada saat saat di mana devi harus bisa mempertahankan diri tidak harus selalu mengalah
1962088 kalau devi ingin masalah ini cepat selesai ya devi bicara dengan kelompoknya nina dan kita cari titik temunya
1962089 dulu waktu di kelas 7 kalau saya cerita tentang kelompoknya bunga agak susah bu nyebut namanya satu satu jadi disebut geng senorita aja bu
1962090 baik masalah nama geng itu rasanya gak terlalu penting deh ibu jadi sedih dan kecewa ternyata kalian gak bisa menyelesaikan masalah dengan baik masa hanya karena masalah hp terus kalian jadi pecah
1962091 sebenarnya kita udah nyoba bu kemarin nanya ke devi kenapa dia nyebar nyebarin ke anak kelas lain tentang masalah ini
1962092 oh jadi nanya baik baik tuh pake muka sinis gitu muka judes gitu
1962093 menyelesaikan masalah tuh harus dengan kepala dingin bukan hati yang panas
1962094 nak ibu tuh sebenarnya berharap kalau ada masalah seperti ini kalian bisa menyelesaikan sendiri dengan baik karena ini masalah yang gak terlalu rumit tapi kalau kalian gak bisa kenapa gak datang ke ibu
1962095 ok ibu sarankan kalau ada yang mau pinjam hp temannya tanya dulu boleh gak dipakai buat berfoto karena barang itu bukan milik kalian
1962096 kita tuh kasihan sama ibu kan udah banyak masalah sama anak anak yang lain
1962097 itu udah kewajiban ibu sebagai wali kelas cha kalian semua anak anak ibu
1962098 kalian cerita ke teman tentang masalah kalian boleh boleh aja tapi hati hati seperti sekarang devi akhirnya disindir sindir oleh teman kalian yang mungkin gak ngerti masalahnya itu berarti mereka berpihak tanpa tahu permasalahan yang sebenarnya karena kalian cerita dengan versi masing masing
1962099 terus gimana dong sekarang mau dilanjut lagi masalahnya atau mau diselesaikan
1962100 ok kalau mau diselesaikan gimana nih kayaknya udah gak ada masalah kan

1962478 if a woman walks around exposing herself then of course a man will look at her and of course he will have certain thoughts no matter who he is or where he is from yes it is his role to look away and islam says this but it is also the womans role not to dangle her beauty in front of his face and make it more difficult this works the other way too did you know that men can not expose any part of their body from the navel down to the knee they also cant wear tight clothing just like women that would suggest any private areas and women have to make sure to be just as modest and lower their gaze

1962489 fantastic misgovernment of the kind we have seen is not an accident nor is it the work of a few bad individuals it is the consequence of triumph by a particular philosophy of government by a movement that understands the liberal state as a perversion and considers the market the ideal nexus of human society this movement is friendly to industry not just by force of campaign contributions but by conviction it believes in entrepreneurship not merely in commerce but in politics and the inevitable results of its ascendance are first the capture of the state by business and second all that follows incompetence graft and all the other wretched flotsam that weve come to expect from washington

1962623 shes started out in sociology which is how i got her when she changed majors she wanted to stay with me i worked it with the english department shes a very special girl
1962624 sarah confided many things to me she took the job there as a way to study the lower classes and what they have to do to make ends meet single mothers girls with substance abuse problems and yes i know there are those who are business women they treat dancing as a job sarah made that all very clear in a paper she did for me last year i have a copy if it would help you
1962625 no one had seen her dancing perhaps and mentioned it to you
1962626 it is possible that doctor larson knows he was teaching her creative writing class hes big on creative visualization other creativity exercises and writing what you know part of sarahs change from sociology to english was a desire to tell the stories of those shed met on the job
1962627 i think so the paper she did for me was more than literate which made it exceptional ive not talked to doctor larson but he had to read samples of her work before he let her into his program so i assume she passed muster
1962628 her roommate said shes been spending a lot of time on campus and that shed recently broken up with her boyfriend do you know if shes seeing anyone here
1962629 i dont i know the boyfriend was escorted off campus a couple weeks ago hed followed her to the library and was disruptive
1962630 i have him on my list to talk to ill add doctor larson to that list could i get a copy of her schedule
1962631 not without a warrant im afraid the only reason i can turn over her paper is because you could pull it from the library we do try to protect our students
1962632 what is it like to be there at club flesh watching people sink what
1962633 thats not a game i play single mothers sure there are plenty of them among dancers name another job where you can clear a grand a night chatting and dancing girls with substance abuse problems sure but name me a business where that isnt the case and folks sinking why is it that people who choose to indulge in carnal pursuits who admit to being simulated by the sight and touch of beautiful women unattainable though they may be are somehow beneath those who dont i know its the puritanical history of this country its fundamentalism that criminalizes natural urges that judgment is just a means of social control it makes people into demons

1962683 counsels explanation for not filing the motion was in his words
1962684 an approach that drew the jurys attention to aspects of defendants personal history that were never testified to this inevitably invited the jury to speculate about matters that were not in evidence although under the circumstances of this case we conclude the impropriety was not prejudicial
1962685 to relieve a defendant of criminal liability an intervening cause must be an unforeseeable and extraordinary occurrence citation the defendant remains criminally liable if either the possible consequence might reasonably have been contemplated or the defendant should have foreseen the possibility of harm of the kind that could result from his act
1962686 a juvenile adjudication may be used as a strike to enhance an adult offenders sentence notwithstanding the absence of the right to a jury trial in delinquency proceedings
1962687 appellant was not removed from his mothers physical custody this
1962688 defendants trial counsel delayed johnsons first trial date because counsel was engaged in trial on another matter and because he felt his other cases had precedence over johnsons on all later trial dates johnsons trial counsel based his requests for continuance only on conflicting trial schedules of his other clients he was thus engaging in case management to johnsons detriment here jacksons trial counsel before the statutory deadline passed initially announced ready for trial although he said he might be engaged in trial on another case he thereafter became engaged in that other trial while jacksons counsel was engaged in the other matter sutton and jacksons trial trailed day to day until their case was transferred for trial on september 25 six days after the 60 day deadline in section 1382 a situation such as this in which trial counsel is presently engaged in another matter and the matter before the court trails for a minimal number of days is thus distinguishable from johnson trial counsel here was actually in trial on another matter and was not delaying this matter so that he could try other cases ahead of it
1962689 in order to present a cua defense to the jury a defendant must have obtained a recommendation to use medical marijuana prior to his or her arrest however that recommendation need not specify an approved dosage or amount of marijuana that may be possessed a doctors opinion that the amount in the defendants possession meets his or her personal medical needs may be proffered at trial
1962690 listening to actually sic what is being said versus what is being interpreted
1962691 our decision today does not imply that exclusion of bilinguals from jury service is wise or even that it is constitutional in all cases it is a harsh paradox that one may become proficient enough in english to participate in trial citation only to encounter disqualification because he knows a second language as well
1962692 we conclude the prosecutors spanish speaking justification was unconstitutionally racially based
1962693 rule 11 b is there for the defendants benefit so it seems quite noble at first for the u s attorney to stick up for defendants rights but this generosity comes at a steep price the u s attorney has already arraigned defendants on superseding indictments that specifically charge a violation of 8 u s c 1326 b 2 which is punishable by twenty years in prison this is eighteen years more than the two year maximum sentence available under defendants original indictments which did not charge any conduct that could increase the maximum penalty above two years
1962694 the circumstance that petitioner did not object personally when defense counsel consented to a continuance serves to distinguish the present case from johnson supra 26 cal 3d 557 if petitioner personally had objected to the one or two days continuance contemplated by her counsel she might have been offered alternative counsel who could be ready for immediate trial as the trial court itself recognized because she did not object that option was not explored in the absence of an objection she is not entitled to dismissal

1962729 statement first then question i recently stepped down from worship at our church i couldnt get along with the worship pastor at all he had no vision for us to go or grow he was stuck in the 80s and 90s and he had nothing to teach the other worship leaders after numerous meetings and suggestions on things to do i gave up and decided for the best of everyone that i remove myself from the situation well 3 days letter he decided that he isnt the one to continue after 6 years leading the church into this new direction were headed the pastor has been trying to get the guy to step down for 2 years too so its good for everyone now the senior pastor has decided that in this transition time he will oversee the worship ministry which is fine although scary but he wants to turn the worship into specific teams operating together instead of the random rotation weve been doing so what he wants to do is stick all the worship leaders in one room we had 4 including me and the worship pastor but the senior pastor has added 2 more and the worship pastor has decided hed like to continue at least leading so that makes 5 worship leaders not including me because i stepped down so the senior pastor wants to stick the 5 worship leaders in a room with himself and hash out 5 seperate teams so that way the senior pastor only has to schedule worship leaders and not musicians hopefully thats clear as mud so now the question what are your thoughts on specific teams for worship where you always play with the same people more info the old worship pastor let anybody on the stage so we have brutal drummers who shouldnt even be allowed to hold chopsticks and singers who constantly break even the plastic communion cups when singing thats a little dramatic of course i told the senior pastor what he needs to do is disband the entire worship ministry bring in a new worship pastor and then let that guy start from scratch where people have to do auditions and all that

1962789 had shuttled rezkos family back from puerto vallarta mexico on april 3 2004 after they both vacationed there separately but did meet up for dinner rezko was not on the flight because he left april 1 to arrange an april 3 party for an iraqi billionaire he hoped to do business with court documents have identified that billionaire as nadhmi auchi
1962790 co investor in a rezko project and then the head of the illinois office of central management services

1962793 the democratic point man on budget issues in 2000 trotter and obama vied to unseat u s rep bobby rush but didnt come close to toppling the south side congressman
1962794 this is a different reception than one held at the four seasons hotel where blagojevich was present
1962795 illinois lt gov pat quinn headed a welcoming delegation that greeted auchi when his private plane touched down at chicagos midway airport
1962796 we talked mainly about the late king hussein of jordan and queen noor recalled quinn who rode downtown with auchi and his family he said he later attended a party for auchi held at rezkos home
1962797 as he has said previously senator obama does not recall meeting nadhmi auchi at any time or on any occasion and this includes any event that may have been held for mr auchi senator and mrs obama have no recollection of attending any such event
1962798 sen obama does not recall meeting nadhmi auchi at any time or on any occasion and this includes any event that may have been held for mr auchi
1962799 obama denies helping auchi in any way with his visa in 2005
1962800 that would seem to leave an out for the lawyerly senator but is inconclusive otherwise
1962801 two sources familiar with the gathering the obamas attended the wilmette reception which came less than a month after obamas democratic primary win on march 16 2004 for his u s senate seat rezko had been a key fund raiser for obama who has since given to charity nearly 160 000 in rezko linked contributions
1962802 if he had met auchi at the party levine said mr
1962803 i didnt know pat quinn had dinner with stuart levine and tony rezko at his house
1962804 obama memory lapse rezko trial testimony contradicts past obama statements
1962805 governments star witness in the rezko trial about the party honoring nadhmi auchi a british citizen who is appealing a fraud conviction in france obama said he didnt recall the event
1962806 i mean this has been i guess four years ago
1962807 my understanding through his lawyer mr auchi doesnt recall meeting me
1962808 i just dont have a recollection of the event as i said i was in the middle of running a u s senate race so you know i was speaking all the time probably six seven eight times a day

1962816 ketika anak anak punk sudah menganggap ngaji sebagai kebutuhan mereka mengirim pesan singkat sms malam ini ngaji nggak yang jelas saya tidak ingin mereka merasa sedang diarahkan untuk masuk sebuah pergerakan atau kelompok harakah tertentu saat ini pengajian kami memang belum ada namanya paling paling teman teman menyebut pengajian ini pengajiannya punk moeslem
1962817 harapan saya ke depan mereka dapat menjadi agen perubahan bagi teman teman yang lain

1962829 scientific computing is just number crunching which the ps3s are very good at given the cell processor and deploying them in a cluster
1962830 right now one limitation is the 256 megabyte random access memory constraint but it might be possible to retrofit more ram we just havent cracked the case and explored that option yet another problem lies in limited speed for double precision calculations required by scientific applications but announcements for the next generation cell processor address this issue

1962843 its an excellent gesture and i know it will get a lot of support from tribal people
1962844 we stand to profit from it in our physical health and well being
1962845 the reason i like it is that even if theres not a big native american market it gives people the impression there is a constituency that deserves attention
1962846 it reinforces the core of the nike brand which is if you have a body you are an athlete
1962847 arizona courts have clearly ruled that prison officials cannot stand in the way of the medical needs of women prisoners
1962848 its regrettable that we need to take extra steps to ensure that sheriff arpaio follows the law
1962849 the courts have already confirmed our position that arizona prison officials cannot ignore the medical needs of prisoners simply because they do not agree with the decision to end a pregnancy
1962850 now given the disregard of the court ruling by sheriff arpaio and his staff it appears that we need to spell out the law more clearly to protect future women detainees

1962902 ive never done this in 25 years as a journalist but im posting transcripts of my conversations with rob richer
1962903 rob can can only say from first hand knowledge that its from the white house that means either the office the presidents office or the nsc cia chief george tenet came back from the white house one day with essentially the memo sheet with the mission to create this fabricated letter
1962904 what i did on this book having worked with george on the last book is i said i need to go to people who have first hand active knowledge from their own actions of things that they did
1962905 i said look you guys are walking into the hottest fire you can imagine
1962906 the book is really about america finding its moral compass
1962907 much of its about the conflict between power and truth its really oddly about the american character at this moment we bled away some of this precious matter the moral authority that really underlies power in the world and how do you get that back i kind of wept as i wrote part of it
1962908 what you find is public rhetoric thats often lofty while its private practices are often low and ugly they two things ultimately become clear at some point americans are feeling a crazy disconnect

1963032 kanda apa gerangan makna kata kata kanda bahwa pernikahan adalah bukti cinta yang hakiki
1963033 wahai dinda bukti cinta adalah pengobanan namun bukanlah pengorbanan dalam kata yang orang orang ucapkan menyebrangi lautan api mendaki gunung yang tinggi dan apalah yang semuanya hanyalah bualan namun dengan nikah yang kita lakukan ini ketahuilah bahwa diantara kita telah terikat janji untuk mengarungi mahligai rumah tangga mahligai yang butuh bukti pengorbanan yang selalu lapang dalam menghadapi cobaan butuh pengertian dengan kesabaran untuk menerima apa adanya kekurangan dan kelebihan masing masing juga harus jujur dan adil dalam segala hal dan tentunya harus saling setia sehingga mahligai yang kita ciptakan mampu bertahan
1963034 ketahuilah dinda cara menjaga mahligai rumah tangga adalah hanya dengan taqwa yaitu takut kepada allah kanda takut hak dinda tidak terpenuhi oleh kewajiban kanda sebagai suami atau dinda takut hak kanda tidak terpenuhi oleh kewajiban dinda sebagai istri bekalan ini yang seharusnya kita pahami dinda

1963261 i stayed in the challenges until my body was where i wanted it to be
1963262 i wanted to see the muscles in my legs and wear a swimsuit something i had not worn in eight years
1963263 my confidence level is through the roof and that smile in my after pictures says that without a word
1963264 my body swelled to the point where i couldnt wear my size 20 clothing and my blood pressure was 190 109
1963265 i changed from being scared to saying im going to be ok
1963266 i was a sweaty red faced 223 pound woman in an extra large t shirt that wouldnt fit over my 51 inch hips
1963267 i was on a mission sorry everyone youll just have to get over the view or turn your going to do this with all i have
1963268 one day i did a calorie count on my free day of 8 000
1963269 it took me two to three days to recover from days like that
1963270 i began to eat more protein and vegetables drank a gallon of water a day and i limited my salt intake now i enjoy my free day but i dont live for it
1963271 the closer i get to the peak the harder it is give up now and ill miss the panoramic view from the top the top is the thrill you cant know until you get there
1963272 when i would do my cardio i would visualize climbing a mountain and reaching the peak or running in marathon and winning
1963273 i was depressed about the way my body looked and out of breath all the time
1963274 i had this negativity hanging over my head i was still in maternity clothes five months after giving birth i felt i should have been happier and that i was letting my family down i needed to do something to be healthy and to be a positive image for my child and my husband

1963276 theyd say how great i looked and asked me what i was doing to lose the weight thats when i went shopping for new gym attire and actually bought shorts and short sleeve shirts rather than continue wearing my oversize sweats
1963277 the main thing was that i had to plan ahead i couldnt just do it day by day id make a lot of recipes on the weekend to last me through the week i had the portable ready to drink shakes and a blender in my office
1963278 i also told everybody that i was doing this challenge to help keep me accountable i told co workers family and friends
1963279 i knew that if these people could do it normally people with busy lives i could too the short term pain was going to lead to long term gratification in my life
1963280 since i was so thoroughly disgusted with it i posted it next to my bed it was the last thing i looked at before going to bed and the first thing i looked at in the morning that kept me on track because i didnt want to look like that i needed to have it visual to have it out there in front of me
1963281 i was thrilled that i had met my goal and my energy level was amazing i was feeling really really great
1963282 i continued living that way from the beginning i knew this was a lifestyle change i wasnt looking for a quick fix
1963283 i was in shock it was such a great accomplishment for me and it was amazing that i was recognized for something i did for myself

1963291 modern buildings design wiring closets into their plans but these wiring closets in mattawan schools are former custodial closets book storing rooms or furnace rooms so weve been using those spaces but they are not secure or environmentally clean and they dont have their own power

1963297 our annual summit provides a forum for scientists from the private and public sectors as well as universities to share perspectives and learn about key developments in their field it is a dynamic exciting environment
1963298 there are similar sorts of forums around the country that we are competing with but what we are trying to provide here is an intimate venue with some world renown experts that really allow them to talk to each other and collaborate
1963299 someday this will make a great blog i will laugh about it later so i must live to tell the story

1963303 when the water treatment project came along we decided at that time that we were going to upgrade our controls to a more 20th century system
1963304 with the society that we now live in with the scare of terrorism the upgrades are a necessary to make sure that we are secure
1963305 i think mattawan is ahead of the curve especially with the new camera system
1963306 we will be a demo site for the new system everybody has entry alarms which will call you if doors open but very few places have camera systems that will send you the pictures off site

1963320 la bureautique a pris une place importante dans la structuration de nos changes professionnels le contenant limitant m me parfois le contenu la forme prenant parfois le pas sur le fond cela dit l preuve
1963321 the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated its as old as greek drama theres a catharsis everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good
1963322 im letting our respective teams work out the details i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what we are looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country and i think that people who supported a whole range of different candidates during the primaries are going to come out of that convention feeling absolutely determined that we have to take the white house back
1963323 if the party is speaking about unity they the clinton delegates believe the only way to unify the party is actually allowing them to vote moving beyond the convention if they were not allowed to vote there would be a lot of resentment
1963324 the chinese authorities refused to issue visas to ten of our members but this has not stopped us from making ourselves heard in beijing by means of a clandestine radio broadcast using miniaturised fm transmitters and antennas
1963325 reporters without borders devised and carried out this protest in a spirit of resistance against state control of the media
1963326 the first non state radio station to have broadcast in china since the communist party took power in 1949
1963327 the program in english french and mandarin was heard in on 104 4 fm in different districts of the chinese capital
1963328 oh dont vote for that obama guy that you want to vote for its all just celebrity hype like britney spears and paris hilton im the real presidential candidate look at me im an old white man clearly im the one with leadership potential

1963333 self defence is strongly needed stay indoors lock all doors and windows if an attacker enters your home use anything large to hit it with aim for the head to destroy the head is to destroy the body
1963334 what do you think about the opening ceremony last night
1963335 hey america im paris hilton and i am a celebrity too
1963336 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1963337 well why dont we do a hybrid of both candidates ideas
1963338 that way the offshore drilling carries us until the new technologies kick in
1963339 i never thought id say this but paris hiltons plan is sound
1963340 ive maintained all along that we need the best ideas of the political left the best of the right and the best of the center we need bipartisan ideas welded together if paris hilton gets into the act with her plan im all for it
1963341 so now well just have to see what britney has to say and maybe combine them both into a policy
1963342 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americans energy crisis
1963343 there are things that you can do individually though to save energy
1963344 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
1963345 but how much mileage should obama be getting about his claim about this issue aaa says for every pound of pressure your tires are under inflated you may be losing 2 percent of your mileage
1963346 and the u s department of transportation dot found that about a quarter of you commuters out there are running your tires a few puffs short of full pressure
1963347 so if you could fix that would it produce the savings obama is citing 3 or 4 percent in overall oil consumption
1963348 the answer is yes if you assume like the dot does at least eight pounds of under inflation for at least one tire per offender
1963349 just last year a put the fuel savings from getting all puffed up at more like 1 percent so obama is using legitimate estimates to make his claim but like the sticker says campbell your actual mileage may vary
1963350 t he bush administration estimates that expanded could increase oil production by 200 000 barrels per day by 2030
1963351 we use about 20 million barrels per day so that would meet about 1 of our demand two decades from now meanwhile efficiency experts say that keeping tires inflated can improve gas mileage 3 and regular maintenance can add another 4 many drivers already follow their advice but if everyone did we could immediately reduce demand several percentage points in other words obama is right
1963352 which may sound like a lot but amounts to only four tenths of one percent of the ocss 18 billion barrels further why is time not only putting out an absurdly low number but also talking about the year 2030 the implication seems to be that the oil wouldnt flow until then or maybe wouldnt peak until then but such a claim would be patently false
1963353 all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling

1963356 shes started out in sociology which is how i got her when she changed majors she wanted to stay with me i worked it with the english department shes a very special girl
1963357 sarah confided many things to me she took the job there as a way to study the lower classes and what they have to do to make ends meet single mothers girls with substance abuse problems and yes i know there are those who are business women they treat dancing as a job sarah made that all very clear in a paper she did for me last year i have a copy if it would help you
1963358 no one had seen her dancing perhaps and mentioned it to you
1963359 it is possible that doctor larson knows he was teaching her creative writing class hes big on creative visualization other creativity exercises and writing what you know part of sarahs change from sociology to english was a desire to tell the stories of those shed met on the job
1963360 i think so the paper she did for me was more than literate which made it exceptional ive not talked to doctor larson but he had to read samples of her work before he let her into his program so i assume she passed muster
1963361 her roommate said shes been spending a lot of time on campus and that shed recently broken up with her boyfriend do you know if shes seeing anyone here
1963362 i dont i know the boyfriend was escorted off campus a couple weeks ago hed followed her to the library and was disruptive
1963363 i have him on my list to talk to ill add doctor larson to that list could i get a copy of her schedule
1963364 not without a warrant im afraid the only reason i can turn over her paper is because you could pull it from the library we do try to protect our students
1963365 what is it like to be there at club flesh watching people sink what
1963366 thats not a game i play single mothers sure there are plenty of them among dancers name another job where you can clear a grand a night chatting and dancing girls with substance abuse problems sure but name me a business where that isnt the case and folks sinking why is it that people who choose to indulge in carnal pursuits who admit to being simulated by the sight and touch of beautiful women unattainable though they may be are somehow beneath those who dont i know its the puritanical history of this country its fundamentalism that criminalizes natural urges that judgment is just a means of social control it makes people into demons
1963367 bravo your point is well taken and makes you the perfect man to answer the question i was going to ask
1963368 how do you keep from going insane in that environment do you become so desensitized to sexuality that you dont notice i should think youd be in a constant state of arousal
1963369 someone working in a chocolate factory will eventually get sick and tired of chocolate
1963370 so youve sampled extensively and no longer have a taste for it
1963371 no i observe i watch the patterns others are excited by the packages i enjoy watching the byplay
1963372 its part of the job if i get distracted someone gets hurt ive seen the games being played i know how they end a friend once told me never fall in love with a stripper because at some point they all lie advice ive learned to cherish
1963373 but still it can be a pleasure to work in the chocolate factory cant it

1963383 instead of complaining about the state of the education system as we correct the same mistakes year after year ive got a better idea
1963384 university teachers should simply accept as variant spelling those words our students most commonly misspell
1963385 there are enormous advantages in having a coherent system of spelling
1963386 it makes it easier to communicate maybe during a learning phase there is some scope for error but i would hope that by the time people get to university they have learnt to spell

1963409 i met these guys who banded birds in canada last night and they had to lay these little nets to catch them and band them and then they let them go it seemed like they were romanticizing their boredom i heard that sometimes as a joke theyd throw these baby birds at each other so that the poop sac would explode on impact

1963423 the real innovation was understanding that ill health was a question of general lifestyle people had a very fatty meaty diet but their habits were deeply rooted in the physical and social environment they had to work at a very local level to gradually change peoples way of life working with health centers schools community organizations
1963424 they applied the same principle working with many organizations including sports clubs investing in facilities educating people that exercising more makes you well and happy

1963428 nobel prize winning behavioral economist daniel kahneman has found however that being wealthy is often a powerful predictor that people spend less time doing pleasurable things and more time doing compulsory things and feeling stressed
1963429 people who make less than 20 000 a year for example told kahneman and his colleagues that they spend more than a third of their time in passive leisure watching television for example those making more than 100 000 spent less than one fifth of their time in this way putting their legs up and relaxing
1963430 rich people spent much more time commuting and engaging in activities that were required as opposed to optional the richest people spent nearly twice as much time as the poorest people in leisure activities that were active structured and often stressful shopping child care and exercise

1963434 ken hagin did not preach the extreme wof message when he ministered at my dads church to the best of my memory and knowledge he preached faith and what can be achieved if ones faith in god is exercised and practiced as a regular part of any believers life ken hagin was a gentleman he would never have preached kenyons teachings at my dads church because he knew my dad did not approve of same i think your statement a second one that was a core or stripped down message minus kenyons teachings accurately describes the relationship between my dad and ken hagin

1963773 id say its necessary just in case my husband forgets something and turns around to come home he does that on occasion
1963774 just press play but before you do remember that you can watch this but i have to put it back in my husbands secret porn stash
1963775 okay janet stop being so afraid im not going to try and take it you know me better than that
1963776 i dont have a problem with her performance this is nothing so he was having a little fun at his bachelor party
1963777 to think i was worried over nothing i feel so much better now ive been paranoid i suppose
1963778 wait a minute thats not a room in a club thats a hotel room no its not its a house party
1963779 he wasnt supposed to do that what in the fuck was going on that night
1963780 i guess you got your answer smack those phat asses hard player leave hand prints on those hoes pow pow one big booty for each hand
1963781 aaaw shit here we go now i see why she was wearing that devil costume lets get the real party started
1963782 that son of a bitch that sneaky trifling black son of a bitch
1963783 get on top sit on his face get on top sit on his face
1963784 this is your last time to play in any other piece of pussy playboy
1963785 everybody knows ds been with mystique since he had his first wet dream he never even sniffed no other pussy try something new suck this bitchs pussy til her face caves in
1963786 thats what i get for marrying a pretty boy you were never really down for me you were just out for ace number one fuck the big house we live in your six figure job the closet full of shiny wingtips and designer threads you rock and that candy apple redporsche you have sitting in our garage you aint shit see this is why women dont want men to have those fucking bachelor parties dirty ass hoes i should kill him i should get my hands on a gun drive up to his job and blow donavans fucking balls off that bastard who does he think he is
1963787 no honey dont you cant i mean shit i knew i shouldnt have shown you that tape
1963788 i guess you had no reason to open your mouth about it since your husbands face wasnt on that tape damn janet you and god who knows else knew about this and let me make a fool of myself i thought you were supposed to be one of my best friends
1963789 you were content keeping your fat mouth shut while i let twelve years of my life waste away with that jerk so save it
1963790 come back in the house youre in no shape to drive
1963791 im okay let me go ive got to get to work
1963792 youre not okay i dont want you to have an accident please come back inside
1963793 shhhhh oh sweetie im so sorry this happened to you go ahead and let it out its going to be all right
1963794 i thought he really loved me we promised each other that no one would ever come between us i gave my virginity to him he was the only man ive ever slept with i cant believe he betrayed me like that
1963795 what if hes still taking money out of my household budget and throwing it away on greedy whores with no morals i bet this is why he hasnt been sleeping with me for the past month i bet hes hanging out in strip clubs i bet he was going to those seedy places the whole time we were dating why do strippers wreck homes like this and what do these women have that i dont okay maybe my body isnt perfect after the two babies i have gained a little weight
1963796 slow down mystique youre upset im sure all sorts of scenarios are suddenly coming to mind but stop getting ahead of yourself this mess happened fifteen years ago at his bachelor party it really doesnt mean that a stripper has anything to do with whats going on in your marriage now
1963797 youre absolutely right if hes really working seventy hours a week he could be banging his secretary on his desk right now
1963798 thats not what i meant either donavan not sleeping with you could mean something or it could mean absolutely nothing at all and for the record you look great theres nothing wrong with you you filled out in all the right places after having brian and brittney i know it hurts honey i know
1963799 as far as what he did at that crazy party other men would line up to have a good woman like you in their lives im not trying to talk badly about donavan but hes such a fool all i can tell you is that men will be men women mature so much faster
1963800 bullshit i wish theyd close every one of these whorehouses down and outlaw bachelor parties i swear i suddenly feel like giving up on my marriage it if werent for our two kids and our financial obligations together we might not be having this conversation janet if a man gives a woman a ring or he commits to date her exclusively he better man up
1963801 theres no excuse for that behavior and i needed to know about it
1963802 oh no you dont you cant even begin to fathom the pain as far as you know youve got the clean cut altar boy who can run for politics and im stuck with the cheating man whore remember
1963803 im not about to take this sitting down only weak women will allow that shit and im not weak dont ever call me again janet i dont need a so called phony ass friend like you if you even think about ever calling me again ill tell scott about his darling wifes little snooping habit i dont think hed appreciate that when hes trying to win a political race
1963804 coutes juste un conseil si tu affutais de temps en temps ta hache
1963805 grl what are doing here i miss you boo boo
1963806 i think that is an assumption that an awful lot of people do make and its completely wrong that never happens you dont wake up one morning and say oh bad day and like here we go it is something very gradual and i dont think you even realise whats really happening youve got a different perspective on yourself and whats actually going on its fairly difficult to explain it just comes to a point where your mind thinks that it can cope but maybe your body cant carry on you cant physically do anything which is what happens you actually cant move and again people think when the minute you check out everythings okay which its not at all ive got a good smile
1963807 not as good as nicks admittedly with him everythings always okay everythings all right everythings fine thats just the way it is with most people its not worth saying how you really think you feel people say how are you and if you go actually im f ing feeling shit they dont wanna know so instead its feeling all right feeling fine thats just the way everyone does it me included

1963812 the status of kirkuk is indeed a sensitive issue that needs to be addressed in a serious fashion but it is an issue that cannot be solved through the legislative mechanism of the election law
1963813 the election law should not be held hostage to that problem
1963814 the abuse was horrendous it was physical as well as psychological it was torture

1963830 yes now i recall the one of the panoptic he is the owner of an extremely beautiful absorbing painting never anyone believe me friend no one would resist that fantastic power the first time that i saw it i felt that i could never leave it
1963831 yes i visited the house often during some time lucrecia is a beautiful person by the way its been a long time since i last saw her do you know anything about her
1963832 how strange i thought if damario was so annoyed with lucrecia he might have already taken down that painting it was so intimate for both

1963865 making money just for the sake of making money is a game like bridge in which people can find extreme pleasure and which can occupy almost all their waking hours but one of the rules of the game is that you must pretend not to enjoy it it must most definitely be classified as
1963866 there must be some connection between the commercialization of life and the separation of religion from mysticism and magic
1963867 the public is always left with the lasting impression that one or other muslim group is responsible for the bombings and that a few suspects are securely in custody awaiting trial
1963868 to make matters worse indian intelligence agencies invariably claim that they are in possession of evidence proving the involvement of entities in pakistan or bangladesh but material supporting those claims has never reached the public domain
1963869 capital particularly big capital will now desert the so called secular groups since its objectives are better served by the dual reality of potential mass unrest and a deterioration of individual rights
1963870 like in the case of pre wwii europe the strategic and tactical failures of the mainstream left encourage the urban underclass to declare loyalty to those who are in economic terms its biggest enemies iran is a more recent example of the process through which political islam established its hold in small market centres district headquarters and major cities by inciting hatred and fear
1963871 the rural vote bank will act as a bulwark against the domination of political parties espousing a religious platform

1963880 the jihad has given new life to property values to businesses and to all kinds of highly profitable though illegitimate commercial activities in pakistans cities the warlords now own hotels liquor stores houses and trading companies
1963881 despite the daily religious proclamations by one warlord or another this war is mainly against the reform agenda of afghanistans communists
1963882 ignore the reality that the young men and boys in certain instances are not the enemy to find the enemy look elsewhere look for those who continue to live in luxury in pakistan and now in western cities
1963883 virtually every single armed follower of radio mullah radio mullah fazlullah the radical cleric apparently representing the taliban in the area comes from the most marginalized section of society these men dont have jobs their families find it difficult to put two meals on the table and they have been in some form of bondage to warlords landowners or smugglers for decades they are the ones being killed in the face of the periodic military pogrammes conducted by the pakistani army
1963884 the complete failure of governments in this part of the world to resolve basic issues like land titles and to implement genuine land reforms has already created an economy which is entirely conditioned by the trade in drugs and arms our young men have nowhere else to go in order to find work and to fend for their families
1963885 the great jihad of the 1980s was a myth and that people like osama bin laden and gulbuddin hekmateyar were basically running mercenary operations and protection rackets with money from the gulf and from saudi arabia with arms provided by the and mi6 and with the protection of pakistans notorious inter service intelligence isi agency
1963886 the same smugglers who backed mullah soofi are now backing mullah radio
1963887 the battle in swat is nothing but a turf war between the alliance of smugglers loggers and clerics on one hand and the collective interests of the bureaucracy the police and small city businessmen and traders on the other there is nothing religious about it

1964004 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

1964068 many of lifes failures are men who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up
1964069 one great source of failure is found in a lack of concentration of purpose there will be adverse winds in every voyage but the able seaman firmly resists their influence while he takes advantage of every favorable breeze to speed him on his course so in our aims and pursuits we shall find much to counteract them much to draw our attention from them and unless we are armed with a steadfast purpose that can subordinate the lesser to the greater that can repel hindrances resist attractions and bend circumstances to our will our efforts will not be crowned with success
1964070 the two hardest things to handle in life are failure amp success

1964123 aids is an emergency there is no time to waste
1964124 to say we are disappointed is an understatement has the aids conference become just another expensive gab fest
1964125 rather than rally the troops officials from government and un agencies talked about 2015 as being good enough and seemed happy to let the 2010 goal slide how many will suffer and die if that happens
1964126 aids is an emergency there is no time to waste millions of the worlds most vulnerable people are counting on governments to make good on the promise for 2010
1964127 in vienna two years from now the world will ask what have you done to end this calamity
1964128 how many people will you have placed on treatment how many female condoms will you have distributed how many health workers will you have trained
1964129 that we have achieved progress in expanding treatment and prevention is welcome news
1964130 but the air of complacency from officials is profoundly disturbing the message from people on the front lines of this pandemic stands in sharp contrast they know that funding is inadequate health systems are weak and medicines are far too expensive and the reason is lack of political will among donors developing country governments and the big pharmaceutical companies
1964131 officials tried to gloss over the real problems of getting aids specific funding to strengthen health systems which was the major policy outcome in toronto two years ago universal access must mean access to comprehensive health services for all

1964144 permasalahan merokok pada anak adalah bencana nasional yang harus segera ditangani menurut survey ekonomi nasional 2004 prevalensi perokok anak usia 13 15 tahun mencapai 26 8 persen dari total populasi indonesia sementara itu trend usia inisiasi merokok menjadi semakin dini yakni usia 5 9 tahun perokok yang mulai merokok pada usia 5 9 tahun mengalami lonjakan yang paling signifikan dari 0 4 persen pada tahun 2001 menjadi 1 8 persen pada tahun 2004
1964145 seluruh bentuk pemasaran mulai dari iklan iklan yang provokatif dan sponsor event event yang digemari remaja ditujukan untuk menjerat remaja menjadi perokok pemula dari pemantauan yang kami lakukan dalam kurun waktu januari oktober 2007 terdapat 1350 kali kegiatan yang diselenggarakan disponsori industri rokok atau sekitar 135 kegiatan tiap bulannya
1964146 kondisi ini tentunya akan berpengaruh pada ketahanan sumber daya manusia kita yang akan menentukan negara dan bangsa di masa depan kita harus mewaspadai adanya strategi global untuk melemahkan bangsa dan negara kita serta menjadikan indonesia tempat pemasaran dan pembuangan rokok dari luar sementara negara negara luar tersebut melarang merokok bagi warganya
1964147 pada tahun 2000 sebelum ada hari tanpa rokok dan perda untuk tidak merokok jumlah tabungan masyarakat rp67 miliar empat tahun kemudian 2004 tabungan masyarakat naik menjadi 223 miliar atau terjadi kenaikan 300 persen dalam jangka waktu empat tahun
1964148 upaya perlindungan pencegahan anak menjadi perokok pemula termasuk upaya melindungi anak dari iklan promosi dan sponsor rokok adalah bagian dari upaya pemenuhan dan perlindungan hak hidup anak dan untuk menyelamatkan generasi bangsa dari dampak bahaya tembakau

1964152 orang sering kali merasa gelisah pada apa yang semestinya tidak perlu digelisahkan
1964153 satu satunya obat untuk menjauhi sifat tamak adalah sikap untuk selalu bersyukur
1964154 apalagi perasaan puas kita sangat dipengaruhi oleh kecenderungan untuk melakukan pembandingan
1964155 maka kalau kita hendak membandingkan diri dengan orang lain bandingkanlah dengan mereka yang kurang beruntung dan merenungkan semua yang kita miliki
1964156 dalam hal ini sikap mental kita menjadi penentu utama apakah kita mau bahagia atau tidak
1964157 bahwa kita bekerja supaya bisa membeli rumah pakaian dan kebutuhan lain itu adalah normal yang tidak normal adalah bila kita terobsesi dan begitu ambisius seolah hidup hanya untuk memenuhi seluruh keinginan itu
1964158 mungkin di saat mengetik kita ucapkan sebaris doa tuhan kasihanilah kami atau yang lain dan itu bisa kita lakukan selama 24 jam waktu kita
1964159 batin kita pun akan merasa bebas karena tidak lekat terhadap hal tertentu

1964361 most direct radiative forcing models classify carbonaceous particles into two main components consisting of either negligibly absorbing organic carbon or strongly absorbing black carbon
1964362 aside from the problem of choosing suitable refractive indices for both forms of carbon from the wide range of values found in the literature this approach ignores the possibility of rich variations in the refractive indices of carbon arising from both changes in emission source and changes during transport in the atmosphere
1964363 is low in the infrared and visible red increases through the visible red yellow green and blue and peaks in the near ultraviolet
1964364 there may be other ways in which the unique optical properties of the carbon spheres may affect radiative force relative to soot for instance owing to their reduced absorption of infrared compared with visible their role in absorption of reradiated heat will be quite different to that for black soot taking account of both the abundance of spheres and their optical properties these measurements challenge the usual supposition in radiative forcing calculations of atmospheric carbon being either negligibly absorbing organic carbon or strongly absorbing black soot carbon for modelling of radiative forcing from aerosols to be accurate scattering and absorption by brown carbon needs to be explicitly included

1964437 what we found is that neither of these popular and commonly used treatments offered a higher birth rate than no treatment at all
1964438 what weve shown is that neither of these first line treatments is better than the couples trying themselves
1964439 although it may seem a bit counterintuitive this is the one area of medicine where doing nothing could be as effective as going for any of these treatments
1964440 in the u s generally higher doses of clomid are used typically 100 milligrams a day
1964441 if anything the take home point from this study is in the group where they did insemination alone without any fertility drug there wasnt a significant increase in pregnancy she tells webmd
1964442 just doing insemination alone is probably not going to really increase a persons chance of pregnancy
1964443 if you have a patient with good results on the ovarian reserve testing then expectant management no treatment might be something the patient might desire

1964465 in addition to strengthening the first generation biofuels industry the rfs plays a crucial role in fostering the continued development of second and third generation biofuels including cellulosic ethanol biomass based biodiesel and other advanced biofuels
1964466 with the ethanol mandate increasing from nine billion gallons in 2008 to 11 1 billion gallons in 2009 this situation will only worsen
1964467 the government is drastically increasing the demands on our corn supply in a time of record prices several million more planted corn acres will be needed in 2009 at a time when competition for acreage is already very tight
1964468 we acknowledge as part of our assessment that there is an increase because of biofuel production in feed prices

1964491 the u s government did not properly investigate this and there are more rocks to be turned over
1964492 im absolutely certain that wtc 7 was brought down by controlled demolition and that as far as im concerned means that this case has not been properly investigated

1964496 i think that google has made a very important strategic mistake in dealing with the secret elements of the u s government that is a huge mistake and im hoping theyll work their way out of it and basically cut that relationship off
1964497 google was a little hypocritical when they were refusing to honor a department of justice request for information because they were heavily in bed with the central intelligence agency the office of research and development
1964498 if google is indeed starting to do harm then i think its important that be documented and publicized
1964499 i think google took money from the cia when it was poor and it was starting up and unfortunately our system right now floods money into spying and other illegal and largely unethical activities and it doesnt fund what i call the open source world
1964500 it is by no means dominating google in fact google has been embarrassed because everything the cia asked it to do they couldnt do
1964501 i also think its very very wrong of google to have this relationship
1964502 let me say very explicitly their contact at the cia is named dr rick steinheiser hes in the office of research and development
1964503 one of the problems with privatized power is that its not subject to public audit
1964504 put google out of business unless theyre willing to go the open source software route
1964505 i will dwell in them and walk among them and i will be their god and they shall be my people therefore come out from their midst and be separate

1964534 indem die nato parlamentarische versammlung parlamentsmitglieder aus dem bereich der atlantischen allianz zusammenbringt hat sie seit einem halben jahrhundert eine wesentliche verbindung zwischen nato und den parlamenten der nato nationen hergestellt und auf diese weise beigetragen parlamentarische und ffentliche zustimmung f r die politik der allianz herbeizuf hren
1964535 frag nicht was der staat f r dich tut frage was du f r die gemeinschaft tun kannst
1964536 bisher waren wir gewohnt dass vor allem amerikaner die bewundernswerte f higkeit haben sich durch das vertrauen in die eigene kraft durch positive visionen und tr ume zu ver nderungen bewegen zu lassen w hrend wir deutsche eher auf die initiative des staates hoffen und uns allenfalls durch alptr ume und krisen ngste aktivieren lassen
1964537 die amerikanische position st tzt sich auch nicht nur aber auch darauf dass die usa an der wirtschaftlich und strategisch so wichtigen atlantischen gegenk ste zuverl ssige partner haben um ein langfristiges interesse an engen transatlantischen beziehungen aufrecht zu erhalten brauchen wir deshalb eine st rkere handlungsf higkeit der europ ischen staaten im rahmen von eu und nato ich sehe keine gefahr dass ein starkes europa sich gegen die usa zu definieren versucht der ausbau der europ ischen sicherheits und verteidigungspolitik dient nicht der schaffung eines gegenwichts zu den usa die esvp soll die nato nicht ersetzen sondern ihren europ ischen pfeiler st rken nur ein starkes europa wird die nato vital erhalten k nnen nur so bleibt das b ndnis f r unsere amerikanischen freunde interessant
1964538 um als gleichgewichtiger partner auch k nftig ernstgenommen zu werden m ssen europa und deutschland ihre wirtschaft allerdings so modernisieren dass sie sich hnlich dynamisch weiterentwickelt wie die der usa
1964539 aber es wird auch k nftig dabei bleiben dass deutschland aufgrund seiner geschichte und seiner berzeugungen eher zu einer kultur der milit rischen zur ckhaltung und zu sanfteren methoden in der au en und sicherheitspolitik neigen wird als die usa
1964540 das spannungsfeld von gegenseitiger bewunderung und gleichzeitig punktueller abneigung also der wunsch nach n he bei gleichzeitiger intellektueller distanz f ngt den widerspruch der engen einzigartigen aber nicht zuletzt auch ambivalenten transatlantischen beziehungen zwischen den partnern auf beiden seiten des atlantiks wohl am ehesten ein

1964546 if your leaders say to you look the fathers kingdom is in the sky then the birds of the sky will precede you if they say to you it is in the sea then the fish will precede you rather the kingdom is within you and it is outside you when you know yourselves then you will be known and you will understand that you are children of the living father but if you do not know yourselves then you live in poverty and you are the poverty

1964553 continue to carry out coordinate and expand research in newborn screening
1964554 maintain a central clearinghouse of current information on newborn screening ensuring that the clearinghouse is available on the internet and is updated at least quarterly
1964555 soon under this bill the dna of all citizens will be housed in government genomic biobanks and considered governmental property for government research
1964556 the dna taken at birth from every citizen is essentially owned by the government and every citizen becomes a potential subject of government sponsored genetic research
1964557 the public is clueless s 1858 imposes a federal agenda of dna databanking and population wide genetic research it does not require consent and there are no requirements to fully inform parents about the warehousing of their childs dna for the purpose of genetic research
1964558 i cannot support legislation no matter how much i sympathize with the legislations stated goals that exceed the constitutional limitations on federal power or in any way threatens the liberty of the american people since s 1858 violates the constitution and may have untended consequences that will weaken the american health care system and further erode medical privacy i must oppose it
1964559 those of us in the medical profession should be particularly concerned about policies allowing government officials and state favored interests to access our medical records without our consent my review of s 1858 indicates the drafters of the legislation made no effort to ensure these newborn screening programs do not violate the privacy rights of parents and children
1964560 in fact by directing federal bureaucrats to create a contingency plan for newborn screening in the event of a public health disaster this bill may lead to further erosions of medical privacy as recent history so eloquently illustrates politicians are more than willing to take and people are more than willing to cede liberty during times of emergency
1964561 i would answer back hard what do you mean obamas not one of us its john mccain who wears 500 shoes has six houses and comes from one of the richest families in his state its barack obama who climbed up the hard way and thats why he wants middle class tax cuts and better schools for our kids

1964633 oh you think youre so smart mr game designer but im onto you
1964634 the entire game is setup to give you the impression that the goal is execution your choice is contextualised by the name the setting the mechanics by your understanding of what an execution is so it seems a little disingenuous for the designer to go oh but its all about free choice and consequences to me its as though youve been taken to a bowling alley given a ball and then after you get a strike you get told that the goal was to get a gutter ball i thought there may have been a trick to it but i figured it might have something to do with the way you shoot him or with how long you take or something like that it didnt occur to me that quitting the game was the way to win it thats a bit of a ruse really

1964646 fallout 3 reminds me of a lot of games i like perhaps as a result of my penchant for rolling stealth characters in every rpg i got a distinct thief vibe when skulking in the shadows monitoring enemy movements from a position of relative safety before lunging for the knockout blow usually a sniper shot to the head attacks when undetected give you a critical strike and deal triple damage

1964676 with proper focus and strategy there is reason for a good sized well run newspaper operation to repurpose its print product for online

1964697 i never think in my career wow i cant wait until this game is over
1964698 then i couldnt wait until that series was over i thought about it that weekend it was pretty awful
1964699 the team has a whole lot of confidence with him on the mound
1964700 it just seems right now that things are not going our way
1964701 weve got to keep fighting through it until they do
1964702 i would have loved to stay out there a little longer and try to find my way out of that last inning but its my own fault for not keeping my pitch total down and getting into too many jams
1964703 we have to finish strong hopefully we can play better

1964706 we played four games against the new york yankees and i think we held our own theyre a playoff caliber team and i think we proved were a playoff caliber team we definitely didnt have anything to hang our heads about
1964707 i feel as confident now as ive felt all season and have a nice little groove going
1964708 its big for us to hopefully keep on a good run here because were far from out of it right now
1964709 thats the team attitude we want to keep winning ballgames and make it interesting
1964710 we were just really lucky that no one else had hired him he was the right guy at the right time we never had any doubts that hed be back
1964711 im going to go up there and show them what i can do and hopefully i can stay
1964712 teams know about us these guys in seattle are in last place but they played us hard and played us tough were going to have to earn it from here on out
1964713 its not like i changed my delivery its just i slowed myself down a little bit and gave myself a little breather
1964714 everyone loves watching the yankees play it will be a lot of angels fans and yankees fans so it should be a good time obviously the environment is a bit greater because the yankees are who they are but im looking forward to it
1964715 this is a place where ive had success in the past and you always have a little comfort when youve done well in a place
1964716 i try not to read too much into it but you get a good feeling when you go to certain places and this is a place where i enjoy playing
1964717 its tough to keep getting behind like that especially when the guy over there is a pretty tough pitcher
1964718 its tough to play catch up consistently and when he gets ahead like that he can relax and throw whatever he wants at any time in the count
1964719 part of the pregame meeting was dont let this guy beat you
1964720 it stinks right now it definitely does but the sun will come up tomorrow
1964721 right now the big situations are finding raul and hes delivering
1964722 he was asking about some of the mental mistakes that ive made and i told him it was a one time deal and it wouldnt happen again
1964723 when youre in a groove your confidence level in every pitch that you throw is pretty good and everything happens the way you actually picture it
1964724 i probably shouldnt be talking to you guys right now
1964725 im going to keep grinding at it but its tough to stay positive
1964726 i just want to be able to keep us in games
1964727 theres still a lot of games to play but the significance is that you dont want to be in a bad position
1964728 were in a pretty good position through all of the stuff that has gone on over the last couple of weeks
1964729 were coming out here to win whether were in contention or not they know that
1964730 i wouldnt say were spoilers we came out and played the game right
1964731 i came here for an opportunity and i want to stay here in the starting rotation
1964732 i dont care if its no 1 or no 2 or no 5
1964733 i cant say enough about him hes been just outstanding if we could find a guy like that every year wed be doing something hes been just dynamic actually he can carve up a hitter as good as anybody
1964734 i felt like our at bats were even better early on today
1964735 we hit some line drives at some infielders throughout the game
1964736 were certainly going to look at it early in the game
1964737 i think well know early how good he feels about himself with his ability and his experience he could certainly give us a little lift
1964738 we have all the confidence in the world in barry
1964739 to go eight innings that was very very impressive this guy can pitch
1964740 his presence in the lineup means a lot to us in different ways
1964741 we can rest our catcher geovany soto a little more we can rotate our outfield a little more it gives us a lot of flexibility and when he gets hot it carries us
1964742 some days we score a lot of runs some days not

1964748 hes got more innings under his belt which i think is a good thing
1964749 hes had success which is a good thing in triple a coming off success so i think that confidence level can carry over into your next start which is here for us

1964999 so how would you explain it all these places so far apart how did they know about building pyramids at the same time
1965000 maybe men all lived together once and pyramids might be an old idea
1965001 old idea it was an engineering marvel even now we dont know how they did it and with such accuracy that even now they are still within 1 percent of being perfect square
1965002 i am really sorry about messing your report up i no i cant help you rewrite it but i could copy it for you and even set to work now if you want
1965003 the word god is more of an exclamation than a proper name it expresses astonishment reverence and even love for our reality if you want to put a human face on it that will do if you do not take it literally since we know nothing higher or more mysterious than people and an energy field which peoples can hardly be less intelligent than people certainly events happen in the field which seem absolutely horrible but faith is the gamble that there is some way of understanding or at least accepting them

1965046 there is little sign of any ceremony at all save for a sizeable chocolate cake especially prepared for the competitors still here namely the track and field squad and a handful of the judo team emblazoned with the olympic rings that have been expertly iced on top
1965047 first sight of rafa nadal waiting outside the stadium looking hot in the temperature sense president bush now looking a touch bored

1965054 how are we going to compete with this in 2012 dont think we could or will
1965055 the chinese dont do things by half so i bet this will be an opening ceremony like no other

1965063 i am obligated to defend the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
1965064 we will not allow the unpunished killing of our fellow citizens those who are guilty will suffer the punishment they deserve
1965065 hundreds of soldiers and dozens of armored vehicles including tanks
1965066 we dont know whether they are militias or regular russian forces
1965067 as they carry heavy equipment we think they must be regulars we dont know we just know they are coming to attack us
1965068 there is a lot of information and it is very contradictory
1965069 any word said in the wrong context could be ruinous for the peaceful and human resolution of this conflict
1965070 we hiding in the basement of a house showered by bombs are not feeling now that we are citizens of a great country we hear russia has a great air force and excellent planes protect your citizens you are our last hope
1965071 the blood shed in south ossetia will remain on the conscience of these people and their entourage we will not allow anyone to do harm to our peacekeepers and citizens of the russian federation
1965072 we consider that to be an act of military aggression and we call on the russian federation to immediately stop military aggression against georgia
1965073 we are very worried that this will escalate even further
1965074 it will escalate very easily to a kind of a warfare and who controls this
1965075 now as far as the situation is now we still think it can be controlled by the parties but if it escalates who knows

1965078 all i know is that im part of this team
1965079 this is something ive dreamt of doing forever this is just a great opportunity a great experience and something that im going to cherish for the rest of my life
1965080 im young im excited and im willing to learn from this veteran group im one of just five first time olympians so were trying to learn all we can from our teammates experienced olympians like
1965081 theres nothing going through my mind about trying to outdo the players who have come before us but coach anne donovan has given us the confidence and clearance to step up and play to our strengths she tells us that were on this team for a reason the only thing that really separates us from the veterans is that well we were born later but that doesnt mean we have to take a back seat you know
1965082 i think that the rest of world gained a lot of confidence when they saw that we could lose wow the united states lost now they think they have a way in and theres no denying that we lost at the world championships of course we werent at full strength but we lost nonetheless and were gonna have to come out and play hard even though the rest of the world is getting better we still feel like were the best in the world
1965083 we really need to focus on bringing a defensive mindset to every game coach has stressed that we all need to play our minutes dont pace yourself dont take even a moment off everyone on our team is talented across the board so every minute matters and we have to play hard every moment were out there
1965084 no not really ill just be spending time with my family im excited just to see china a little bit ive never been to asia before

1965088 we are a strong department at south king fire amp rescue and we will overcome this
1965089 as noted in both the 07 energy act and then the 08 farm bill cellulosic is the new magic word
1965090 what we first tried to solve with ethanol we will now solve with cellulosic
1965091 pennsylvania can be to cellulosic ethanol what corn based ethanol was to iowa and the midwest
1965092 pennsylvania has an abundant supply of cellulosic ethanol feedstocks including switchgrass woodchips municipal waste and agricultural waste this alternative fuel law ensures that pennsylvania farmers and businesses will fully realize the benefits of these resources
1965093 we all hope we can shift to cellulosic ethanol which wont be quite as competitive with our general food system
1965094 the current situation with cellulosic is one that has great potential but the technology is not quite there to make it close enough to being economic that people are willing to make the very large investments that are required in these plants
1965095 there are no greenhouse gas issues with corn stover and forest residues

1965106 a group of poets that gained a large popular readership during the early years of george vs reign

1965162 i think everyone was shocked to hear that the americans were holding this woman at bagram in afghanistan from the information coming through i am told she is being held in exactly the same conditions as the men and has absolutely no privacy when it comes to toilet and shower facilities
1965163 this would never happen to a western woman and it shows just how women are viewed by the u s military there is even a suggestion she has been molested and sexually abused by her captors we need to demand the truth
1965164 i was released on humanitarian grounds mercifully my treatment was good respectful and decent although still terrifying
1965165 i remembered moazzam telling me about the womans screams and how he first imagined they could be from his wife in truth i thought maybe he had just been listening to a tape recorder as part of a form of mental torture
1965166 however we now know the screams came from a woman who has been held in bagram for some years and without compromising anyone we can also reveal from impeccable sources that her prison number is 650
1965167 this information has been enough to scramble the pakistan media into action by demanding the return of this woman to her homeland immediately
1965168 prisoner 650 is just the tip of a very nasty iceberg of human rights abuses illegal detentions and rendition flights it is a shameful episode in pakistans history which must be put right
1965169 i wonder how can we hand over our sister to the non muslims for their illegal trial by men whose history is full of rape and other abuses to prisoners
1965170 i began to hear the chilling screams of a woman next door why have you got a woman next door they told me there was no woman but i was unconvinced those screams echoed through my worst nightmares for a long time and i later learned in guantanamo from other prisoners that they had heard the screams too
1965171 while on the run one not only confirmed he had heard a womans screams but said he had seen her
1965172 my story made international headlines front page pictures and major stories on tv but there has not been one word not one paragraph about prisoner 650 the grey lady of bagram a murderous detention facility under control of the u s military and intelligence services
1965173 all like the grey lady of bagram have been illegally abducted by secretive intelligence agencies they began disappearing in 2001 during the so called war on terror

1965177 blame afghanistan alone for the heroin problem in the world
1965178 its true that this country is producing the raw material for heroin the opium but it is not possible to make heroin without certain chemicals and these chemicals are not produced inside afghanistan
1965179 we can use market forces to successfully combat afghanistans illegal drug trade
1965180 but he already saw the first one and wasnt scared at all
1965181 dude what are you doing thats not how you give kisses
1965182 well that is how that girl kisses spider man in the movie
1965183 i will tell mommy that you talked to a stranger
1965184 hubert humphrey won the nomination but the democratic party was still divided particularly because vice president humphrey did not disassociate himself from johnsons vietnam war policy i too opposed the war but wanting to get a democrat in the white house i stuffed many humphrey for president leaflets under apartment doors that fall
1965185 it is necessary to disrupt the status quo that is the tradition of our country our founders were disrupters magnificent disrupters martin luther king jr was a disrupter as were the suffragettes it is the american way the change that resulted from these leaders has made our country greater how can we follow their lead
1965186 people always ask arent you scared and i say just strike that word from your vocabulary this is not for the faint of heart as i said this is not for the faint of heart you cant be afraid you have a vision knowledge a plan you have support this is what you believe in if you show one cent of being afraid your options are destroyed so you have to believe in what you are doing and you may not win every fight but you will advance the cause
1965187 the challenges of success as well as the lessons of failure organize dont agonize we just have to move on politics is not for the faint of heart dont let me give you this impression that people are waiting with open arms to pull you into power nobody nobody ever in the history of the world has given away power
1965188 let me say that washington dc is a city that is wedded to the status quo change is not what they are about and as a leader i say you must be kidding the city is wedded to the special interests because they all make a living perpetuating the status quo its the special interests not the peoples interest and that is why it was so important if i may have a moment of partisan enjoyment that we won the last election because i said i am an outsider i have become the speaker of the house not because i mastered the inside of things but because i am an outsider and i want change to happen here
1965189 well throw you a crumb and well keep the status quo that is not the american way our founders in this city where it all started they were disrupters sometimes you wonder why you have to go to such lengths to convince people of the obvious about the future
1965190 we have a foreign policy question the actual question is do you think we should blockade iran
1965191 i think we should ask a broader question do you think there is a desire and a plan on the part of this administration to engage iran
1965192 iran keeps insisting that they want to proceed on developing nuclear power they say for domestic use we suspect they have other motives they cannot be allowed to do this
1965193 a lot of technology from china from pakistan probably from russia and other places and that should never have happened
1965194 the last resort consequences of preventive military action against iran
1965195 fears that it would prompt a rally round the flag effect in iran
1965196 but i dont think anything can be accomplished by going into iran to stop them from developing weapons of mass destruction because that would only galvanize the country around the leadership thats a b we may not accomplish our goal they may have parallel program where we think we got it but we didnt get it or we got part of it and we didnt get the rest and what have we accomplished in terms of world opinion at the same time
1965197 what we should be doing and theyre trying to do this more but we should have been doing it more robust and sooner is to say to iran dont even think about having a weapon of mass destruction and were galvanizing world international global forces diplomatically economically culturally financially economically to pass sanctions to tighten and tighten and tighten if you proceed down this course
1965198 the president of iran has said i have friends well if those friends want to be friends with iran then we cant have them be friends of ours because our foreign policy is that we cannot permit proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
1965199 and let me just say this war in iraq has been a horrendous dilemna a grotesque mistake
1965200 they went into that war knowing full well there was no intelligence to support the imminent threat that this administration was contending i was a senior democrat on the intelligence committee at the time its called the gang of four the top democrats and the top republicans in the house and in the senate and we saw all of the intelligence and there was no intelligence to say that there was an imminent threat of weapons of mass destruction from iraq it was clear i voted against the war
1965201 i had all the intelligence and i knew the threat wasnt there so this administration knew all this faulty intelligence stuff they knew it wasnt there
1965202 i applaud the presidents focusing on this issue and on taking the lead to disarm saddam hussein
1965203 yes he has chemical weapons he has biological weapons and he is trying to get nuclear weapons
1965204 i would imagine its those feelings in iraq that led to this next question are you going to allow a motion to impeach president bush to come to the floor
1965205 and this all occurs before the election in 2004 wheres the outrage why do you think the democrats lost in 2004
1965206 the search is for truth the search is for truth to take our country in the direction of our founders with their magnificent disruption we have to continue in the tradition of the magnificent disruption and one way for that to happen is for women to know their power
1965207 you were briefed about torture and the wiretapping years before the public found out
1965208 you were briefed as a member of the gang of four about torture in 2002 and as the gang of eight about wiretapping
1965209 not these kind of questions were not taking these kinds of questions youre done

1965787 the natural event of a man and a woman living in constant companionship with or without children is an admirable arrangement which works to the degree one does not insist it must work and does not treat ones partner as property another being regarded as property is automatically a doll whenever i perform a ceremony of marriage for personal friends i give some such discourse as this what i am about to say may at first sound depressing and even cynical but i think you will not find it so in practice there are three things i would have you bear in mind the first is that as you now behold one another you are probably seeing each other at your best all things disintegrate in time and as the years go by you will tend to get worse rather than better do not therefore go into marriage with projects for improving each other growth may happen but it cannot be forced the second has to do with emotional honesty never pretend to a love which you do not actually feel for love is not ours to command for the same reason do not require love from your partner as a duty for love given in this spirit doesnt ring true and gives no pleasure to the other the third is that you do not cling to one another as to commit mutual strangulation you are not each others chattels and you must so trust your partner as to allow full freedom to be the being that he and she is if you observe these things your marriage will have surer ground than can be afforded by any formal contract or promise however solemn and legally binding

1965789 the bush signing statement claims authority to open domestic mail without a warrant and that would be new and quite alarming
1965790 it takes executive branch authority beyond anything weve ever known
1965791 which provides for opening of an item of a class of mail otherwise sealed against inspection in a manner consistent with the need to conduct searches in exigent circumstances
1965792 protect human life and safety against hazardous materials and the need for physical searches specifically authorized by law for foreign intelligence collection
1965793 in certain circumstances such as with the proverbial ticking bomb the constitution does not require warrants for reasonable searches

1965827 mencaci orang islam muslim adalah perbuatan fasiq dan membunuhnya adalah perbuatan kufur
1965828 seorang muslim itu bersaudara terhadap muslims lainnya ia tidak boleh menganiaya dan menghinanya seseorang cukup dianggap berlaku jahat karena ia menghina saudaranya sesama muslim
1965829 dan orang orang yang menyakiti orang orang mukmin laki laki atau perempuan tanpa kesalahan yang mereka perbuat maka sesungguhnya mereka telah memikul kebohongan dan dosa yang nyata
1965830 tiada kebaikan sedikitpun dalam amal perbuatannya dan ia kelak akan masuk neraka
1965831 barangsiapa yang memanggil seseorang dengan kata kata kafir atau ia berkata wahai musuh allah sedang orang yang dikatakan itu tidak begitu keadaannya maka tiada lain tuduhan itu akan kembali kepada dirinya
1965832 sesungguhnya orang orang mukmin itu bersaudara karena itu damaikanlah antara kedua saudaramu yang berselisih dan bertakwalah kepada allah agar kamu mendapat rahmat
1965833 maka datanglah sesudah mereka pengganti yang jelek yang menyia nyiakan shalat dan memperturutkan hawa nafsu maka kelak mereka akan menemui kesesatan
1965834 saya bertanya kepada rasulullah saw tentang orang yang menyia nyiakan shalat maka nabi saw menjawab maksudnya orang yang melambatkannya
1965835 wahai orang orang yang beriman janganlah harta dan anak anakmu itu dapat melalaikan kamu dari ingat kepada allah barangsiapa yang berbuat demikian maka mereka itu kelak akan merugi
1965836 kami dahulu tidak termasuk orang orang yang mengerjakan shalat dan kami tidak pula memberi makan orang miskin dan kami senang membicarakan yang batil bersama orang orang yang membicarakannya dan kami mendustakan hari pembalasan hingga datang kepada kami hari kematian
1965837 janji sebagai pembeda di antara kami dan mereka orang kafir ialah dalam hal shalat barangsiapa meninggalkan shalat maka benar benar ia telah kafir
1965838 perbedaan antara hamba allah yang beriman dan yang kafir adalah menyia nyiakan shalat
1965839 barangsiapa yang menjaga shalatnya maka ia shalat akan menjadi cahaya dan tanda bukti yang bisa menyelamatkannya di hari kiamat kelak sedang orang yang tidak mau menjaga shalatnya maka dia tidak mempunyai cahaya tanda bukti serta penyelamat di hari kiamat nanti bahkan ia kelak akan berkumpul dengan firaun qarun haman dan ubay bin khalaf

1965841 documents obtained by the committee indicate that contrary to the denials of administration officials advisors to the president and officials in the state and commerce departments knew about hunt oils interest in the kurdish region months before the contract was executed
1965842 by the summer of 1999 bush had already raised 37 million but he wanted to conserve his campaign cash so he turned to a texas crony ray hunt to help fund the iowa effort
1965843 in july of 1999 hunt was among a handful of bush supporters who each donated 10 000 to the iowa republican party
1965844 approached a month or so ago by representatives of a private group in kurdistan as to the possibility of our becoming interested in that region
1965845 we were encouraged by what we saw we have a larger team going back to kurdistan this week
1965846 department officials claimed that to the extent they were aware of any negotiations they actively warned hunt oil not to enter into a contract because it was contrary to u s national security interests
1965847 documents obtained by the committee indicate that contrary to the denials of administration officials advisors to the president and officials in the state and commerce departments knew about hunt oils interest in the kurdish region months before the contract was executed
1965848 thinks the bush administration didnt do enough to stop the deal

1965856 it would be an unconscionable act of betrayal a stain on our character as a great nation if we were to walk away from the iraqi people and consign them to the horrendous violence ethnic cleansing and possibly genocide that would follow a reckless irresponsible and premature withdrawal
1965857 it was an unconscionable act of betrayal a stain on our character as a great nation that we chose to invade iraq at the expense of the iraqi people and consign them to the horrendous violence ethnic cleansing and possibly genocide that we knew would follow a reckless irresponsible and unnecessary invasion
1965858 the taliban towers at guantanamo bay the caribbeans newest 5 star resort
1965859 greetings from paradise gtmo resort and spa fun in the cuban sun
1965860 someone who loves me got me this t shirt in guantanamo bay cuba
1965861 when i see the conditions the prisoners have to cope with and then think of the t shirt slogans i am appalled
1965862 to say i am repulsed is an understatement unbelievable as it may seem the us authorities are proud of the souvenirs and what they are doing
1965863 the military keeps a tight hold on everything that is available in guantanamo bay and someone senior has given their approval for this disgusting nonsense
1965864 pretending that guantanamo bay is essentially a resort in the caribbean is grossly offensive and the idea of relaxing in the sun while close by many individuals are robbed of their rights tortured and abused is both repugnant and ridiculous
1965865 these supposedly fun souvenirs are in grotesquely bad taste and the fact that they are on sale at the camp quite frankly beggars belief
1965866 the majority are kept in isolation in cells that are no bigger than a toilet
1965867 there is no sea view instead if they have a window it looks out on to a bleak corridor the cells are lined with steel from floor to ceiling including the toilet sink and bed base
1965868 there is a popular misconception that these men have had trials and been found guilty nothing is further from the truth not one of them has
1965869 the tortures that the americans use are wide ranging and inhuman one is to blast the cell with freezing cold air another is to pretend to take the prisoners to a country like egypt where prisoners are tortured even to the extent of taking them on a mock flight so they can be treated in a barbaric fashion
1965870 inmates are offered three meals a day but there are eight prisoners who have been on hunger strike for over a year asking either for a trial or to be set free
1965871 these men are force fed twice a day first they are strapped down with 16 different restrictions including one that jerks their head back then a tube is fed through their nose and down into their stomach
1965872 the guards dont always use lubrication and regularly use the same tube for several different prisoners without bothering to clean it
1965873 as it is outside american territory the us constitution doesnt apply
1965874 my rickshaw is my life its very cheap for my passengers
1965875 we must save the cycle rickshaw drivers look at the soaring fuel price hikes
1965876 these bikes are wonderful alternatives they provide an affordable smog free choice
1965877 but unfortunately when the whole world is talking about the environment we in south asia are talking about development we somehow think we are better if we have hordes of swanky cars
1965878 we should be building bike lanes to provide the cycle rickshaws a humane driving area for many reasons lets face it fuel prices are only getting higher and here we have an alternative right in front of us
1965879 if we keep banning them we will regret this in future generations
1965880 we love the peaceful and private ride and the breeze
1965881 i like that the price is never impacted by fuel hikes to me its a lovely way to do some shopping as a woman
1965882 the rickshaws are popular in the walled old city like chandni chowk but they can lead to large amounts of congestion
1965883 its also not so easy for them since there are so many different kinds of motorized traffic on the roads
1965884 from a marketing point of view you dont introduce new products in august
1965885 we dont want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud
1965886 covert attempts to mold opinion through the undisclosed use of third parties
1965887 participants were instructed not to quote their briefers directly or otherwise describe their contacts with the pentagon
1965888 it was them saying we need to stick our hands up your back and move your mouth for you
1965889 no part of any appropriation contained in this or any other act shall be used for publicity or propaganda purposes within the united states not heretofore authorized by the congress
1965890 the failure of an agency to identify itself as the source of a prepackaged news story misleads the viewing public by encouraging the viewing audience to believe that the broadcasting news organization developed the information the prepackaged news stories are purposefully designed to be indistinguishable from news segments broadcast to the public when the television viewing public does not know that the stories they watched on television news programs about the government were in fact prepared by the government the stories are in this sense no longer purely factual the essential fact of attribution is missing
1965891 over the years gao has interpreted publicity or propaganda restrictions to preclude use of appropriated funds for among other things so called covert propaganda
1965892 look i didnt know look i think that you guys should take a step back and look at this look dod has made a decision theyve decided to stop this program but i would say that one of the things that we try to do in the administration is get information out to a variety of people so that everybody else can call them and ask their opinion about something and i dont think that that should be against the law and i think that its absolutely appropriate to provide information to people who are seeking it and are going to be providing their opinions on it it doesnt necessarily mean that all of those military analysts ever agreed with the administration i think you can go back and look and think that a lot of their analysis was pretty tough on the administration that doesnt mean that we shouldnt talk to people
1965893 scant credible evidence that iraq had any significant collaborative ties with al qaeda
1965894 saddams regime is intensely secular and is wary of islamic revolutionary movements moreover baghdad is unlikely to provide assistance to a group it cannot control
1965895 in desperation saddam would share chemical or biological weapons with al qaeda
1965896 sporadic wary contacts with al qaeda since the mid 1990s rather than a relationship with al qaeda that has developed over time
1965897 if iraq regimes sic continues to defy us and the world we will move deliberately yet decisively to hold iraq to account its a new world were in we used to think two oceans could separate us from an enemy on that tragic day september the 11th 2001 we found out thats not the case we found out this great land of liberty and of freedom and of justice is vulnerable and therefore we must do everything we can everything we can to secure the homeland to make us safe
1965898 with every step the iraqi regime takes toward gaining and deploying the most terrible weapons our own options to confront that regime will narrow and if an emboldened regime were to supply these weapons to terrorist allies then the attacks of september 11th would be a prelude to far greater horrors
1965899 the battle of iraq is one victory in a war on terror that began on september the 11 2001 and still goes on that terrible morning 19 evil men the shock troops of a hateful ideology gave america and the civilized world a glimpse of their ambitions they imagined in the words of one terrorist that september the 11th would be the beginning of the end of america by seeking to turn our cities into killing fields terrorists and their allies believed that they could destroy this nations resolve and force our retreat from the world they have failed
1965900 now were in a new and unprecedented war against violent islamic extremists this is an ideological conflict we face against murderers and killers who try to impose their will these are the people that attacked us on september the 11th and killed nearly 3 000 people the stakes are high and once again we have had to change our strategic thinking the major battleground in this war is iraq
1965901 we know that iraq and al qaeda have had high level contacts that go back a decade some al qaeda leaders who fled afghanistan went to iraq these include one very senior al qaeda leader who received medical treatment in baghdad this year and who has been associated with planning for chemical and biological attacks weve learned that iraq has trained al qaeda members in bomb making and poisons and deadly gases
1965902 w e we need to think about saddam hussein using al qaeda to do his dirty work to not leave fingerprints behind
1965903 evidence from intelligence sources secret communications and statements by people now in custody reveal that saddam hussein aids and protects terrorists including members of al qaeda secretly and without fingerprints he could provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists or help them develop their own
1965904 w hat i want to bring to your attention today is the potentially much more sinister nexus between iraq and the al qaeda terrorist network a nexus that combines classic terrorist organizations and modern methods of murder
1965905 the battle of iraq is one victory in a war on terror that began on september the 11 2001 and still goes on t he liberation of iraq removed an ally of al qaeda
1965906 report on whether public statements regarding iraq by u s government officials were substantiated by intelligence information
1965907 statements and implications by the president and secretary of state suggesting that iraq and had a partnership or that iraq had provided with weapons training were not substantiated by the intelligence
1965908 the intelligence community did not confirm that muhammad atta met an iraqi intelligence officer in prague in 2001 as the vice president repeatedly claimed
1965909 authorizes funding for the defense of the united states and its interests abroad for military construction and for national security related energy programs
1965910 provisions of the act including sections 841 846 1079 and 1222 purport to impose requirements that could inhibit the presidents ability to carry out his constitutional obligations to take care that the laws be faithfully executed to protect national security to supervise the executive branch and to execute his authority as commander in chief the executive branch shall construe such provisions in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the president
1965911 should be opened to international oil companies as quickly as possible after the war
1965912 the country should establish a conducive business environment to attract investment of oil and gas resources
1965913 by 2010 we will need on the order of an additional 50 million barrels a day
1965914 in a january 29 2001 memorandum the president established nepdg the national energy policy development group comprised of the vice president nine cabinet level officials and four other senior administration officials to gather information deliberate and make recommendations to the president by the end of fiscal year 2001 the president called on the vice president to chair the group direct its work and as necessary establish subordinate working groups to assist nepdg
1965915 other senior administration officials were the director of the office of management and budget the assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff for policy the assistant to the president for economic policy and the deputy assistant to the president for intergovernmental affairs
1965916 in developing the national energy policy report the nepdg principals support group and participating agency officials and staff met with solicited input from or received information and advice from nonfederal energy stakeholders principally petroleum coal nuclear natural gas and electricity industry representatives and lobbyists
1965917 none of the key federal entities involved in the nepdg effort provided gao with a complete accounting of the costs that they incurred during the development of the national energy policy report the two federal entities responsible for funding the nepdg effort ovp and the department of energy doe did not provide the comprehensive cost information that gao requested ovp provided gao with 77 pages of information two thirds of which contained no cost information while the remaining one third contained some miscellaneous information of little to no usefulness ovp stated that it would not provide any additional information doe the department of the interior and the environmental protection agency epa provided gao with estimates of certain costs and salaries associated with the nepdg effort but these estimates all calculated in different ways were not comprehensive
1965918 iraq possesses huge reserves of oil and gas reserves id love chevron to have access to
1965919 to open up areas of their energy sectors to foreign investment
1965920 serious physical injury such as organ failure impairment of bodily function or even death
1965921 interrogations undertaken pursuant to the presidents commander in chief powers
1965922 necessity or self defense could provide justifications that would eliminate any criminal liability
1965923 no physical or mental torture nor any other form of coercion may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them information of any kind whatever prisoners of war who refuse to answer may not be threatened insulted or exposed to any unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind
1965924 must have some status under international law he is either a prisoner of war and as such covered by the third convention or a civilian covered by the fourth convention there is no intermediate status nobody in enemy hands can be outside the law
1965925 a cabinet level meeting to deal with the impending al qaeda attack
1965926 follow the example of world trade center bomber ramzi yousef and bring the fighting to america
1965927 members including some who are us citizens have resided in or traveled to the us for years and the group apparently maintains a support structure that could aid attacks
1965928 more sensational threat reporting that bin laden wanted to hijack a us aircraft
1965929 patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks including recent surveillance of federal buildings in new york
1965930 a call to our embassy in the uae in may saying that a group of bin laden supporters was in the us planning attacks with explosives
1965931 in a single 17 sentence document the intelligence briefing delivered to president bush in august 2001 spells out the who hints at the what and points towards the where of the terrorist attacks on new york and washington that followed 36 days later
1965932 reiterated a consistent and constant theme osama bin ladens intent to launch terrorist attacks inside the united states
1965933 the attack will be spectacular and designed to inflict mass casualties against u s facilities or interests attack preparations have been made attack will occur with little or no warning
1965934 i cannot imagine why he would say it its not true
1965935 the fact that john mccains top adviser says that a terrorist attack on american soil would be a big advantage for their political campaign is a complete disgrace and is exactly the kind of politics that needs to change
1965936 barack obama will turn the page on these failed policies and this cynical and divisive brand of politics so that we can unite this nation around a common purpose to finish the fight against al qaeda
1965937 unite this nation around a common purpose to finish the fight against al qaeda
1965938 tony snow former white house press secretary dies at 53
1965939 it was a joy to watch tony at the podium each day
1965940 he brought wit grace and a great love of country to his work his colleagues will cherish memories of his energetic personality and relentless good humor
1965941 the most exciting intellectually aerobic job im ever going to have
1965942 tony snow broke the mold he was a completely different kind of press secretary
1965943 for one thing he would give you his own opinion and youd have to say tony wait i asked what the president thought
1965944 he had a front row seat and he looked wonderful
1965945 is the world better off in your opinion now that he is gone
1965946 in late may the iaea reported that irans suspected work on nuclear matters was a matter of serious concern and that the iranians owed the agency substantial explanation
1965947 has recently accused iran of developing its program of enriching uranium
1965948 whats to say they couldnt start another covert nuclear weapons program
1965949 massive civil disobedience including a sit in of a minimum of several hundred thousand people shutting down washington d c completely
1965950 id love to do it but i gotta go to work in the morning
1965951 educate the public on the plight of coral reef ecosystems
1965952 an unseen measurement bias has been identified in global records of sea surface temperature the discrepancy will need correction but will not affect conclusions about an overall warming trend
1965953 global solutions to economic social and environmental sustainability including improved equity
1965954 just to make things clear we are not stating that anthropogenic climate change wont be as bad as previously thought
1965955 what we are saying is that on top of the warming trend there is a long periodic oscillation that will probably lead to a to a lower temperature increase than we would expect from the current trend during the next years
1965956 that is like driving from the coast to a mountainous area and crossing some hills and valleys before you reach the top
1965957 in some years trends of both phenomena the anthropogenic climate change and the natural decadal variation will add leading to a much stronger temperature rise
1965958 additional investment needs in the blue map scenario are usd 45 trillion over the period up to 2050
1965959 it the reaction will be positive privately i think therell be public denunciations but no action
1965960 its clear that the administration has essentially given up that possibility
1965961 i dont think its serious any more if you had asked me a year ago i would have said i thought it was a real possibility i just dont think its in the cards
1965962 the israelis have one eye on the calendar because of the pace at which the iranians are proceeding both to develop their nuclear weapons capability and to do things like increase their defences by buying new russian anti aircraft systems and further harden the nuclear installations
1965963 theyre also obviously looking at the american election calendar my judgement is they would not want to do anything before our election because theres no telling what impact it could have on the election
1965964 an obama victory would rule out military action by the israelis because they would fear the consequences given the approach obama has taken to foreign policy
1965965 with mccain they might still be looking at a delay given that time is on irans side i think the argument for military action is sooner rather than later absent some other development
1965966 the key point would be for the israelis to break irans control over the nuclear fuel cycle and that could be accomplished for example by destroying the uranium conversion facility at esfahan or the uranium enrichment facility at natanz
1965967 that doesnt end the problem but it buys time during which a more permanent solution might be found how long that would be hard to say depends on the extent of the destruction
1965968 things moved so fast and i was always worried i would cut myself

1965978 until one is committed there is hesitancy the chance to draw back concerning all acts of initiative and creation there is one elementary truth the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans that the moment one definitely commits oneself then providence moves too all sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred a whole stream of events issues from the decision raising in ones favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance which no man could have dreamed would have come his way whatever you can do or dream you can do begin it boldness has genius power and magic in it begin it now

1965991 get rich quick separate you from your money as fast as i can
1965992 if you decide that your going to showdown the hand then price it to ur standards lets say your willing to show down the hand for at max 200 chips why not just bet it instead of hoping that your opponent will play the way wish this is a case where aggression doesnt make you chips it saves you chips lets say you bet 200 and you get reraised to 600 well you priced what you were willing to play and it didnt work out for you if you dont want to pay anymore then you fold out i think that this is much better than checking and hoping that the opponent prices the bet to your standards if the villain has the nuts hes going to reraise your river bet in the hopes of getting more chips if the villain has a marginal hand thats slightly better than yours he might fold out because he is afraid of a hand thais better than his non nuts at the same time he might also call but in either case you priced your show down
1965993 im a tight aggressive player how could he call there with third pair
1965994 i finally got aces and raised and didnt get any action if i could just get some action on my good hands i could win one of these things
1965995 he was a 7 1 underdog and he should have known by the way you were betting but called anyways
1965996 uh 1812 would you no you wouldnt why because hes not a history major and doesnt have the foggiest on the correct answer this very simple concept in empathy looking at things through the eyes of someone else should help you understand why you shouldnt get angry at your opponent
1965997 oh dont worry hell eventually be caught down the road
1965998 i cant win at the 5 50s i will win more by moving up and playing with players who respect my bets raises

1966013 which he either did not read did not understand or did not believe
1966014 patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks including recent surveillance of federal buildings in new york
1966015 the presidents daily briefing seven years ago today august 6th 2001 entitled bin laden determined to strike in u s mentions bringing the fighting to america retaliating in washington wanting to hijack a u s aircraft preparations for hijackings surveillance done in new york groups of supporters in the u s planning attacks all the information you could have wanted all of it in george bush s hands seven years ago today with 36 days left to interrupt or alter 9 11 so when you rhetorically ask as mr posner did in his exceptional book why america slept the answer is actually a correction america did not sleep george bush slept

1966065 come da paure da un cervello ferito in una parte
1966066 era perch non poteva restare niente di tutto questo che gli occhi facevano i matti
1966067 ruotavo la testa per fare la giostra con i bambini e con i grandi che vedevo e non vedevo la tasca il naso le ginocchia una mano con la mela o con la scodella o con niente senza braccio
1966068 e si pu andare dalla finestra dallaria della finestra semiaperta fuori sullocchio che butta resina
1966069 a letto era un bel cielo dalle finestre di tanti bei giorni
1966070 lavevano portata con il carro allospedale e poi quando era venuta tra quelle due finestre si era fermato
1966071 hanno fame di un cielo che non deve piovere segnare le scarpe scappare in mezzo agli occhi senza smettere
1966072 con le vie le vetrine ci muovono in una parte nuova come dirsi tutto delle cose che se ne sono andate
1966073 sono venuti gi i sassi il letto ha detto la zia aveva una pietra grossa nel mezzo siamo scappati dagli occhi il vento nella testa ho pensato ogni giorno a questo solo stare senza sguardo
1966074 a sapere bene forse potrei dire anche per noi una visione intera con uno specchio sopra con un cielo
1966075 io che sono delle cose negli occhi ma non so come sono quando le guardo
1966076 i tetti quei tetti mi dicevano che io ero i miei occhi e non altri
1966077 successo un tempo ma come fosse adesso perch anche adesso un tempo
1966078 con il sole dal faro scende sui campi parte degli occhi del pittore italiano lucio fontana
1966079 e io guardo quello che ho letto di una terra che adesso povera
1966080 giravi gli occhi incominciava la casa prima non esisteva nulla
1966081 ho portato con me delle vecchie cose per guardare gli alberi un inverno le poche foglie sui rami una panchina vuota
1966082 i apologize for the lack of any real furniture we dont really have any beds just the couch or the floor
1966083 either is completely fine with me honestly its just nice to be out of the rain
1966084 im sorry man it was just way too much fun to watch you snap up after you heard the wake up lazy dumb ass and get into a lane sound
1966085 its fine im sure i would have done the exact same thing to you my friend
1966086 want to grab breakfast somewhere im sure you havent eaten considering you had to wake up much earlier than normal to catch your plane
1966087 yeah i think theres a coffee shop not very far into town that has bagels and breakfast sandwiches and shit like that take the exit after this one and ill show you how to get there
1966088 fife fifteen weve got to leave in about half an hour if im going to catch my flight on time
1966089 how about we have a little us time before you go off and leave me for the next week or two i mean we did have to postpone our wedding for this
1966090 hun i really wish i could but we really do have to go soon
1966091 are you bribing me normally youd jump on the opportunity to have a little fun
1966092 dont be a smart ass you know youre going to miss me now go get dressed so we can head out
1966093 daddy is mad that kyle is picking her up from the airport
1966094 not the answer i was looking for but ill take it
1966095 so are you still going to live in your apartment
1966096 well it was his apartment so i ended up moving back in with my mom i think ill probably stay there until the baby is born and i can somehow get back on my feet
1966097 im so sorry to barge in on your life like this its really inconsiderate of me but i just didnt know who i could turn to you always seemed to have an answer for everything maybe im desperately trying to cling onto something but i still think that you have the answer im looking for whatever that may be
1966098 thank you so much for being here it means the world to me
1966099 i understand your frustrations i apologize for my countrys lack of courtesy
1966100 if i could please have everyones attention for a moment it seems we have overbooked our airline today we would like to offer two volunteers a full refund and a first class ticket to anywhere within the continental united states if they are willing to give up their seat today and reschedule their flight
1966101 its almost a shame really you know i mean five years ago do you think we could have ever guessed that wed be this distant you never even mentioned that you ever thought of leaving
1966102 listen im sorry if this was awkward for you i mean i know youre engaged and me coming out here completely unannounced was probably uncalled for how many people would be desperate enough to beg friends and relatives for enough frequent flier miles to hop a plane and fly 1 900 miles just to see an old friend
1966103 so what ever happened to that kid you were dating before i left
1966104 dammit jack why the hell did you have to call me to drag your ass home this early in the morning i mean for god sakes isnt this what kairi is for
1966105 she has school plus eight years of me hauling your lazy ass across the state and you cant wake up a few hours earlier than usual to take your turn at hauling mine
1966106 so how long are you going to be gone for this thing again
1966107 a week enough time to take care of business as well as spend some time exploring my old stomping grounds
1966108 are you going to need a ride back to the airport tomorrow or whenever your flight gets in
1966109 nah im sure ill be able to bum one off kairi honestly im sure she will appreciate the extra time we can spend together on the trip up
1966110 were both lucky you called me when you did another half an hour and i would have still been slowly trudging through traffic and you would have still been rotting away in some airport cafe sipping your 5 76 cup of coffee and reading some chuck klosterman book that youve overly hyped up in that article of yours
1966111 thanks for the ride regardless dave i really do appreciate you doing this for me

1966173 he stood with the hiv aids community when we were in the early days of the aids crisis he stood by us during the early days of the defense of marriage act and he will be a wonderful proponent for us in the senate
1966174 the thing about that race is that saxby chambliss is a fairly popular incumbent
1966175 the way ive seen that race is that the candidates the democrats have in the field they dont really have chance of beating chambliss and i still feel that way martin is a nice accomplished solid fellow but i dont think anyone realistically expects him to beat chambliss
1966176 vernon jones politically has been seen as damaged goods for many people for a while
1966177 i think its going to mean a lot barack obamas influence on the race with jim martin in the senate
1966178 even though chambliss has a lot of money barack obama is going to help us with that push for change a lot of voters want change as far as saxby chambliss is concerned too

1966206 for the whole year we expect growth to be between 4 and 5 per cent
1966207 singapores economy has so far been partly buffered because weve been carried along by the vibrancy of the asian region but asian economies are starting to feel the impact of americas problems and so are we we must therefore prepare ourselves for a bumpy year ahead
1966208 we are doing the next best thing to put in place effective relief measures and provide the poor and the needy with the help they need we must look beyond immediate problems like the cost of living to understand what is happening in the world around us discover new opportunities and tackle our longer term challenges
1966209 we can create an environment where singaporeans see them children as a natural and important part of life and where young couples get support in starting families we have looked at this comprehensively and will take further steps to address the practical problems which couples face
1966210 we must adapt ourselves to it and use it to educate and engage our cyber citizens we will evolve our policies and rules our economy and society to take full advantage we will continue to open up our system progressively
1966211 there are cyclical factors things like fluctuating demand from event organisers and corporate companies however the hotels performance is still continuing at a steady pace compared to last year and we expect this to continue basically to the final quarter of 2008 the occupancy levels are comparable to last year but there has been a slight increase in the average room rates i would say that growth has continued theres definitely no regression

1966220 saint augustines descriptions of a conversation between hearing and deaf persons suggest that such communication via a form of sign language was commonplace this may indicated that converastion among deaf people in late ancient roman society was not only familiar but that deaf people were not as isolated as some have surmised
1966221 in the late 1400s agricola described a deaf person who had been taught to read and write
1966222 it was in 1578 that ponce de leon described how he had taught the congenitally deaf sons of great lords and other notables to read and write attain a knowledge of latin and greek study natural philosophy science and history and to pray ponce de leons students included the deaf brothers pedro and francisco de velasco and the congenitally deaf fray gaspar who later became a priest
1966223 we find little biographical informtion that might help us understand how deaf people lived it seems likely however that the dark ages were especially dark for deaf persons

1966233 the reality is were making good progress we think that the talks are headed in the right direction in washington
1966234 i think thats entirely possible in some measure its up to the union
1966235 one of the reasons why i love the school so much is at the time i wasnt qualified to go into college if you look at grades or sat tests

1966343 many citizens are too busy to attend events and or do not know about political events that is where we hope to bridge the gap
1966344 state senate majority whip jane orie says shes preparing a letter to pittsburghs oversight board asking it to warn city council by freezing the parking tax rate council risks a cutoff of all state funds to the city the ability to impose that penalty is one of the powers granted to the oversight board by state lawmakers pittsburghs financial recovery plan approved by the pennsylvania legislature requires that the parking tax be scaled back that was part of the trade off in exchange for additional taxing powers granted to the city including the annual 52 emergency municipal services tax
1966345 its irresponsible for them to have passed this i believe there is no support in the legislature to do this
1966346 we here on council control old taxes new taxes what tax rates are going to be
1966347 mayor luke ravenstahl and state legislators stopped short of endorsing city councilman jim motzniks plan to cancel mandated cuts in the tax and instead use some of the parking revenue to cut city debt and boost its troubled pension fund but they didnt rule it out either
1966348 if a parking tax freeze would happen and obviously that would require state action i certainly firmly support the dedication of that revenue to pension and debt
1966349 its something that were going to dig into this fall
1966350 mayor luke ravenstahl said wednesday will veto a proposed ordinance that would freeze the parking tax at 45 as a result the tax will drop to 40 starting jan 1 council members last week voted 8 1 to keep the tax at 45
1966351 would equate to in many cases less than a dime a day
1966352 it would cost us more to go around and change our signs and change our machines
1966353 a photograph is not only an image as a painting is an image it is the interpretation of the real it is also a trace
1966354 over a three year span the aggregate profit for both the debt reserve and the pension would come to 12 476 484 respectively the additional revenues aggregate would come to 24 952 968 funds deposited in the debt reserve fund have to be used for debt dedication of the funds will free up other funds to be used to extend the paygo capital budget therefore staving off the need to increase debt
1966355 city council raised the parking tax in 2004 from 31 percent then already the nations highest parking tax to 50 percent unleashing a storm of criticism from downtown business restaurant and parking lot owners council members said the increase was needed to save nearly 100 city jobs keep open the oliver bath house and maintain a youth sports program
1966356 pittsburghs parking tax at 50 the highest in the nation now tops the wage tax as the second largest source of city tax money

1966381 desde el ahorro en tiempos de bonanza e impulsando las inversiones hist ricas como hace zapatero en la comunitat valenciana frente al permanente derroche y el recorte hasta un 50 por ciento en las obras de la generalitat como hace camps
1966382 mientras camps se dedicaba a favorecer la especulaci n y el derroche del dinero p blico no se hizo nada en la modernizaci n del sistema productivo y ahora recoge lo que siembra con un incremento del paro que duplica la media nacional
1966383 camps es el l der del paro la morosidad y el endeudamiento en espa a por sus pol ticas de lo ef mero y su falta de apoyo al sistema productivo
1966384 como se dilapida el dinero p blico de los valencianos mientras se sigue en un claro deterioro de los servicios p blicos

1966416 we are happy to share with the world in these joyful moments but i am sad to see the big teams of many countries while our country is left behind with one of the smallest teams in the olympics
1966417 we had hoped that our country will participate with a large team in order to get good results in the games our interest in the olympics would have been greater
1966418 anyhow i will try not to miss the events they are in
1966419 we have waited eagerly for this world event in iraq we are in desperate need for such issues in order to entertain ourselves and forget the miseries

1966436 during periods of slow economic growth the last thing an advertiser wants to cut is its spending on search based advertising
1966437 when someone is ready to take action by clicking on an ad or buying something they will go to a search engine and type in what theyre looking for
1966438 the very last ad is the one that gets 100 of the credit we did this case study to get a better understanding of the synergies between search and display
1966439 when people type in those keywords they are at an extreme point of sale thats well understood everyone knows google gets a whole heck of a lot more credit for searches than what is attributable

1966460 el 23 de julio zapatero y angela merkel comparecieron en conferencias de prensa en las que se refirieron extensamente a la situaci n econ mica de sus respectivos pa ses
1966461 en cambio el rotativo brit nico no dedicaba ni una l nea a la comparecencia de zapatero me parece que esa diferencia de eco indica que el diario de referencia econ mica europeo sabe distinguir lo relevante de lo banal las declaraciones de importancia pol tica y econ mica y las insustancialidades demag gicas en definitiva la expresi n de liderazgo y la de ausencia de l
1966462 zapatero se est comportando ante la crisis como lo contrario de lo que pretende ser un l der reformista el l der reformista va dos pasos por delante de los problemas los explica con claridad a la sociedad no le oculta las dificultades ni los costes el dirigente populista primero intenta esconder el problema despu s intenta atenuarlo y por ltimo se aplica a ocultar su coste cualquier cosa antes que renunciar al rostro simp tico y a decirle a cada uno lo que le resulta grato escuchar

1966496 if christ is really gods search for man god to have effectively come down to earth must be discoverable here in this very place and moment
1966497 the best christian thought has always seen that only pharisaism comes through trying to be good for sanctity is less in wanting to be moral than in loving god and other men but the moralism which condemns a man for not loving is simply adding strength to that sense of fear and insecurity which prevents him from loving

1966561 prophetic magisterium the testimony and the fruitful legacy of pope montini
1966562 who supremely loved christ who desired greatly and strived to bring the gospel of christ to all peoples who for love of christ offered his life
1966563 lived and proclaimed the faith with tireless dedication and courage in the defense of integrity and purity he took advantage of every opportunity to make known the word of god and the thinking of the church
1966564 difficult years for the magisterium and for the governing of the church the years of protest and paul vi had to firmly steer the boats rudder and with courageous strength he strived to defend the deposit of the faith
1966565 difficult and painful he knew it would be opposed but he did not run from his responsibilities he had the issue studied and he studied it deeply and afterwards he had the courage to make a decision understanding well that he was going against the dominant culture and against what public opinion was expecting
1966566 the issue was one of divine law written by the creating hand of god in the very nature of the human person and the pope could not change it only interpret it
1966567 in a world wanting of love and full of problems and violence paul vi worked to bring about a civilization inspired in love in which solidarity and love reach to where social justice cannot
1966568 the civilization of love which should be raised up in hearts and consciences was for pope montini more than an idea or a project it was the guiding force of his entire life
1966569 to elect a board to manage our affairs as an independent polish roman catholic parish until an agreement can be reached with the archdiocese

1966575 the people expressed their desire for change and they choose a new phase for the country nobody doubts the importance of meeting these expectations getting rid of errors and negativity in political life and the urgent adoption of measures to seek the common good above personal family group and partisan interests in this context we congratulate the new government and the people for achieving the objectives of authentic change
1966576 mr fernando lugo who was a member of the bishops conference and left of his own accord was given a dispensation by pope benedict xvi and became president of the republic of paraguay
1966577 it does not seem necessary to point out that the catholic church does not identify with the new government but it is not redundant to reiterate that we cannot neglect our pastoral work in order to become involved in politics
1966578 it is important that the president alter his language to revise his comments
1966579 we must have a commitment to the church in madrid and throughout spain it is a commitment but above all apostolic character that concerns us all nautrally it concerns the pastors and faithful but very directly and specifically the young people
1966580 to recognize and remember the great heritage of holiness and missionary spirit inherited from our elders for the sake of young people from spain and the world
1966581 likely social or mental health related implications of undergoing induced abortion

1966583 likely to increase the risk of both abortion and depression
1966584 depression induced abortion and childbirth as well as sociodemographic variables family relationships and a number of individual characteristics such as schooling and occupational history and conduct problems
1966585 young adult women who undergo induced abortion may be at increased risk for subsequent depression
1966586 the concept of a beach convent is something that is appreciated by vacationers and the nuns themselves
1966587 we have come here today to speak out against the human rights abuses of the chinese government we have come here today to be a voice to those who are in prison because of their religious beliefs

1966589 we knelt right there in the middle of tiananmen square and began to pray
1966590 more people gathered around we were having umbrellas shoved in our side kicked the police of course were there
1966591 after a while they took the banner and then they picked us up and physically removed us from tiananmen square and detained us
1966592 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents and human rights advocates and religious activists
1966593 we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs
1966594 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
1966595 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1966596 we do not expect therefore pilgrims this time at madhu
1966597 i am so moved and proud tonight to see my country put on such an olympic games
1966598 this is the biggest holiday for chinese people this is a chance for the world to meet china
1966599 we want you to win as many golds as you possibly can go forth give it all you got
1966600 its got to be really exciting thinking about marching in that stadium and representing our country
1966601 we appreciate all the hard work youve put in to get to this spot
1966602 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
1966603 when theres a initial cluster of two consonants of which one of the two elements is voiced a schwa is inserted between the two
1966604 the in the nominative is either due to mono syllabicity of the word
1966605 which phonemically would point toward t kan and tkn s while id say from your idea of fixing asyllabic roots wed want to see t kan and tekn s right
1966606 in what way is takn representative of the pie stage
1966607 note that indeed this is also regressive vowel harmony just like old norse while proto altaic has progressive vowel harmony
1966608 the indo european endings for the vocalism are m s t which go back to an earlier m sa ta the last two might be innovations of indo european but the first person singular is m and not m as this would ruin the syncopation
1966609 the second person singular ending is clearly built of the t that glen reconstructs h from the first person singular ending
1966610 but from the forms ax and at i failt to see where those as went and where those s came from
1966611 finales nasales mobiles et pr nasalis es indo europ ennes
1966612 let me just stress that everything i present here are my theories im not doing this to get respect and honour but just so people wont think badly of glen gordons awesome work if i make some terrible mistake in my reasoning
1966613 with this the two forms of the genitive have finally been unified into a single suffix so so obvious that im astounded it hadnt occurred to me sooner besides that its also so obvious im sure it has occurred to other people too
1966614 the s ending in the nominative is obviously highly curious if it is indeed from the stem so to because youd be saying so so this this in pre indo european
1966615 my gut tells me that o was a at some point especially considering hittite having a for o
1966616 and id want to assume that then all later es are in fact secondary developments from a or
1966617 last but not least the perfect has three endings ending in e while according to the rules of syncope we wouldnt like to see final es or os at all
1966618 it almost looks like a sort of anti vowel harmony where the vowels preceding the suffix disharmonise with the suffix vowel im curious if anyone knows such a language please tell me if you do
1966619 the idea of having an exception class for syncope devoted to deictics seems rather crazy in my opinion why would they syncopate and not normal suffixes
1966620 maybe were not looking at one syncope maybe there was syncopation and only later suffixation of deictics which underwent their own de accentuation and therefore loss of vowel
1966621 so according to that all of the word final as would result in what we know in the conventional system as e
1966622 either way the closed open syllable idea does works quite well but is also pretty impossible to prove is it not
1966623 just on a side note i was wondering why do you always write your reconstructed dentals with a tilde under them
1966624 but if im correct ive never seen you write it as such with the velars labiovelars for example
1966625 but youd expect this schwa to survive in some other non reduplication environments as well itd be interesting to go looking for some words like that will do so soon
1966626 seems like a logical resistance but why did it mask itself as e and not as i
1966627 theres indeed quite a bit too this though then id imagine the e reduplication was already e at the time while a new reduplication was formed with a schwa which then became i
1966628 i do have some problems with the idea that reduplication develops twice
1966629 thinking of attempting to construct a phylogenetic tree for a set of semitic languages using
1966630 and once youve already established known cognates chances are youre not going to have to make phylogenetic trees since its pretty clear already
1966631 the world as it is and the world as it should be
1966632 our job as americans is to narrow the gap between those two ideas
1966633 do we settle for the world as it is or fight for the world as it should be
1966634 this is going to be a close election and thats why we cant leave anything to chance
1966635 that kind of bottom up approach to politics is what makes this country great
1966636 the second thing he said he had to do was ask his wife
1966637 but he was persistent in that barack obama kind of way
1966638 the man i fell in love with in that church basement is the man who stands before america today
1966639 you look at the physics of the thing and it looks like a very improbable game
1966640 just fork over the dough and let them go for it
1966641 patients in the united states made an estimated 1 1 billion visits to physician offices and hospital outpatient and emergency departments in 2006 an average of four visits per person per year according to new health care statistics released today by the centers for disease control and prevention
1966642 lets make it easy to tell what weapons they have on the table
1966643 the rule is no biting hitting slapping or scratching the guesser if i go higher

1966794 harlot starlet and abrasive funny man in illicit meeting at comedy club shocker
1966795 aidan lori has been thinking how good it would be to have a baby
1966796 i mean youve got to look after it feed it clean it youre looking at lots of time just being with it
1966797 you might even have to spend time loving the little person
1966798 youd have to spend time as its parents educating it
1966799 there would be nannies boss lots of them you wouldnt have to lift a finger
1966800 its simple and brilliant boss everyone is doing it and its a sure fire way of getting you at least five to eighteen years of exposure
1966801 yes my sweetness lady you can even go longer if you do a really good job of it the funny thing is the royals have been showing us how to do it for hundreds of years and weve only just cottoned on
1966802 sort of like the queen yeah you think about how they love a royal wedding
1966803 people turn out in their thousands to watch that shit man they same goes for the divine babies they produce everyone wants the first picture or the first reaction from the glowing and happy parents
1966804 if you two want to take this seriously youll have to cut that out
1966805 anyway think about it you two the greatest comedian living today and the most famous pop singer of the moment getting together to have a child
1966806 it doesnt just end with the kid being born a whole new market opens up as soon as there is a child involved the daytime audience will follow every sleepless night every school play every contraction and every teenage binge on the town you would hardly have to lift a finger to keep yourselves in the picture
1966807 well spend a little bit of your stash fly to sudan and tell that to the face of the little girl dying because she is too poor to live
1966808 they used to laugh at me when i said i wanted to be a comedian ha well theyre not laughing now
1966809 humping you until the time before you conceive will be fun after that youre on your own
1966810 im not going to do this my career is great loris will be fantastic for many many years im sure shes got a brain in her head and she knows how to work people without having to go through the indignity of a public pregnancy
1966811 then go and fall in love find someone who will father a child with you and help you bring it up to be a good decent human being you might actually find its more rewarding than flashing your stretch marks on breakfast tv
1966812 you do realised youre turning down the opportunity of a lifetime
1966813 it would be cared for have the best of everything
1966814 and what happens when it grows up watching its parents fighting in the tabloids or when the important issues need addressing and its mother and father arent there to guide it because theyre at an award show getting pissed with fucking soulless soap stars
1966815 yeah on chat shows when the poor fucker cant get a real job because theyre too good for the real world its just bloody wrong
1966816 aidan even if you are sure you dont want to do this can you call me sometime

1966820 so i said to her why dont you tell him where you got that hat
1966821 i have come across a discovery that will shake our relationship as you the audience and me the funny fucker to shards of logical and morbid destruction
1966822 i read the other day that your sense of humour is related to your own sense of mortality the more you laugh at something means youre more in denial that you know youre going to die
1966823 stop laughing youre not as immune to death as you like to think
1966824 dont you see what youre doing youre living a lie youre living a lie
1966825 im the one helping you to pull the wool over your eyes i never thought i would be the one to lie to you

1966854 i listen to secular hip hop cause i can relate
1966855 you turn to corruption and destruction to feed your need to be the best thats not like the marko man i know
1966856 you get angry you dont like what you hear and you power up to fight your way out of it
1966857 oh yeah definitely not the marko man that everyone knows definitely not the marko man you need to be either thats what they want you to do
1966858 i am your balance here in nessasis without me youd fail hardbody when i first came here i thought that my purpose was to defeat you i fought you in your corrupted state when you were shin marko man and while you obviously had the power to defeat me your skill was waaaay off as a result i couldve taken you out then and there but you clearly wouldnt have learned anything if i did however i think you have been brought to a point of no return or at least not a normal return you basically have officially lost your mind
1966859 marko if the problem truly is what it is then we shall fight
1966860 the solution to your madness lies in the result of this fight
1966861 you might as well fight it out now like i said the solution that you seek will be revealed at the end of this fight youre already knee deep in it finish it
1966862 i mean look at you all of that power yet the mind to use any skill with it ceases to exist
1966863 fine by me it just give me a ne advantage in range
1966864 marko needed to die right now better me do it than someone else trust me if marko was in his normal state then i promise you thered be no way i could kill him or even beat him marko is by far the greatest warrior when hes thinking straight and when he has all available powers and resources that hes been used to for umpteen years he came to nessasis he lost those powers and thus this is the result however if the reason for markos insanity is because of the death of his friends then i can guarantee you that marko will be back with a vengance oh yeah marko will be back and hell be out to get anyone and everyone that is the pure enemy

1966868 no matter how hard you stare at the sun it keeps on rising rising over those eastern hills destroying the night
1966869 or you could just go through your whole life and be happy anyway
1966870 its not entirely clear how i ended up like this near the parenthesis
1966871 on top of improvised chord sequences using piano and vibraphone
1966872 as bismarck once remarked in a famous speech moral courage is in any case a rare virtue in germany but it deserts a german completely the moment he puts on a uniform
1966873 you get the impression that no more than a few dozen people are involved who happen to be at the helm of the ship of state and whose deeds and decisions form what is called history
1966874 according to this view the history of the present decade the 1930s is a kind of chess game among hitler mussolini chiang kai shek roosevelt chamberlain daladier and a number of other men whose names are on everybodys lips
1966875 it may seem a paradox but it is nonetheless the simple truth to say that on the contrary the decisive historical events take place among us the anonymous masses the most powerful dictators ministers and generals are powerless against the simultaneous mass decisions taken individually and almost unconsciously by the population at large decisions that influence the course of history arise out of the individual experiences of thousands or millions of individuals
1966876 what happened to that majority did they die did they disappear from the face of the earth did they become nazis at this late stage how was it possible that there was not the slightest visible reaction from them
1966877 there are some things i must never do never say anything that i would be ashamed of later
1966878 only what if dear god there was some court that did not recognize this defense but simply wrote down everything as it happened that did not look into my heart but simply noted the swastika armband
1966879 no other nation has experienced anything comparable to the events of 1923 in germany
1966880 anyone who had savings in a bank or bonds saw their value disappear overnight soon it did not matter whether it was a penny put away for a rainy day or a vast fortune everything was obliterated a pound of potatoes which yesterday had cost fifty thousand marks now cost a hundred thousand the salary of sixty five thousand marks brought home the previous friday was no longer sufficient to buy a packet of cigarettes on tuesday in august the dollar reached a million marks in september a million marks no longer had any practical value at the end of october it was a billion the atmosphere became revolutionary once again
1966881 from 1914 to 1918 a generation of german schoolboys daily experienced war as a great thrilling enthralling game between nations which provided far more excitement and emotional satisfaction than anything peace could offer and that is where nazism draws its allure from its simplicity its appeal to the imagination and its zest for action but also its intolerance and its cruelty toward internal opponents ultimately that is also the source of nazisms belligerent attitude toward neighboring states other countries are not regarded as neighbors but must be opponents whether they like it or not
1966882 if my experience of germany has taught me anything it is this rathenau who led a progressive government in 1921 22 and was then assassinated by anti semitic thugs and hitler are the two men who excited the imagination of the german masses to the utmost the one by his ineffable culture the other by his ineffable vileness both and this is decisive came from inaccessible regions from sort of beyond the one from a sphere of sublime spirituality where the cultures of three millennia and two continents hold a symposium the other from a jungle far below the depths plumbed by the basest penny dreadfuls from an underworld where demons rise from a brewed up stench of petty bourgeois back rooms doss houses barrack latrines and the hangmans yard from their respective beyonds they both drew a spellbinding power quite irrespective of their politics
1966883 it was then that the real mystery of the hitler phenomenon began to show itself the strange befuddlement and numbness of his opponents who could not cope with his behavior and found themselves transfixed by the gaze of the basilisk unable to see that it was hell personified that challenged them
1966884 what saved me was my nose i have a fairly well developed figurative sense of smell or to put it differently a sense of the worth or worthlessness of human moral political views and attitudes most germans unfortunately lack this sense almost completely the cleverest of them are capable of discussing themselves stupid with their abstractions and deductions when just using their noses would tell them that something stinks
1966885 they still fall for anything after all that i do not see that one can blame the majority of germans who in 1933 believed that the reichstag fire was the work of the communists the parliament burned down and a convenient communist arsonist was fingered which the nazis used as the excuse to unleash police state tactics against all opponents what one can blame them for and what shows their terrible collective weakness of character clearly for the first time during the nazi period is that this settled the matter with sheepish submissiveness the german people accepted that as a result of the fire each one of them lost what little personal freedom and dignity was guaranteed by the constitution as though it followed as a necessary consequence
1966886 anger and disgust with the cowardly treachery of their own opposition leadership
1966887 join the thugs to avoid being beaten up less clear was a kind of exhilaration the intoxication of unity the magnetism of the masses many also felt a need for revenge against those who had abandoned them then there was a peculiarly german line of thought all the predictions of the opponents of the nazis have not come true they said the nazis could not win now they have won therefore the opponents were wrong so the nazis must be right there was also particularly among intellectuals the belief that they could change the face of the nazi party by becoming a member even now shift its direction
1966888 the only thing that is missing is what in animals is called breeding this is a solid inner kernel that cannot be shaken by external pressures and forces something noble and steely a reserve of pride principle and dignity to be drawn on in the hour of trial it is missing in the germans as a nation they are soft unreliable and without backbone that was shown in march 1933 at the moment of truth when other nations rise spontaneously to the occasion the germans collectively and limply collapsed they yielded and capitulated and suffered a nervous breakdown the result of this million fold nervous breakdown is the unified nation ready for anything that is today the nightmare of the rest of the world
1966889 it is one of the uncanny aspects of events in germany that the deeds have no doers the suffering has no martyrs everything takes place under a kind of anesthesia objectively dreadful deeds produce a thin puny emotional response murders are committed like schoolboy pranks humiliation and moral decay are accepted like minor incidents even death under torture only produces the response bad luck
1966890 we were pursued into the farthest corners of our private lives in all areas of life there was rout panic and flight no one could tell where it would end at the same time we were called upon not to surrender but to renege just a little pact with the devil and you were no longer one of the captured quarry instead you were one of the victorious hunters
1966891 things were quite deliberately arranged so that the individual had no room to maneuver what one represented what ones opinions were in private and actually were of no concern and set aside put on ice as it were on the other hand in moments when one had the leisure to think of ones individuality one had the feeling that what was actually happening in which one participated mechanically had no real existence or validity it was only in these hours that one could attempt to call oneself morally to account and prepare a last position of defense for ones inner self
1966892 it is said that the germans are subjugated that is only half true they are also something else something worse for which there is no word they are comraded a dreadfully dangerous condition they are under a spell they live a drugged life in a dream world they are terribly happy but terribly demeaned so self satisified but so boundlessly loathsome so proud and yet so despicable and inhuman they think they are scaling high mountains when in reality they are crawling through a swamp as long as the spell lasts there is almost no antidote
1966893 vous portez un brassard orn dun swastika et vous d clarez que vous ne le voulez pas alors pourquoi le portez vous
1966894 aucune des pr dictions des opposants au nazisme ne sest r alis e ils disaient que les nazis ne pouvaient pas gagner pourtant ils ont gagn donc lopposition avait tort par cons quent les nazis doivent avoir raison

1966920 like irene or david or beulah gray or guy or dot but even more so i should strive to be like paul and even more so to ultimately strive to be like christ
1966921 one of the reasons so many christans lead mediocore lives they are comparing themselves to mediocre people

1967012 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

1967038 if network operators cant manage traffic loads one way theyll do it another by banning discrimination based on application or content the fcc and net neutrality proponents more broadly are pushing network operators closer and closer to what increasingly is their only viable alternative usage based pricing
1967039 the best thing that ever happened to the network operator crowd
1967040 the worst thing that ever happened to applications and content
1967041 these assertions are simply untrue by stirring up fears of higher monthly bills this posturing attempts to delegitimize the commissions worthy action giving consumers the false impression that they must choose between secret internet blocking or the very undesirable practice of metering
1967042 this is a false choice one most providers dont even consider necessary or practical these scare tactics shouldnt deter anyone from pursuing the policies we need to preserve a free and open internet
1967043 but to believe such a move is right around the corner we must accept the argument that there is congestion in the network
1967044 predicting the internets catastrophic collapse and ghost sites galore in 1996
1967045 almost all of the many predictions now being made about 1996 hinge on the internets continuing exponential growth but i predict the internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse

1967049 fgf 23 helps regulate serum phosphate levels and we know that among patients with kidney failure elevated phosphate is associated with more rapid progression to renal failure and earlier death
1967050 the results of this study suggest that we need to be concerned about phosphate control even for patients whose serum phosphate levels are normal and that may involve routine screening for fgf 23
1967051 incorporating fgf 23 levels into the management of kidney failure may have its greatest potential for treatment of the millions of patients with early stage kidney disease who do not yet require dialysis who usually have normal phosphate levels but quite high fgf 23
1967052 routinely monitoring fgf 23 may help determine which patients need to begin therapies that control phosphate levels which may reduce mortality in this very high risk group

1967151 in effect this is a circular arena a theater in the round and that is how it is used with complete confusion as to who are spectators and who are the show
1967152 around the fountain from the outermost edge of the fountain wall to the innermost edge of any seating
1967153 the fountain plaza appears to be smaller than 90 of the current area and thus does not comply with the gerson quinn agreement the question is however by how much the task force did not have enough information from the parks department to draw a clear conclusion on the size of the inner circle in the plan rough calculations made by task force members of the total square footage of the inner circle ranged from 88 to 77 of the current area

1967195 abbiamo ritrovato parte della zona termale con piastrini ancora in situ un muro con ancora le tracce delle risega su cui si poggiava il pavimento sotto cui passava laria calda per il riscaldamento e un paio di mosaici in bianco e nero con motivi molto belli anche se non del tutto integri dice federica fontana probabilmente uno di questi mosaici fa parte di una nuova domus sempre risalente al iv secolo d c collocata per dallaltra parte della strada che divideva il quartiere residenziale si tratta di una casa leggermente meno ricca ma molto curata dove scaveremo nei prossimi anni
1967196 almost invariably a victims thoughts like how could he do this to me or ill get back at him produce violent images of causing that pain to another or else the torturer becomes deeply identified with the victims agonies to the extent of secretly imagining how it hurts so in the play of lives the victim turns persecutor or the torturer in his constant infliction of pain needs to suffer the very thing he inflicts
1967197 all my husbands have left me i dont deserve to be loved
1967198 pray for many more earthquakes to kill many more thousands of impudent and ungrateful chinese

1967204 my little fellow why are you looking so earnestly in that window
1967205 i was asking god to give me a pair of shoes
1967206 no doubt my little fellow you feel more comfortable now
1967207 we will not allow the death of our compatriots to go unpunished
1967208 there are so many claims and counter claims that its impossible to know who started it
1967209 both sides have been antagonistic and easy to antagonize its a cold war thats suddenly gotten very hot
1967210 the conflict might be short and hot but my sense is that neither party wants a prolonged conflict
1967211 were mad as hell and we wont take it anymore
1967212 he cheated on me and i punched him right in the face
1967213 i caught her cheating so i did what anyone would do i bitch slapped that ho
1967214 it will be like instant messaging its ubiquitous but no one makes money on it
1967215 it will have to be a very different kind of advertising if someone does figure it out then google will be in a good position
1967216 if you are a publisher youre paying for this expense and youre trying to figure out how ad revenue will offset that expense
1967217 what weve found is that advertisers and agencies are only interested in professional media so professional content providers are having a good time finding extremely high demand because they have a lack of video views
1967218 those who will not use their brains are no better off than those who have no brains and so this mindless school of jelly fish father mother son and daughter become useful beasts of burden or trainers of the same
1967219 if we know the truth we must tell it if we dont we must learn it

1967225 there was never any issue of us owing dues until january 2008 when someone in the local office tried to say we owed it
1967226 we paid within days even though we werent officially notified we paid six months dues but we were told that we had not paid dues and that our membership had lapsed they are trying to take away our membership on technicality
1967227 the uaw constitution in article 45 section 1 specifically states that a shop committee person terminated by the employer and who has a pending grievance remains a member and can run for any open office thats pretty cut and dry
1967228 normally the ieb conducts factual hearings but because of ieb prejudice we are asking that the prb itself hold this one
1967229 the prejudice is demonstrated in two ways a according to a witness statement in the record the local expelled the five on the recommendation of eunice stokes administrative assistant to uaw president ron gettelfinger given in a phone conversation in january when stokes did not know and did not inquire about all the facts and b the ieb ordered the trial last fall to go ahead on the theory that the five lied to members in the strike by saying it was authorized though the charge didnt allege that and every witness on both sides agreed at the trial it wasnt true
1967230 corporations continue to flock to the south where they can take advantage of right to work laws and intimidate workers
1967231 it is incidents such as the termination of the five cleveland freightliner union members that impedes the ability of unions to organize successfully in the south
1967232 when workers see what happens to union members union leaders they will choose not to be a part of a union in the end the corporations win and workers lose
1967233 today freightliner is not only an integral part of the daimlerchrysler truck group and the pillar of our north american commercial vehicle operations it is also the group sales leader for our entire truck business
1967234 very very soon i think in less than a year
1967235 no wage adjustments provided at any newly organized plant prior to mid 2003
1967236 no future expectations that any freightliner business unit will be required to meet uaw pattern agreements
1967237 i saw many things that could have been avoided that management just overlooked
1967238 i was fired a couple of times and walked out of the plant a couple of times
1967239 i always changed out of my uaw shirt first because i didnt want to give them the satisfaction of seeing someone in a union shirt taken out of the plant
1967240 i didnt vote for robert whiteside for shop committee chair because i didnt know him
1967241 hes polite and professional but when you stepped on his peoples toes you unleashed a lion
1967242 the previous shop committee chair had a nice office with a secretary paid by the company
1967243 but when robert was elected they put the office in a metal hole in the back of the plant and took the secretary away i asked him brother do you think youre the wrong color for this company he said it sure looks that way
1967244 workers rights and civil rights walk down the same road
1967245 but we had a series of terminations for substance abuse i dont take drugs or even drink but i think everyone has the right to be protected from false positive tests
1967246 indeed they must have been in good standing to even be allowed a trial
1967247 what we want is justice from our employer and what we would like to achieve is solidarity from our international union and our brothers and sisters all over the world
1967248 we wholeheartedly endorse this colossal waste of funds not only is moveon orgs anti drilling position out of step with 70 percent of americans but a member like mike conaway who represents the texas oil patch will probably see his approval rating surge upward as a result of these ads

1967264 women are art men are machines were built to just keep working as long as weve got fuel
1967265 unmarried men are rudderless ships they are just floating around bangin into stuff until they get a good woman to anchor them
1967266 my wife asked me if i would remarry if she died
1967267 a fellow told my wife your husband is really brave and she said no he isnt hes just stupid shes right you see males do lots of stupid things simply cause they were bored at the time and their curiosity got the better of em
1967268 i guess we didnt hit you hard enough the first time
1967269 nah it was an independent job lino doesnt know a thing about it
1967270 it was just a convenient landmark someplace we could all meet up before going to the job
1967271 so you decided hey as long as were here lets rob the fuckin place
1967272 i know the family bowl is your turf i know that whole neighborhood is your territory we were just supposed to meet there and move on
1967273 i showed up early to wait for gus and the guys
1967274 i should have just peeled out of there called the guys and had them clear off but
1967275 i just decided to peek in see if i could help i guess i dont know do you always know why you do something
1967276 anyway there were maybe three guys in there tearing the place apart they were just finishing up and when one of them spotted me coming in he just came at me i tried to hold my own but they were all like 30 years younger than me they ate me alive next thing i remember these guys are shaking me awake
1967277 what was the real job you were meeting up for
1967278 nothing professional nothing that would have upset the apple cart
1967279 i would just love a damp towel and a whiskey

1967285 o esp rito que deve animar existe de qualquer maneira fora dele propriamente falando ele n o tem uma alma pois a encarna o est apenas em vias de se realizar mas est ligado alma que deve possuir
1967286 isso acontece freq entemente e deus o permite como prova seja para os pais seja para o esp rito destinado a encarnar
1967287 sim h as que jamais tiveram um esp rito destinado aos seus corpos nada devia cumprir se nela somente pelos pais que essa crian a nasce
1967288 h sempre crime quando se transgride a lei de deus a m e ou qualquer pessoa cometer sempre um crime ao tirar a vida crian a antes do seu nascimento porque isso impedir a alma de passar pelas provas de que o corpo devia ser o instrumento

1967306 our galaxy contains between 100 and 400 billion stars and there are some 125 billion galaxies in the universe that gives us 20 000 quadrillion stars each of which might have many planets in orbit since none of us has been there it would be pretty self centered to assume that out of al those stars earth is the only place where life has developed in the universe
1967307 the universe has been evolving for some 14 billion years but the earliest humans only appeared seven million years ago thats a very thin slice of time the last 18 days if we shrink evolution down to a year
1967308 again assuming we shrink evolution down to a year we have only developed science in the last 250 years the last 90 minutes and travelled in space since 1961 the last 16 minutes
1967309 when white people first met black they were shocked when we first met elephants we were also shocked but we gor used to it and found that we could share love with time we have learned that when fear is removed love is the natural condition this logic tells us that when we do meet being from another planetary civilization whether in physical or psychic form once we get over the shock we will discover love
1967310 what you want me oh jesus dont you know who i am dont you know what ive done no you want billy graham or joyce meyer not me im not what you want look away im old and rusty i have deep scratches and dents even my motor is seized and my brakes are shot my mom and dad hated me no one loves me i am forgotten and rejected how could you the god of the universe who owns everything want me
1967311 youre not hopeless in my eyes youre priceless i can make your crooked paths straight i am the same god who created the universe out of nothing i am the same god that can resurrect you too take my hand and let me help you
1967312 ive called you by name and i know who you are and you have found favor in my sight
1967313 dad forgive this one this one is mine i died for this one for my sake let this one live

1967318 i think i pretended to be a cat too long

1967320 no i dont remember it cause i was sleeping i just woke up on the floor
1967321 god doesnt just tolerate us or remain with us out of obligation we are his treasure and the objects of his holy passion
1967322 you cannot continue life as usual or stay where you are and go with god at the same time that is true throughout scripture noah could not continue life as usual and build an ark at the same time jonah had to leave his home and overcome a major prejudice in order to preach in nineveh saul later paul had to completely change directions in life in order to be used of god to preach the gospel to the gentiles
1967323 therefore i urge you brothers in view of gods mercy to offer your bodies as living sacrifices holy and pleasing to god this is your spiritual act of worship
1967324 dont you know that you yourselves are gods temple and that gods spirit lives in you
1967325 do you not know that your bodies are members of christ should i therefore take the members of christ and make them members of a prostitute never
1967326 or do you not know that your body is a temple of the holy spirit within you which you have from god and that you are not your own
1967327 it is gods will that you should be sanctified that you should avoid sexual immorality that each of you should learn to control his own body in a way that is holy and honorable not in passionate lust like the heathen who do not know god and that in this matter no one should wrong his brother or take advantage of him the lord will punish men for all such sins as we have already told you and warned you
1967328 marriage should be honored by all and the marriage bed kept pure for god will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral
1967329 do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of god do not be deceived neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of god and that is what some of you were but you were washed you were sanctified you were justified in the name of the lord jesus christ and by the spirit of our god
1967330 the king will reply i tell you the truth whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine you did for me
1967331 he will reply i tell you the truth whatever you did not do for one of the least of these you did not do for me
1967332 if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land
1967333 this shows how deep a challenge it is for police leaders who are trying to balance the concerns of citizens about national security and the issue of terrorism
1967334 twenty years ago you would have more likely seen a police department that would bully straight ahead with this over these heated objections
1967335 it was quite clear from the community of muslim leaders in l a that this was ill conceived and something they could not partner in
1967336 if a police chief like william bratton who is considered one of americas finest had the naivet to think this idea would work we cant say that community policing in america has come very far since the days of rodney king
1967337 it shows that there still needs to be a lot more proactive interaction between police and the communities they serve
1967338 when people hear about the plan they think that muslims are bad
1967339 this is the first great step toward a healthy dialogue between the muslim community and the lapd and it is definitely a great step toward democracy
1967340 we decided 15 years ago that reaching out to police was good idea
1967341 the support goes both ways we have seen how despite a small number of police who violate codes of conduct most try to protect us so we see how hard they have worked for muslims since 9 11

1967391 well i spied on them when ever they had there meetings and after i came home from making sure the ambulance came he got really mad and then really drunk so i decided to make it work to my advantage i asked him about the whole thing and he told me

1967458 as our attentional skills are squandered we are plunging into a culture of mistrust skimming and a dehumanising merger between man and machine
1967459 the deep reading that used to come naturally has become a struggle
1967460 the replacement of complex inner density with a new kind of self evolving under the pressure of information overload and the technology of the instantly available
1967461 is that we now go outside of ourselves to make all the connections that we used to make inside of ourselves
1967462 the next generation will not grieve because they will not know what they have lost
1967463 i feel that much of my life is ebbing away in the tide of minute by minute distraction im not certain what the effect on the world will be but psychologists do say that intense close engagement with things does provide the most human satisfaction

1967573 although i do not yet know exactly what my comment will entail i can say with a great degree of certainty that it will be incredibly stupid
1967574 the result will be an astonishing combination of ignorance offensiveness and sheer idiocy
1967575 it is my moral obligation to alert the internet community to the fact that this video is totally gay and furthermore that the individual who made it is a fag

1967584 i promise everyone that this post will be exactly what you have come to expect from an idiot like myself

1967688 consumers are increasingly demanding their entertainment be truly immersive engaging and collaborative whereas once the act of watching reading and hearing entertainment was passive consumers now and in the future will be active and unrestrained by the ubiquitous nature of circular entertainment key to this evolution is consumers basic human desire to compare and contrast create and communicate we believe the next episode promises to deliver the democracy politics can only dream of

1967766 he needs goals to aim for he pushes and pushes and as hes approaching his goal he needs the next goal a workaholic is not able to stop and enjoy his accomplishments
1967767 if a workaholic won the lottery he would not stop hes not doing it for the money
1967768 instead enormous anxiety and unresolved psychological issues are kept at bay by the work addicts incessant activity the underlying belief is that if i were not always active i would have no right to exist like alcoholism its a disease of the soul a spiritual disease
1967769 workaholics are addicted to power and control but the focus of the obsession is work
1967770 the more chaos you have inside the more you need to control everything around you the obsession eventually runs you you dont run it
1967771 looking back i wasnt able to remember any memories of my children in those raising days the older baby days to pre teen years
1967772 i cant remember any interaction with my kids all three have told me that at some point they wanted to leave home i was so busy completing the process of each day i didnt realize i wasnt present for my family
1967773 i didnt know i had a problem i didnt realize i was screwing up my life

1967785 solana expressed his serious concern about the situation in south ossetia and called for every effort to be made to rapidly end the violence and resume peaceful talks between the sides

1967802 i have opened it and it is all there which is good considering how it has been treated over the years the story to do with the parcel has a lot to do with my youngest boy you know he was killed in a motor accident in france when he was 32 he had two girls in the car with him whom he was leaving back to their hotel and he died in an astounding fashion only god could have schemed it he was driving at speed along a straight stretch and he was over the limit and a local doctor on the way to another collision was lighting a cigarette crossed the road and caught him on the pillar of his saab and pulled his belt and strangled him poor geoff
1967803 no no i am well over it i thought i would die after it but i didnt and i live blimp was the fellow you should have seen at the funeral and the afters he was full of fussing and dashing about and making eulogies he must have done eight or nine and the more he spoke the greater geoff was he was really enjoying himself i never saw him so smug
1967804 geoff came along about 11 years after patsies and he was nuisance of a child being exceedingly delicate in his mothers view and i saw a very very bold young scamp but he was most lovable
1967805 being so much younger he was spoilt or neglected we tended to assume that he knew everything as he grew up he played rugby snooker the girls and a tiny bit of cricket once on a sun filled day he was silly mid off when he saw a girl and disappeared and was never selected again geoff was like me in build so always played centre or full back but never had the bulk so always played rigger on the seconds when he was in college he went to trinity and did arts he had a lot of great friends he having the charm and some money from his grandpa who on his death divided up his wealth among all the grandchildren i got none of it then i suppose i didnt need it i have done ok in my business
1967806 yes i was i was an antique dealer i got into it when i was a young fellow i was not any good at swotting at a desk i was much more inclined to look underneath for the woodworm so in fifth year after much pleading at the age of sixteen my dad gave me the princely sum of 30 00 and told me that if i didnt make it into 60 by the summers end that i would have to go back to school i made it into 100 because i had so little to start i ferreted out good pieces of furniture or glass or silver or whatever and i would for a small reward tip off the real dealers about where they could get a pair of early candelabra for instance after a couple of years i had enough earned to do some buying and selling later i rented louis kahns premises which were on the first floor in south william street i bought that house and having gotten the taste i suppose you could say i became a property man i became known as mister george though my name was john george cutler you should call me george

1967831 quiero ver que se haga justicia con los tres comandantes del ruf
1967832 era un ni o que asist a a la escuela cuando fui capturado y mutilado sin piedad ahora la mayor a de los rebeldes han sido rehabilitados y se les imparti cursos de capacitaci n mientras que yo y otros amputados languidecemos con nuestras cicatrices
1967833 sabemos que donantes internacionales env an una enorme asistencia para nosotros pero jam s la recibimos es demasiado injusto si estos ex comandantes son condenados habr justicia para las v ctimas
1967834 el pueblo de sierra leona necesita sin duda la reconciliaci n sin embargo las atrocidades cometidas por el ruf merecen el m ximo castigo este pa s no puede tolerar la impunidad porque no queremos repetir nuestro horrendo pasado
1967835 nos sumamos a un acuerdo de paz y la guerra civil lleg a su fin no creo que el juicio de tres caballeros en un tribunal especial est a tono con el esp ritu de reconciliaci n nacional creo que deben ser liberados y que hay que enterrar el pasado
1967836 acuerdos con algunos pa ses de la regi n que prometieron ofrecer lugares de detenci n para los condenados que se ajusten a los est ndares internacionales esto no ocurre en las c rceles de sierra leona por lo que las personas halladas culpables cumplir n sus sentencias fuera del pa s
1967837 no creo que sea inteligente mantener a esas personas en nuestras c rceles

1967841 el gobierno federal no puede argumentar seriamente que carece de jurisdicci n nacional para proteger la salud p blica de enfermedades peligrosas como el c ncer
1967842 los fumadores pasivos tienen m s riesgo de contraer c ncer de pulm n por lo tanto es necesario establecer una prohibici n de fumar de alcance nacional en lugares como edificios p blicos restaurantes y discotecas
1967843 si se acepta la l gica de la bgn y su manipulaci n de las estad sticas se puede concluir que fumar protege contra el c ncer

1967881 i am the darkness that is the light and the stillness that is the dancing
1967882 if you ever had your heart broken or hurt and you forgave that person and still was able to love them like before thats true love
1967883 take a look at what you have think of all you did to get it remember it only takes one second to lose
1967884 the best thing about loving and being hurt is that you get to know what true love really is for as gold is tested in fire and so will love be perfected in pain
1967885 when it hurts to look back and you are scared to look ahead look beside you and your bestfriend will be there
1967886 sometimes the one you love the most may say something hurtful out of anger or frustration that doesnt matter what matters most is what is really in their heart
1967887 those who have never experienced hurt can never experience true love
1967888 sometimes we must get hurt in order to grow we must fail in order to know sometimes our vision clears only after our eyes are washed away with tears
1967889 people need love the most when they deserve it the least
1967890 always remember that through the tormoil love may bring the heart sees what the eyes cannot
1967891 to love someone is nothing to be loved by someone is something to love and be loved by someone is everything
1967892 when you were born you were crying and everyone around you was smiling live your life so that when you die youre smiling and everyone around you is crying

1967941 apple is a market leader by creating a fervor for the iphone ipods and macs it has become one of the most cutting edge companies in the digital world
1967942 ultimately i think apple is a bit overwhelmed and i hope they realize that the lack of communication will hurt them in the long run
1967943 i dont think theres been a misstep at all i think the problem has been with the expectations compared with what any company in that position will choose to do and how theyll act
1967944 the problem isnt with what apple has done the only real problem is the difference between what apple actually does and what people expect them to do expecting a benevolent wide open unrestricted market for absolutely every application developer in the world was naive those of us from the wireless world instead of the computing world certainly saw this as being completely predictable
1967945 why is anybody in the world surprised by this of course there will be limits on the applications that are available of course there will be stifled development of course there will be things that dont suit the powers that be and will vanish weve come to expect that from the telcos but somehow the benevolent apple would provide us with an environment that was wide open without limits and without controls
1967946 the behavior is somewhat chaotic and ungoverned because there are a lot of people trying to do a lot of things and sometimes when you succeed so fast and so well the expectations rise a lot the big challenge becomes how do you meet those expectations this is what is happening at apple that they are dealing with a huge success the iphone has become iconic overnight so they are dealing with a huge uptake of stuff and this is moving so fast and chaotic in the sense that everyone wants to have their application on it
1967947 the real triumph of this tour is that we havent strangled each other

1967985 in recent weeks genuine passengers using ryanairs website have been suffering long processing times and slower access because of the huge volume of information being downloaded from our website by these screenscrapers all over europe in all cases this scraping activity is unlawful and in breach of both ryanair coms copyright and terms of use

1968017 that door will hold against megatons of explosive power plus each of our guests are safely tucked away in their cells awaiting room service
1968018 i need to call in to find out if the other sites have been cleared but im guessing radio transmission in here wont get out
1968019 a few thousand tons of concrete and many more of earth do not a good transmitter make
1968020 but there is a secured phone line behind you at the desk kemp
1968021 indeed they are just made the final call moments before your own sir i took the liberty of making the checks as i assumed you would be somewhat busy
1968022 i dont know when ill return but i could be at arkham a while
1968023 yet wayne tower what the hell did i do to tranter
1968024 i havent even touched the guy once had no reason too till now
1968025 we have only one option here i need you to get to city hall now begin clearing out as many people as possible with a quarter mile blast radius perimeter
1968026 if you can give me a better option with what little information we have im all ears
1968027 use whatever police or authorities in the vicinity to help you im heading to gotham superior courthouse once that is under control im heading to arkham asylum i need you to meet me there when city hall is under control now go
1968028 of course where else am i going to go on such an exciting night
1968029 you want me to get on to gcpd headquarters for clearance of the building and surrounding area right
1968030 yes a quarter mile blast radius we dont know how big this device is or what collateral damage it can do
1968031 agreed plus i already made the call as soon as i heard tranters announcement
1968032 ok i also need you to send any available men you may have over to city hall to assist nightwings clearance of that area
1968033 its bane hes out of his cell and the door is smashed
1968034 and recall your men back to the door well try and hold him off long enough so we can escape
1968035 i hope they dont have itchy trigger fingers or were done for either way
1968036 theres a pulse but it isnt strong we need to get him to my medical facility now
1968037 err twenty five i think i havent had time to count its all been so rushed
1968038 first i need your men to secure the people here and get them back a quarter mile
1968039 begin doing what you can use force if you have to but no one gets hurt ill make a call for further help meanwhile im going inside to check for stragglers where is your security control room
1968040 entrance hall far end behind the main desk its unlocked already
1968041 thank you send me five men to that room when youre done here
1968042 amazing what a bit of influence can get you in this town
1968043 good i need you five to continue a foot search of as much of the building as you can concentrate on the lower levels everywhere from this floor up looks clear
1968044 you have until 8 45pm when times up you clear out and get to safety no arguments
1968045 if you want to go sort out arkham asylum instead of me be my guest
1968046 remember 8 45pm you leave no questions no hesitation get out and get away
1968047 and now im here to save these scumbags from a fate that most of them deserve
1968048 yes sir fortunately one of the night watchmen had the tv news on in the monitoring room hardly my best idea of how to watch over the criminally insane but tonight i shall let it slide
1968049 he saw the whole broadcast and called me as soon as this place was mentioned i then had him mass page all off duty guards to get here as quickly as possible
1968050 fortunately i was on duty tonight and have been coordinating efforts to move the prisoners safely and without incident
1968051 down to the riot shelters about 500 meters east of the outer buildings
1968052 thats not far enough away we dont know how big the blast radius could be
1968053 the inner shelters are protected by nuclear standard blast doors
1968054 unless mr tranter has placed a nuclear warhead everyone will be safe
1968055 that said how are you going to fit all of the prisoners and guard staff into the shelters
1968056 i can assure you that there is enough space for every prisoner here
1968057 west and south wings are all clear with prisoners moving down the shelter now east wing clearance is already under way now i must go and assist my men
1968058 follow me and ill show the entrance to the shelter
1968059 the remaining cells are being opened up right now we should have them all in and us within ten minutes
1968060 the sight of you two up there is enough to incite these barbarians to god knows what i need you two down here once were all secured in the shelter
1968061 master bruce ive been expecting your call how can i assist
1968062 im sure youve seen what has happened with our friend virgil tranter
1968063 alfred i need your help please can you contact the building manager at wayne towers get him to coordinate the evacuation of the building with a half mile clearance zone tell him that whatever resources he needs are at this disposal
1968064 alfred youre in control of this one i cant deal with all of the sites and i need someone i trust implicitly
1968065 you may remember our coverage only two months ago about the new super energy source omnipotens radix and how this highly efficient and safe energy could revolutionise gotham gcn received a call from none other than virgil tranter head of nuclear vision technologies and the self proclaimed saviour of the future of this city
1968066 mr tranter asked us to make a brief recording to be played out to explain the situation i must warn you that what follows makes for shocking listening
1968067 we have all had to suffer the ruling of the criminal underclass and i for one have had enough nowhere is safe our streets are littered with thugs the prisons are full business is corrupt the police force even more so
1968068 an honest life has become difficult to live that is why tonight i virgil tranter plan to shake this city to its very core and begin to purge the rats from our streets our offices and law enforcement buildings
1968069 my team and i have placed five devices in key locations in gotham city those locations are city hall the gcpd headquarters arkham asylum gotham superior courthouse and wayne tower each device contains enough omnipotens radix to level each building and the corruption inside
1968070 and it is whats even simpler about it is that each device is primed to detonate at precisely 9pm tonight oh and if any do gooders out there are thinking of trying to defuse or move them out of harms way
1968071 dont bother each device weighs around two tons and has auto detonate systems should they be tampered with in any way i shall see you all in the dawn of a new era
1968072 even if we knew where each device was within each building we couldnt feasibly reach each one in an hour let alone make the devices safe

1968133 more wild bison have been killed this year than at any time since the 19th century
1968134 with the spring migration just beginning and the government showing no sign of relief this years slaughter could easily surpass 2 000 bison
1968135 it would seem as though history was not learned the first time for here we are today watching these same government entities enacting the same policy
1968136 the government is ignoring the will of the people in its haste to cater to the demands of the livestock industry
1968137 the people are insisting that the buffalo slaughter stop but we are being ignored by a park service intent on killing buffalo by the thousands
1968138 the systematic destruction of these herds is decimating genetic diversity and destroying instinctual behavioral patters wiping out family groups paralyzing their evolutionary potential
1968139 all of these actions are being done under the guise of protecting montanas brucellosis free status yet it is clear that brucellosis is a smokescreen being used to control public lands and prevent native wild bison from restoring themselves on their native habitat
1968140 dear people in charge of killing our nations last wild bison our bison not yours please read and heed the letter below i have written you dr zaluski you suzanne lewis and also the governor of montana about my outrage and heartache concerning this unwarranted and immoral slaughter none of the three of you has bothered with the courtesy of a reply in fact at times emails have not even been accepted this is not the way government employees should conduct their duties in a democracy perhaps you do not know although i cannot imagine that you dont know the thrill for people visiting yellowstone to see the bison there in great numbers in their natural habitat should they step across park boundaries what of it artificial park boundaries are the intruders not the bison i must tell you that it appears that all of you have completely sold out to the cattle interests whether or not that is true that is the appearance and the montana department of livestock and all of you above appear to the rest of the country to be a bunch of rowdy and out of control cowboys is that the image you wish to project to the rest of the nation each of you that wears the park service emblem with the bison on it should at least have the good grace to remove those patches if you cannot ensure the safety of the bison otherwise you are also guilty of hypocrisy i am sorry to be so harsh but i have been begging for the lives of the bison for years and you do not hear please hear the cries of the bison and the people who love them thank you
1968141 the government has been killing our nations last remaining wild bison claiming it is necessary to prevent the spread of brucellosis to cattle on the horse butte peninsula
1968142 there are no more cattle on horse butte so that excuse rings hollow its about time the people in charge get behind the locals who support wild bison being on horse butte without harassment by the government
1968143 when we purchased the munns ranch one of our goals for the property was to willingly remove the last cattle from the butte however yearly cattle grazing on the ranch has kept the grasses down which has helped deter potential grass fires on both the ranch and the butte and has also kept down the spreading of noxious weeds
1968144 for these reasons we believe the ranch must continue to have a grazing component which we hope to achieve naturally by allowing the bison to continue migrating out of yellowstone national park and on the ranch as they have historically always migrated to help achieve this goal we renamed the ranch the yellowstone ranch preserve the yrp and posted the yrp as a bison safe zone to create a sanctuary for bison activity in order to achieve this goal the hazing and slaughter of bison by the department of livestock on the butte must cease
1968145 the government promised the public an adaptive management plan for bison now it is time for them to adapt their management
1968146 the governments bison plan was created at a time when cattle grazed across much of horse butte every summer now that the cattle are gone the plan needs to be changed to become more tolerant of yellowstones iconic bison
1968147 the government is spending hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars to protect cattle that arent even here
1968148 it doesnt make sense and it is no way to manage some of our nations most revered wildlife the bison slaughter on horse butte should stop
1968149 i ask the rank and file in yellowstone rise above the fear of job retaliation and remember why you joined the park service
1968150 buffalo field campaign yellowstone bison update from the field march 06 2008
1968151 i felt a deep sadness for the deaths of the buffalo but what really distresses me is the condition of human beings we see everything as a disposable commodity already and that is not good what we need to be seriously concerned about is humanitys callousness towards an entire species unchecked violence is happening again here and that should send a strong message its not a one time tragedy its not even an unfortunate necessity its habitual cruelty we can do it here and we can go to other parts of the world and do it to other human beings the buffalo slaughter represents governments capacity for unconscionable habitual violence that is what is dangerously contagious it sends a chill through me
1968152 the agents who made their way up to my perch with an eighty foot cherry picker were unconcerned with my safety
1968153 they cut my sleeping bag that was my protection from the montana winter took off my boots and threw them to the ground attempting to freeze me out of my lock box the sheriff and forest service agent cut my safety line attached me to the cherry picker bucket and threw me in it
1968154 they nearly broke my arms while descending with me i was still attached by my lock box to a leg of the bipod
1968155 i was screaming in excruciating pain and i looked down to see montana dol agent shane grube laughing at my plight and continuing to offer suggestions that would grossly endanger my life and the lives of the agents who were throwing me against the bucket of the cherry picker over and over
1968156 i risked life and freedom on behalf of the thousands of frustrated people fed up with this government and their full tilt assault on the last wild bison
1968157 i know full well that the frustration felt in me was echoed with the tens of thousands of people who called wrote and petitioned the government to voice their concerns for these amazing animals concerns that repeatedly fall upon deaf ears

1968190 in previous simulations this region came out smooth but now we have enough detail to see clumps of dark matter
1968191 some of those clumps are so dense they will emit a lot of gamma rays if there is dark matter annihilation and it might easily be detected by glast
1968192 there are several candidate particles for cold dark matter and our predictions for glast depend on the assumed particle type and its properties
1968193 for typical wimps anywhere from a handful to a few dozen clear signals should stand out from the gamma ray background after two years of observations that would be a big discovery for glast

1968424 changing the margins is easy and works to save paper which saves trees which reduces air pollution and slows down global warming
1968425 these are tight economic times for everybody so the mayor is looking at any and all means to save money
1968426 this was a no brainer to do and it was easy to do too it saves what we were wasting in paper its probably something we should have done sooner

1968439 soul travel movement of the inner consciousness which travels through the lower states until it ascends into the ecstatic state the awareness of the religious experience of being achieved through a series of spiritual excerises known to the followers of eckankar
1968440 this is the thing about soul travel it gives you such a glimpse of truth not just as a piece of knowledge out there but as a living breathing part of you so that you know something as truth often you find out that life is more beautiful and fuller than you had ever expected it to be and gods creation is more wondrous
1968441 were the coast guards elite were the best of the best when storms shut down the entire ports we go out when hurricanes ground the united states navy we go out when holly lord itself reaches down from heaven and destroy his good work with winds that rip houses out of the ground we go out and the attrition rate of the school is well over 50 so if by some miracle you actually have what it takes to become one of us then you get to live a life of meager pay with a distinct possibility of dying slow cold and alone somewhere in the vast sea however you also get the chance to save lives and there is no greater call in the world than that

1968449 why is it that most people are complaining about having to pay more for an airline ticket when they dont mind paying hundreds of dollars to see a ball game go to a concert etc just wanted to get some insight on what the average person thinks about this
1968450 people pay 15 to check a first bag but 6 on a magazine at the airport and then complain at how the airlines are nickel and diming them and then they line up for the privilege of purchasing a new cellphone go figure

1968461 what the deputies committee has raised is given the possibility that political fragmentation in pakistan is going to continue do we need to change our strategy
1968462 the argument that we may destabilize pakistan has taken us to where we are right now

1968470 they may not like it but anybody that kidnaps is obviously not a safe person to me a normal person isnt going to do that you have to have a violent streak to be able to do that
1968471 i do think i want to look into the unlawful detention to make sure we have that down the prosecutors were ones who wanted to add that
1968472 weve run this thing through the attorney generals office and several other lawyers
1968473 the idea is very simple if one of your daughters came up missing and the last known person to have communicated with her was contacted on myspace or facebook wouldnt you want to know who that individual was
1968474 we just need to know that information for criminal investigation purposes
1968475 before the officer even had a chance to knock on the door he heard a shot and the sound of a body hitting the floor
1968476 this is the last place i have chosen to feel the wind in my face
1968477 he was distraught and said he had been treated very badly by the people who arrested him and locked him up when he left he gave me a big hug and told me he loved me which he had only done once before when his mother had recently died he had a massive circle of friends he had had many letters of support and it is clear he took his own life
1968478 he strongly denied the charges of indecent exposure in court and pleaded not guilty there was press coverage which was difficult for him and his family allegations like this would destroy him and his family
1968479 one single unfounded allegation was enough to blow apart everything he loved and had worked so hard for in his community

1968485 the false selling of the iraq war we were railroaded into an unnecessary war
1968486 no president of the united states should employ distortion of truth to take the nation to war
1968487 the bush administration convinced a substantial majority of americans before the war that saddam hussein was somehow linked to 9 11 inexcusably selling the false iraq al qaeda claim to americans
1968488 the president and his top advisers did not allow the american people or even congress to have the information necessary to make reasoned judgments of their own its obvious that the bush administration misled americans about mr husseins weapons and his terrorist connections
1968489 therefore i urge you to imitate me for this reason i am sending to you timothy my son whom i love who is faithful in the lord he will remind you of my way of life in christ jesus which agrees with what i teach everywhere in every church
1968490 i just want you to know that i love him
1968491 the only solution is to elect more pro abortion politicians
1968492 corrective statements should be made by roman catholic church authorities who realize that pelosis words are creating confusion and scandal not only among catholics but also among the population at large
1968493 a victim of the philosophy undergirding the 1960s sexual revolution
1968494 the killing of an innocent child is incompatible with receiving communion which is receiving the body of christ
1968495 since pro abortion politicians continue to persist in their support for abortion we persist in calling on every american bishop to enforce church law and deny these men and women holy communion

1968501 seculars want temple as fast of av begins saturday night israelnn com
1968502 its true that we dont exactly represent a majority of secular kibbutz members but the pioneers have always been a minority the zionists were a minority among the jews those who came to the land were a minority among the zionists those who worked the land were also a minority and now we are a minority as well but i hope that soon we will be the leaders
1968503 well the word religious can be the subject of long discussions look the gerrer rebbe once said when the haskalah enlightenment came to the world with science physics etc we the religious left it for the secular jews when zionism came to the world we gave that too to the secular and now we have also left the repentance movement for the secular accordingly it looks like we the secular will also have to build the beit hamikdash
1968504 there are many religious authorities including maimonides who say that the temple must be rebuilt and so i think it should be done as a first step we must show that we control the temple mount i call upon all of israel to come to the mount on tisha bav and show that it belongs to the jewish nation
1968505 we are not it but that is it the door
1968506 for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation
1968507 if its not war then we are very close to it
1968508 the russians have invaded georgia and we are under attack
1968509 receiving reports of ethnic cleansing in villages of south ossetia
1968510 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
1968511 georgia will not yield its territory or renounce its freedom
1968512 and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made
1968513 for in six days the lord made heaven and earth the sea and all that in them is and rested the seventh day wherefore the lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it
1968514 and all the vessels of the house of god great and small and the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the king and of his princes all these he brought to babylon and they burnt the house of god and brake down the wall of jerusalem and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof
1968515 but if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day and not to bear a burden even entering in at the gates of jerusalem on the sabbath day then will i kindle a fire in the gates thereof and it shall devour the palaces of jerusalem and it shall not be quenched
1968516 then i contended with the nobles of judah and said unto them what evil thing is this that ye do and profane the sabbath day did not your fathers thus and did not our god bring all this evil upon us and upon this city yet ye bring more wrath upon israel by profaning the sabbath
1968517 and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read
1968518 but pray ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on the sabbath day
1968519 in a d 196 victor bishop of rome attempted to impose on all the churches the roman custom of having easter fall every year on sunday
1968520 the question relating to the observance of easter which was agitated in the time of anicetus and polycarp and afterward in that of victor was still undecided it was one of the principal reasons for convoking the council of nice being the most important subject to be considered after the arian controversy
1968521 easter day was fixed on the sunday immediately following the new moon which was nearest after the vernal equinox
1968522 let us then have nothing in common with the most hostile rabble of the jews
1968523 the judges and town people and the occupation of all trades
1968524 all things whatsoever that it was duty to do on the sabbath these we have transferred to the lords day
1968525 the council of laodicea first settled the observation of the lords day and prohibited the keeping of the jewish sabbath under an anathema
1968526 down even to the fifth century the observances of the jewish sabbath was continued in the christian church
1968527 they kept the sabbath day observed the ordinance of baptism according to the primitive church instructed their children in the articles of the christian faith and the commandments of god
1968528 question have you any other way of proving that the church has power to institute festivals of precept
1968529 answer had she not such power she could not have done that in which all modern religionists agree with her she could not have substituted the observance of sunday the first day of the week for the observance of saturday the seventh day a change for which there is no scriptural authority
1968530 carlstadt held to the divine authority of the sabbath from the old testament
1968531 indeed if carlstadt were to write further about the sabbath sunday would have to give way and the sabbath that is to say saturday must be kept holy
1968532 there is scarcely anything which strikes the mind of the careful student of ancient ecclesiastical history with greater surprise than the comparatively early period at which many of the corruptions of christianity which are embodied in the roman system took their rise yet it is not to be supposed that when the first originators of many of these unscriptural notions and practices planted those germs of corruption they anticipated or even imagined they would ever grow into such a vast and hideous system of superstition and error as is that of popery
1968533 it would be an error to attribute the sanctification of sunday to a definite decision of the apostles there is no such decision mentioned in the apostolic documents that is the new testament
1968534 it must be confessed that there is no law in the new testament concerning the first day
1968535 until well into the second century a hundred years after christ we do not find the slightest indication in our sources that christians marked sunday by any kind of abstention from work
1968536 the ancient sabbath did remain and was observed by the christians of the eastern church in the area near palestine above three hundred years after our saviours death
1968537 modern christians who talk of keeping sunday as a holy day as in the still extant blue laws of colonial america should know that as a holy day of rest and cessation from labor and amusements sunday was unknown to jesus it formed no tenet teaching of the primitive church and became sacred only in the course of time outside the church its observance was legalized for the roman empire through a series of decrees starting with the famous one of constantine in 321 an edict due to his political and social ideas
1968538 the festival of sunday like all other festivals was always only a human ordinance and it was far from the intentions of the apostles to establish a divine command in this respect far from them and from the early apostolic church to transfer the laws of the sabbath to sunday
1968539 the church made a sacred day of sunday largely because it was the weekly festival of the sun for it was a definite christian policy to take over the pagan festivals endeared to the people by tradition and to give them a christian significance
1968540 is it not strange that sunday is almost universally observed when the sacred writings do not endorse it satan the great counterfeiter worked through the mystery of iniquity to introduce a counterfeit sabbath to take the place of the true sabbath of god sunday stands side by side with ash wednesday palm sunday holy or maundy thursday good friday easter sunday corpus christi assumption day all souls day christmas day and a host of other ecclesiastical feast days too numerous to mention this array of roman catholic feasts and fast days are all man made none of them bears the divine credentials of the author of the inspired word
1968541 babylon the mother of harlots derived much of her teaching from pagan rome and thence from babylon
1968542 the power of the caesars lived again in the universal dominion of the popes
1968543 from simple beginnings the church developed a distinct priesthood and an elaborate service in this way christianity and the higher forms of paganism tended to come nearer and nearer to each other as time went on in one sense it is true they met like armies in mortal conflict but at the same time they tended to merge into one another like streams which had been following converging courses
1968544 unquestionably the first law either ecclesiastical or civil by which the sabbatical observance of that day is known to have been ordained is the edict of constantine 321 a d
1968545 this constantines sunday decree of march 321 is the parent sunday law making it a day of rest and release from labor for from that time to the present there have been decrees about the observance of sunday which have profoundly influenced european and american society when the church became apart of state under the christian emperors sunday observance was enforced by civil statutes and later when the empire was past the church in the hands of the papacy enforced it by ecclesiastical and also by civil enactments
1968546 constantines decree marked the beginning of a long though intermittent series of imperial decrees in support of sunday rest
1968547 constantine labored at this time untiringly to unite the worshipers of the old and the new into one religion all his laws and contrivances are aimed at promoting this amalgamation of religions he would by all lawful and peaceable means melt together a purified heathenism and a moderated christianity of all his blending and melting together of christianity and heathenism none is more easy to see through than this making of his sunday law the christians worshiped their christ the heathen their sun god so they should now be combined
1968548 down even to the fifth century the observance of the jewish sabbath was continued in the christian church but with a rigor and solemnity gradually diminishing until it was wholly discontinued
1968549 constantines five sunday law decrees marked the beginning of a long though intermittent series of imperial decrees in support of sunday rest
1968550 he looks annoyed if you cant respect your man who can you respect

1968562 if signed into law ab 2567 will mean an official day commemorating homosexuality bisexuality and transsexuality in california government schools
1968563 every may 22 ab 2567 will positively portray to children homosexual experimentation homosexual marriages sex change operations and anything else thats in the closet
1968564 when fully implemented sb 777 and ab 394 will teach children in california government schools to support homosexuality bisexuality and transsexuality via instructional materials programs and activities and school safety guidelines
1968565 in addition the california state school board this year implemented sb 71 requiring public schools that provide sex education to promote unmarried sexual activity with no restraints other than mutual consent
1968566 ab 2567 will further motivate parents to remove their children from the immoral public school system
1968567 with public schools becoming sexual indoctrination centers homeschooling and church schools are no longer parental options theyre parental imperatives
1968568 this is yet another example of the campaign to normalize homosexual behavior not just in schools but in our culture
1968569 young children will be forced to celebrate the life of a man whose claim to fame is his sexual orientation
1968570 parents should be outraged that californias lawmakers want their children to spend a whole day celebrating homosexuality instead of studying important subjects like math or science
1968571 every parent and student should call governor schwarzenegger and tell him to veto ab 2567
1968572 on harvey milk day exercises remembering the life of harvey milk and recognizing his accomplishments as well as the contributions he made to this state
1968573 this bad bill will teach impressionable schoolchildren the anti religious homosexual bisexual transsexual agenda of harvey milk
1968574 for the love of god parents and their children we implore gov schwarzenegger to veto ab 2567

1968740 il 7 gennaio scorso nei pressi di orvieto il personale del treno 9312 roma bolzano etr 485 e gli stessi passeggeri mentre viaggiavano alla velocit di 220 chilometri allora hanno avvertito un forte rumore seguito da contraccolpi e sobbalzi delle prime vetture dopo limmediato arresto del treno risultato il distacco dellalbero di trasmissione del secondo motore della vettura di testa la distruzione e il danneggiamento di numerose apparecchiature meccaniche ed elettriche del sottocassa delle prime vetture e danni al binario in particolare si accertata la distruzione della gabbia metallica posta a protezione dello stesso albero di trasmissione e la rottura delle travi di sostegno della cassa a seguito di ci si verificato un principio di incendio
1968741 che nessuno autorizzato a confidare nelle fortunose circostanze che fino a oggi hanno evitato gli eventi facilmente immaginabili
1968742 dopo lo scontro frontale il tipo di incidente pi pericoloso che possa capitare a un treno ad alta velocit
1968743 la rottura ha interessato i binari questo significa che se il pezzo dellalbero di trasmissione si fosse puntato contro le traversine leffetto catapulta avrebbe sollevato la locomotiva scaraventando il treno a 220 allora gi dalla massicciata o contro le pareti di una galleria di questo stiamo parlando
1968744 che lazienda ha garantito essere sufficienti per prevenire nuovi casi abbiamo ritenuto opportuno ristabilire la normale velocit di marcia

1968762 our expectations were minimal but as it turned out more than 1 000 people placed bets on the harness race
1968763 we were completely taken unawares there is definitely potential if it is supported by one of the horseracing channels it could provide a new interest for the racing fraternity and certainly gets our backing

1968767 told you hed lose when someone tries to beat him
1968768 if the handle is going down that is not a good sign
1968769 there is less interest what underlies that though is that it may not be as bad as what it looks for a particular racetrack or that it could be way worse for another racetrack
1968770 our industry is in the midst of a challenging period with discretionary entertainment dollars tighter than they have been for several years
1968771 one day i looked at our numbers and it was like where did all of our players go
1968772 there is less concern over booked money as its going back in the pool
1968773 if you are just booking you have limits on what you can handle because you want to limit what you can lose and the big bettors find that is not a viable outlet particularly if they are a very good bettor
1968774 i think sports betting and poker through bookmakers has been a bigger problem in that we have lost some players now doing that instead of horse racing or they have cut back on horse racing betting to do that
1968775 you would think its alternative gaming and that can be everything from sports betting to online poker to people just playing more slots at night when they go to a casino its probably a variety of combination of those factors
1968776 you can beat a race but cant beat the races
1968777 all these places need is a webpage and they are in business
1968778 put up a web page and are not expensive like racing

1968780 the judge conducted himself in a judicially correct and professional manner today something we never experienced under the previous government which initiated these charges
1968781 now my luck hangs in the balance of being either acquitted from the charges by the court or accorded capital punishment
1968782 but let us remain strong pray for me for god is with us and we shall win

1968787 hai kamu sekalian mengapa kamu berbuat demikian kami ini adalah manusia biasa sama seperti kamu kami ada di sini untuk memberitakan injil kepada kamu supaya kamu meninggalkan perbuatan sia sia ini dan berbalik kepada allah yang hidup yang telah menjadikan langit dan bumi laut dan segala isinya 14 16 dalam zaman yang lampau allah membiarkan semua bangsa menuruti jalannya masing masing 14 17 namun ia bukan tidak menyatakan diri nya dengan berbagai bagai kebajikan yaitu dengan menurunkan hujan dari langit dan dengan memberikan musim musim subur bagi kamu ia memuaskan hatimu dengan makanan dan kegembiraan

1968800 wait until next year nebraska will be contending for a bcs bowl
1968801 team blues rally 2 here is a picture i took inside the stage
1968802 were only 10 minutes away from the actual site so its a bit like playing in your back garden and ive been to the festival for the last eight years last year we played the t break stage this one we were on the futures one so there was a little bit of deja vu though its a bigger stage but the tent was just as full for us as it was last year
1968803 weve been there for the last three or four years just going as mates
1968804 i think our best year was two years ago last year we played and so we didnt get to let our hair down as much two years ago there was a big group of us about 40 people
1968805 we think its the best festival going its a little bit secret and its small its not like t or glastonbury where you have to keep your wits about you theres a lot from the fence collective and people into underground scottish stuff and a lot of that sort of music comes to belladrum it takes two minutes to pitch the tent and five minutes to walk to the site
1968806 were doing a half hour set at bella and its a shame cos the difference between half an hour and 35 minutes is amazing with that extra five minutes you could squeeze in two more songs and that can make it a completely different half hour
1968807 thatll be in there we have to play it now because its one people know but when weve just got half an hour we tend to come out with the fast paced songs rather than slow it all down
1968808 were learning all the time though two years id have thought i knew everything
1968809 weve been together for four years anyway with this album we had to put a set of songs together that fitted together and we have to do b sides and write all the time but what were writing now is quite different and i dont know how bands get stuck playing the same thing you need to make a slow progression so people dont know exactly what to expect how can any band stay sounding the same after five albums or whatever its all about the music and bands forget that sometimes its not about how skinny your jeans are and all those bands get in the way of people whore trying to achieve something with their music weve had the same haircuts and worn the same kind of clothes since we were 15 and 16
1968810 i prefer it if people dont know all about me you can have the biggest crisis in your personal life ever and you should still get up there and perform on stage and do a show being in a band means lots of travelling and its about waiting on your expectations ive been doing that since i was 16 myself and my band the only way to get over the boredom of the waiting around is by writing music otherwise you just stand still for months and months waiting for the next thing to happen the not knowing is the most exciting part but its also the terrifying part and it keeps you on edge its not a five year job it isnt safe forever how you cope with the stress the anxiety confusion i think thats the only reason a lot of bands turn to drugs people want to be in bands so they can get out of their face but thats not the reason bands take drugs its because they buckle under the pressure
1968811 ive got my friends and family and the myspace stuff means you dont have to move away to london or something because your audience is at your fingertips id much rather not hang around with other bands i see myself as a down to earth person practising and just being yourself rather than what someone tells you to be
1968812 what alan said about this band is what we think in our minds we think were the best band that ever lived
1968813 and that attitude pushes you forward but what he said i was humbled by it
1968814 do you know that the pastor lets his children watch power rangers on tv
1968815 do you know that his wife bought a two piece swimsuit from victorias secret
1968816 i hadnt heard that but i did overhear their 6 year old talking about the horrible argument her parents had
1968817 living in the fishbowl is fine its all those cats watching that make me nervous
1968818 you know how much i love the nations preaching and encouraging others and you know how much i love you i want you to know i am willing to skip this trip to be at your graduation would you like that
1968819 are you going to preach like your daddy or teach like your mama
1968820 i cant do this anymore i am not gifted to lead i cant be what they need
1968821 besides the other things what comes upon me daily my deep concern for all the churches
1968822 buck stops with the man at the helm of the ship
1968823 but do not forget to do good and to share for with such sacrifices god is well pleased obey those who rule over you and be submissive for they watch out for your souls as those who must give account let them do so with joy and not with grief for that would be unprofitable for you
1968824 if i book in advance i can easily get a ticket
1968825 we sell a metric fuckload of beer and have money to burn

1968829 start fasting on seeing the crescent of ramadan and give up fasting on seeing the crescent of shawwal and if the sky is overcast and you cannot see it complete thirty days of shaban
1968830 i asked aaishah may allaah be pleased with her about the fasting of the messenger of allaah peace and blessings of allaah be upon him and she said he used to fast until we thought that he would always fast then he would not fast until we thought that he would always not fast but i never saw him fast in any month more than he fasted in shabaan
1968831 the best way of fasting in allahs sight is that of dawud who used to observe fasting every alternate day
1968832 i have not seen you observe additional fast during any month other than ramadan as you do in sha ban
1968833 this is a month that people usually forget about between rajab and ramadan and it is a month in which peoples deeds are presented to allah so i like that my deeds are presented while i am fasting
1968834 whether it is allowed to specify the 15th of sha ban with some acts of worship or not
1968835 a newly invented way in beliefs and actions in the religion in imitation of the shareeah by which nearness to allaah is sought not being supported by any authentic proof neither in its foundations nor in the manner in which it is performed
1968836 i warn you of the newly invented matters in the religion and every newly invented matter is an innovation and every innovation is misguidance and every misguidance is in the hellfire
1968837 whosoever does an action which we have not commanded then it must be rejected
1968838 whosoever introduces into this religion of ours that which is not a part of it then it must be rejected
1968839 this day have i perfected your religion for you completed my favour upon you and have chosen for you islaam as your religion
1968840 indeed in the messenger of allah you have an excellent example to follow for him who hopes in the meeting with allaah and the last day and remembers allah much
1968841 and whosoever contends with the messenger after guidance has been made clear to him and follows a way other than the way of the believers we shall leave in the path he has chosen and land him in hell what an evil destination
1968842 all of my ummah will enter paradise except those that refuse
1968843 i have left behind me two things if you cling to them you will never go astray they are the book of allaah and my sunnah

1968850 cool ready now lets go dude cmon and drive jesseman not gonna get there with you out there are we now
1968851 the guys who selected the olympic riders at least the ones who left me off the list are idiots
1968852 the decision either comes down to politics brownnosing they just dont like me or they are idiots it must be politics because nobody is that stupid
1968853 how the usa cycling selection committee could have chosen jason mccartney to race in beijing over me makes absolutely no sense
1968854 there are only a few guys in america capable of staying with the best in the world and ive never seen jason riding the wheel of riders like spains olympic favorite alejandro valverde
1968855 the only argument that could be made in jasons favor over mine is that jason is a rider who can ride the front well i have ridden for the best guys in the world cadel evans alberto contador levi leipheimer ive never in my career jeopardized the team to ride for myself and ive ridden against those guys too sitting on their wheel and thats not something jason has done
1968856 never did i say jason was a bad rider or not worthy of his trip to athens
1968857 jasons desire to push past the limit was very impressive in bike racing sometimes timing is more important than strength it was just that on that day he did not have the best form of the riders in the break i did however say that u s postal rode the worst tactics that i have ever seen from a team of that quality and i still believe that to be true
1968858 a great guy and one of the top 10 best riders in the u s
1968859 jason is also one of the best opportunist riders out there
1968860 but the olympic team isnt for the top 10 best american riders its for the top five best riders and it isnt a race for opportunists its a race where the best riders in the world battle it out at the finish
1968861 there were a lot of names on our list and when we started getting down to the finals we had a big issue with chris was that he had a medical problem
1968862 we were picking the team right then on top of those dates and that was a factor as much as anything else
1968863 theyre both good climbers and team workers but mccartney was healthier at the time and chris was injured we got as much information we could from as many people about that we werent just guessing
1968864 i think chris deserves to be here he is a super smart bike racer and has a ton of experience he would be an asset to the team
1968865 he deserves to be here but so does everybody else we only have five spots
1968866 um fil sofo um homem que experimenta v ouve suspeita espera e sonha constantemente coisas extraordin rias que atingido pelos pr prios pensamentos como se eles viessem de fora de cima e de baixo como por uma esp cie de acontecimentos e de fa scas de que s ele pode ser alvo que talvez ele pr prio uma trovoada prenhe de rel mpagos novos um homem fatal em torno do qual sempre ribomba e rola e rebenta e se passam coisas inquietantes

1968882 while elegantly mounted and well acted the movie is not the equal of the tv production in part because so much material had to be compressed into such a shorter time
1968883 if its a choice between the movies 135 minutes or the 659 minutes of the miniseries which has been re mastered and re released in a lavish four disk edition id say its no choice at all the shorter version is the one that seems long

1969263 heating the air increases its volume and by increasing its volume it increases the cars range thats why with one gallon of gasoline or its equivalent we are able to make over 100 mpg
1969264 no ones really proven a six seater passenger car can get any better than 75 miles to the gallon so this would represent a big step forward

1969274 we observe that some training is more geared to reaching orthodox jews whereas secular jews form a great majority in most communities
1969275 the torch of the messiah yeshuas jesus love will be set on a high hill through the testimony of both messianic jews and gentile christians together and finally the messianic jewish community will be able to demonstrate in practical and loving terms that we truly are part and parcel of our jewish people

1969411 the news reports indicate that the russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences of euro atlantic stability and security are grave the government of georgia has called for a cease fire and for resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately convene an emergency session of the united nations security council to call on russia to reverse course the u s should immediately work with the e u and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen

1969424 you know what ed and i laugh about it its kind of funny but its like you know i guess some people assume there is a seed of truth to it people think where theres smoke theres fire people think that but they dont realize that er its obviously er its just so amazing the way something can be just a complete fabrication yet it gets twisted
1969425 i just dont even want to speculate on that its just one of those things that rolls off my back theres not one seed of truth to it so itll just go away in the end i have actually met perez hilton a couple of times hes normally very nice but if he covers an untrue rumor then i have to accept that it will become one of those things people will speculate about

1969428 as above so below as below so above this maxim implies that the transcendent god beyond the physical universe and the immanent god within ourselves are one
1969429 but eventually a new world religion will be inaugurated which will be a fusion and synthesis of the approach of the east and the approach of the west the christ will bring together not simply christianity and buddhism but the concept of god transcendent outside of his creation and also the concept of god immanent in all creation in man and all creation
1969430 a fresh orientation to divinity and to the acceptance of the fact of god transcendent and god immanent within every form of life

1969432 he rules everything and is everywhere and is in everything
1969433 the fact that god stands above and beyond his creation does not mean he stands outside his creation he is both transcendent above and beyond his creation and immanent within and throughout his creation
1969434 god who is the ground of all being dwells in around and through all things
1969435 error is like leaven of which we read a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump truth mixed with error is equivalent to all error except that it is more innocent looking and therefore more dangerous god hates such a mixture any error or any truth and error mixture calls for definite exposure and repudiation to condone such is to be unfaithful to god and his word and treacherous to imperiled souls for whom christ died

1969476 what started us looking at this issue is the fact that senator mccain has declared his intention to maintain us forces in iraq for a hundred years
1969477 that means that mccain wants to control babylon for at least a century
1969478 we believe that the end times is near based on the pattern of wars earthquakes and other strange phenomena weve been witnessing since the start of the new millennium
1969479 given that it may be imminent the person who controls babylon must be the antichrist

1969525 our campaign will show the sublime values of islam and the ability of the islamic system to solve modern problems the muslim world is crying out for islam and hizb ut tahrir works globally for the restoration of the khilafah caliphate in the muslim world it is also time to question the capitalist system and the liberal values they want to impose across the world
1969526 rmw has been transparent about the fact that its funding comes from a variety of sources but primarily it receives grants from the global opportunities fund and communities and local government
1969527 that doesnt strike me as the most effective way to spend taxpayers money
1969528 its too late islam is now islamism and our best hope is to support islamist groups who promise not to bomb us
1969529 i am sure i saw that the uk would be free of islamist terrorists if the govt played ball with the likes of mcb
1969530 british islamists target other countries why according to sifaoui it has long been recognised by the british islamists by the british government and by uk intelligence agencies that as long as britain guarantees a degree of freedom to the likes of hassan butt the terrorist strikes will continue to be planned within the borders of the uk but will not occur here ironically then the presence of vocal and active islamist terrorist sympathisers in the uk actually makes british people safer while the full brunt of british based terrorist plotting is suffered by people in other countries
1969531 telling british people that they shouldnt be in this country is both vicious and counterproductive
1969532 i wonder if the thinking is its too late islam is now islamism and our best hope is to support islamist groups who promise not to bomb us id be very depressed if it were the perspective being promoted by the government
1969533 if the old boy thought he could have more prestige respect a bigger house more money etc then i am sure he would support a call for the caliphate
1969534 in an earlier post above dan you emphasise that fact that most muslims in the uk are likely to be british citizens now youre advocating that they be treated as separate groups depending on their cultural ethnicity
1969535 why not ignore both their religious and cultural heritage and treat them just like the rest of us as british citizens without special consideration for their beliefs and regardless of their cultural background
1969536 my beef with islam islamists call it what you will is their insistence on the superiority of their faith to that of everybody elses and those of no faith at all

1969586 for this reason castellanos moyas adoption of bernhards style can be seen as more than homage
1969587 so instead of the brief sentences quoted in senselessness i imagine a much longer novel with as much original testimony as that of the editors story
1969588 is it superb for so many sentences in a review to be illogical
1969589 this is not meant as criticism so much as an attempt to define why senselessness is a brave and important novel rather than a great one
1969590 so in terms of a witness to hisoty and for the sake of art more testimonies might have made this novel more important

1969635 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
1969636 it was an unforgettable and moving ceremony that celebrated the imagination originality and energy of the beijing games

1969656 the dramatic increases in gas prices and home energy bills are creating real strain for the people of south carolina and its time that america pursues our own energy supplies
1969657 for over 30 years congress has stopped production of american energy and made us more dependent on foreign oil its time for an all of the above american energy strategy that allows us to pursue offshore drilling for oil and natural gas oil shale nuclear energy hydrogen wind solar geothermal and other emerging technologies the first commonsense step to reduce gas prices is to allow the bans on offshore drilling and oil shale to expire at the end of september making october 1st american energy freedom day

1969661 these incendiary and personal attacks have no place in our politics

1969665 i know theres going to be a vigorous debate on trade and bashing trade can make for good sound bites on the evening news
1969666 opening new markets for american goods and services is indispensable to our future prosperity we can compete with anyone senators obama and clinton think we should hide behind walls bury our heads and industries in the sand and hope we have enough left to live on while the world passes us by but that is not good policy and it is not good leadership and the short sightedness of these policies can be seen today in congress refusal to vote on the colombian free trade agreement when new trading partners can sell in our market and american companies can sell in theirs the gains are great and they are lasting the strength of the american economy offers a better life to every society we trade with and the good comes back to us in many ways in better jobs higher wages and lower prices

1969669 the exxon mccain 08 campaign is off to a roaring start
1969670 exxon john has hit the campaign trail with his promise of more of the same failed energy policy that weve seen for the past eight years some of the best and brightest minds from big oil have joined exxon john and donations from big oil are pouring in to ensure that more of the same bush cheney energy policies of the last eight years which have given americans record gas prices continue for four more it is clear that john mccains promise of 4 billion in new giveaways for big oil a gas tax gimmick that will line their pockets even more and pattern of voting against incentives for alternatives to oil is fueling this campaign if you want more of the same vote exxon mccain 08 in november
1969671 a couple dozen barack obama supporters lined 3rd avenue in huntington wednesday morning as senator john mccain visited the marshall university football squad the john mccain we see running for president right now is not the same john mccain he was in 2000 said matt sowards president of the cabell county young democrats hes not this political maverick he claimed to be he has turned in to be just another bush man the obama supporters claimed mccain is hooked with big oil and will do nothing to help the nations energy crisis we cant stand four more years of the failed policies in washington sowards said

1969674 roughly a year after industry leader exxon xon announced its plan to buy mobil
1969675 create d the largest oil company and the third largest company in the world behind ge and microsoft
1969676 let there be no mistake the oil and gas industry knows that exxon mccain is the ticket to four more years of record profits and skyrocketing energy costs
1969677 our political opponents can try to muddy the waters if they want but big oil has steered more than 2 million to the exxon mccain 08 campaign for a reason john mccains promise of more of the same reckless giveaways and tax breaks for big oil and obstruction of alternatives to oil is exactly what big oil is looking for which is why exxon mccain is their ticket this november
1969678 in 2006 troutman was active in fundraising for presidential candidate hillary clinton and in 2002 was a campaign advisor for vice presidential candidate john edwards
1969679 at a morning town hall meeting in lima mccain was dogged by democratic complaints that his campaign manager rick davis was a highly paid lobbyist for german owned dhl who lobbied congress to accept a dhl proposal to buy airborne express airborne ran its operations out of the wilmington air park in clinton county and now dhl now proposes to leave wilmington
1969680 john mccain a maverick the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008 the american people are learning that the john mccain of 2008 represents more of the same failed policies weve gotten from george bush for the past eight years senator mccain is clearly in the tank for exxon and big oil for keeping our troops stuck in iraq for decades to come and for an economic policy that puts tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations above relief for hardworking families john mccain has changed hes taken the low road leveling false negative and misleading attacks against barack obama john mccain is no more a maverick within the republican party than dick cheney is hes just more of the same
1969681 but stylistically and substantively there is no daylight between george bush and john mccain they are joined at the hip
1969682 john mccain has changed in profound and fundamental ways that i find personally really surprising and frankly upsetting he is not the john mccain as a senator who defined himself quote as a maverick though questionable this is a different john mccain
1969683 on iraq on the economy on tax policy on domestic policy across the board he is espousing the bush policies hes changed a lot since 2001
1969684 but in the end after eight devastating years under president bush senator mccain is simply offering four years more
1969685 you know the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt vote for this john mccain we dont need another four years of george bush what hes proposing is four more years of george bushs economic policy and its ridiculous and its unfair the american people
1969686 its been my honor to welcome my friend john mccain as the nominee of the republican party i wish you all the best im proud to be your friend
1969687 to a casual observer it probably seems odd that we lump together these extraordinarily diverse and complex communities into one council

1969712 by the way rick davis and nobody else at his firm either has been a registered lobbyist in five years five years
1969713 contended that nobody at davis manafort had been a registered lobbyist for five years
1969714 a check of lobbyist records shows associates at the firm have represented clients numerous times as recently as 2005
1969715 davis was registered as a lobbyist for corporate clients like the telecommunications company verizon
1969716 mr black told reporters that neither mr davis nor anyone else at his firm has been a registered lobbyist in five years the campaign later said it was three years
1969717 a type of lobbying for which firms do not have to register
1969718 has developed a specialty in recent years in a type of lobbying for which firms do not have to register namely representing the interests abroad of foreign politicians and businessmen
1969719 clients have included the richest man in ukraine and a former premier of that country whose opponents were supported by mr
1969720 the lobbying firm of davis manafort inc arranged through an affiliate for the public relations firms work last spring at the same time davis manafort was being paid by the republican presidential candidates campaign details of davis manaforts ukraine work were contained in a late january filing with the justice department according to those documents a public relations firm called daniel j edelman inc was paid 35 000 a month last year to promote the party of regions by davis manafort international llc a delaware corporation set up in march 2007
1969721 questions have been raised since some of davis manaforts work included public relations efforts in the u s for the ukrainian party efforts to sway u s public opinion on behalf of a foreign entity generally require a firm to register as a foreign agent with the justice department davis manafort isnt registered with the department neither mr davis nor his partner paul manafort responded to phone calls and emails seeking comment rick gates a partner at davis manafort said we did not register because we do not work as a foreign agent he declined to elaborate
1969722 and lobbying partner paul manafort had started and co owned
1969723 3edc determined in reconciling invoices that the campaign actually owed the company less money
1969724 davis the campaign ceo is paid 20 000 a month
1969725 defended mr davis saying the campaign manager had not taken any money from his lobbying firm since 2006
1969726 earns no money from their activities while he is on leave
1969727 had not taken any money from his lobbying firm since 2006
1969728 davis the campaign ceo is paid 20 000 a month
1969729 john mccains presidential campaign is blasting a new york times report suggesting that the candidate may have known since 2005 that his campaign managers firm worked for a kremlin backed politician the mccain campaign is strongly denying the papers reporting that in 2005 a white house national security council staffer called john mccains senate office to complain that rick davis lobbying firm was undercutting american policy on ukraine by representing a kremlin backed politician
1969730 the davis manafort firms lobbying work was a source of tension before the campaign insiders say given that the senators image as a crusader against special interests made him vulnerable to critics looking for hypocrisy a sore point was the work the firm did for a pro kremlin politician opposed by mr mccain and the u s government current ukrainian prime minister viktor yanukovich a national security council official brought it to mccain aides attention last year they say
1969731 a national security council official brought it to mccain aides attention last year they say
1969732 in december soon after mr terry nelson was hired as campaign manager
1969733 it was at this time last december that mr mccain first learned about management alliance 3edc and a third issue involving mr davis his and his firms work for the ukrainian party headed by mr yanukovich mr weaver confirmed that he raised them backed by mr nelson and mark salter mr mccains closest aide mr weaver said he recommended mr davis be removed mr mccain agreed then later changed his mind
1969734 for the first seven months of 2008 murders rose by 18 percent over the same period in 2007 and by 9 percent for the same period in 2006 according to internal police data 291 people were killed from january through july up from 246 in 2007 and 266 in 2006
1969735 aggravated batteries with a firearm another marker of increased violence also continued to climb to 1 153 incidents in the first seven months up 245 from the same period a year earlier according to statistics provided by the source
1969736 this aint your suburban retirement home campus sweetie theres crime in the city
1969737 know i dont like to wear the same thing as other people im hanging out with so i ask whats the style about is it a gang thing
1969738 but is the ridiculously over sized white t with baggy ass jeans a gang thing or a trend
1969739 ive been here for 3 5 years and havent noticed a significant change in the level of crime this kind of stuff happens from time to time its totally unacceptable but it happens from time to time i actually think last summer was worse
1969740 i agree something needs to be done about the increase of shooting in uptown and what that is is stepping away from the computer and get involved call the police sign complaints on quality of life crimes you witness drinking and urinating and go to court join a block club or citizen patrol this wont get rid of the gangbanger but it will push out his customer become a good witness
1969741 fyi eighty percent of kids wearing baggy white ts and blue jeans are not gang bangers at least not of kids
1969742 uptown is one of only two districts in chicago that dont mandate drug screening for subsidized housing
1969743 do they drug test people who move into condos why do they only drug test us
1969744 the only sticky wicket about this is that someone will invariable jump up and say
1969745 does anyone have any information on landlords in uptown i wonder if theres a publicly available list of who owns what and whether we could identify the worst offenders in terms of landlords who own lots of units that are the scene of trouble
1969746 and if the uptown gets rehabbed and back in the live music business will this eventually make that situation even worse
1969747 taxpayer money doesnt mean they dont have a right to privacy
1969748 a guy in a cave can out communicate the united states
1969749 i am not going to do anything out of the ordinary i think the team has become self reliant so i think each one of us is trying to be a leader
1969750 he has gotten a lot stronger in the weight room and he has picked up this offense
1969751 it is tremendous to see what cody has done as a member of the offensive line i see him trying to work with us by getting stronger and working hard in the off season
1969752 coach hawkins has done such a great job getting all of these quality kids to come here and so many of them are so talented we have five running backs that i consider to be heisman caliber it is amazing to see how little by little each piece of the puzzle begins to fit into place
1969753 we could go undefeated and we could lose ten it all depends on how this team can gel together and win football games
1969754 i think it is a healthy thing to have competition each one of us wants success for the team but at the same time we all want that spot so we are all working hard in camp
1969755 when each of the plays is called on offense i am working on where i am supposed to be and trying to lessen the learning curve everyday we learn about three or four new plays a day so the coaches are doing a nice job of breaking up the playbook so that we can learn it
1969756 i am just trying to take camp one day at a time that is the only way you can do it if you try and take it all together you are not going to change things day by day and practice by practice you learn what you did wrong and hopefully you can change the next time
1969757 it just make me excited to play this year the freshmen are very talented and they have the opportunity to help us out right away it all makes us better it increases competition in practice it increases our depth
1969758 not having a lot of guys was tough last year i remember one game in particular against baylor it was hot and humid and baylor was throwing the ball around and when they started driving on us we got tired so the depth that we will have this year will definitely help us be able to throw out new formations and new guys in there without the talent level dropping off it helps you tremendously not only in practice but in games
1969759 our expectations are the same every year we expect to win the big 12 and go to a major bowl game that has always been our goal for every season we wont have anything less
1969760 we have been playing ever since we were kids we have played little league together high school together and college together maybe the nfl together i dont know its unique nobody else has it
1969761 all of them are important to me i want to average 150 yards per game that is the goal the ultimate goal for the team is help the team win at least ten game and to go to a major bowl game
1969762 i just can do what i do and do it well there is a lot of young talent on this team and i am going to do what i can to help this team out
1969763 i am a lot stronger than this time last year i have to work on speed a little bit but i know the offense a lot better than last year
1969764 they all have a natural ability to run the ball even though they make those typical freshman mistakes it is expected but they are all naturally talented and gifted athletes
1969765 the consistency that is found in the life of god
1969766 the best written funniest pithiest paean to inner city life that i have read in a long time maybe ever
1969767 racing can be a lot of things and its easy to forget why we race to begin with racing should never be about winning or about time racing should always be about seeing how hard you can push yourself on any given race day sometimes the best race people run is also their worst finish time for that distance and if you tell people your time they will usually utter an apology and you usually accept it because how do you explain that you fought every step this race that your mind told you to quit with loudspeakers and drums and your body told you to give up with aches and pains previously unimagined but that you continued you fought on and that you are proud of that time because you refused to let your fear triumph most people dont understand that finish times are easier to understand
1969768 i dont think theyll go back to first past the post
1969769 they benefited to some degree where a couple of their very important models in their second year on the market the es and the rx which together account for over two thirds of lexus sales both improved significantly
1969770 the lower score is largely due to vehicles that are no longer in the marketplace
1969771 the vehicles are still out there so the study is still relevant but obviously they had some problems gms saab brand was the most improved in this years study improving to 254 problems from 319 more than 60 percent of the 38 brands in the study improved from last year the no 1 problem cited in the study based on responses from more than 52 000 original owners of 2005 model year vehicles was wind noise followed by noisy brakes pulling to the left or right dashboard issues and window fogging the study weights all problems equally vehicle dependability has been steadily improving across the industry overall sargent said since the 2005 study the industry average has improved from 237 problems per 100 vehicles to 206 this year that equates to slightly more than two problems per vehicle furthermore the types of problems reported have trended toward soft
1969772 improved quality is good for everybody its good for the consumer they dont have the annoyance of problems they dont have the costs associated
1969773 for the manufacturer its obviously good news because they dont have to pay so much in warranty repairs
1969774 this suggests that service centres across the country are listening to their customers and putting more focus on improving the overall service experience
1969775 i didnt get my way and now i feel emasculated so you must die
1969776 i have no life and am so depressed i want to die but i want to see what its like to blow people away
1969777 i think theres too much testosterone going around unchecked id like to cut a few off
1969778 if the currency fluctuation doesnt go in its favour its going to be in even deeper trouble
1969779 toyota will continue to keep a close eye on the used car market and set suitable values in a timely manner

1969783 this hippy dippy south carolina six piece riders on the beach boys melodious surfin safari wowed us at sxsw
1969784 there is a consistent pattern of questionable activity that yahoo has engaged in and i think it shows why steve ballmer decided to walk away from the deal
1969785 at the end of the day he felt he couldnt trust these guys
1969786 instead of complaining about the state of the education system as we correct the same mistakes year after year ive got a better idea
1969787 university teachers should simply accept as variant spellings those words our students most commonly misspell
1969788 the spelling of the word judgement for example is now widely accepted as a variant of judgment so why cant truely be accepted as a variant spelling of truly
1969789 either we go on beating ourselves and our students up over this problem or we simply give everyone a break and accept these variant spellings as such
1969790 remember i am not asking you to learn to spell these words differently all i am suggesting is that we might well put 20 or so of the most commonly misspelt words in the english language on the same footing as those other words that have a widely accepted variant spelling
1969791 its a waste of time if people arent aware of the problems caused by the irregularity of english spelling in the first place
1969792 it sickens me to consider we would allow anyone the liberty to destroy our heritage just because they are fed up with seeing it misused
1969793 instead do something about it deal with the real problem stop the rot put it right from the start
1969794 the simple fact that professor ken smith missed is that employers
1969795 there is no decision on it we are taking a long look at a number of different options but is about making the right decision and not being bumped into making a decision before the pre budget report
1969796 we are looking at a range of options and stamp duty is one of those options
1969797 but the fact is there is no quick solution here there isnt a decision that can be made this week in august or next week in august that will make the difference that some people are projecting
1969798 people thinking about buying a house will put off looking while those already looking will be less pro active
1969799 the governments position on stamp duty is a toxic combination of chaos and denial
1969800 first the chancellor refused to rule out a suspension of stamp duty then the treasury denied it was on the table then last night the housing minister told the bbc the government is considering it after all
1969801 today despite evidence from estate agents across the country that buyers are pulling out as a consequence of darlings dithering caroline flint said that she did not accept that uncertainty was having an impact on the housing market
1969802 this continued dithering over a crucial area of tax policy is undermining the housing market and damaging the wider economy its hard to know which has suffered most this week the governments credibility or confidence in the housing market
1969803 alistair darling must now make an immediate statement to clarify the position and end this fiasco

1969806 pacific codex is finally here you can order a copy now from
1969807 with the first edition coloured vinyl editions sold out we now have black vinyl editions of bass communions ghosts on magnetic tape and no mans speak and returning jesus in stock all three albums are available from our store theres a nice offer on all three available
1969808 100 cotton hanes beefy t shirt dark brown with the quiety evocative cover art from the loss dvda cd package printed on the chest an antique border printed in metallic gold frames the image and the names bass communion and loss are printed directly below available in small medium large extra large and extra extra large 100 shirts have been printed for this first run
1969809 for me the album is an extension of the previous release ghosts on magnetic tape which relates to electronic voice phenomena or the idea that the dead can still communicate with the living world through recorded media in order to try to capture this feeling i wanted the music to leave a spectral ghostly impression and to have an organic decaying quality like something trying to break through from another world to this end my musical sources were mainly 78 rpm records a vibraphone and an upright piano no synths or electronics were used only organic sources or instrumentation that has been around for at least the last century
1969810 today i completed cover version iv and i think its my favourite so far in the series im very happy the cover version itself is probably the most obscure yet and may create some controversy with its subject matter guaranteed to offend but also very beautiful i think
1969811 ghosts on magnetic tape is the audio equivalent of an edgar allen poe compendium ranging from the darkly beautiful to stark bleakness the compositions soundtrack a narrative comprised of layered effects and instrumental samples that float atop tidal waves of bass ebbing and flowing between troubled waters and molten lava ghosts on magnetic tape is inspired by scientist konstantin raudives famous attempts to communicate with the dead and subsequently capture his efforts on magnetic tape a striking characteristic of ghosts on magnetic tape is the crackle and hiss of analogue limitation exemplified in the recurrent use of music from 78s rather than dirty the sound the cracklings add a warm and charming dimension further emphasized by the seamlessness of the work ghosts is ideally suited for a silent listening environment because this piece can be delicate as it is powerful
1969812 the cover version cd singles were originally intended to be limited editions of 1 000 copies mainly because i didnt really expect them to sell that well and that 1 000 copies of each would suffice however to my surprise the singles quickly sold out and became highly collectible selling for sometimes hundreds of dollars on ebay also between recording the first 2 cv singles i came up with the idea to house all the singles in a box at the end of the series which created a new problem which was how would people who missed earlier releases in the series complete their set so i have decided to make the singles available again and remove the strict limitation on them i must offer my apologies to those that have in the meantime paid over the odds to pick up their copies im also aware of the fact that a large amount of sw related reissues are becoming available during the next few weeks and of the considerable cost to those fans who feel that they want to collect all of them with something like 50 items in my back catalogue now there always seems to be the need for something to be revamped reissued especially as more and more people discover the music some of these forthcoming new editions of older material are major projects eg stupid dream that have been in the works for many months but are only just now coming to fruition others such as the reissues of pts metanoia and moonloop are record company initiatives out of the bands control on top of this there are 2 more releases in the continuing series of sw vinyl reissues on tonefloat its coincidental that all of these have been scheduled for release by the various companies at almost exactly the same time as they were all conceived and planned at different times over the last 2 years therefore my apologies for a potentially expensive time for sw completists

1969840 photographers would still like to see image processing plug ins in lightroom and i agree with them but for a plug in to actually behave like a plug in it cant break the non destructive workflow
1969841 unlike aperture lr doesnt require developers to rewrite code to work as a plug in instead it simply lets external apps open save image data as they normally would less work for developers should translate into more options sooner for photographers

1969849 this birthday is huge weve been preparing for a really long time
1969850 the olympics are kind of on the backburner until saturday
1969851 we are pleased with the results for this fiscal year with the deterioration of the credit markets and the volatility of interest rates we are confident that our business model to diversify our revenue streams is beginning to pay off
1969852 were closing in on the 600 million mark in total assets and entering 2009 in an excellent position
1969853 our growth in noninterest income is starting to attract national attention with our level of noninterest income as a percentage of total revenue moving closer to that of our larger regional competitors revenue diversity is essential and we are pursuing this new business model to reshape the way in which financial products are packaged priced and sold
1969854 weve continued to step away from aggressive loan growth in an effort to maintain the integrity of both our balance sheet and the credit quality of our loan portfolio we are seeing the results of irrational lending and pricing practices across the country as well as the impact of creative financing tactics the resulting reduction in our loan portfolio has allowed us to reduce our reliance on higher cost wholesale deposits thus improving both our cost of funds and our liquidity position
1969855 our commitment to steer clear of sub prime products and pricing disparities resulted in a stronger credit portfolio in the last year with what we believe is an appropriate level of delinquency given the current state of the economy in addition our approach supports our brand position as a trusted advisor always working with our customers needs and best interests in mind
1969856 if you point that thing at me this is what youll get
1969857 it annexation allows for the highest and best use of this land the most valuable use which is going to be for commercial development
1969858 we dont think that there will be any evidence presented to show that this annexation will provide any good to the surrounding area these people will have their house next to a strip mall
1969859 its dangerous for government and anyone in an official government capacity to say that we have enough of a certain kind of development and that we dont need anymore
1969860 that should be a private sector decision and its very difficult for anyone in government to make that decision no matter how well informed you might think that you are we have a developer who has demographic data and market studies and is willing to expend 50 60 million in investment here that i think speaks volumes
1969861 its still america we live in a free society its a land of free markets free enterprise
1969862 yes its still america and everybody has their rights however private corporations and their goals should not necessarily outweigh personal goals of the individuals who actually live here
1969863 they have a right to their property to maintain their property and to hopefully be happy with their property
1969864 i think people who live in this area have a right to stand in the way and complain
1969865 we are dealing with a 100 percent ownership consent here 100 percent of the owners are here today
1969866 when it comes to the general good and the best evidence i believe this board is well aware of the fact that the highest and most credible evidence on the general good are the wishes of the landowners that are involved with the annexation
1969867 it could create additional jobs in the area and increase income for the city therefore i think its in everybodys best interest the annexation be approved and this property be zoned commercial
1969868 theres that possibility but there are still unknowns after we vote one way or the other on the annexation as to how that property will be treated within the city laws and guidelines as to what they do with the zoning of the area
1969869 there are many undetermined factors at this point we strictly are releasing that property from the county to a city
1969870 ohio revised code only gives us so much to discuss

1969892 we consider these employees to be high potential candidates to fill future leadership roles within our organization and of the communities we serve we consider this program a wise investment even in these tough economic times and important to our strategic growth plans

1969912 we are pleased with our sales increase in the first nine months in spite of the weakness of the economy and construction in general operating income was impacted adversely in part by the significant increase in steel prices and components and also the rapid escalation in energy costs we implemented a price increase effective july 1 2008 and we continue to monitor material price increases while disappointed in the margin for the quarter corrective actions have been taken and backlog continues strong income before taxes for the nine months was enhanced by the distributions from our synthetic fuels investees we look forward to continuous growth from operations and we continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our existing businesses

1969922 muslims quite rightly expect these councils to represent their interests and their expectations serious interference as happened in belgium seriously undermines the credibility of some organisations in the eyes of their coreligionists and this results in a dangerous sense of bewilderment regards to the real representatives of muslims
1969923 this agreement is tremendously significant at a time when the political authorities in israel and palestine and the international community are failing to find just and lasting solutions to the political impasse it means that the pgftu will be able to ensure much more effective representation for palestinian workers while those working for israeli employers will also benefit
1969924 the agreement calls upon the ituc and its affiliates to continue to support future cooperation and we are fully committed to do this
1969925 its my opinion that nissan made a huge error by igniting these racist instincts

1969928 bad commercial nissan heres why 1 arabs buy 20 times more nissan vehicles than isrealis 2 if the arabs did a commercial like this how do you think the jews will react 3 nissan better appologize or else they lost a s t load of buyers

1969934 we are extremely pleased with our continued progress during the last quarter in particular our transaction payment processing segment continued to do well we added 324 new customers this quarter and this segment produced 1 9 million in revenue or 62 of our overall revenue while producing gross margins of approximately 45 we also continued to realize significant cost savings as a result of re positioning our check processing segment in the last two quarters of the previous year we believe that e commerce in general will continue to experience significant growth and we also believe that we are positioning ourselves to take advantage of that growth through our continued partnership approach to service offerings during the quarter we made measured and deliberate progress with respect to our intellectual property activities we strongly believe in the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property and we anticipate having more to report in this regard in future quarters
1969935 i am pleased that richard who has been working with pacific asia petroleum over the last 9 months as our managing director now assumes this senior corporate executive role his career of expertise in the oil and gas business internationally and his hands on experience in coal bed methane and tight gas sand operations is timely for our company as we move forward to develop properties that have the potential to add significant value to our company richard has added tremendous value to the company over the last 9 months and now his appointment as a senior executive officer of the company will serve us well as we attempt to commercialize on our opportunities we look forward to his experience and excellent operational and management skills to contribute towards the continued growth of the company in the future
1969936 i am very privileged to be able to work with the unique and world class management team at pacific asia petroleum the opportunities ahead are significant and i am confident that we can capitalize on these and continue to build and grow this company more than delivering to the expectations of all our stakeholders alike it is exciting to be part of a small dynamic team which has the experience to confidently evaluate risk and potential while at the same time able to be nimble enough to act decisively to quickly close on selected objectives asia is about relationships respect patience and persistence more especially so in china we will use this understanding wisely as we move our various projects to commercialization and profitability

1969939 to the skeptics we ask that you keep in mind that the charities included in this study are multi million dollar operations leading one of them requires an individual that possesses both an understanding of the issues that are unique to the charitys mission as well as business and management expertise similar to that required of for profit ceos attracting and retaining that type of talent requires a certain level of compensation
