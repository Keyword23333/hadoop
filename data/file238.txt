2380000 i always kind of feel the most stressful race is the first race of the season and the first race of a regatta
2380001 the same holds true for the first race of the olympics its been some time since lausanne world championships crews get better its exciting to get that first race you know where you stand you know what to expect
2380002 when you get out on the water its very exciting
2380003 it bring it more to the front and centre you are here and you are racing
2380004 its a big game for us just to get this tournament going
2380005 we want to be focused play our game and make sure and start this tournament the way we want to play
2380006 were looking for a close game with a chance to win at the end
2380007 if we do well against them we can come out with some positives and build from there
2380008 you train as best as you can to perform your best
2380009 you cant control how other teams do we come here to win medals but at the end of the day the best you can ask for is putting your best foot forward
2380010 for sure its a different atmosphere having no teammates here
2380011 i kind of miss that camaraderie but now that im here with all the different sports i feel a big part of team canada and once you get in the ring youre by yourself anyway so im used to that
2380012 i expect the climbers to make a lot of attacks but i feel confident and im looking forward to it
2380013 he should protest and make it known that in the countries of the world there are nations the proof was provided the prime minister of canada himself
2380014 an exceptional california cabernet trefethens 2004 is a beautifully balanced package of red and black fruit flavors intermingled with nuances of cedar and cigar box its complexity is astounding and even i who rarely embrace 14 plus percent alcohol wine this one weighs in at 14 1 percent find it harmonious and stylish
2380015 when you have a relationship with the press no matter what your job is there is only one solution either do not court the press and everyone is free to be unknown and have a perfectly fantastic life without being famous or if you expose yourself it means there is something about you that wants to be there it is not obligatory i was not obliged to be a model i was not obliged to be a singer i could have been a doctor
2380016 its been a lot of fun working with some young athletes
2380017 i felt the people who had the biggest influence on me were my coaches so its been an honourable profession and an honourable thing to do
2380018 you really dont know if youre going to a tournament until the last minute
2380019 funding is a big big big issue its just a general state of uncertainty
2380020 we do have wrestling mats though which is the main component of wrestling
2380021 but it would be nice to have a bit more weight training stuff which will gradually come my presence there is helping a lot of things change
2380022 theyre very appreciative and they show it in every way
2380023 its just different the culture is different if youre walking around they wont even let me carry my own bag
2380024 he actually was at our national camp a month ago
2380025 it just elevated the intensity and it was a huge inspiration when youve got a guy like that in the room it just elevates the game
2380026 any time a nigerian athlete will meet a canadian athlete it will give me a cause for concern as much as i want my athletes to succeed in nigeria i also want the canadian wrestlers to succeed because funding will come for us i hope if we do compete against each other its deep into the tournament where both of them will win medals
2380027 there are lots of expectations from the nigerian government too especially with my involvement
2380028 i dont think they understand how difficult it can be to medal at the olympics
2380029 tomorrow morning ill go to tian an men square to see what may occur on this special moment anyway aug 8 is a day deserving being remembered
2380030 today we feel happier than we do at spring festival
2380031 its because our economy has developed so much and our president hu jintao has led the country well
2380032 id say his opening and reform policy of 1978 laid the groundwork for the prosperity we have today
2380033 this is a very happy moment for the chinese people
2380034 which is the essence of the chinese culture our culture is a he culture
2380035 and while we want to win medals at the games
2380036 if the cup is not full youre not a very sincere host
2380037 they are all excellent candidates and indeed the quality of the unsuccessful candidates today was also exceptional

2380134 oh my god i knew it would be you who would have the balls to wear that shirt fortunately all of the chinese seem to be home jerking off over the opening ceremonies so you shouldnt get into too much trouble
2380135 thank you knowing you were a leg man and since i sort of suspected that you would be here today i did it for you
2380136 not that much sit with me a while grab a beer and i will roll you one of these cigs
2380137 i got to finish up a couple of things and ill be back
2380138 this is good but seems like a different tobacco than last time
2380139 it is that organic new mexico american spirit i alternate it sometimes with the drum and bugler when i can get it
2380140 you know after getting really disgusted with chinese occupation of tibet darfur and the 200 000 to 300 000 internet police that they seem to have i also decided to boycott the opening ceremonies of the beijing olympics on tv at first i wanted to boycott the entire olympics but decided just to skip the opening and closing ceremonies
2380141 these are after all the main showcases of the chinese communist party they really want to show the progress they have made during the past 30 years while practically destroying their country
2380142 i hear that in entire wide beijing region most of the major rivers are mostly dried out that you drive over these long bridges over dry river beds
2380143 thats apparently true and despite the fact that they moved a lot of the polluting industrial plants away from beijing for the olympics while polluting other parts of the country and reduced the automobile traffic it is pretty obvious that the pollution still hangs in the air all over the place
2380144 ok bring me that burger and we can get away from this endless tv coverage here and lets plan to also boycott the sochi olympics in russia now that russia has invaded south ossetia and its at war with georgia and considering what they did in afghanistan and what they are doing in the caucasus the ioc should have never given them the olympics
2380145 and unless china gets out of tibet and actually formally recognizes it as an independent country i am not only not going to watch their olympics but will make very effort not to buy their products
2380146 we havent scrimmaged yet i think theyve all done really well so far everyone keeps pushing paul cianciolo off to the side and we also have a walk on thats really impressed me obviously were comfortable with the three kids we just mentioned that have been around so i think weve made some progress but weve still got a long way to go
2380147 the nice thing is that the wideouts have really helped the quarterbacks
2380148 theyve helped coach them saying hey you were a little late on that throw or are you gonna break another yard its been those kind of things that have really helped

2380166 the things that makes a festival is the audience and ive always found the audience in nova scotia and the maritimes to be very much from the heart its very music related they dont want any fancy b s they want the reality
2380167 atlantic canada is one of the only place in the country that has still retained an individual atmosphere and attitude
2380168 obviously were going to see some defensive fronts that are going to try to challenge us and put eight in the box so that we cant force it down their throat like we would like
2380169 right now its all about the little things and thats what im harping on
2380170 hes light years ahead of where he was last season hes doing a great job of picking up blitzes hes understanding pass protection a lot better hes doing a better job of getting himself in great position to pick up blitzes and on top of that hes conscious of all the little things that we discuss every day
2380171 the bottom line thing is now weve got to put all that into production as we come out here every single day
2380172 obviously youve got to understand theres some great defensive schemes out there they get paid on the other side of the ball weve just got to make sure that were detailing everything from an offensive standpoint
2380173 also too we want to be better at not playing uphill football where were trying to force something where now we can make something happen in a different area
2380174 thats why were counting on improving in the passing game
2380175 we signed a great receiver in bernard berrian weve got a young sidney rice whos developing weve got bobby wade robert ferguson weve got a bunch of young guys who are going to help us and i think once those young receivers and the quarterback start stepping up their play which they are right now its going to open up more lanes
2380176 it is hard to watch it and not see it and kind of put it out of my mind
2380177 but i am serious when i say there is so much going on here with the meetings preparing for practices preparing for the next day personnel meetings at night that i am probably not as involved as you guys the media are in seeing everything that happened day to day
2380178 the first thing for a young guy like that is to learn the system he is doing great hes a very bright young man and every day he is making progress some days its a full step forward and a half step back but that is the way it is for any young guy

2380186 mac os x 10 5 5 build 9f9 comes exactly one week after the mac maker began widespread testing of leopard update by privately distributed build 9f5 to its vast developer community since then the cupertino based company has implemented two dozen additional code corrections to bring the total number of bug fixes expected as part of mac os x 10 5 5 to more than 100 people familiar with the latest build say
2380187 those with knowledge of the ongoing beta test say apple is also using build 9f9 to broaden developers focus area from 18 core system components to 24 some additions from last weeks build include directory services fonts mdnsresponder screen sharing and x11 unlike the previous build however apple is no longer advising developers to abstain from installing the pre release software on macs that include integrated graphics cards
2380188 we note that the macbook has had the same design since its launch over two years ago and the macbook pro has had essentially the same design since its launch over 2 5 years ago which was very similar in design to the powerbook g4 released over 5 5 years ago
2380189 to compare the long running imac g5 design lasted three years

2380198 i was able to put those balls on the guys and allowed them to make plays
2380199 not behind them or too high i hit them in stride so they can really make plays that was one thing i was happy about tonight
2380200 i was so nervous i think it was the hardest i have ever shot during the match and during the final it was just so hard
2380201 you could see us running around we didnt have much time after the qualifying match and before the final our heart rate was so high im seriously happy it is over and i hold gold

2380221 some members are completely alone or have family members in other states
2380222 and simply do not have access to assistance we want to be able to help them
2380223 so i will no longer be an employee of the city though i will continue to serve in my present capacity as an employee of the nonprofit organization the reduction to the 30 hour work week however will affect the transportation piece

2380226 when you stumble like that you look operationally at what happened the city of palmetto is going to continue to be the contractor for van service so that it will still have the ability unlike many of the other centers to go outside of the 25 mile travel radius allowed by the county
2380227 some of the other staffing items were going to have to work on

2380241 its very hard to tell how serious it is at this point although tv pictures tend to show russian armor moving into south ossetia we dont know for sure
2380242 if that were to be the case this would be the most serious incident in south ossetia since the end of the war and it changes the face of this conflict quite dramatically
2380243 there is now real danger of georgian and russian forces clashing in a serious fashion
2380244 im still a bit puzzled as to why this has gone so far given the risks to georgia in terms of the possibility of not being able to fulfill its aspirations towards nato and the eu
2380245 russia has a military capability if it is indeed moving into south ossetia to secure a corridor from tskhinvali back through the roki tunnel and to secure tskhinvali itself
2380246 the biggest danger would be if fighting broke out in the city itself
2380247 it boils down to kosovo independence natos bucharest summit and possibly also russian internal politics and the transfer of power
2380248 in february russian diplomats said kosovos unilateral declaration of independence from serbia would stir up strife in the balkans and linked kosovar status to separatist areas abkhazia and south ossetia
2380249 irrespective of who triggered this recent action the general direction of russian policy is clear which is we are taking control of these territories and were not even pretending that were not
2380250 turning the tide of a georgian offensive would mean a massive invasion by russian forces
2380251 they would need to deploy crack russian troops on the battlefield and that does not guarantee victory over georgia because you cant deploy much
2380252 massive russian intervention would mean its going to be a long war a bloody war with an unpredictable outcome because ossetia is geographically separated from russia
2380253 its a hell of a logistical nightmare to try and take and keep south ossetia against a rather fine georgian military
2380254 i think there are opportunities for both sides to pull back from this there is a risk of wider conflict but its in neither sides interests to begin head to head clashes
2380255 i think its unlikely the u s would intervene to support georgia militarily at this stage the focus in the coming days is going to be to try and put a lid on this as quickly as possible
2380256 should fighting continue as it is likely to over coming days russia looks set to respond especially as the majority of south ossetias population hold russian citizenship this includes the possibility that ground troops such as airborne units stationed in russias north caucasus region could also be deployed such a development would mark a major escalation of the conflict and potentially lead to wider regional instability with associated risks to major caspian europe energy transit routes such as the baku tbilisi ceyhan oil pipeline
2380257 the first priority for washington right now is to stop the fighting before it spins out of control there is a very real danger that this might go beyond what either the russians or the georgians intended
2380258 i would think that the secretary rice is working the phones on all sides the united states can help here but it must be an honest broker
2380259 i cant see us intervening militarily the only possibility would be if this would escalate between georgia and russia then its a different ballgame
2380260 if there was a full scale confrontation georgian against russian armies and the georgian government was under threat of falling if the situation escalates and the russians do not withdraw im not saying military involvement but some kind of military assistance would be essential whether logistics or intelligence we cannot see georgia disappear under the russian boot
2380261 how this conflict develops is unpredictable at this point what is clear is that we are entering the next stage of a year long conflict between russia and georgia todays events and their consequences are further deteriorating investor sentiment towards russian assets
2380262 last weeks attack on new york listed coal firm mechels pricing behavior by putin and the lasting tnk bp saga found a bloody next act in a screenplay that could be named
2380263 potentially we are dealing with a very serious crisis which goes far beyond ossetia georgia or the caucasus a lot depends on how the united states acts and this is what is on the top of the minds of people in moscow
2380264 the united states is vulnerable in this situation and may invite an undesired deterioration of ties with russia the rocky relations could become a lot worse
2380265 the u s leaning towards georgian membership of nato got well out of hand they have not yet demonstrated that they are a full democracy george w bush overplayed this by saying georgia and ukraine would definitely get into nato
2380266 no one within nato wants to fight for georgia they see it as being too far away
2380267 for 25 years the lighting has been set up in a baseball configuration
2380268 youre going to look up and say hey those lights are out its not that the lights are out its that we got it balanced away from a baseball configuration
2380269 we just sense the team senses that were cut out to do great things this year
2380270 i think this will be the beginning of many great years ahead of us
2380271 from year to year it seems like were improving in every position i think thats what you need to do is to be in that position go ahead and get the players and draft the players that make that team championship worthy
2380272 were certainly happy hes out of our division so we can fight for the division and move on to win championships
2380273 it was mostly to enjoy mankato and hear from the coaches and the personnel

2380277 the feeling of standing back and watching the music unfold in front of you is incredible
2380278 each year in the united states out of an estimated 4 4 million confirmed pregnancies there are more than half a million miscarriages twenty nine thousand stillbirths and thirty nine thousand infant deaths under 1 year of age

2380327 based on our review we believe our investment in aol may be impaired
2380328 after consideration of the duration of the impairment as well as the reasons for any decline in value and the potential recovery period we do not believe that such impairment is other than temporary

2380331 with cloud computer looming on the horizon it is important for us all to think of the privacy threats there as well
2380332 the tool resides with someone else and the data is stored somewhere else generally that is a bad idea
2380333 when information is in the public domain it is game over
2380334 information on your computer may get protection under the law but on someone elses it gets less protection
2380335 the information we are all giving to online companies is massive and dangerous and its going to get worse before it gets better
2380336 giving them our data is a clear and present risk

2380343 the end user dictates what we are to offer them
2380344 look i have nothing against new extensions and there are some great ones besides dot com but you are equating the growth of the internet into creating more extensions
2380345 that is a much higher learning curve does having a dozen more tld offer the end user more access or a freer ability to find and navigate i do not believe so

2380347 las diferencias de ste con el original ser n muy evidentes para quienes conocen el cuarteto pero los que no lo conocen no podr n percatarse en qu lugares espec ficos le hizo anotaciones el compositor y su familia
2380348 la mayor a de los cambios son de matices que van de lo fuerte a lo quedo o de lo gradualmente m s fuerte a lo gradualmente m s quedo y esto es muy importante y resulta revelador porque en la mayor a de las ejecuciones musicales de la poca tenemos secciones evidentes y bien definidas de fuertes y quedos
2380349 pero en mozart particularmente sus piezas son como una monta a rusa de din micas son mucho menos definidas en sus secciones y hay m s cambios abruptos y sorpresivos
2380350 aunque sab amos que exist a este manuscrito el hecho de que tuviera anotaciones de mozart y no del mismo haydn hizo que se le restara importancia obedeciendo a esta idea incorrecta de que s lo la versi n del compositor es la v lida y no su serie de reinterpretaciones
2380351 tenemos evidencias de que cuando mozart interpretaba sus obras las interpretaba de manera diferente y l jam s hubiera esperado que un int rprete ejecutara sus piezas de la misma manera que l sino al contrario esperaba que un int rprete tuviera imaginaci n y buen gusto que se apropiara de la pieza
2380352 hay muchas partituras en donde hicieron notas de ejecuci n din micas fraseos pero hasta donde yo s ste es el ejemplo m s extremo es posible que haya habido otros casos importantes pero alrededor del 80 por ciento de esas partituras que los mozart usaban para trabajar y ensayar se perdieron

2380361 there are not too many competitive bridge players in canada
2380362 its hard to learn because its very complex and i dont think people are taking the initiative to learn it early in their school years
2380363 i played in junior high when we had a bridge club and my marks went up by five or 10 per cent because my memory was tested and it kept me sharp i am an athlete too and bridge balances athletics with intellect and im not happy unless i do both it keeps me sane

2380394 i think a j was not hustling on the play
2380395 he hit the ball and pretty much thought it was out of play
2380396 when i hit it and drew caught it i didnt know where it went

2380414 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2380415 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2380416 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2380417 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2380418 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2380419 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2380420 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2380421 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2380422 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2380423 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2380424 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2380425 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2380426 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

2380434 shes always been real unique and i think it was very understandable shed pick today
2380435 in fact arugula is grown by local farms in iowa and is widely available in stores throughout the state including cleverly farms in mingo iowa and mariposa farms in grinnell iowa moreover vendors at numerous farmers markets including the davenport farmers market and the ames farmers market sell arugula directly from farms to consumers several iowa grocery stores also carry arugula the website of hy vee a large grocery chain headquartered in and with four stores in west des moines iowa approximately 22 miles from adel iowa where obama made his arugula remark offers tips on cleaning and serving arugula as well as several recipes featuring it

2380443 we never had the opportunity to vote on this and speaker pelosi wont give us the opportunity
2380444 she said they just need to use their imagination and thats what were going to do
2380445 its not a 10 to 20 year down the road option
2380446 huffing and puffing on the chamber floor has done absolutely nothing to solve the energy problem

2380530 if you read any of my past posts on obama you will see why he has no credibility in my eyes

2380536 the first thing i would do is make sure that we have a missile defense system in place in czechoslovakia and poland and i dont care what his objections are to it
2380537 i was concerned about a couple of steps that the russian government took in the last several days one was reducing the energy supplies to czechoslovakia apparently that is in reaction to the czechs agreement with us concerning missile defense and again some of the russian now announcement they are now retargeting new targets something they abandoned at the end of the cold war is also a concern
2380538 i think its serious its a serious situation but theres a lot of things we need to do we have a lot of work to do and im afraid its a very hard struggle particularly given the situation on the iraq pakistan border

2380547 he is in big danger of losing the cachet he built up for himself in being pro western and the restraint he has often shown in the face of provocation by russia
2380548 if he is going to start a war he is going to lose the support of a lot of friends in the west
2380549 at the end of the day the georgians realize that time is not on their side and they could not let south ossetia and abkhazia become even more messy and russian influence even stronger
2380550 he has had plenty of warnings from the west that it wont pull any chestnuts out of the fire for him so i dont think he can count on the cavalry riding in
2380551 the russians hope he will get more than verbal support
2380552 the russians want a more direct confrontation with the west and i hope the bush administration has the wisdom not to give them that satisfaction
2380553 ultimately his nato ambitions could go out of the window

2380564 far below my comfort zone and probably less than the minimum fuel required
2380565 our fuel situation had not become critical yet but had we had any delay i would have had to declare a fuel emergency
2380566 i am not sure if the flight plan as given to me by my company was a real flight plan or if they were just telling me it was so that i would continue to jfk thus saving them time and expense in the future if such a situation presents itself again i will divert to my initial destination regardless of what my company says i can do the safety of my crew far outweighs any financial burden to the company
2380567 this was probably the new fuel saving initiative by the company management to save money
2380568 north south operation is very unpredictable along the east coast i dont think this is a place where we should skimp on fuel
2380569 relaying my opinion on the reduced fuel load and my suggestion not to compromise fuel loads in and out of florida
2380570 because in an attempt to abide by the new fuel conservation procedures just adopted by the company not enough fuel was put on the aircraft to handle a simple delay in an effort to save money an aircraft had to divert

2380572 we reduced expenditures by the same amount in capital projects
2380573 we had a reduction in revenue in six of our revenue sources and an increase in revenue in four
2380574 were carrying five vacancies in full time public safety positions through the month of september two in the police department and three in the fire department
2380575 were covering some of our public safety services utilizing part time help for the moment to reduce our costs in benefits this first year when our budget is so tight
2380576 parrott as well as a number of other fire and police department employees has done a great deal more than 40 hours of work each week
2380577 we avoided spending about 50 000 this year for a public works director
2380578 were working with some old equipment and we have to kind of baby it along but were getting the work done
2380579 were beefing up patrols trying to be seen a little more in the neighborhoods
2380580 and were working on building a database of area residents to help us know when people are typically home and what cars we should expect to see at each residence that will help us to recognize unusual behavior and possible intruders
2380581 we had a little over 120 calls for service during the month of july mostly for medical assistance

2380595 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2380596 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2380597 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2380598 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song

2380601 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2380602 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

2380726 it appears that for people who have a certain genetic make up the initial physical reaction to smoking can play a significant role in determining what happens next
2380727 if cigarette smoking is sustained nicotine addiction can occur in a few days to a few months the finding of a genetic association with pleasurable early smoking experiences may help explain how people get addicted
2380728 its interesting to see research which helps us join the dots on the whole mechanism of nicotine addiction but in practical terms we have for now to carry on doing what we are currently doing to help smokers

2380730 we should be deeply concerned that with less than two years to go before our deadline for universal access the g8 has committed little more than a third of the resources that it has promised to deliver by 2010

2380741 as soon as i met him the headache was gone god told me it was time to be his wife praise be to god i am his wife now i am now the happiest woman on earth when you marry a man with 86 wives you know he knows how to look after them

2380745 regarding oil and gasoline we know that demand destruction is occurring in the united states now at least initially it appears slowing trade and global gdp growth will affect oil demand in emerging markets as well if the latter is the case oil could fall below 100 or even below 90 per barrel

2380804 the vietnamese catholic culture is very strong a lot of those who have come here have been through a great deal just to get to this country theyve always preserved their catholic faith this is a trial this is a challenge

2380817 in the 10 years ive been working with rescuing animals ive never seen the citys animal control managed better they have a great facility its really encouraging how proactive the organization has become recently in terms of adopting animals out and organizing adoption events
2380818 im against it but what choice is there the city can do only so much irresponsible pet owners who dont spay and neuter hurt us all
2380819 we got a 25 000 grant in 2006 for a special project we spayed and neutered everything we could get our hands on
2380820 our donations are down by 50 percent this year because people cant afford gas how can they give 20 a month to us
2380821 i cannot stress enough how important it is to fix your pet it should be a federalized law the money put towards these animals could be used elsewhere it is my goal to work myself out of a job i would love to see the day when there arent any more animals to adopt rescue or alter spaying or neutering your pets helps us all
2380822 its a very common story people lose their homes and leave their pets behind irresponsible owners who abandon unaltered pets when they abandon a property are going to add very much to this problem
2380823 black cats and black dogs are the last to go i dont know why perhaps subconscious religious superstitions but if i put a pretty white dog next to a pretty black dog most people pick the white dog even though its hair is going to show up on everything a whole lot more
2380824 older pets are often overlooked people wanting to adopt have often recently lost an animal and the fear of death points them towards kittens and puppies the advantage of older animals is that they dont chew theyre already housebroken and most of the health issues are already known you can adopt a puppy today and it may have hip dysplasia in three years you just never know

2380862 in something of a surprise former senator and presidential candidate george mcgovern has come out in opposition to the so called employee free choice act which is being pushed by labor unions
2380863 the efca seeks to amend current labor laws with regard to how they deal with the formation and certification of unions in the workplace right now there a secret ballot to decide whether or not there should be a union in the workplace this allows workers to make a choice without worrying about the response of pro union co workers
2380864 if efca passes the secret ballot would no longer take place if they could get a majority of workers to sign a petition calling for a union on the surface this would seem reasonable but the truth is that often workers are tricked intimidated or otherwise coerced into signing these petitions with a free and secret election the workers would be able to make an informed choice

2381121 what it does is reaffirms the confidence that people can have in the queensland justice criminal system
2381122 this actually proves that the court system in queensland believes that such high profile individuals can get a fair trial in this state
2381123 in this case the learned primary judge did not advert to the possibility that any adverse effect of pretrial publicity might be dissipated by an adjournment of the trial for a few months
2381124 the system of trial by jury proceeds on the assumption that jurors can be trusted to be true to their oath
2381125 where there has been extensive pretrial publicity it is customary for the trial judge to explain the obvious points of distinction between media reports and the evidence presented in criminal cases

2381145 based on our review we believe our investment in aol may be impaired
2381146 after consideration of the duration of the impairment as well as the reasons for any decline in value and the potential recovery period we do not believe that such impairment is other than temporary
2381147 the disney stores are going to be reviewing other potential locations in the manhattan retail market
2381148 my purpose in life is to demonstrate through example and teaching the way a company policy that should live and to influence all those related links with to emulate that example
2381149 shut up and go to your room cubicle like a good little boy company drone before you get on my nerves and get spanked fired
2381150 you can move some tees up you can make some easier pins or otherwise it can get ridiculous
2381151 where theyre putting the pins theres no chance we dont want rain but it would be easier to play if we had it its not that difficult a course but it plays difficult because of the pins its like miniature golf out there a fair course is a fun course this is just survival
2381152 so im not going into whether its fair or unfair right now the target is over par and i just dont know how many
2381153 its unusual to see this setup in a pga championship
2381154 when youre on the greens its difficult to read the putts because the breaks are so subtle so sometimes you dont hit the putts as firm as you should
2381155 the way they say these things happen it could be a lot worse
2381156 i have heard about people who come back from this in a short period of time and others in a long period im hoping mine is short
2381157 i liked the frame of mind at the end of practice
2381158 you hate for it to happen like that but it is what it is
2381159 thats why were here to step in in case something happens
2381160 its an extraordinary moment and opportunity for these other quarterbacks were so lucky to have guys like mitch and aaron theyre championship kids
2381161 you accept that i cant do the things i used to do im not going to make excuses about how ive felt physically everyone out here has to put up with something i feel i can still play the game pretty well at times when im feeling good it just takes awhile to stretch myself out some days
2381162 the problem is that i just never know it might go out on me tomorrow but there are some weeks when i dont feel it as much ive gone into sunday with some chances to get into contention and it hasnt happened and im not going to blame it on anything
2381163 it was somewhere in the middle of the round and i managed to make it to the clubhouse
2381164 the next day i couldnt set up over the ball
2381165 its like other times when ive hit four wedges and had to go back in there are times when it doesnt want to cooperate yeah it can be frustrating i played at a high level for a very long time and its frustrating when it affects my game i could probably do something surgical to get rid of the pain yeah but i dont know that id ever play golf again certainly not at the level id like to
2381166 i missed the last five fairways coming in made two bogeys and didnt finish up the way i wanted to physically i have to be ready to go you just have to keep from overworking yourself

2381171 ive learned a lot become a better professional and a better man because of my experience and my time in new york i dont regret or feel ashamed about anything that happened to me in my time in new york
2381172 the most difficult part is just the realization that the organization no longer wants you
2381173 you spend eight years there and in the blink of an eye youre no longer wanted there
2381174 headley britannia is fine im the worse one im sweating like a trooper
2381175 i was warned about the heat and humidity but they didnt tell me i was going to nearly drown
2381176 i was really pleased with him its only a short time since i got the horse and it cant be any better
2381177 we hadnt seen them play beforehand so we just watched a bit of tape on them but we hadnt seen them play live
2381178 we didnt really know what to expect but i think they were still pretty tough with us and pretty physical
2381179 its the olympics so weve got to expect that but it was a good hit out for us

2381182 i was only holding a canadian flag i planned to use that as a decoy but they said id broken the rules and would have to leave the whole thing was pretty ridiculous
2381183 my friend went into the venue first and he snuck in the tibetan flag and a banner because i knew they would search me
2381184 im pretty upset i got a bit scratched up and im bleeding from the elbow
2381185 it is against ioc regulations to be propagating political slogans or aiming to create racial hatred
2381186 not only have they breached the ioc regulations they also disturbing other spectators hence they were told to leave and would not be welcome back

2381197 ended up with the football trying to make the best out of a bad situation
2381198 the competitor in him probably got the best of him he lowered his shoulder and the end result was a broken collar bone
2381199 i thought our first offense was sharp coming out of the gate that was important to us
2381200 i thought he played really well i liked the poise
2381201 there were so many good things that i saw and a couple bad ones but donovan was a plus
2381202 can be great if we continue to stay healthy and continue to progress
2381203 i think it was awesome that the offensive line did a great job of run blocking
2381204 we threw two passes and they protected very well i think it was a good first drive for us
2381205 it was done he just had to review it and look through it one more time hell be out there for the next one
2381206 its nothing different just going out and trying to make the same plays
2381207 youve got to understand that this is first time in the nfl
2381208 weve all been through that before and understand you kind of have some butterflies and get a bit nervous at times but i thought he handled it well

2381212 it was a great way to start especially against them
2381213 theyve got a great defense and theyre strong up front weve had some trouble starting out well on the road in the past but i thought this was a great start and a lot to be happy about
2381214 considering he wasnt a center until three weeks ago id say he did fine
2381215 thats what the preseason is for to work these kinks out
2381216 there are things we need to improve on and this will be a good measuring stick
2381217 our first unit early on we moved the ball pretty well and kind of mistake free there
2381218 thats one of the things you look for in an early preseason game and i like the way we ran the ball
2381219 we feel very comfortable with our running game but we wanted to get our pass game a fresh start
2381220 i left a few putts out there but overall it was a very good ball striking round
2381221 theres one guy under par right now and conditions are exactly like the us open
2381222 rough being thick greens being firm and crusty and its playing tough
2381223 this week obviously has a fair bit of importance with where both teams are on the ladder
2381224 the cowboys are a quality outfit so we need to turn up in the right frame of mind and be ready for a very tough night
2381225 it made me feel so happy and proud by giving these very poor people a hope in life

2381233 i think its the meanest thing that could ever have happened to her
2381234 adding garbage to garbage i just dont understand how someone who professes to love somebody can do this
2381235 i think she would protect him at all costs she is a selfless partner
2381236 my heart goes out to her she shouldnt have to deal with this after all she has been through from the loss of her son wade to her brave battle against cancer
2381237 i dont think its anyone elses business whats going on in their marriage
2381238 i feel for elizabeth edwards and i also feel that shes the only person allowed to make any judgment in this situation
2381239 just because there has been an affair doesnt mean you dont have a strong marriage
2381240 marriages survive infidelity when both decide to repair and forgive
2381241 ok tell reporters its none of their business but dont lie
2381242 is he lying about the baby being his as well
2381243 this informs what cate will know about relationships with men
2381244 it informs how she will deal with her own relationships with men
2381245 the national enquirer is not well regarded as a news source by the news media
2381246 we began pursuing the story soon after it first appeared but the standard for proof in this kind of intimate behavior is and should be very high
2381247 better to get it right even if we couldnt get it first
2381248 i think the mainstream news media were responsible for not airing it and not printing it earlier there really wasnt anything to report
2381249 if the story were false it would be a tremendously hurtful thing for his family and professionally lethal to him
2381250 he saw the handwriting on the wall and wanted to do something different
2381251 a man with 10 wives would collapse and die but my own power is given by allah that is why i have been able to control 86 of them
2381252 i dont go looking for them they come to me i will consider the fact that god has asked me to do it and i will just marry them
2381253 to my understanding the koran does not place a limit and it is up to what your own power your own endowment and ability allows
2381254 god did not say what the punishment should be for a man who has more than four wives but he was specific about the punishment for fornication and adultery
2381255 as soon as i met him the headache was gone
2381256 god told me it was time to be his wife praise be to god i am his wife now
2381257 i said i couldnt marry an older man but he said it was directly an order from god
2381258 i am now the happiest woman on earth when you marry a man with 86 wives you know he knows how to look after them
2381259 as you sit here if you have any illness i can see it and just remove it
2381260 they were sick and we told god and god said their time has come
2381261 a man with 10 wives would collapse and die but my own power is given by allah that is why i have been able to control 86 of them
2381262 to my understanding the koran does not place a limit and it is up to what your own power your own endowment and ability allows
2381263 as soon as i met him the headache was gone
2381264 the fact is that censorship always defeats its own purpose for it creates in the end the kind of society that is incapable of exercising real discretion

2381267 yahoo has a long history of providing clear notice to our users via our privacy policy and is always exploring additional avenues for enhanced notice
2381268 consumers have and continue to respond strongly to internet products and services that are customized to their interests
2381269 yahoo strongly believes that consumers want choice when customizing their online experience and they have also demonstrated a strong preference for advertising that is more personally relevant to them
2381270 bloggers or families who want to occasionally post content are generally subsidized by the advertising business model through free or reduced cost hosting and also through the ability to have text graphical and even video ads appear on the site
2381271 this ability to make money while sharing views increases the number of viewpoints that can be taken in public debates and surely enriches our public conversation as a nation and as a global society
2381272 no one is saying that there cant be targeted marketing

2381274 so we are going to move forward and hopefully that will spur action by the congress
2381275 weve got so much talent surrounding the quarterback its going to be hard for them to lose a game
2381276 with the coaching staff we have we can make adjustments throughout the game and put our quarterbacks in the best position possible well be fine
2381277 the most consistent performer the guy that makes the play the guy that is least likely to turn it over least likely to make poor decisions
2381278 weve just got to execute the offense just make good decisions and get the ball to our guys because weve got a lot of talent
2381279 we realize all we have to do is just get the ball in playmakers hands and make great decisions and the rest will take care of itself
2381280 it was unfortunate what happened to ryan you know you never want to see a teammate leave
2381281 andrew and i realize its our time to step up
2381282 if youre competing against someone its nice that its a great guy like jarrett lee
2381283 i thought that we tackled a lot better than we did the first day of spring when we were wearing pads
2381284 i didnt like the way we executed our pass petrino said
2381285 we usually do better than that but we came back and got good work in on our inside run and did a nice job on live third downs
2381286 there is good competition between him jerry franklin and jermaine love all three are getting reps with the ones tenarius is a man that has great instincts and really knows the game the best thing is that he came into camp with the attitude that im going to play as a freshman and compete for a starting job so ive been very impressed with him
2381287 he has been very reliable on his routes and i think that hes faster than he was in the spring hes been real sharp and i think hes dropped one ball in five days so i am really happy with the way hes played
2381288 its all about corporate dollars if you dont have corporate partners i dont care who you are youre not going to participate in this sport its just not going to happen
2381289 and were looking at kids to put in these late models
2381290 for the african american kid im looking at putting in my late model im going to have to pay for it out of my own pocket
2381291 whats going to get marc in a cup car has nothing to do with the color of his skin
2381292 it has to do with his ability to drive the car his ability to generate money to sell products for sponsors and his ability to have a pleasant attitude and be a good everyday person
2381293 who have raced together all their lives both of them seeming to succeed at every level
2381294 so what i want to know and everybody else wants to know is if not now when
2381295 since we started the program with reggie white weve been careful not to push guys
2381296 you could do more damage if you push guys quick
2381297 its true he has been in bigger cars for a while longer than i have and my learning curve is a little longer than his
2381298 but theyre a helluva lot farther ahead of the game than what 90 percent of people go through
2381299 but im talking about how much money it cost to get him here
2381300 i would say its probably been more than 2 million and 2 million now wont do it
2381301 i would say theres a possibility he could run something part time in nationwide in the fall
2381302 next year were trying to look at trucks as a great spot for him
2381303 and all the work thats gone into trying to create inclusiveness
2381304 in fairness i think our progress nascar the sport and nascar the sanctioning body should be measured on our commitment to the drive for diversity
2381305 i was ready to punch the first m who looked at me wrong
2381306 that took him completely aback because he knew i was a promoter and he figured that would get a tremendous amount of ink
2381307 the voice said if you let that blankity blank race in the 600 youre dead
2381308 even in the 80s things could still get out of hand particularly around a nascar track
2381309 one of the things that always concerned me when we had a race was somebody a fan in the infield taking a potshot at a driver with a rifle
2381310 there was an uproar among about a hundred fans who stormed a fence surrounding the track some of them chanting go home nigger
2381311 if you start or end your sentence with the n word that makes it racial
2381312 the reality is it had nothing to do with winning the race it had nothing to do with losing it
2381313 one of the things we find is that a lot of times the consumers dont know there is a minority driver
2381314 chase austin is that he has the charisma he keeps his nose clean hes a clean cut good kid whos doing something great
2381315 youve got this little window dressing operation and its not cutting it its a mannequin
2381316 i mean we had nothing before this at least is something
2381317 the only way this thing is going to work is to get the diversity drivers in cars like bandoleros and legends at an early age
2381318 a few of them will come out of it to the major leagues
2381319 when we do theres going to be a lewis hamilton in there
2381320 increasing the number of families who participate in youth racing
2381321 were building partnerships with the world karting association 600 racing wheelers association for bandoleros and legends cars and the quarter midget association of america to invite more kids in including minority kids
2381322 and then we went out to see some of the summer shootout
2381323 you buy a pair of shorts and a pair of tennis shoes he needs a baseball glove
2381324 heck id like to see nascar go out and sponsor five teams that have african american drivers
2381325 for the competitors who have spent their years toiling in this sport trying to participate in this sport struggling in this sport going in and out of this sport
2381326 the biggest thing nascar can do is continue to try to grow the grassroots programs that give people an opportunity at an early age to get involved
2381327 and all the other sanctioning bodies in racing have always kind of taken the attitude of this is america were open well welcome everybody into it but were not going to give anybody anything
2381328 i think we have the character within this team and thats what the olympic team is for
2381329 i think in the past three olympics weve gone out there saying were going to beat the yanks were going to beat the yanks and weve come up short and a lot short
2381330 there are some other wonderful nations around the world and im sure if you asked any of these athletes if you dont bring your a game every day to the court youre vulnerable
2381331 us and us are hunted so teams come in against us and they figure theyve got nothing to lose
2381332 so were well aware that theres a lot of steps yet and were just keeping our concentration on that
2381333 if we allow jamie charman and simon black and luke power and michael rischitelli to get on top of us in the midfield then thatll supply those big forwards for them
2381334 on the other hand if we can win that area of the ground then it gives our big guys a chance so its going to be a critical part of the game
2381335 it was a good win last week prior to that we had a couple of losses
2381336 so i think its important that you go into the finals with a little bit of momentum brisbane are playing for a spot in the eight and we know theyll come out firing
2381337 so its going to be a good test for us
2381338 i think it does it gives a little bit of momentum going into the game

2381378 overridden in order to protect the safety of a child who has been declared dependent
2381379 an order that they be sent to private or public school rather than educated at home by their mother
2381380 primarily based on its view that parents have an absolute constitutional right to their children
2381381 we filed our original opinion on feb 28 2008 granting the petition on the bases that 1 california statutory law does not permit homeschooling and 2 this prohibition does not violate the u s constitution
2381382 in order to provide an opportunity for further argument on the multiple complex issues involved in this case including but not limited to 1 additional california statutes that might bear upon the issue and 2 potentially applicable provisions of the california constitution
2381383 i have never seen such an impressive array of people and organizations coming to the defense of homeschooling
2381384 tens of thousands of california parents over 166 000 homeschooled children are now breathing easier
2381385 homeschooling was initially expressly permitted in california when the compulsory education law was enacted in 1903
2381386 in 1929 however homeschool was amended out of the law and children who were not educated in public or private schools could be taught privately only by a credentialed tutor
2381387 subsequent developments in the law call this conclusion into question although the legislature did not amend the statutory scheme so as to expressly permit homeschooling more recent enactments demonstrate an apparent acceptance by the legislature of the proposition that homeschooling is taking place in california with homeschools allowed as private schools

2381407 its good to see public acknowledgment that our story was accurate all along
2381408 probably the biggest question about this whole mess is why the mainstream media protected edwards by ignoring the story for the past 8 months
2381409 i think its entirely appropriate for a news organization to wait to report a story until they have information that theyre comfortable with reporting
2381410 all i can say is that were not in the business of printing things we dont know to be true
2381411 the problem with a story like this is that its very very difficult to ascertain the truth until one of the people steps forward
2381412 the national enquirer is a supermarket tabloid that is accurate some of the time and inaccurate some of the time
2381413 it was the subject of late night talk shows and certainly all over the web
2381414 it was in our culture and in our faces and to act as if it didnt exist would be to ignore reality
2381415 facebook may have the superior technology but it doesnt have the users in germany
2381416 colleagues beginning today we are adopting an inquirer first policy for our signature investigative reporting enterprise trend stories news features and reviews of all sorts what that means is that we wont post those stories online until theyre in print well cooperate with philly com as we do now in preparing extensive online packages to accompany our enterprising work but well make the decision to press the button on the online packages only when readers are able to pick up the inquirer on their doorstep or on the newsstand
2381417 for our bloggers especially this may require a bit of an adjustment some of you like to try out ideas that end up as subjects of stories or columns in print first if in doubt consult your editor or me or chris krewson

2381446 shine the spotlight on game developers who are seeking new possibilities of expression through the medium of games and will serve as a vehicle for a new style of presentation that broadens the possibilities of games
2381447 the games that we are looking forward to considering for presentation will be demos of prototypes games with experimental elements that have already been released or that are planned for release and games developed by students who have hit upon something out of the ordinary
2381448 there will be no distinctions made whatsoever between professionals and amateurs we welcome submissions of games created by small venture businesses as well as doujin games developed by individuals
2381449 i think publishers have concluded the only games that work are the surefire 500 million box office kind of games like spider man and shrek the transformers game really surprised people how well it did but the movie was big i dont think they expected the dark knight movie to be this big

2381460 nu sint un dragomirolog sa spun asa nu urmaresc intimplarile vietii domnului dragomir si nu stiu daca asta este expresia unei negocieri reale pe care a avut o sau doar asa o vorba zisa la televizor dar pentru ca domnul dragomir s a plimbat pe sticla televizorului ore intregi fara ca partidul sa aiba o reactie ferma in aceasta privinta eu am reactionat si am spus ca deja ma simt in situatia in care trebuie sa ma delimitez fie si de o asemenea intentie ma delimitez ferm in sensul ca nu vad nici o posibilitate de cooperare cu nici o formatiune politica ce are in componenta pe cineva ca mitica dragomir

2381462 preseason is really important to me like all these guys
2381463 were working hard and this is where you get better
2381464 we will just have to keep working on all the areas that we have identified that need improvement a lot of guys got playing time some guys got quite a bit
2381465 i dont think it is very different than the other positions
2381466 sometimes the player doesnt have the opportunity to be productive on a particular play whether that is because of what the other team is doing or maybe because of another breakdown
2381467 then there are other times when he does in the end the bottom line is how do you feel the players production on any given play is rated toward the potential or what he could have done or he should have been able to do in that particular situation
2381468 im sure the next time he gets an opportunity to play he will try to take some of the experiences he had last night and build off those
2381469 i think every day is important whether its a game or practice or a meeting
2381470 its definitely a new experience but i was prepared to play well by the coaches
2381471 you just have to come back next week watch some film try to get better and move on
2381472 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2381473 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2381474 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2381475 and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2381476 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2381477 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2381478 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2381479 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2381480 i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame
2381481 i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm johns conduct has done to us think also about the real harm that the present voyeurism does and give me and my family the privacy we need at this time
2381482 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2381483 used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it
2381484 mad she was angry furious would be a good way to describe it
2381485 she should not be involved in protecting me from whatever the consequences of this are
2381486 my lord and my wife have forgiven me and so im going to move on i think our marriage will not only survive it will be strong
2381487 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2381488 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2381489 help two friends and former colleagues rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to move forward on their own
2381490 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2381491 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2381492 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2381493 its guaranteed to cleanse the body and clear the mind
2381494 i wanted to project this happy family image to friends and neighbours but they all knew
2381495 we had no money because he spent it on drink i never knew what to expect when he walked through the door
2381496 my husband only ever admitted having one drink the trust was non existent
2381497 people think they are protecting the children from the drinking
2381498 my mother was heartbroken and baffled by my drinking she aged 10 years i felt guilt shame and self hatred but it only made me drink more
2381499 you have to accept that neither you nor anyone else can make someone stop drinking harmfully but you can help them to make changes
2381500 i cant control it i cant cure it i didnt cause it
2381501 its a very special car for customers who want to take the bespoke experience to a higher level
2381502 we should be deeply concerned that with less than two years to go before our deadline for universal access the g8 has committed little more than a third of the resources that it has promised to deliver by 2010
2381503 what we have is the sense of real slippage that well you know it may not be 2010 and it probably will be 2015 as if that doesnt matter
2381504 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2381505 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2381506 it appears that for people who have a certain genetic make up the initial physical reaction to smoking can play a significant role in determining what happens next
2381507 if cigarette smoking is sustained nicotine addiction can occur in a few days to a few months the finding of a genetic association with pleasurable early smoking experiences may help explain how people get addicted
2381508 being involved with this work isnt like the normal doctor patient relationship its more like a friendship
2381509 everythings expensive now tortilla tomatoes eggs chicken milk rice cooking oil everything

2381771 there was plenty of drama in the narrative of the attack and the best candidates brought this out
2381772 although these figures are pleasing the overall pass rate was still only 66 per cent an increase on the results for previous years but a clear indicator that the exam continues to be a challenging test candidates who were successful in all four parts of the exam can be rightly proud of their achievements
2381773 the compass stable of three magazines have a political edge that is unusual in regional magazine publishing
2381774 our readers respond to the editorial content in great numbers and the magazine along with its sister titles in hampshire and dorset strikes a chord with the emotions frustrations and aspirations of the demographic in the communities they serve
2381775 we cant succeed in afghanistan or secure our homeland unless we change our pakistan policy
2381776 face mounting popular opposition in a nuclear armed nation at the nexus of terror and radical islam
2381777 we must strengthen local tribes in the border areas who are willing to fight the foreign terrorists there the strategy used successfully in anbar and elsewhere in iraq and we must empower the new civilian government of pakistan to defeat radicalism with greater support for development health and education
2381778 the u s should support the people who are in office today if we fail the alternative is the happy go lucky mullahs

2381784 and i want to spend some time with those children as well
2381785 we had a very long primary we had the longest primary in history and so i can imagine folks need a break from politics
2381786 i think that the majority of people had been fed a constant stream of political chatter and i am sure that having a couple of weeks off and enjoying the olympics is probably what the doctor ordered for everybody
2381787 im going to go body surfing at an undisclosed location im going to see my tutu my grandmother im going to watch my girls play on the beach
2381788 its that spirit that im convinced is what america is looking for right now
2381789 the national enquirer is not well regarded as a news source by the news media
2381790 we began pursuing the story soon after it first appeared but the standard for proof in this kind of intimate behavior is and should be very high
2381791 better to get it right even if we couldnt get it first
2381792 i think the mainstream news media were responsible for not airing it and not printing it earlier there really wasnt anything to report
2381793 if the story were false it would be a tremendously hurtful thing for his family and professionally lethal to him

2381811 jerusalem will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
2381812 not only do we get impaired drivers but we get wanted people
2381813 we get felons we get people that are in possession of drugs you name it we run across it when we run a dwi checkpoint
2381814 we just broke down in tears because they took everything
2381815 everything down to the kids book bags theres nothing else to explain the feeling it was just heartbreaking
2381816 on the exterior of the building theres been no signs of forced entry indicating either someone was staying inside the building or someones very familiar with the building
2381817 im pretty sure they want us to get some security before they donate again they dont want us to load up the building with good stuff so people can come and take it
2381818 no matter how small a space might be there were always gardens
2381819 i just came out and lifted it one day the whole plant
2381820 but i have only one left they dont like the day lilies though the root is too bitter
2381821 i love them because they bloom from early spring to freeze and because they make so many people happy
2381822 if you give someone roses their expression just lights up their face
2381823 had access to the banned drug and had explained the context under which it was received
2381824 i feel a great weight has been lifted by cooperating
2381825 we will go to trial we await the formalities but given the cooperation we expect a reduction in accordance with the code
2381826 if is possible we will try to transfer alessandro to the trento hospital today by helicopter
2381827 only after alessandro is seen by the trento hospital primary doctor will we know when alessandro will be back to races
2381828 thats only something for the media and the public but its never been one of my personal goals to finish within the top 15 on my first tour de france on the other hand is something that makes me very happy and proud nobody expected this of me except of course cofidis manager eric boyer and my trainer who knew that i could perform this way
2381829 since last winter i have been preparing and concentrating solely on the tour it was a bit risky but it worked out so i came here feeling fresh and the more experienced people told me that thats what makes the difference in the last ten days
2381830 even in the last time trial i still had some energy im surprised at myself but at the same time i think that all my preparation and work just pays off
2381831 i told my parents i want to ride the bike for six months flat out to see if i can get a pro contract i had already been in the french national team the year before but becoming a pro cyclist really was my dream it helped that i already had my university degree
2381832 i worked two years for the team without any personal agenda it was just about gaining experience and power on some bigger races like the tour de romandie the tours of germany and poland last year i started getting some results i won a stage at the route du sud where there were four climbs in one day i passed guys like sevilla and mancebo so i started getting more and more confidence in my abilities
2381833 i was never center stage always in the second ranks in the shadow of others still i earned a spot in the national team for the world championships
2381834 its very exciting for me and my family only a few people ever get this chance
2381835 hey look at how fucking stupid and out of control i am

2381839 mossad provoked americas air strike on libya in 1986 by making it appear that terrorist orders were being transmitted from the libyan government to its embassies
2381840 not easy to deal with a hot tempered type who spoke aggressively to the prime minister he had the feeling that he was going to save the negev and the homeland but was not getting the response he deserved
2381841 i took a negative view of creating a zone like this of any kind
2381842 the sponsors wanted to create an island which would be free of all the countrys laws that contradicted our basic approach which espoused the homogeneity of the system we rejected the idea outright
2381843 one day i was summoned urgently to the office of yitzhak rabin
2381844 i was wearing a plain shirt i had no idea i would be called in to the prime minister i found a few american investors there all wearing suits and ties who had arrived on a private flight from new york and were going back that same day they wanted to know why i had written what i had written
2381845 i explained to them that a zone of the kind they wanted was suitable for backward countries but not for a developed country like israel i told them that in the end the zone would become a money laundering center and that no one apart from lawyers would make a profit from it
2381846 because they promised 20 000 new jobs from the point of view of the negev that could have been a welcome change
2381847 we did everything except to lie down in front of the prime ministers door
2381848 with this track we have the opportunity to assist and approach the entrepreneurs in the belief that they are not out to cheat anyone we must not take a narrow view of the sponsors because only an entrepreneur who makes a profit is one from whom we can later demand that he improve the workers wages
2381849 if these investors and capitalists make a profit and dont pay taxes on it whats wrong with that its true that they will make a profit but i dont begrudge them that profit
2381850 but that would have created serious distortions in the economy and would have put our reputation at risk and created a tax haven
2381851 the initial idea for the project came from a warm jewish heart
2381852 but when they started making more and more demands we said enough there is a line we mustnt cross even if the price is the salvation of the negev anyway its far from certain that the negev would have been saved
2381853 my ties with silverstein grew closer when i tried to get shochat to give the matter second and third thought and to give the free trade zone a chance
2381854 i love the project and what happened just made me eat my heart
2381855 if a free trade zone is such a great idea why not do it throughout the country and then who will pay taxes
2381856 i didnt touch the subject during my period as cabinet secretary
2381857 barak examined the subject with all kinds of confidants and also talked to me about it i told him that i was vehemently against it
2381858 silverstein gave me speeches from which i understood that he had better investment potential in other parts of the world
2381859 he presented a zionist aspect i supported the idea because i thought i had to find an opening anywhere we had an opportunity for thousands of jobs
2381860 i tried to persuade him not to despair and to keep the ember burning
2381861 weve learned something dont try to do business in israel certainly dont do business with the government because youll get killed im never going to do this again the sad thing is that this has turned off so many potential american businessmen from doing business in israel and thats a tragedy

2381875 what is the point then of reuniting if it causes so much pain
2381876 wouldnt it be better to leave well enough alone if knowing your mother causes you so much pain you said yourself that you cannot regain your lost years so why do you try why not focus on your present blessings
2381877 downtown norwich was done a grievous disservice in the late 1960s when then state sen bill stanleys proposal to bring route 2 through norwich was defeated by the city council in 5 4 vote had that 65 million proposal been enacted downtown likely would not have suffered the severe economic downturn that saw stores close and the downtown all but die for the last quarter of the 20th century

2381884 jesus jesus kingdom of god revealed love is the way we follow each day and in him all is healed
2381885 we post modern emergent hipsters we take some grief from people because we have a shtick but the point is 100 years ago those preachers had a shtick too
2381886 were just saying lets embrace it lets have fun with it

2381889 we have requested law enforcement agencies to be alert for any buses being operated by angel tours or iguala busmex since they are not authorized to operate legally
2381890 if found on the road we want law enforcement to immediately stop and place the vehicles out of service
2381891 when students are engaged its going to make them want to learn and if they want to learn well get the desired outcomes we want as a district
2381892 with cloud computer looming on the horizon it is important for us all to think of the privacy threats there as well
2381893 the tool resides with someone else and the data is stored somewhere else generally that is a bad idea
2381894 when information is in the public domain it is game over
2381895 information on your computer may get protection under the law but on someone elses it gets less protection
2381896 the information we are all giving to online companies is massive and dangerous and its going to get worse before it gets better
2381897 giving them our data is a clear and present risk
2381898 how hard would it be to target someone as a political activist or a person with aids

2381903 en los entrenamientos trabajamos generalmente sobre nosotros mismos y del rival hacemos algo m s espec fico el d a anterior y el mismo d a del partido esto es lo que vamos a hacer con grecia l gicamente cosas nuestras que estamos trabajando nos sirven para grecia y para todo
2381904 lo que todav a no s como solucionar es el d a de alemania porque si tenemos que hablar el d a anterior y el d a del partido no vamos a tener que levantar a las cuatro de la ma ana porque es la primera vez que vamos a jugar a las nueve
2381905 somos conscientes de que lo estamos haciendo bien y de que lo hemos hecho bien pero tenemos que hacerlo bien de ahora en adelante y a n as est la dificultad de los rivales el primer rival grecia es indiscutiblemente muy dif cil
2381906 lo estoy viviendo como lo tiene que vivir un entrenador ocupado en su equipo y en los rivales con la m xima ilusi n y sabiendo que tenemos detr s a toda espa a y que el momento del baloncesto espa ol es bueno pero hay que refrendarlo con hechos no con palabras
2381907 este equipo tiene calidad el momento del baloncesto espa ol es muy bueno y hay mucha calidad vamos a intentar aprovechar esta calidad para poder seguir diciendo lo mismo despu s de los juegos porque sabemos que las cosas hay que demostrarlas haci ndolas no habl ndolas
2381908 son muy listos jugando son muy vivos ese tipo de jugador que est pendiente de todo se desenvuelven en ese nivel especialmente dimitris diamantidis y theodoros papalukas luego tienen jugadores muy grandes que son tiradores de fuera eso nos crea problemas ese juego inteligente y los apoyos que tienen en ioanis burusis costas tsartsaris y antonis fotsis capaces de defender dentro y tirar desde el per metro hace m s peligrosos a los exteriores
2381909 es cierto que espa a gan a grecia en madrid con muchas dificultades en la semifinal del europeo a falta de tres minutos bamos perdiendo ellos adem s de la preparaci n han tenido competici n el preol mpico lo que han demostrado lo han demostrado en competici n oficial y nosotros en amistosos
2381910 se puede contar con todos los jugadores ya que algunos que han tenido alg n problema muscular como ra l l pez o alg n problema articular como juan carlos navarro est n bien
2381911 hemos llegado al nivel que quer amos eso ahora hay que demostrarlo pero es el nivel que quer amos para empezar los juegos el primer partido de una competici n tiene un plus de mentalidad m s dif cil es muy importante el resultado pero hay que convenir que queremos seguir mejorando durante los juegos y que el primer objetivo es clasificarnos entre los cuatro primeros descargamos la tensi n en cada partido individual no ser igual si alcanzamos los cruces

2381961 agriculture products here in the state of iowa can feed the world and were not afraid to compete with anybody

2381978 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
2381979 rebuilding what has fallen apart is centrally the process of rebuilding relational spaces that hold things together
2381980 was unable to obtain useful results with either no 4 or no 5

2381988 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2381989 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2381990 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2381991 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2381992 its all about corporate dollars if you dont have corporate partners i dont care who you are youre not going to participate in this sport its just not going to happen
2381993 and were looking at kids to put in these late models
2381994 for the african american kid im looking at putting in my late model im going to have to pay for it out of my own pocket
2381995 whats going to get marc in a cup car has nothing to do with the color of his skin
2381996 it has to do with his ability to drive the car his ability to generate money to sell products for sponsors and his ability to have a pleasant attitude and be a good everyday person
2381997 who have raced together all their lives both of them seeming to succeed at every level
2381998 so what i want to know and everybody else wants to know is if not now when
2381999 since we started the program with reggie white weve been careful not to push guys
2382000 you could do more damage if you push guys quick
2382001 its true he has been in bigger cars for a while longer than i have and my learning curve is a little longer than his
2382002 but theyre a helluva lot farther ahead of the game than what 90 percent of people go through
2382003 but im talking about how much money it cost to get him here
2382004 i would say its probably been more than 2 million and 2 million now wont do it
2382005 i would say theres a possibility he could run something part time in nationwide in the fall
2382006 next year were trying to look at trucks as a great spot for him
2382007 and all the work thats gone into trying to create inclusiveness
2382008 in fairness i think our progress nascar the sport and nascar the sanctioning body should be measured on our commitment to the drive for diversity
2382009 i was ready to punch the first m who looked at me wrong
2382010 that took him completely aback because he knew i was a promoter and he figured that would get a tremendous amount of ink
2382011 the voice said if you let that blankity blank race in the 600 youre dead
2382012 even in the 80s things could still get out of hand particularly around a nascar track
2382013 one of the things that always concerned me when we had a race was somebody a fan in the infield taking a potshot at a driver with a rifle
2382014 there was an uproar among about a hundred fans who stormed a fence surrounding the track some of them chanting go home nigger
2382015 if you start or end your sentence with the n word that makes it racial
2382016 the reality is it had nothing to do with winning the race it had nothing to do with losing it
2382017 one of the things we find is that a lot of times the consumers dont know there is a minority driver
2382018 chase austin is that he has the charisma he keeps his nose clean hes a clean cut good kid whos doing something great
2382019 youve got this little window dressing operation and its not cutting it its a mannequin
2382020 i mean we had nothing before this at least is something
2382021 the only way this thing is going to work is to get the diversity drivers in cars like bandoleros and legends at an early age
2382022 a few of them will come out of it to the major leagues
2382023 when we do theres going to be a lewis hamilton in there
2382024 increasing the number of families who participate in youth racing
2382025 were building partnerships with the world karting association 600 racing wheelers association for bandoleros and legends cars and the quarter midget association of america to invite more kids in including minority kids
2382026 and then we went out to see some of the summer shootout
2382027 you buy a pair of shorts and a pair of tennis shoes he needs a baseball glove
2382028 heck id like to see nascar go out and sponsor five teams that have african american drivers
2382029 for the competitors who have spent their years toiling in this sport trying to participate in this sport struggling in this sport going in and out of this sport
2382030 the biggest thing nascar can do is continue to try to grow the grassroots programs that give people an opportunity at an early age to get involved
2382031 and all the other sanctioning bodies in racing have always kind of taken the attitude of this is america were open well welcome everybody into it but were not going to give anybody anything
2382032 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2382033 i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2382034 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public
2382035 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly but that misconduct took place for a short period in 2006 it ended then
2382036 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2382037 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2382038 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2382039 a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2382040 i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame the toll on our family of news helicopters over our house and reporters in our driveway is yet unknown
2382041 but now the truth is out and the repair work that began in 2006 will continue
2382042 people put time and energy and money and their loyalty into this campaign and for

2382052 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars

2382054 georgian military forces completely control all the territory of south ossetia
2382055 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2382056 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
2382057 there was pressure for all of us but for her it was even harder
2382058 im sorry but the chinese press is putting a lot of pressure on chinese athletes
2382059 she did a fantastic job im so proud of her
2382060 it was spectacular really unbelievable we liked it a lot
2382061 the heavy presence of chinese peoples liberation army officers throughout the proceedings left many wondering exactly what image the hosts were intending to project to the international community

2382065 in the fall of 2003 after the world learned there were no wmd as habbush had foretold the white house ordered the cia to carry out a deception
2382066 the mission was carried out the letter was created popped up in baghdad and roiled the global newcycles in december 2003 conning even venerable journalists with tom brokaw the mission is a statutory violation of the charter of cia and amendments added in 1991 prohibiting cia from conducting disinformation campaigns on u s soil
2382067 i dont think people are looking at it too narrowly or suskind is when i read his book
2382068 thats where nixon had a problem for telling the cia to block the fbi for part of the watergate investigation
2382069 asteptam sa vedem cu ce contribuie guvernul si apoi vom decide ce fonduri alocam si noi
2382070 am primit ajutor de la timis in jur de un milion de lei dar si de la cluj constanta sau arges pentru ca sint in jur de 100 de case care au fost distruse de inundatii si vor trebui refacute ne am gindit sa cumparam pentru aceste familii 100 de frigidere si 100 de aragazuri le vom da in momentul in care vor fi terminate lucrarile si se vor muta in casa noua
2382071 s au executat pina acum lucrari de reabilitare respectiv realizarea in fatada de est a unei intrari directe pentru subsolul salii realizarea colonadei in fatada de vest si si a doua cosuri de ventilatie a beciului cit si lucrari de consolidare la coltul de sud est apoi s a desfacut bolta cilindrica pe latura nordica si estica si s a realizat refacerea acestor bolti respectiv inlocuirea pietrei degradate
2382072 lucrarile de drenaj nu s au facut bine au fost niste greseli in urma cu citiva ani si trebuie reluate iar tabla zincata nu a mai fost schimbata din 1960 in conditiile in care garantia ei este de 30 de ani
2382073 lucrarile grosiere care au fost lucrari de amploare de baza si absolut necesare s au facut o biserica precum trei ierarhi nu este insa ca o vila pe care o faci in trei luni este mai usor de construit din temelii decit de restaurat
2382074 in prezent sint bani de la oficiul national al monumentelor istorice printr un protocol cu inspectoratul de stat in constructii respectiv 300 000 lei noi bani care nu pot fi insa folositi decit pentru consolidarea acoperisului deoarece pot fi folositi doar pentru lucrari de consolidare
2382075 sint deja vreo 35 000 de ron neplatiti pentru lucrarile de consolidare si alte lucrari pe care le am realizat pina acum la sala gotica
2382076 stiu ca exista vointa domnului primar ca lucrurile sa fie derulate in cel mai bun mod cu putinta
2382077 in ipoteza ca se va rezolva cu fondurile pentru restaurarea pietrei lucrarile vor mai dura aproximativ doi ani
2382078 i think its the meanest thing that could ever have happened to her
2382079 adding garbage to garbage i just dont understand how someone who professes to love somebody can do this
2382080 although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him
2382081 you know what shes still really bright and i still have a lot of respect for her
2382082 my heart goes out to her she shouldnt have to deal with this after all she has been through from the loss of her son wade to her brave battle against cancer
2382083 i dont think its anyone elses business whats going on in their marriage
2382084 i feel for elizabeth edwards and i also feel that shes the only person allowed to make any judgment in this situation
2382085 just because there has been an affair doesnt mean you dont have a strong marriage
2382086 marriages survive infidelity when both decide to repair and forgive
2382087 ok tell reporters its none of their business but dont lie
2382088 is he lying about the baby being his as well
2382089 this informs what cate will know about relationships with men
2382090 it informs how she will deal with her own relationships with men
2382091 what amazes me is that he doesnt see how this action is going to reverberate not only through his marriage now its going to touch his kids forever

2382101 from the front of the bus to the back of the bus
2382102 if we can go down the road in sequential order its a lot easier to locate
2382103 theres nothing more frustrating that having somebody call 911 for a house fire or emergency whether it be for fire or ems and not being able to locate the house
2382104 we go door to door to every home to make sure they have their address posted correctly so 911 can find them as quickly as possible
2382105 they have 30 days to post them we do have a civil penalty of 50 dollars a day
2382106 we were on the right road but because their house wasnt numbered and 2 or 3 houses on the same road werent numbered it took an extended amount of time to get there
2382107 no it needs to be studied we need an environmental impact report eir and we need to know what the affect will be on the black nosed bottle snails sexual performance before any actual drilling can take place or even any exploration or any talking about drilling which would of course upset the mating rhythms of the american leftist pinkoids and should be the focus of a separate eir

2382116 really make it impossible to preach the whole counsel of god
2382117 weve been in broadcasting for over 45 years so we remember what it was like under the previous regime of the so called fairness doctrine
2382118 what we had to do then would be impossible today
2382119 if someone were to assert that god has ordained marriage as only between a man and woman that would be a controversial statement today
2382120 a newspaper can print a reply or an op ed piece but with broadcasting its fixed its 24 hours that are divisible into so many minutes and if youre devoting them to x you cant devote them to y
2382121 if a broadcaster has to subsidize its opponents and the station is listener funded theyre going to lose a lot of money
2382122 crushing the immigration bill had the feeling of a sort of crusade
2382123 its not free speech we dont support it and most people on the left dont support it
2382124 the bottom line is that we need to get better at talk radio

2382131 they understand that america is a melting pot and they appreciate that tyson recognizes this with its employees
2382132 the history of the labor movement tells us that unions are at their strongest when theyre most inclusive
2382133 that means making it our business to stand up to win respect for every workers right to practice their faith

2382141 for fuel prices to rival repaying a home loan as a major financial consideration shows just how much the cost of petrol has factored into australian household budgets
2382142 thankfully prices have come down with the global price of oil dropping in recent weeks but the steep cost of petrol is now firmly in the australian financial psyche
2382143 the australian economy has certainly slowed down and the pressure will be on the rba and the banks to reduce rates in the next few months
2382144 based on our review we believe our investment in aol may be impaired after consideration of the duration of the impairment as well as the reasons for any decline in value and the potential recovery period we do not believe that such impairment is other than temporary
2382145 we explored options on checks for two b 737 400 aircraft once space became available at our tullamarine facility a decision was taken to have the work done there
2382146 now is the time qantas should sit down with us to commit now to maintaining maintenance operations onshore
2382147 and to move off the path of cost cutting and any further possibilities of further job reductions in their maintenance and engineering area
2382148 all the highlights were rectified to the satisfaction of the qantas team before aircraft delivery to australia
2382149 with regards to the string of faults that were reported in the media malaysia airlines investigated and established that these were unsubstantiated

2382176 there are an amazing amount of things that we could see by watching the traffic go by
2382177 we were saying there are so many of them they are everywhere

2382183 researchers have long wanted to find a way to move a patients disease into the test tube to develop cells that could be cultured into the many tissues relevant to diseases of the blood the brain and the heart for example
2382184 now we have a way to do just that to derive pluripotent cells from patients with disease which means the cells can make any tissue and can grow forever
2382185 this enables us to model thousands of conditions using classical cell culture techniques

2382190 i was awed by the group of 20 teens who rose at 4 a m and hiked 17 kilometers much of it uphill to participate in a carpentry class at the new mayan center despite the effort at the days end they were reluctant to stop planing and sawing the wood for the beds they would finish building the next day

2382192 country churches back in the 1920s and 1930s were not real fancy
2382193 early pentecostals were concerned with spreading the gospel and sending missionaries out and telling people about jesus they were practical rather than concerned about leaving an architectural legacy
2382194 early believers were committed to the idea that christ could come back at any moment it seemed logical to them that the best investment that would not be eaten up by moths or rust would be in souls not fancy buildings
2382195 i dont think they were christmas and easter attenders they wouldve attended fairly regularly and they knew the preacher fairly well

2382198 we believe that ot 730 may represent a significant advance in terms of patient safety in the treatment of glaucoma
2382199 all of the current drug therapies for glaucoma on the market today have side effects some potentially life threatening ot 730 has been specifically designed as a prodrug to deliver a potent beta blocker locally within the eye but then rapidly break down to inactive metabolites upon entry into the systemic circulation our goal in clinical trials will be to compare its iop lowering effect against timolol the most prescribed ocular beta blocker and to determine its effects if any on cardiovascular and pulmonary function we believe that unique safety profile could ultimately position it as a leading monotherapy or in combination with other classes of drugs for use in glaucoma patients

2382287 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2382288 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2382289 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2382290 and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2382291 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2382292 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2382293 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2382294 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2382295 i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame
2382296 i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm johns conduct has done to us think also about the real harm that the present voyeurism does and give me and my family the privacy we need at this time
2382297 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2382298 used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it
2382299 mad she was angry furious would be a good way to describe it
2382300 she should not be involved in protecting me from whatever the consequences of this are
2382301 my lord and my wife have forgiven me and so im going to move on i think our marriage will not only survive it will be strong
2382302 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2382303 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2382304 help two friends and former colleagues rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to move forward on their own
2382305 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2382306 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2382307 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it

2382323 aside from the face what body part best gives away what emotions someone is experiencing
2382324 the bank thought it financed an electric power station but in fact financed a brothel
2382325 its often more politically viable to fund programs for women and children and youth
2382326 everything you can say about china is true somewhere in china
2382327 you should believe this proposition because we tend to be right
2382328 you should believe this proposition because we say you should
2382329 a major problem with this view is that if the church has believed itself to be infallible and it tends to get its beliefs right then it is probable that it got its belief about its infallibility right

2382345 macar o parte din bani sa fie folositi pina la sfirsitul anului si sa fie lansata licitatia de executie guvernul aloca banii dar cei care deruleaza proiectul trebuie sa se ocupe de gestionarea lor
2382346 asta s ar putea face in etapa actuala pentru ca vor veni bani de la guvern 77 de milioane de lei dar lucrurile grele incep dupa aceea in evaluare sint mentionate si constructii de cladiri pentru statia meteo sau pentru unitatea militara dar ca sa faci asemenea lucrari trebuie sa faci proiect si sa parcurgi toate etapele de licitatie ceea ce ia timp nu ne putem misca in acest proiect din cauza acestor cladiri pista nu poti sa o incepi pina nu le construiesti celor de acolo cladirile in alte parti

2382362 i dont think its going to be won by one under par
2382363 i just need to make sure that i stay around where i am and maybe a little closer to par thats going to have a chance on sunday
2382364 i hit some extremely good golf shots where you just throw your hands up in the air and say shoot what can i do
2382365 its one of the hardest golf courses ive ever played there are a lot of holes where birdies arent in the cards theyre accidental
2382366 i i dont understand when people are going around worrying about we need to have english only they they wanna pass a law we want just uh we want english only no i agree that immigrants should learn english i agree with that
2382367 you know its embarrassing its embarrassing when when uh when europeans come over here they all speak english they speak french they speak german and then we go over to europe all we can say is merci beaucoup right
2382368 we unreservedly apologise both to him and to his family for making this distressing allegation and for breaching his privacy
2382369 if a cricketer for instance suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat which he could do very easily i mean are you going to ban cricket bats
2382370 deaf if you are near there no wonder you are deaf
2382371 are you sure you want to go through with this
2382372 if you stay here much longer you will go home with slitty eyes
2382373 first thing we should do in this new society is kill all the lawyers
2382374 out beyond ideas of right doing and wrong doing there is a field
2382375 quality of life thing from the way i look at it binary perspectives are essentially boring and monochromatic and you end up having the same old boring as hell conversations re irony
2382376 im a nikehead i wear chains that excite the feds
2382377 coca cola is no longer the most popular soft drink in the country
2382378 the operating system for marketers is now fundamentally changing it doesnt matter how big your market share is today if your product and your marketing are optimized for the older model you will be defeated by the relentless tide of the new marketing and the products and services that are designed for it
2382379 wars and elections are both too big and too small to matter in the long run the daily work that goes on it adds up
2382380 czemu nikt wcze niej nie wyja ni mi tego w tak klarowny spos b
2382381 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with senator obama than senator mccain
2382382 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2382383 senator obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2382384 most likely evolution would be unreliable in equipping us to think rationally about anything
2382385 most likely evolution would be unreliable in equipping us to think about complicated metaphysical ethical and epistemological issues
2382386 bisher l uft alles nach plan der vierer zeigt sich in ordentlicher form und max ist immer f r eine berraschung gut
2382387 es bringt nichts sich lange vorher verr ckt zu machen am renntag muss es kribbeln dann wirds gut ansonsten verkrampft man im vorfeld viel zu sehr
2382388 wir haben in altlanta und sydney auch schon den kompletten vorbereitungszyklus zuhause abgeschlossen und uns f r eine sp te anreise entschieden never change a winning system
2382389 wir sind weltmeister und waren in diesem jahr trotz umbesetzung auf anhieb vize europameister damit haben wir nat rlich schon den anspruch um eine medaille mitzufahren
2382390 okay so youre probably going is this like a noxzema commercial or what but seriously i actually have a way normal life for a teenage girl
2382391 for a few customers the atom 500 will be the ultimate expression of lightweight performance
2382392 and represents the outer limits of what is achievable in a road registered car we also use this sort of project to explore the possibilities of how we can improve our standard cars
2382393 driving the r8 is like smearing honey into keira knightly
2382394 in principle this car is too fast for my thoughts
2382395 we strongly advise you not to travel to the regions of south ossetia abkhazia and the pankisi gorge north of akhmeta because of the threat of terrorist and criminal activity related to local separatist movements
2382396 serious fighting has broken out in south ossetia and tensions remain high in other separatist regions the situation could deteriorate further without warning
2382397 the true measure of education is not what you know but how you decide to share what you know with others
2382398 we have a banking crisis and an agency crisis and a mortgage crisis and a coming credit card crisis weve never seen anything like that before and it all seems to be coming home to roost at the same time thats never happened either
2382399 but we did not even have credit cards in the 1930s there were no such thing as student loans
2382400 what ive said is that im playing the hand that was dealt and that my responsibility is to protect the u s economy and the american people
2382401 she has decided that she will need a few more weeks than originally planned to be ready for her return to the stage
2382402 they gave us a great game yesterday a 4 0 pickering win thursday and gave us another great game today friday
2382403 theyre a great team to play against it feels great to win that one
2382404 all i was thinking is all i want to do is get a single and do anything to help my team out
2382405 it just so happened that i got a good pitch i was able to get a hold of it and it went off with a bang
2382406 she elizabeth was mad she was angry i think furious would be a good way to describe it
2382407 were all first year juniors and not many teams knew whom we were coming in here
2382408 all i wanted to do was push that ball to the outfield and score that run
2382409 my defence is strong and i rely on that a lot
2382410 jacoby said the vehicles produced in chattanooga will be offered in gasoline hybrid and diesel versions
2382411 im not going to be the vice presidential nominee or vice president im going to help sen mccain get elected as governor of louisiana let me be clear i have said in every private and public conversation ive got the job that i want
2382412 you are to distinguish between the holy and the common and between the unclean and the clean
2382413 tom brings a unique and wide ranging skill set to our european clients and to our u s clients with interests in europe
2382414 with diverse experience in market regulation structured finance banking funds insolvency and litigation arising out of these areas he is an ideal complement to our london team
2382415 we began pursuing the story soon after it first appeared but the standard for proof in this kind of intimate behavior is and should be very high
2382416 better to get it right even if we couldnt get it first
2382417 i think the mainstream news media were responsible for not airing it and not printing it earlier there really wasnt anything to report
2382418 if the story were false it would be a tremendously hurtful thing for his family and professionally lethal to him
2382419 you are kind of like a doctor you have to be available
2382420 to watch kids live and die its a very emotional job
2382421 john mcney is always steering us in the right direction
2382422 hes been around a long time and understands health care
2382423 most hospitals have had small legal departments and outsourced legal work
2382424 what used to be sleepy legal departments are much more active
2382425 great boss who is very easy to work for and very supportive
2382426 the general rule is most kids are healthy but when theyre sick theyre really sick
2382427 we look for lawyers with a specialty in a very narrow field and stick with them forever
2382428 is a very soft spoken self effacing modest understated guy who is extremely bright and extremely knowledgeable in the health care area
2382429 i hope the board of cook realizes the jewel that they have in john because he is not a self promoter
2382430 john is much more likely to get his hands dirty and get down to nitty gritty issues
2382431 texas had a reputation for lots of litigation and very high judgments
2382432 it was very difficult to keep doctors on staff they would go to other states
2382433 its still the duty of the medical profession to reduce errors and improve quality of care
2382434 part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam
2382435 like it would have crossed our minds to let up on the guy just because hes on vacation
2382436 it literally is the same old democratic consultant driven politics
2382437 its the same attempt not to tell a story about the country and the other guy but to prove youre right like an academic debating seminar
2382438 both the american and british forces guaranteed to me they knew what they were doing and i made the mistake of listening to them
2382439 the third invasion has been called off even if a proxy can be found to start it
2382440 i know its an old lament at this point but it never ceases to amaze me how in the course of less than a decade
2382441 the philosophy of failure the creed of ignorance and the gospel of envy
2382442 barbara was shocked that sherri would say she needs to be saved shes dumbfounded by the stupid things that keep coming out of sherris mouth
2382443 and after hearing what she said to a christian magazine word came back from barbara that she wants to boot her off the show
2382444 barbara thinks sherri has become far worse of a problem than star jones and rosies odonnel when they were on the show and thats saying a lot
2382445 barbara may first give her a chance to shape up before shipping her out
2382446 and if barbara does let sherri go expect a fun farewell with the whole gang saying only nice things about sherri in public
2382447 there is no possibility of sherri or anybody else on that cast getting fired
2382448 i am going to see my grandma who i havent seen in almost 18 19 months and whos getting to the age that i want to make sure i am spending time with her on a consistent basis and so she can see her great grandchildren
2382449 and i want to spend some time with those children as well
2382450 we had a very long primary we had the longest primary in history and so i can imagine folks need a break from politics
2382451 i think that the majority of people had been fed a constant stream of political chatter and i am sure that having a couple of weeks off and enjoying the olympics is probably what the doctor ordered for everybody
2382452 im going to go body surfing at an undisclosed location im going to see my tutu my grandmother im going to watch my girls play on the beach
2382453 its that spirit that im convinced is what america is looking for right now
2382454 tailandia advierte les a sus habitantes sobre el peligro de los juegos
2382455 as long as he has a hard cock and knows how to lick my pussy
2382456 what would the world be like if nobody did a job they didnt want to do
2382457 in an area of the state that is usually as talented as any in the country here is yet another prospect who will be one of the best in the country when the process is completed in february of 2009
2382458 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
2382459 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
2382460 we call on russia to cease air and missile attacks on georgia respect its territorial integrity and withdraw the ground combat forces from georgian soil
2382461 the us is working actively with its european partners to launch international mediation we urgently seek russias support of these efforts
2382462 we underscore the international communitys support for georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders as articulated in numerous un security council resolutions
2382463 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful

2382465 does ne one know the song amp atrist for the summer cbs studios promo of csi u can listen 2 it under videos at www cbs com or at www grissomsararomance com under ssn 7 btk1 clips called cbs studios promo under the summer promos much appretiated if found b c ive been looking all year thanx
2382466 to explain to the man on the street that we know what we are doing there
2382467 its all about corporate dollars if you dont have corporate partners i dont care who you are youre not going to participate in this sport its just not going to happen
2382468 and were looking at kids to put in these late models
2382469 for the african american kid im looking at putting in my late model im going to have to pay for it out of my own pocket
2382470 whats going to get marc in a cup car has nothing to do with the color of his skin
2382471 it has to do with his ability to drive the car his ability to generate money to sell products for sponsors and his ability to have a pleasant attitude and be a good everyday person
2382472 who have raced together all their lives both of them seeming to succeed at every level
2382473 so what i want to know and everybody else wants to know is if not now when
2382474 since we started the program with reggie white weve been careful not to push guys
2382475 you could do more damage if you push guys quick
2382476 its true he has been in bigger cars for a while longer than i have and my learning curve is a little longer than his
2382477 but theyre a helluva lot farther ahead of the game than what 90 percent of people go through
2382478 but im talking about how much money it cost to get him here
2382479 i would say its probably been more than 2 million and 2 million now wont do it
2382480 i would say theres a possibility he could run something part time in nationwide in the fall
2382481 next year were trying to look at trucks as a great spot for him
2382482 and all the work thats gone into trying to create inclusiveness
2382483 in fairness i think our progress nascar the sport and nascar the sanctioning body should be measured on our commitment to the drive for diversity
2382484 i was ready to punch the first m who looked at me wrong
2382485 that took him completely aback because he knew i was a promoter and he figured that would get a tremendous amount of ink
2382486 the voice said if you let that blankity blank race in the 600 youre dead
2382487 even in the 80s things could still get out of hand particularly around a nascar track
2382488 one of the things that always concerned me when we had a race was somebody a fan in the infield taking a potshot at a driver with a rifle
2382489 there was an uproar among about a hundred fans who stormed a fence surrounding the track some of them chanting go home nigger
2382490 if you start or end your sentence with the n word that makes it racial
2382491 the reality is it had nothing to do with winning the race it had nothing to do with losing it
2382492 one of the things we find is that a lot of times the consumers dont know there is a minority driver
2382493 chase austin is that he has the charisma he keeps his nose clean hes a clean cut good kid whos doing something great
2382494 youve got this little window dressing operation and its not cutting it its a mannequin
2382495 i mean we had nothing before this at least is something
2382496 the only way this thing is going to work is to get the diversity drivers in cars like bandoleros and legends at an early age
2382497 a few of them will come out of it to the major leagues
2382498 when we do theres going to be a lewis hamilton in there
2382499 increasing the number of families who participate in youth racing
2382500 were building partnerships with the world karting association 600 racing wheelers association for bandoleros and legends cars and the quarter midget association of america to invite more kids in including minority kids
2382501 and then we went out to see some of the summer shootout
2382502 you buy a pair of shorts and a pair of tennis shoes he needs a baseball glove
2382503 heck id like to see nascar go out and sponsor five teams that have african american drivers
2382504 for the competitors who have spent their years toiling in this sport trying to participate in this sport struggling in this sport going in and out of this sport
2382505 the biggest thing nascar can do is continue to try to grow the grassroots programs that give people an opportunity at an early age to get involved
2382506 and all the other sanctioning bodies in racing have always kind of taken the attitude of this is america were open well welcome everybody into it but were not going to give anybody anything

2382558 we believe this brutalist unwelcoming bunkerlike building is not a proper representation of our practice or our theology and that without a compelling government interest our members not the historic preservation review board are in the best position to determine that representation

2382560 and the complex possesses amazingly high integrity in all respects location design setting materials workmanship feeling and association down to the original carpeting and seat upholstery in the church auditorium
2382561 the city is saying you must keep the forbidding concrete wall and the church is saying we want to reach out to people
2382562 this case tees up whether historic preservation can trump the right to worship
2382563 we believe that ot 730 may represent a significant advance in terms of patient safety in the treatment of glaucoma
2382564 all of the current drug therapies for glaucoma on the market today have side effects some potentially life threatening ot 730 has been specifically designed as a prodrug to deliver a potent beta blocker locally within the eye but then rapidly break down to inactive metabolites upon entry into the systemic circulation our goal in clinical trials will be to compare its iop lowering effect against timolol the most prescribed ocular beta blocker and to determine its effects if any on cardiovascular and pulmonary function we believe that unique safety profile could ultimately position it as a leading monotherapy or in combination with other classes of drugs for use in glaucoma patients

2382591 so did many of those who live in the blogosphere where the enquirer story was taken as fact in spite of its anonymous sources
2382592 we began pursuing the story soon after it first appeared but the standard for proof in this kind of intimate behavior is and should be very high
2382593 better to get it right even if we couldnt get it first

2382598 it is simply not good enough for john key to say he supports the peoples right to have their voice heard in a referendum without committing his government to abide by the result
2382599 in fact when nationals leader john key announced their pledge of 10 policy items at their conference last weekend not a single one of them addresses any of the social engineering labour has forced upon the nation in the past 6 9 years

2382614 china respinge islamul si forteaza musulmanii sa devina atei detinind si ucigind profesorii de religie islamica si distrugind scolile islamice
2382615 liberals like nancy pelosi and charlie brown want to continue supporting federal laws that prevents us from tapping americas vast oil resources thats how we got into this mess and why gasoline prices are now breaking our family budgets
2382616 america has nearly a trillion barrels of recoverable oil more than three times that of saudi arabia that democrats like nancy pelosi and charlie brown wont even let us touch in fact more than 94 percent of our territory remains off limits because of this foolish prohibition if we want to change this policy weve got to change this congress
2382617 politicians sitting on their hands while we pay at the pump we dont need government bureaucracies and higher taxes to fund them we need to get government out of the way and open american oil to american production right now
2382618 well have to wait and see what happens for the spring after we get information from the departments
2382619 it is important for the deans to approach the cuts in a differential manner in their departments they are the ones who can say this aspect of my physics program is more important than that aspect of my physics program
2382620 were just beginning to evaluate how well deal with it
2382621 regardless how big your budget is a million dollars is a million dollars it is hard to find ways to make the cuts
2382622 cuts are going to be very very difficult and its just too early to know the impact
2382623 i will be meeting with faculty administrators and staff for input ideas and options to address the reductions before final decisions and resolutions are made
2382624 at this time it is too early to determine the impact on potential unfulfilled positions or reduction in staffing

2382630 the deputies opened fire and executed our dogs the very second they broke down our front door
2382631 we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
2382632 what kind of a self absorbed nitwit runs for president knowing that hes got a scandal like this in the hopper

2382660 i think thats extremely clear because then the decision to trade for favre wouldnt have been made
2382661 are capable of taking us where we have to go
2382662 the most difficult part of the last 24 hours is coming to realize youre no longer wanted by your organization
2382663 you spend eight years with an organization and in the blink of an eye youre no longer wanted thats the crude part of the business that is sometimes hard to accept emotionally
2382664 lets face it all you have to do is look at the numbers and the quarterback rating
2382665 carr was 125 and anthony wright was 97 the frustrating thing was that you can pick a play here and there and say thats the game but we did have opportunities
2382666 these two david carr and anthony wright have gone head to head since camp began
2382667 and theres certainly some evidence as of thursday night that the competition is proving to bring out the best in both of them and its highly competitive
2382668 i think it was good for me to get out there and have a positive experience
2382669 going from one place to the other you never know how guys are going to react to you in the huddle or how its going to be out there but i had a good experience out there hopefully ill be able to build off that
2382670 i came to pick up a jersey for my husband hes been driving me nuts about it
2382671 he likes the packers but hes more of a favre fan so i had to get him a jersey
2382672 a lot of people have been buying a bunch at a time
2382673 he knows were in new york and i think hed be very disappointed if i came home without one

2382678 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2382679 we deplore the russian military action in georgia which is a violation of georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity
2382680 the deputy secretary said that we deplore todays russian attacks by strategic bombers and missiles which are threatening civilian lives
2382681 these attacks mark a dangerous and disproportionate escalation of tension
2382682 the build up of forces was more than expected and they moved earlier than we thought they would
2382683 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2382684 what is clear is that russia has invaded georgias sovereignty has encroached on georgias sovereignty and it is very important for us to resolve this issue as quickly as possible
2382685 we deplore the russian military action in georgia which is a violation of georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity
2382686 if the whole world does not stop russia today then russian tanks will be able to reach any other european capital
2382687 he is in big danger of losing the cachet he built up for himself in being pro western and the restraint he has often shown in the face of provocation by russia
2382688 what russia is doing in georgia is open undisguised aggression and a challenge to the whole world

2382691 tskhinvali and the heights around tskhinvali and the majority of the villages in south ossetia are under the control of georgian forces
2382692 the entire town of tkshinvali is currently controlled by units of south ossetias self defence
2382693 he is in big danger of losing the cachet he built up for himself in being pro western and the restraint he has often shown in the face of provocation by russia
2382694 what russia is doing in georgia is open unhidden aggression and a challenge to the whole world
2382695 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil

2382698 ik wilde alleen even vragen waar je was geweest ineens zag ik je niet meer ik zag alleen een touw met lakens uit het raam hangen
2382699 waarom zou ik jou vertellen waar ik geweest ben als ik het zelf niet eens weet
2382700 wat is er nou waarom moet je me zo graag aan de lijn hebben

2382709 has good relations with both the pm prime minister and the former minister of mines not to mention lots of french contacts both of whom could possibly shed light on this sort of activity
2382710 the last american diplomat to meet with saddam hussein before the first gulf war
2382711 it now of course will read the husband of the first american spy to have her identity compromised by her own government
2382712 u s immigration and customs enforcement ice agents together with federal state and local law enforcement partners across massachusetts have arrested 52 gang members and associates and 28 other criminals this week as part of the agencys operation community shield initiative which targets violent street gangs
2382713 i cant help them with their problem they cant see me i can be like 68 years old and im still trouble because theyre thinking about something in vietnam or theyre thinking about jane fonda or they think i slept with their daughter they think i burned my draft card its like a big rorschach of things that i did or did not do
2382714 i think that denver officials would be well advised not to believe everything that the fbi warns them about
2382715 thats how things can get out of hand due to fabricated exaggerated projections about violence or protest
2382716 what you saw in 2000 was the claim that 75 000 anarchists were descending the secret funding of permanent police equipment the denial of permits for protesters you saw the same thing in 2004 you will see the same thing in 2008
2382717 i planned for multiple scenarios not knowing which one would play out
2382718 but certainly after the murder of kennedy coming on the murder of king to me it was in the air that we were going to be busted and face serious harm unless we surrendered and left the city and simply went along with the plan just go along with our own disappearance
2382719 in evaluating this case you should bear in mind that your prime objectives should be to neutralize him in the new left movement
2382720 thousands of hairy yippies were going to have sex in public while drinking from the lsd laden waters of lake michigan they actually believed that and this sex in the parks on acid would occur at roughly the same moment that black revolutionaries would storm the convention with guns
2382721 named strangely enough in memory of chicago police killed by an anarchists bomb during a violent confrontation between police and protesters in 1886
2382722 it takes two for a riot to occur and if it wasnt for the fbi advisers chicago 68 would not have happened repeat would not have happened
2382723 i do think they are playing around unnecessarily with the rights of protesters to protest
2382724 i dont know how the negotiations will come out but you know naming something a protest zone but then not allowing it to be heard or seen its a mockery of the first amendment most importantly its not necessary
2382725 it does seem to me theres a legitimate right to protest at stake
2382726 i dont think the protests will be very large if obama is the nominee i dont see the point in interfering with them its particularly crazy because most of the delegates at the democratic convention have been in many demonstrations themselves
2382727 the message was that the people coming to protest deserve this kind of repression if they get out of hand theyre just trying to scare the public into justifying more tax dollars for a false sense of security more gadgets for the police department
2382728 if they had given us permits i doubt there would have been much confrontation at all
2382729 what caused the rioting in the streets was the lack of permits and the lack of a place to stay too much order creates disorder is the way ive always put it
2382730 you dont have the draft you have one fifteenth of the american casualties now that you had at this point during vietnam the establishment is doing everything it can to keep this war from impacting the american people and yet people have seen through it
2382731 which i think means the ghosts of 68 are still with us people know a quagmire when they see one
2382732 i bet you couldnt remember that when she was alive
2382733 whos that singer guy i think hes british he sings that song youre beautiful

2382737 be true to them on all occasions in all places against all foes and at whatever cost
2382738 what have i or those i represent to do with your national independence
2382739 the rich inheritance of justice liberty prosperity and independence bequeathed by your fathers
2382740 is shared by you not by me the sunlight that brought life and healing to you has brought stripes and death to me
2382741 with all my soul that the character and conduct of the nation never looked blacker to me than on this 4th of july
2382742 it starts with teaching our daughters to never allow images on television to tell them what they are worth and teaching our sons to treat women with respect and to realize that responsibility does not end at conception that what makes them men is not the ability to have a child but the courage to raise one
2382743 we used to say that boys get guns and girls get babies now we routinely ask reporters for the age of parents whenever someone meets a tragic end
2382744 the absolute prohibition of handguns held and used for self defense in the home
2382745 the american people consider the handgun to be the quintessential self defense weapon
2382746 there are many reasons that a citizen may prefer a handgun for home defense it is easier to store in a location that is readily accessible in an emergency it cannot easily be redirected or wrestled away by an attacker it is easier to use for those without the upper body strength to lift and aim a long rifle it can be pointed at a burglar with one hand while the other hand dials the police whatever the reason handguns are the most popular weapon chosen by americans for self defense in the home and a complete prohibition of their use is invalid
2382747 this may be a moment in time that is different from when earlier calls did not prove that effective
2382748 it may represent a real shift to interest in community service
2382749 loving your country shouldnt just mean watching fireworks on the 4th of july
2382750 loving your country must mean accepting your responsibility to do your part to change it if you do your life will be richer our country will be stronger
2382751 it also depends on the teacher in east l a or the nurse in appalachia the after school worker in new orleans the peace corps volunteer in africa the foreign service officer in indonesia
2382752 we cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that weve set
2382753 weve got to have a civilian national security force thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
2382754 we feel that a customer would want to buy products that cesar recommends since hes a specialist in his field
2382755 the situation is so catastrophic that the international committee of the red cross has asked for a humanitarian corridor
2382756 are you ready to stop the bombers in the air
2382757 we demand the russian federation immediately terminate aerial bombardments immediately pull out the occupying forces and negotiate cease fire
2382758 we deplore the russian military action in georgia which is a violation of georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity
2382759 historically russia was and will remain the guarantor of the security of the people of the caucuses

2382763 daca vrem sa judecam povestirea despre detinutul suhov separind o de contextul ei istoric si ideologic ca pe o creatie artistica asetica ar insemna sa privam cartea de tot ceea ce i imprima dramatism si vitalitate caracterul ei documentar si critic fireste ca aceasta natura polemica atit de dependenta de actualitate incomodeaza abordarea literara a cartii calitatile si defectele ei nu pot fi semnalate in termeni formali stil constructie prezentarea personajelor nervul povestirii etc ca la romanele obisnuite in acest caz nu este importanta eliberarea textului de un model crearea unei lumi suverane si independente de lumea reala ci lumina pe care o arunca asupra unei realitati preexistente ca si conditia umana si speranta de malraux sau amintiri din casa mortilor de dostoievski o zi din viata lui ivan denisovici este mai aproape de istorie decit de literatura

2382767 we believe that ot 730 may represent a significant advance in terms of patient safety in the treatment of glaucoma
2382768 all of the current drug therapies for glaucoma on the market today have side effects some potentially life threatening ot 730 has been specifically designed as a prodrug to deliver a potent beta blocker locally within the eye but then rapidly break down to inactive metabolites upon entry into the systemic circulation our goal in clinical trials will be to compare its iop lowering effect against timolol the most prescribed ocular beta blocker and to determine its effects if any on cardiovascular and pulmonary function we believe that unique safety profile could ultimately position it as a leading monotherapy or in combination with other classes of drugs for use in glaucoma patients
2382769 i will set shepherds over them who will care for them and they shall fear no more nor be dismayed neither shall any be missing says the lord
2382770 we need to know if the district did all it could to exercise its responsibility to protect these children after they knew they were at risk

2382774 second string trivia facts and lists about the vice presidency and its vice presidents
2382775 it has been held by men whose greatness was diminished by the restrictions of office by those who were able to rise to greatness despite the office and by men who the office has turned into curiosities of history
2382776 and it looked as though i might pay a price for that

2382835 even if no one knows the secret numbers the fact that the backdoor is present makes dual ec drbg very fragile if someone were to solve just one instance of the algorithms elliptic curve problem he would effectively have the keys to the kingdom
2382836 he could then use it for whatever nefarious purpose he wanted or he could publish his result and render every implementation of the random number generator completely insecure

2382866 saya itu yakin bahwa pemahaman para pengikut syaikh rabi bin hadi dan syaikh muqbil bin hadi itu
2382867 metode yang mereka pakai adalah googling mencari informasi dengan search engine google ini bukan perbuatan orang muslim tetapi kaum yahudi
2382868 saya percaya apa pun kata hadis anda tentang perilaku sex muhamad tetap anda anggap muhamad itu adalah orang yang mulia dan beraklak baik itu terserah anda
2382869 selama puasa superman sex suka cium dan jilat lidah aisha he he
2382870 muhamad sekali lagi main sex dengan aisha yang lagi menses
2382871 gambar 3a cercaan dari prayoto myqers pro aktif yang hingga tanggal 8 agustus 2008 pukul 10 45 ya allah ya rahman ya rahim sungguh engkau menjadi sebaik baik saksi atas kebencian orang orang kafir itu terhadap rasulmu shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan sungguh engkaupun menjadi sebaik baik saksi bahwa myquran menjadi corong corong manusia terlaknat tersebut dalam menghinakan nabimu
2382872 eh alquran yang asli itu sudah dibakar usman cs alquran yang elo pegang itu adalah salinan ke 2 sudah banyak bukti alquran itu kitab sesat yang nyontek dari apocripa palsu dan banyak kontradiksi di dalamnya secara extenal pun alquran itu banyak bohongnya dan kisah alquran punyak bertentangan dgn sejarah dan alkitab kalau dibahas bisa panjang lebar bung
2382873 dan diantara manusia ada orang orang yang membantah tentang allah tanpa ilmu pengetahuan tanpa petunjuk dan tanpa kitab wahyu yang bercahaya dengan memalingkan lambungnya untuk menyesatkan manusia dari jalan allah ia mendapat kehinaan di dunia dan di hari kiamat kami merasakan kepadanya adzab neraka yang membakar
2382874 azab dan neraka bagi orang yang ingar dan mendustai alquran
2382875 di alkitab jelas menyatakan bahwa yesus itu adalah penyelamat dan penolong manusia masakan tuhan ente mau mengutus nabi terakhir setelah isa tapi tuh orang bukan penolong dan penyelamat manusia jika itu terjadi kemungkinan ada 2 1 tuhan ente lagi linglung 2 muhamad nabi palsu percaya ame gue deh ngak akan lari dari 2 kemungkinan itu lah
2382876 semoga anda semakin yakin bahwa alquran adalah wahyu setan yang sengaja menyesatkan manusia dari kebenaran alkitab
2382877 diantara manusia ada orang yang membantah tentang allah tanpa ilmu pengetahuan dan mengikuti setiap syaithan yang jahat yang telah ditetapkan terhadap syaithan itu bahwa barangsiapa yang berkawan dengan dia tentu dia akan menyesatkannya dan membawanya ke adzab neraka
2382878 alquran bilang isa bukan hanya utusan tapi sebagai allah god juga
2382879 tapi muhamad malah mati diracun oleh orang yahudi kemudia mati dikuburkan dan tidak bangkit dari kematian
2382880 jika minum khamar adalah perbuatan setan dan allah swt memberi minum khamar di surga islam maka jelas
2382881 tuhan islam itu bisa melakukan perbuatan setan makara atau tipu daya adalah perbuatan iblis yang juga dilakukan oleh allah swt
2382882 he he he he sudah pada frustasi tidak bisa mengelak fakta pengetahuan muhamad itu dari iblis lalu bikin pertanyaan yang bodoh dan fitnah tentang an nisa 11 12
2382883 tuhannya muhammad awloh dlm quran yang begitu gila penyembahan adalah bukan tuhan yang sama dengan tuhan para nabi tuhannya muhammad adalah tuhan lain yang tidak ada hubungannya dengan para nabi justru kalau kita mencocokkannya dengan bibel tuhannya muhammad identik dengan setan
2382884 kita tahu bahwa sosok yang mula mula menyesatkan manusia adam adalah setan kemudian awloh mengaku dengan terus terang bahwa dirinya suka menyesatkan manusia dan raja tipu yang lihai
2382885 hanya tuhan sinting saja yg minta dirinya disembah sembah 50 kali sehari
2382886 saya bukan kristen kalau saya disuruh memilih nabi mana yang layak diikuti saya pilih yesus sekalipun yesus bukan tuhan dan bila seandainya allah swt itu tuhan saya lebih memilih tidak ber tuhan daripada bertuhankan sosok jelek seperti allah swt
2382887 saya percaya kalau semua umat beragama bisa hidup rukun bersama yaitu apabila ajaran ajarannya tidak seperti ajaran arab ajaran muhammad itu sangat berbahaya masa dia mengajari kita agar membunuh orang orang di sekeliling kita dia pun juga mencita citakan arab suatu hari nanti bakal menguasai seluruh dunia telaah kritis mana mesti kita ikuti yesus atau muhammad
2382888 kita ikut muhammad sama dengan ikut setan kita ikut yesus sama dengan ikut tuhan
2382889 tetapi muhammad mengajari kita agar memusuhi manusia lain seharusnya kita sadar kalau muhammad adalah alat setan dialah anti kristus
2382890 yesus tidak pernah mengajari kita agar memusuhi muhammad mengajari kita agar memusuhi
2382891 iya kok memang islam telah memfitnah tapi kalau yang berikut ini bukanlah fitnah 1

2383069 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2383070 all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
2383071 these attacks mark a dangerous and disproportionate escalation of tension as they occur across georgia in regions far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2383072 we are asking our friends and the united states among them to somehow to try to mediate and try to persuade russia to stop this military aggression and invasion of georgia
2383073 what we heard is that the state department and the entire administration is deeply concerned and that they are heavily engaged with russia trying to de escalate the situation
2383074 what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2383075 to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in
2383076 all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia

2383085 the congress and bjp are the dominant political parties in the country it has become essential for them to draw some common minimum plan with regard to economic reforms disregarding this need would only increase the problems that the nation is already facing
2383086 when our government presented the relevant bill in parliament the bjp did not oppose it
2383087 the congress and bjp need to have a dialogue in this direction
2383088 your brain makes a choice between breathing and sleeping at first the brain chooses sleeping but then it wakes you briefly so you can catch your breath

2383097 im not against vaccines but i dont want to do anything that would harm my daughter
2383098 we dont know if it will make a difference in the ultimate rates of cancer
2383099 the jury is still out on how much benefit were actually going to get with this vaccine
2383100 the crux of it is that we know how to prevent cervical cancer
2383101 one of the key questions is whether this huge outlay of money for the vaccine is a better strategy than reaching out to the women who arent getting pap tests and follow ups
2383102 even though it guards against two hpv strains the other hpv types need to be taken into account
2383103 it will take a long time before we know the true efficacy of the vaccine

2383108 a lot of strength training athletes eat protein every two or three hours
2383109 has produced bigger and better results than any other protein supplement in history up to 3 times better than regular whey proteins
2383110 almost everyone agrees that the rda for protein isnt sufficient for athletes or anyone exercising for more than one hour a day
2383111 bars may have more protein than you really need but that doesnt mean that theyre harmful
2383112 many products are over hyped the science of protein has gotten a whole lot better but theres still a problem with marketing
2383113 many hypertension experts in the early 1960s were still saying that elevated blood pressure wasnt bad for you and that reducing it could cause damage to important organs such as strokes and heart attacks
2383114 even now we dont consider the diagnosis of hypertension established unless youve had elevated readings three times separated by at least a week in those days they would have been even more cautious and not started treatment right away
2383115 the medical scenes in this seasons premiere are reasonably realistic
2383116 it was in vitro the untold story behind angelina and brads twins
2383117 there are several categories of risk associated with the use of art
2383118 it looks as though theres an increased risk of some congenital birth defects
2383119 across the board the biggest risk of art stems from the increased likelihood of multiple births
2383120 if we can determine which embryos are most likely to take we can decrease the number that are transferred and reduce the risk of a multiple pregnancy
2383121 while the goal is to help patients with family building patients want a healthy baby
2383122 we want to make sure were not adding to the risk with art
2383123 they had all things in common no rich and poor all made free partakers of heavenly gift
2383124 they did not walk after law of moses etc they walked after the new laws fast pray word of lord
2383125 tell us a little about that more personal side of your faith what does it look like today in terms of spiritual habits do you read the bible regularly do you pray
2383126 do you believe in this personal relationship with god that some people talk about
2383127 what does that look like for you and how do you feed that personal relationship with god
2383128 do you believe that the resurrection of jesus actually happened that it actually historically did happen
2383129 and do you believe on the salvation issue and this is controversial too that belief in christ is needed for going to heaven
2383130 i would only recognise a french court and i only take my orders from the international rugby board and the french rugby federation
2383131 the only problem might have been if the bulldogs had asked for a release letter
2383132 but theres been no release letter asked at all if there is no request for an exit letter there is no recognition of a former contract
2383133 hes signed his contract with toulon hes played a game and hes with us
2383134 one thing that did come out is that its a lot more confrontational than super 14 and they like to be in your face and i suppose they like the rough stuff a little bit more than at home

2383140 it is vain to serve god we call the proud happy they that fear the lord were heard though and a book was written for them that feared the lord and they will be spared then shall they return and discern between the righteous and the wicked

2383161 were in this mode where were telling everybody everything all the time it becomes about saying things just blathering on were at the apex of that trend
2383162 they apparently rented a u haul van in atlanta and came to rome the bank they chose was just a random selection
2383163 after the robbery they ditched the van at berry college and made their way back to atlanta in separate taxis they met up at a hotel in atlanta and then parted ways
2383164 we understand that while colson was taking a shower at the hotel edinbyrd took off with the money
2383165 colson said he hadnt seen or heard from edinbyrd since

2383171 what in the world was she thinking why are my tax dollars via welfare and food stamps paying for this lifestyle
2383172 why did she have more children than she could support are we supposed to join her in the bedroom and put condoms on her partners
2383173 i have nothing but contempt for c c she is guilty of child neglect because she has far more children than she can afford she is also guilty of being a parasite on society c c should be sterilized and that goes for all the c c s out there as well as the men boys who knock them up
2383174 is your stupid piece supposed to tug at my heartstrings and make me want to give up more of my money in the form of higher taxes to some welfare queen who never stopped to think about the consequences of having 6 kids from 4 different fathers the kids should be taken from her and raised by the state and she should get fixed and get a job
2383175 the social fabric in d c unraveled a long time ago
2383176 they said we should go smoke some weed and were talking about being in a strip bar some really explicit things

2383375 its kind of this symbiotic thing where you give the crowd energy and they give it back to you
2383376 the thing with the silent barn is the people are hanging out
2383377 theres no artificial divide you go to a big fancy club the band is back in a sanctuary the whole time theyre cloistered away
2383378 everything is regulated the fans basically are being overcharged and treated like cows herded in and herded out the moment the show is over the big bouncer goon comes up and tells everybody to get the fuck out how does that in any way foster the community
2383379 theyll get a lot more tips then you work the door
2383380 to be doing stuff i cant really articulate myself thats exciting to me to not be able to characterize it
2383381 we are doing it in terms of if music were invented yesterday
2383382 you create a space where people can come in and sit down at the same grubby chair at the silent barn every weekend and they start to feel ownership they start to feel comfortable this is a place i can feel like its my place
2383383 it just surprised us a little bit how long that small an amount of mercury can stick around in carpet

2383395 our indian representations have not been cartoonish slurs but serious noble portraits of serious noble warriors our connection with the indian has not been arbitrary stereotype but a reference to an important historical fact dartmouth of course was originally conceived as a school for educating american indians
2383396 sometimes the last st on the cast on edge gets lost if you need to pick up a stitch by placing the loop between 2 sts on the needle
2383397 i understand the desire of members of the general assembly to maximize revenue generated by tourism and summer employment
2383398 it is important to provide school divisions with the flexibility to make sound educational decisions that support the best interests of our students
2383399 the problem was it got killed in committee for so many years that you dont hear much about it now
2383400 as weve stated in the past its our first season so were going to monitor the attendance levels and adjust the schedule in line with demand
2383401 you have a very difficult environment across the board in tourism so you have that and were just going to see were going to see how attendance is through the latter months and the outer season months
2383402 bass pro wants the city and county to approve this in the next 30 days or everybody move on to other projects
2383403 they are excited and they want to begin immediately this thing has been extended longer than anyone expected they are the ones pushing to get this thing finalized and signed
2383404 the real key is what are the city and county committing to in terms of additional funds
2383405 that can take the form of redevelopment tax credits there are credits available but you have to apply for them if you can get those thats fine if not are there additional monetary contributions on the city and county the county commission has said in the past that the county is done funding the pyramid
2383406 the devil is always in the detail and we have two partners
2383407 we are going to need to have the agreement in hand and have enough time to review the agreement and have some back and forth before mr hagale comes in for ceremonies
2383408 my hats off to you for getting us to this point
2383409 this was built as an arena well be the only city in america that has an arena in an adaptive reuse other than a church
2383410 they made a decision early on that they were not going to be a part of the lobbying for this
2383411 they have so many cities so many developers that are encouraging them to come to their cities that they made a point in the very beginning that they were not going to try to lobby to be in memphis we had to want them for them to come
2383412 until they have a signed contract theyre not going to develop the actual architectural and engineering plans this really sets in motion all of the work that needs to be done for us all to agree
2383413 there is almost no monetary gain to the county government by going forward with the terms
2383414 it may be that we need to step out of the way but we want to look at it for the good of the whole county and be sure were not cutting our nose off to spite our face the fact is that we want to know what our commitment is at one point we were being asked to guarantee 30 million but i dont think were in a position to do that

2383417 i dont know if that was a joke i think we always kind of revert back to psychedelic because it is a kind of catch all
2383418 there are so many times i go and see a band and say theyd be really good if they just made it more simple
2383419 i think bands sometimes way over think things well make things really simple but also really interesting so that if you dont get it one way youll get it another i tend to think were an updated version of 60s soundtrack music with more of an aggressive feel and maybe something that people can get into dance wise
2383420 at least lately weve been talking about adding vocals were discussing that maybe the band needs this other element we probably will add vocals but they would just be another sonic element it wouldnt be about the lyrics
2383421 i dont think we want to sit there and write deep thoughts about unrequited love or something
2383422 i saw him play the other night and what he sang sounds awesome but if you actually listen to the music hes just saying whatever pops into his head
2383423 it was amazing i think it helps to be a complete weirdo years ago when i was playing music with some other friends that was the idea that somehow wed happen upon this total weirdo who would just end up singing for us and it would be the best thing but then you have to deal with a total weirdo in the band
2383424 i have bands that i really like in new york but its weird because i dont feel like im part of any scene i feel like im a part of a circle of friends but thats much smaller
2383425 maybe if you live in a small town you feel like its a scene new yorks not really the most nurturing city for artists as far as a true scene i dont think it exists in new york maybe there are pockets to seek out other people it can be difficult you get into this situation where the only place you see these people is at your show or their show and basically it is this back and forth of like well i went to his so hes going to come to mine
2383426 i really think its important that a place love whats going on love the community love the music and love the scene
2383427 i liked the vibe of it it kind of reminded me of basement punk shows when i was in high school everybody seemed really psyched to be there
2383428 its nice to be able to look straight ahead and youre on the same level

2383568 have been contacting democratic primary election voters and fraudulently identifying themselves as calling on behalf of the florida democratic party
2383569 the callers then go on to solicit votes for kosmas in the aug 26 democratic primary
2383570 the unlawful calls continued even after the kosmas campaign was notified of the problem
2383571 her campaign was given the opportunity to rectify the violations prior to the submission of fec charges but apparently chose not to
2383572 strenuously object to all of the so called information in this story
2383573 if we cant trust her to honestly represent herself correctly on the telephone can we trust her to represent the citizens of the district in congress
2383574 the democratic party does not make endorsements in the primary our party is not a handful of elitists but rather a party of the people we determine our candidates in our primaries what has occurred is just another case of a political millionaire acting as if she is above the law and has no problem in attempting to deceive voters
2383575 people really are fed up with the whole pelosi democrat in name only thing
2383576 i personally have little tolerance for fake democrats anymore and kosmas playbook here is the worst example of rovian dirty tricks
2383577 we need to reject this not just in fl 24 but across the board and oust these damn neocon enablers once and for all
2383578 well i am calling to ask you to support suzanne kosmas for congress
2383579 she is the last person i would support i am supporting clint curtis and am on his campaign staff
2383580 her campaign was given the opportunity to rectify the violations prior to the submission of fec charges
2383581 but apparently chose not to if we cant trust her to honestly represent herself correctly on the telephone can we trust her to represent the citizens of the district in congress

2383583 the florida democratic party strenuously objects to all of the so called information in this story
2383584 what mr curtis was complaining about the florida democratic party has offices there doing general activities preparing to aggressively take on tom feeney who as im sure you know is one of the most corrupt members of congress
2383585 i believe we had a few signs up just like we would have signs up for any democrats running in our office
2383586 i dont believe clint curtis asked us to put signs up at this point weve decided to take all of the signs down because of the allegations
2383587 know s that the kosmas campaign requested the posters be put up
2383588 because there are signs in the window it doesnt mean were getting involved in the campaign
2383589 even if everything alleged in mr curtis complaint were true which theyre not it would be 100 legal to do everything there
2383590 we have our own offices and were calling and recruiting volunteers suzanne kosmas campaign is not working out of them not using them and is not involved in that
2383591 there may have been one or two calls from one or two staffers and they were reprimanded possibly
2383592 anonymous allegations from a clint curtis staffer who has a financial stake in the race
2383593 no we would do no such things we dont scrub stories here but wed be happy to post any evidence he has showing the allegations to be untrue

2383596 i wanted to honour aisha and all the wives of muhammad by giving voice to them remarkable women whose crucial roles in the shaping of islam have so often been ignored silenced by historians

2383630 the united states and russia must take the lead in striving to abolish nuclear weapons
2383631 these two countries should begin implementing broad reductions of nuclear weapons instead of deepening their conflict over among others the introduction of a missile defence system in europe
2383632 i vow to lead the international community for permanent peace
2383633 i feel their pain but this case is over he was already acquitted in a foreign jurisdiction

2383666 usually ill make an on site visit to inspect the fish and take a water samples
2383667 i will put a couple of them into smaller bowls full of anesthetic water to inspect them closer
2383668 surgery involves a table with a tank full of anesthetic water topped with foam pad cut into a v shape
2383669 you set the fish into the v run a tube full of anesthetic water from the tank over the fishs gills so it can breath

2383679 it is reasonable to conclude that the federal eagle envelopes utilized in the attacks were purchased from a post office in maryland or virginia

2383684 there is no motive that has been suggested to me that makes any sense
2383685 it is frightening to me as a citizen and certainly as a defense attorney for people to characterize citizens who have trouble or questions or disputes with members of congress as having a dark side
2383686 thats the only thing i can comment to that that does not prove a thing
2383687 based upon the totality of the evidence we had gathered against him
2383688 we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
2383689 circumstantial evidence sure some of it is but its compelling evidence and our view is we are confident it would have helped us prove this case against dr ivins beyond a reasonable doubt

2383712 colleagues beginning today we are adopting an inquirer first policy for our signature investigative reporting enterprise trend stories news features and reviews of all sorts what that means is that we wont post those stories online until theyre in print well cooperate with philly com as we do now in preparing extensive online packages to accompany our enterprising work but well make the decision to press the button on the online packages only when readers are able to pick up the inquirer on their doorstep or on the newsstand
2383713 for our bloggers especially this may require a bit of an adjustment some of you like to try out ideas that end up as subjects of stories or columns in print first if in doubt consult your editor or me or chris krewson
2383714 a stake through the heart of the has been inquirer
2383715 can look at it as a cautionary tale on choosing ones enemies well because you are going to become much like them or because theyre going to become much like you

2383719 i threw the ball a lot better than the linescore said
2383720 i just really got outpitched theres nothing really more to say
2383721 that last start i was trying to get out alive
2383722 i didnt care if i gave up 100 runs that game i was so beat out there i was so exhausted out there
2383723 he was attacking the zone with like nine pitches it seemed like
2383724 i think a j was not hustling on the play
2383725 he hit the ball and pretty much thought it was out of play
2383726 when i hit it and drew caught it i didnt know where it went
2383727 i thought it kicked away from him just trying to make something positive here hoping we can get a run to score o c did a good job reading the throws
2383728 to use his army of the undead to take over the world and get revenge on the sorceress who put him to sleep so many years ago
2383729 a close look into the various clauses of the joint venture agreement reveals that all essential ingredients of an aop stand satisfied in this case geoconsult rites secon combine

2383731 if youre just doing recycling its a tough business to be in for profit youre not creating a tremendous amount of value and youre moving around heavy devices with big shipping costs
2383732 feels like we have been waiting for this game for around 5 years so in that time a lot of expectation has built up if this game isnt the best thing to ever be installed on my pc im going to be more than a tad bit disappointed

2383738 they took it up a notch with the complexity of the scenes and the intricacy
2383739 they have some areas which are now misty which is a really interesting effect walking through a mist previously they had sort of grayed out the scene and called it mist but now its hard to peer through
2383740 theyve again taken the end game and made it more accessible to more people
2383741 without costing the high end players without giving up the challenge that keeps the high end players motivated
2383742 i think blizzard has learned a lot from the last expansion release
2383743 even a group of ten people will be able to conquer the very highest end game content while 25 man versions will let people who want to be more hardcore do that as well
2383744 if youre familiar with the mechanics of the 10 person version
2383745 then you should be familiar with the 25 person version at least in the philosophical sense

2383759 the competitor in him probably got the best of him he lowered his shoulder and the end result was a broken collar bone

2383765 we threw two passes and they protected very well i think it was a good first drive for us
2383766 it was done he just had to review it and look through it one more time hell be out there for the next one
2383767 its nothing different just going out and trying to make the same plays
2383768 youve got to understand that this is first time in the nfl

2383791 oh my god i love the brown brown is so kurt cobain its really cute
2383792 i suspect there will not be more than two parents in the land who would have faith in the government that this information will be secure
2383793 at the moment there are no plans for the unique learner number to be used by the id card system
2383794 given the track record of government it disasters and the possibility that all these childrens records will end up in iowa this is a worry
2383795 the government has a terrible track record in managing complex it programmes recent events have shown that sensitive personal data is not safe in ministers hands there must be profound worries not just in terms of civil liberties but also in terms of the security of young people with a project like this
2383796 eu vorbesc din catedrala aceasta adic a sfintilor apostoli din constantinopol si v d multime de oameni aici de se vor ntoarce 100 la hristos plat nsutit voi avea de se vor ntoarce 60 sau 30 nu mic este plata iar de se va ntoarce numai unul si pentru acesta mare plat mi va da mie hristos c un singur suflet este mai scump dec t toat lumea dup cuv ntul care a zis ce va da omul n schimb pentru sufletul s u m car de ar c stiga toat lumea iar de nu se va ntoarce chiar nici unul eu nu voi nceta s nv t si s predic deoarece f nt nile izvor sc si izvoarele curg m car de ar lua cineva si ar bea ap din ele sau nu ar bea ele si fac datoria
2383797 cei ce marturisesc aparandu si credinta sunt ca niste apologeti ai vremurilor acestora

2383799 toate pl cerile acestei lumi nu sunt nici m car umbra fericirii h r zit n ceruri celor ce l iubesc pe dumnezeu acolo este bucuria ve nic biruin a i s rb toarea dob nde te pacea l untric i mii de suflete n jurul t u se vor m ntui

2383801 au doara toti sunt apostoli au doara toti sunt prooroci au doara toti sunt t lcuitori ce te faci pe tine pastor oaie fiind ce te faci cap picior fiind ce te apuci a comanda osti fiind r nduit ntre soldati
2383802 orice s v r i i cu cuv ntul sau cu lucrul pe toate ntru numele domnului iisus hristos s le face i
2383803 ns noi propov duim pe hristos cel r stignit pentru iudei sminteal pentru neamuri nebunie dar pentru cei chema i i iudei i elini pe hristos puterea lui dumnezeu i n elepciunea lui dumnezeu
2383804 c nd te rogi sa nu ti nchipui dumnezeirea nici sa lasi vreo alta forma sa intre si sa se ntipareasca n mintea ta
2383805 c nd va vedea divolul ca mintea se roaga lui dumnezeu din inima atunci vine cu ispite mari si grele
2383806 celor ce isi au mintea permanent la lucruri lumesti macar daca ar si auzi nu vor crede si urasc pe cei ce le ar spune
2383807 desi mari pacate va face cineva dar daca pe acestea le face n taina si pe nimeni nu va sminti mai putin se va munci dec t cel ce mai mici pacate va face nsa pe fata si smintind pe multi
2383808 mai bine un razboi vrednic de lauda decat o pace care te desparte de dumnezeu
2383809 multi oameni nu simt existent vazduhului pana nu incepe sa bata vantul
2383810 ca o tr mbit din naltul cerului vorbesc zidirile cu noi si strig c este un ziditor
2383811 toate cate voiti sa faca voua oamenii asemenea faceti si voi lor ca aceasta este legea si prorocii

2383816 atunci ia alte sapte duhuri mai rele decat el si intra si se incuiba in ea facand cele de pe urma ale omului mai rele decat cele dintai
2383817 asadar nu mai este nici o osanda pentru cei ce umbla in iisus hristos nu dupa trup caci legea duhului vietii m a eliberat de legea pacatului si a mortii romani 8 1 2

2383881 i did feel a bit out of place when i was ignorant of the facts about homosexuality i can never forget the overwhelming feeling of self pity and hatred i had i mean we all grow up thinking we are straight and when things dont really fall in the desired place its natural for someone to feel out out of place essentially because of the dearth in those times about 4 years ago complete absence of support groups or a positive social discussion platform
2383882 it was my 20th birthday and i thought it was about time that i told my parents about something as important as this
2383883 i asked my dad if he could see me being tortured and then told him the truth that i am not particularly interested in girls for me a mans mind and a mans body is far more beautiful than a girl i think i am gay
2383884 i definitely want a partner for myself i think that was one of the main reasons why i told my parents about myself as i wanted him to be respected the way my girlfriend or wife would have been if i were straight my parents really cant get the fact that i wanted to live with a man it was really difficult for them to get their hand round gay love without divorcing it from the sexual act the fact that one cant really do anything about ones sexual orientation has made them to sit and talk about it but social constraints over my happiness is still to loose the battle i think my father kind of had an inkling about the whole homosexual inclination of mine my close friends and cousins know about me and its like an open secret in my close circle

2383890 wenn auf dem balkan oder im kaukasus was los ist schnell bei zbigniew brzezinski nachlesen was wohl dahintersteckt und wie es vermutlich weitergehen wird
2383891 anders als in armenien oder aserbaidschan mit ihrer ethnisch recht homogenen bev lkerung geh ren etwa 30 der 6 millionen georgier ethnischen minderheiten an berdies hegen diese kleinen volksgruppen die in ihrer organisationsform und ihrem selbstverst ndnis eher st mmen gleichen groll gegen die georgische herrschaft nach der aufl sung der sowjetunion machten sich daher die osseten und die abchasen den innergeorgischen machtkampf zunutze um sich von georgien abzuspalten dies geschah mit stillschweigender r ckendeckung russlands das georgien zum verbleib in der gus aus der sich georgien anfangs g nzlich zur ckziehen wollte und zur duldung russischer milit rbasen auf seinem territorium zwingen wollte um das gebiet von der t rkei abzuriegeln
2383892 der umstand dass zwei der gr eren angrenzenden nationalstaaten t rkei und der iran jeder mit einem historisch gewachsenen imperialen kulturellen religi sen und konomischen interesse in der region in ihrer geopolitischen orientierung unberechenbar sind und zudem selbst mit internen problemen zu schaffen haben verst rkt die instabilit t des eurasischen balkan gravierend und macht die lage noch explosiver
2383893 auch die r ckendeckung die die ukraine den nach gr erer unabh ngigkeit strebenden staaten gibt verfolgt den zweck die eigene unabh ngigkeit gegen ber moskau zu st rken so hat die ukraine die anstrengungen georgiens unterst tzt aserische lexporte ber sein gebiet zu leiten dar ber hinaus tat sie sich mit der t rkei zusammen um den russischen einflu im schwarzen meer zu schw chen und unterst tzte die t rkischen bem hungen erd l von zentralasien in t rkische terminals zu leiten
2383894 au enpolitisch w nschen sich georgien und armenien obwohl letzteres von russischer unterst tzung gegen aserbaidschan abh ngig ist eine zunehmend engere anbindung an europa
2383895 ermutigt durch die t rkei und die usa hat aserbaidschan nicht nur die forderungen russlands zur ckgewiesen auf seinem boden milit rbasen zu errichten sondern sich auch dem ansinnen moskaus widersetzt da alles l von baku zu einem russischen schwarzmeerhafen geleitet werden sollte stattdessen entschied es sich f r eine doppell sung die eine zweite durch georgien zur t rkei verlaufende lleitung vorsieht
2383896 amerikas prim res interesse mu folglich sein mit daf r zu sorgen da keine einzelne macht die kontrolle ber dieses gebiet erlangt und die weltgemeinschaft ungehinderten finanziellen und wirtschaftlichen zugang zu ihr hat
2383897 die staaten die amerikas st rkste geopolitische unterst tzung verdienen sind aserbaidschan usbekistan und die ukraine da alle drei geopolitische dreh und angelpunkte darstellen
2383898 in dieser region hat amerika ein gemeinsames interesse nicht nur mit einer stabilen prowestlichen t rkei sondern auch mit dem iran und mit china eine allm hliche verbesserung in den amerikanisch iranischen beziehungen w rde den globalen zugang zur region erheblich erweitern und insbesondere die unmittelbare bedrohung abwenden der aserbaidschans berleben ausgesetzt ist
2383899 ausschlaggebend f r die zukunft der kaukasusrepubliken d rfte die weitere entwicklung und politische orientierung der t rkei sein wenn sie ihren kurs auf europa beibeh lt und wenn europa ihr nicht die t ren zuschl gt werden die kaukasusstaaten vermutlich in den einflu bereich europas streben eine aussicht die sie gl hend herbeisehnen aber wenn die europ isierung der t rkei aus innenpolitischen oder u eren gr nden ins stocken ger t dann wird georgien und armenien keine andere wahl bleiben als sich russlands willen anzupassen

2384112 were thrilled to be here and were not going to blow the opportunity
2384113 they have good hitters at the top of their lineup well just have to be careful with their hitters
2384114 were going to have to come out hitting they have good pitching also

2384119 at the end of the day people ask do i trust this person is he ready to be president
2384120 were running a respectful campaign its got some humor in it but its respectful
2384121 when we arrived on the scene the husband had gotten out of the vehicle
2384122 they were just trying to get out of here and everything happened so fast
2384123 it was like somebody was just dumping water out of a cup you couldnt see two feet in front of you
2384124 the tree held them from being swept away and the mother was holding the child
2384125 she said her little girl was still trapped in the car
2384126 i think she was in shock she wasnt screaming or crying
2384127 here he is just trying to get his family to safety and then tragedy strikes
2384128 i went in and gave both my girls a kiss
2384129 i cant hold onto him much longer youve got to get me help
2384130 once i saw that come down i thought were in trouble
2384131 mom how can you say that if god is the one bringing the rain
2384132 i saw him standing on a rock with water just rushing through
2384133 he was telling us tell the rescuers my familys down there
2384134 she had the 5 year old she couldnt get both of them out thats horrible how do you choose
2384135 everybody was just helping everybody people here were just amazing
2384136 i just think once you have kids you just think of their well being and their safety first
2384137 its just so sad to be on vacation with your family and have something like this happen
2384138 you think youre doing the right thing at the moment she must have thought she was getting her kids to safety
2384139 when this news first fluttered across the screen a few months back i thought those bastards
2384140 ive known him since 2003 and no i never suspected anything like this
2384141 i did not put much stock in the national enquirer but its obviously very sad and disheartening
2384142 she is one of the most fascinating women ive ever met in my life and her dedication to her husband was beyond anything
2384143 here is a woman who is given a death sentence and she tells him to continue on with the campaign
2384144 our point of disagreement was that we just had a parting of the ways over how he was planning to run his campaign i had no inkling of this
2384145 i thought he was a good guy and i thought he was a good husband and it had appeared that he was faithful to her as she is to him
2384146 during the course of my involvement with the edwards family
2384147 i had no inkling of this and like everyone in that campaign we were in love with elizabeth and how could you not be
2384148 i still admire his ideas and the goals and the things he fought for
2384149 my heart goes out heart goes out to his family when circumstances like this come up its never easy and its certainly got to be a lot more difficult having it play out in the public arena
2384150 its heart breaking to think of what it does to the edwards family and to john
2384151 they made some observations while in contact with him that would indicate the use of alcohol
2384152 we went down there the first time they gave it to us pretty bad
2384153 thats something that ive had in my mind it was probably the most embarrassing loss ive ever been a part of
2384154 one thing i took offense to was their offensive coordinator mark stoute who incidentally was the head coach of the wolves for six weeks of the 2004 off season throwing the ball on us late in the game
2384155 coach bob landsee is a friend of mine and he apologized after because he didnt call the plays but that stuff sticks with you i expect this to be a war
2384156 thats tough steven savoy at 100 percent is a no brainer
2384157 hes a great player its one of those things where if hes not 100 percent he wont go im leaning that he wont play i dont see him getting to 100 percent by the game

2384180 people want to see more renewable energy development and by participating on facebook the users can actually see that development occur it is a unique opportunity to witness and participate in companies going green

2384183 we jumped at the opportunity to participate in the application

2384191 in the south seas there is a cargo cult of people during the war they saw airplanes with lots of good materials and they want the same thing to happen now so theyve arranged to make things like runways to put fires along the sides of the runways to make a wooden hut for a man to sit in with two wooden pieces on his head to headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas hes the controller and they wait for the airplanes to land theyre doing everything right the form is perfect it looks exactly the way it looked before but it doesnt work no airplanes land so i call these things because they follow all the apparent precepts and forms of scientific investigation but theyre missing something essential because the planes dont land

2384193 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
2384194 some people ive encountered in life seem more certain about everything than i am about anything that kind of certainty isnt just a personality trait that i lack its an attitude that seems to me to misunderstand the very nature of reality its complexity and ambiguity and thereby provide a rather poor basis for working through decisions in a way that is likely to lead to the best results

2384196 safety standards vary widely and their enforcement is far from vigorous in some communities
2384197 capt craig evans of the germantown police department said his department lacks the resources to patrol neighborhoods for compliance with a village ordinance that requires fencing around any pool with water deeper than 18 inches
2384198 the village is considering an ordinance that would allow police to issue tickets to students if they violate rules about the use of cell phones and other electronic devices in schools
2384199 police chief peter hoell said he thinks the ordinance would be used only a couple of times a year
2384200 the village board is expected to approve the ordinance aug 18 given that is was unanimously recommended this week by the boards public safety committee

2384217 hes hit the ball for power for us and made some nice plays out in center field and fit in very well with the chemistry of this team its been a win win for us

2384235 i tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment
2384236 an angry man stirs up dissension and a hot tempered one commits many sins
2384237 im sure we may be looking at it because of this tragedy
2384238 since theyve come to seattle this is really the first incident and certainly the first fatality connected to pedicabs
2384239 we really got input from people in the community mothers who have delivered here
2384240 and we worked very closely with the staff in labor and delivery now to really incorporate their ideas into the design
2384241 sorry doesnt begin to describe the way i feel right now sorry to the readers to the herald to my family
2384242 im not saying the outcome would have been different but the timetable and decision to resign today really was johns choice
2384243 what about our families what will this do to the faith of our children
2384244 but when the bar continues to rise as well that makes it hard
2384245 my advise for you all if you want things to get done well you have to start cursing at the boss and the staff its the only way to make them move
2384246 my caretaker is now interested to purchase one and kick us out of his shop when my partner check with the company airku they arent protecting us here i have an established biz and there the caretaker wants to take over the company has all to gain having another new buz is it so simple as just giving us the referral fees and ask us to relocate
2384247 i am really fed up with amazed aims with the amazing stories just to share a bit of my frustration i would just conclude that these people are the unreliable lot i am shameful to say that i have to resort to shouting at them to get things done even one of the caretaker had to call the office and threatened them the machine had exploded before they sent the technician phone calls and sms were being denied ignored and there werent sincerity in solving problems
2384248 they cant even handle the present situation and yet they are expanding into another kind of business can you imaging the consequences in fact deteriorating of the back up service doesnt start recently it started last year itself so its clear the management has been ignoring it
2384249 my machine has broken down twice and the last time took more than 2 weeks to repair i cant remember how many times i called their tech support in shah alam but i remember how i feel when they did not respond as fast as i would like how do you expect to refer someone to this business i am unwilling to introduce my friends and family since most likely i will get blamed if anything goes wrong
2384250 what has happened to amazed aim marketing the well publicised model for entrepreneurship i am truly amazed that so many seem to have something discouraging to say my personal experience is that nobody from office cares to follow up on complaints where is customer service i have asked for my preferred new locations a long time ago but they only give me those i dont like i thought they are supposed to check out the new locations and reply but silence is the game they play
2384251 i think the company expands too fast without paying enough attention to customer service and the fundamentals for quality maintenance it is like what pak lah said malaysia is superb in first class infrastructure but third class mentality in maintenance another get rich quick scheme
2384252 i would propose is to reduce monthly maintenance fee from 25 to 10 25 is illogical as we still have to pay rent water and elec bill in the end considering the bank loan we have to pay its tough to even get to break even point should also be 10 out of our net profit for that matter all cost minus out not from total collection
2384253 what i dont get is why does the machine breaks down at an average of once a month are they using old scrap metal for these machines it certainly isnt worth the rm30k that weve all invested
2384254 the first time my machine broke down i had to report it to shah alam 3 times the person in charge there is either always engaged at a meeting or not in office they didnt log my first 2 reports they had not noted that i had called to complain about the fault when i asked them why the response was so slow the person said that they didnt have enough technicians since many had left the company the second time my machine broke down the owner of the shop i was renting space called me up and told me that they had reported it to airku 5 days before and that the machine was still broken down when i called up shah alam to enquire about the matter i was told the person in charge was engaged forever again i asked the person operator clerk to give me the phone number of the superrvisor she gave me michael tans the mds number which i called the other thing about shah alam is that do not believe it when they say theyll call back they have never called me back who are they always on the line with anyway
2384255 i spent as much time with cindy in washington and arizona as our jobs would allow
2384256 i was separated from carol but our divorce would not become final until february of 1980

2384265 since concerns have been raised about that brief time i am stepping down to avoid distracting from

2384267 the difficulty of charting the waters of islamophobia in this election cycle

2384271 grammer was an actor who signed on to the project after the script was written
2384272 the real triumph of this tour is that we havent strangled each other
2384273 not to say it hasnt crossed my mind or andys or stewarts
2384274 ill do a series of meetings with the hgtv people and some phone calls and from there my life changes
2384275 its all kind of still happening but its full steam ahead toward the show
2384276 the goal is to do a show where people could learn and laugh and not feel that they wasted 30 minutes of their life
2384277 my husband and i have always been on a budget when we try to do things in our own home and with our clients as well
2384278 so the idea is how do you make something cost efficient look like you spent a million bucks
2384279 the first thing you hear when you win the show is your lifes going to change
2384280 you know the payoff will be great but you also know its going to be a ton of work theres a lot of nervous excitement you know youre going to have to produce but luckily for me i have the 100 percent support of my husband and thats what it takes to make this happen
2384281 while i was off filming he cared for the business
2384282 and he even got us more business so hes the unsung hero
2384283 and i was willing to go that extra step to help make it happen but shes the star in our family thats for sure i am so proud of her anyone who knows jen knows she really deserves this
2384284 were walking around in a daze i know our lives are going to change tenfold but its something to look forward to
2384285 cause if you have to do the clap and back away the move the loser is asked to make to give the winner the spotlight then i was going to fall down so i was just thinking how i was going to back away
2384286 my views developed in the course of time but i have always believed in what i did and never acted against it
2384287 the soviet government had let the genie out of the bottle and however hard they tried later they couldnt put it back in
2384288 russia can neither be grasped by the mind nor measured by any common yardstick no attitude to her other than one of blind faith is admissible
2384289 broke russias back the red terror unleashed by its leaders their willingness to drown russia in blood is the first and foremost proof of it
2384290 the bitter russian experience which i have been studying and describing all my life will be for us a lesson that keeps us from new disastrous breakdowns
2384291 i had to drop the hammer im leaving nine each day
2384292 its a lot better but it still bothers me a little bit when i squat

2384300 its the kind of round ive been looking for to get myself back on the leaderboard and feeling the good vibes
2384301 when i got here on tuesday i called home and i said this is the hardest golf course ive ever played
2384302 if i were to play here every day i dont know if i would enjoy it its a very difficult golf course
2384303 i wasnt saying i was better than jay z as a person or rock was greater than hip hop as a thing or whatever it is
2384304 i can say without a doubt i have no feelings like that whatsoever about the jets
2384305 if something happens with the dolphins it will be because of how i feel about the situation and opportunity it wont have anything to do with the new york jets and me trying to prove something
2384306 the most difficult part of the last 24 hours is coming to the realization that youre no longer wanted by the organization
2384307 you spend eight years there and in the blink of an eye youre no longer wanted there thats the crude part of this business thats hard to accept emotionally
2384308 its clear the organization feels i wasnt the quarterback to lead them where they wanted to go i think thats extremely clear otherwise the decision wouldnt have been made and thats fine thats part of being in this business

2384317 he does it because hes in pain from the injuries he got as a prisoner of war his hands hurt constantly so he rubs them together
2384318 mccain saw us excused himself and we three went to the senate dining room for lunch
2384319 during lunch mccain said almost with mischievous glee that he had slipped some highly technical questions to james mcclure to ask mofford questions she wouldnt be prepared to answer or expected to answer
2384320 flabbergasted i asked mccain why would he want to sabotage moffords testimony when in fact the cap was the nonpartisan pet of republicans and democrats such as far left udall and far right goldwater since its inception
2384321 his reply as near as i remember was ill embarrass a democrat any time i get the chance
2384322 ive known cindy since she was a little girl and the hensleys have always been very good to me
2384323 that hurt me more than anything to be set up like that
2384324 he orchestrated a partisan mean spirited and utterly inexcusable hearing designed to embarrass governor mofford by unfairly pressing her only a week into her new job for minute details on the central arizona project which was the most sacrosanct of all issues critical to arizona
2384325 i know that there was quite a little conversation with my staff i know we did ask mofford a number of questions because somebody had told us that she was not well grounded in some of the issues and it was designed to expose her lack of information
2384326 im not saying he wasnt but i just dont remember
2384327 he said i didnt have anything to do with that
2384328 the one about the woman who is attacked on the street by a gorilla beaten senseless raped repeatedly and left to die
2384329 when she finally regains consciousness and tries to speak her doctor leans over to hear her sigh contently and to feebly ask
2384330 you can attribute that to me and hell kill me for it
2384331 he traces his environmental awareness to the sainted rep mo udall an arizona democrat who took mccain as a young congressman under his tutelage to environmentalists thats like saying you learned about civil rights by driving around alabama with martin luther king jr
2384332 mccain was i have to say at the time sympathetic with what we were trying to do but he never came forward and offered any solutions
2384333 soon found he had to stop mccain from using his good name
2384334 you will recall during my speech at the dinner for the president in phoenix i announced that you were going to give half of the funds you raised to the state republican party i am told by the party that you still owe them 35 000 and unless you pay all of it or most of it they cannot meet their payroll next wednesday
2384335 that was devastating to me that he brought in a reporter i thought that was crossing the line and it destroyed me
2384336 i was wearing pepe jeans the day i came to new times so you could interview me for the cindy mccain story
2384337 if a person knows that prescriptions have been written in their name and they never met with the doctor and they dont know the whereabouts of the drugs what is their responsibility and i was told it was my responsibility to turn it in so at that moment i began to cooperate with the dea
2384338 july 27 1992 i have always wondered why john mccain has done nothing to fix the problem
2384339 the aforementioned matters are of great concern to those directly involved but my main concern is the ability of avmt to survive a major shake up
2384340 during my short tenure at avmt i have been surrounded by what on the surface appears to be the ultimate all american family in reality i am working for a very sad lonely woman whose marriage of convenience to a u s senator has driven her to distance herself from friends cover feelings of despair with drugs and replace lonely moments with self indulgences
2384341 he always had his own views of how a newspaper ought to be run and he didnt like the way we ran it
2384342 its a free world so hes welcome to feel that way
2384343 we used to sit in the outer office and listen to him
2384344 others were much more discreet about it for instance jon kyl if he had an issue would call and discuss it and it would be fine
2384345 hed tell editorial boards how awful his hometown paper was
2384346 so id hear from my colleagues around the country that was always fun
2384347 hes a united states senator and you ought to have respect for a united states senator
2384348 in the 1990s the problems people faced were high unemployment and high interest rates
2384349 we are making sure the right advice and support is available at the right time for the minority of borrowers who may need it at the moment because of global economic pressures
2384350 what benefit has the political game been to them in all those years what good the franchise what good socialism or the vested interests of the tories friends
2384351 never in my thirty three years living in glasgow have i ever heard anyone announcing their intention to vote along sectarian lines
2384352 funnily enough people seem to be more upset about the abolition of the 10p tax rate and sleaze than the candidates belief or otherwise in transubstantiation
2384353 funny now that curran is seeking to do the same thing that labour are trying to airbrush that story out of history
2384354 i canvassed for david davis on the eve of the by election the uncertain did not want to discuss we had a single conversation with a man who did raise 42 days he was for locking them up but not on consideration if they were innocent
2384355 as a sticking point for a g8 agreement on specific targets
2384356 the eu and japan had been pressing the g8 to accept the targets without them
2384357 at labours house trained socialists the lowest form of hypocrite
2384358 i am a simple soul and do not claim to understand all of the issues involved but i do know that i would not want the police to have the freedom to haul me off the street lock me up for 42 days without charge without a trial and without me knowing precisely what i was suspected of
2384359 living streets is disappointed at the lack of policies on this issue
2384360 an offensive term for a person who is fanatically dedicated to or seeks to control some activity practice etc
2384361 a nobody called sian a nazi just a socialist read the posts
2384362 f also what right has an out of work it girl got to dictate how our taxes are spent when she currently isnt contributing any of her own
2384363 g yes we are facing global natural resource problems they are not going to be solved by bullying a small minority who need choose or can afford a larger car most modern 4x4s are no bigger than a london taxi a car specifically designed for london streets as it has maximum space and visability with the footprint of a normal saloon car like a taxi most seat seven to declare these cars too big is ludicrous when they are more efficient than most normal cars and contrary to sians velief they are designed for all roads that includes cities to encourage vandalism and vigilante attacks on drivers is scandalous these vehicles are usually cleaner than most older cars and vans as they have catalytic converters yet sian doesnt target these vehicles why only target the vehicles driven by the rich if it is not socialism
2384364 i am thankful for all the efforts made by everyone at amnesty international and all those who took part in actions on my behalf we are united in the struggle for the causes of justice and democracy this struggle is still ongoing
2384365 the greatest surprise of all even for me after eight years spent working as a film critic has been the sustained level of intensely sadistic brutality throughout the film
2384366 the dark knight is a superhero movie and the violence it contains exists within that context
2384367 watching screen violence had changed the frontal lobe brain function of normal adolescents to be more like that of the children with disruptive brain disorders
2384368 i see you are alive see that is a conversation starter and does nto lead to much granted it might not fly too much with hospics care or something like that if the person was just diagnoisis with a grave disease or something
2384369 well the car brokedown again and so and so on
2384370 my prediction on the consequences after the attack on iran
2384371 i am a most unhappy man i have unwittingly ruined my country a great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit our system of credit is concentrated the growth of the nation therefore and all our activities are in the hands of a few men we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men
2384372 authority received as the truth rather than truth as the authority

2384380 this tastes like sweet malt smirnoff ice always goes bad
2384381 looks like dish water smells like starbust the lemon joints drunk lemonade
2384382 its the motivational cocktail it motivates me to move on to the next hook up
2384383 this drink has a positive message but fails to deliver maybe if i was to flip it on 45 so i could dance to it
2384384 all this shit is starting to taste the same this is sweet and boozy it makes me feel 16
2384385 its terrible first sip i feel like im licking a stripper pole the coconut is just too sickening
2384386 a bite off bad apple i now realize i hate green drinks
2384387 incredible hulk green seven out of ten more run than a vw rabbit my dog would love this shes a tough critic

2384393 children have never been very good at listening to their elders but they have never failed to imitate them

2384420 new college is on probation with wasc and may lose its accreditation
2384421 new college is on probation with wasc most private colleges in the bay area have been on probation we look at this as an opportunity to better serve our students
2384422 insist upon ethical relationships in all aspects of our communal life
2384423 serious doubts that the same board and executive leadership that have allowed the problems are now capable of remedying these serious and pervasive matters
2384424 create a structure to aid the full time core faculty of the college in their plans to fulfill the requests of wasc that are essential to maintaining the accreditation of the college
2384425 we the adjunct council in solidarity with the core faculty council ask for cross representation towards our common goals we support the core faculty vote of no confidence and support the call for new administrative leadership further we call for the immediate replacement of the board of trustees president and academic co vice presidents in compliance with the demands of wasc
2384426 subject to special scrutiny and any new site or degree program is subject to review through wascs substantive change process
2384427 gross misapplication of academic advising program administration and program design
2384428 the commission has repeatedly found that in addition to longstanding and ongoing financial challenges new college did not have systems and structures in place in very basic areas of operation including governance faculty oversight of academic matters assessment of student learning and financial management and accounting
2384429 the leadership has not honored the most basic principles of institutional integrity shared governance and sound management
2384430 as noted by the team the dominant administrative perspective would seem to be that the complaints received by wasc are motivated or orchestrated by one or a few disgruntled persons and that the events alleged are virtually without merit new colleges written response confirms this stance by stating the institution can be seen as a target of opportunity particularly for a group who may band together and act in concert selectively representing information in a manner that creates a picture that seems to depict a pattern of more widespread difficulties in operations than is actually the case this view of the state of new college reiterated by you at your appearance before the commission demonstrates a failure to appreciate the severity of new colleges problems and a lack of willingness to address these issues honestly and directly
2384431 the commission has serious doubts that the same board and executive leadership that have allowed the problems described in this letter to persist are now capable of remedying these serious and pervasive matters

2384441 si es una pregunta en la que me formulo una y otra vez y sigo sin entender ni comprender mucho menos el tener una respuesta de ello sigo en el enigma que me ha marcado mi existir tan fuerte tan imponentemente dolorosa no solo perd a mi amada perd a mi m s entra able amiga perd a mi compa era de mis m s dulces sue os a la hora de irme a la tierra de morfeo perd a mi ngel y su c mulo de sentimientos que enamorar an a cualquier mortal a mi sucubo llenandome de lujuria ante mis opacos ojos y de estremecimiento caluroso de mi piel mi sangre y mi alma entera al igual que perd a mi pa o de l grimas cuando me sent a dentro de la eterna melancol a a mi motivo de sonreir en el que amanec a en un nuevo d a he perdido m s que a una mujer he perdido a mi gloria no dejo de pensar que fue lo que te incit a dejarme en el sendero donde caminabamos juntos me atormenta me persigue la desesperaci n por saber la verdad y no solamente una parte quiero respirar el mismo aire indolente en el que has inhalado profundamente pero no puedo no puedo controlar mis l grimas al imaginarte en cada lugar donde camino invadiendome la oscuridad arropandome con sus s banas de soledad su incansable sensaci n aterradora cantandome suavemente a mis oidos las notas del abatimiento mi frustraci n es m s grande cada vez tampoco puedo dejar de sentir rabia de decir palabras de alarido esto ser culpa de un canalla que te enjabon la mente y tus sentimientos hacia mi dios mismo fue quien decidi quitarte de mi camino quiz s verdaderamente y solamente tu fuiste la que decidi dejarme ser mi culpa por todo tantas preguntas sin una respuesta clara y concisa revolviendo mis pensamientos una y otra vez sintiendome culpable y un miserable carente de tu amor cada vez me pierdo en el laberinto de perdici n no tengo quien me guie para salir de ello no deb ste soltar mi mano estoy perdido sin ti porqu te fuiste mi lado no lo entiendo no lo acepto no lo tolero no lo soporto y creo que jam s tendr s el valor para responderme tu me has dicho que encuentre a otra persona mejor que tu yo no lo har no voy a desearte que tengas a otra persona al cual entregarte yo quiero que est s a mi lado y nunca soltarte ante nadie egoismo no importa por donde se quiera observar este sentimiento no puedo enga arme ni por el mayor sentido com n que tenga no deseo olvidarte nunca ni dejar de amarte a n cuando tu me tengas en el ba l empolvado de tus recuerdos la vida de ha arrebatado de la gloria de amarte pero jam s me podr quitar el amor que siento por ti mi peque ita volver a ser el alma que forma parte de las tinieblas infinitas de donde me hab as salvado alguna vez s lo saldr si me das aquella luz de esperanza que alguna vez me iluminabas estar condenado a estar all toda mi vida
2384442 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
2384443 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
2384444 party leader david ford claimed today that the dup and sinn fein do not want the minister to be a member of the executive meaning he or she would have no role in wider issues like the budget
2384445 so called breakthrough over the department of justice amounts to very little
2384446 apparently all the dup and sinn fein have proposed is a minister who would not even be a member of the executive
2384447 how could anyone fulfil a role as important as justice minister in those circumstances
2384448 should be a runaway winner an eye for detail humour and history i want to be him
2384449 depth variety and regular posts and a bit of politics too
2384450 a brilliant mix of humour politics and insightful analysis not just of ni but of british left politics and beyond where else do you get postings in what i assume is serbo croat beside gail walker watch and the photos attaching to the stories are usually hilarious although a disappointing absence of girls aloud as naughty schoolgirls of late
2384451 for its unusual socialist outlook on northern ireland and wider politics his is the perspective of someone who feels not unreasonably that the present party political system leaves his left wing views unrepresented as such he stands aside from the traditional ni partisan discussions a refreshing interesting and nicely written blog
2384452 is written with a certain amount of linquistic flair this is a blogger who clearly enjoys his english he also enjoys reading and gives us book reviews and cultural pieces his political position is self described as liberal unionist but his views are not entirely predictable and the items rather eclectic including a fascination with and dislike for ethnic nationalism in its east european manifestations
2384453 chekov really has a penchant for writing in a way that really grasps the reader
2384454 i hate to say it but chekov does write well
2384455 passionate unionism epitomising the pan uk unionist approach oneill synthesises an incredible amount of material for this blog a blogger with a genuine grasp of his subject
2384456 for the fact that he is in public office and combines council business and interesting outlooks generally
2384457 but only since pol omuiri came on board since then it has moved beyond a party political platform to something more considered and interesting
2384458 a group blog fairly closely associated with an identifiable political party is quite a good thing as it provides a picture of that partys id as well as a space for them to develop their thinking about issues that they will sometimes have to answer for their stance on soonish
2384459 a wee part of the blogosphere where i can be found and i shamelessly do so because it will permit me to state that the blog in question has been nominated four times in political blog categories and lost four times
2384460 i agree with its tone and attitude regarding the north of ireland situation
2384461 ignited has a grasp of the nuts and bolts of politics which i envy reading his pieces always make me view my own stuff as a bit conceptual and airy fairy a blog which is in touch with the unionist grass roots
2384462 fair deal is one of the very few bloggers delivering a dup standpoint in a thoughtful manner i rarely agree with what he says but hes always worth reading damian oloan is an excellent new addition writing coherent and temperate analysis from a liberal nationalist perspective an encouraging indication that moderation is not dead
2384463 fair deal damian oloan tom griffin patrick corrigan and very occasionally ian parsley all are delivering thoughtful and coherent articles analysing different areas of political life here
2384464 almost intimidating erudition from brian crowe as he examines the world from communitarian conservative perspective
2384465 where language literature and politics intersect some thoughtful musings on identity in relation to northern ireland from an irish ex pat
2384466 a tyrone ex pats whimsical blog where politics is viewed through the filters of sport travel identity and more recently fiction
2384467 a new collaborative venture by a number of bloggers braodly on the left it deals in political social and cultural issues as well as some humour
2384468 possibly the most impressive blog there are serious and thoughtful pieces virtually every day on a huge range of topics
2384469 serving up an interesting mix of investigative journalism and local interest
2384470 david vance really out posts the other contributors and hes from the north though id say that his focus is a good deal wider but his stuff on ni is quite astute
2384471 the ira have clearly gone off the stage and have done so since 2005 but theres still attempts being made by some people to drag them back on and i think thats silly
2384472 if were trying to build a normal modern democratic european society there is no excuse for holding onto weapons and ive already started that debate
2384473 i have asked that they produce an ad hoc report clarifying its assessment of the completion of the transformation of pira as set out in its 18th report
2384474 the notion that there has been a steady increase in favour of women taking an equal role in the workplace and away from their traditional role in the home is clearly a myth
2384475 creationism is not for the re class because i believe that it can stand scientific scrutiny and that is a debate which i am quite happy to encourage and be part of the issue for the current education minister caitriona ruane is that she tells us shes all for equality surely if that is the case you cant have one set of interpretations being taught at the expense of others
2384476 the use of the word theory can mislead those not familiar with science
2384477 this is due to an increased disillusionment with current sinn fein strategy i no longer share the belief that this strategy will lead to irish unification it is not just solely about policing i am disillusioned with the current political strategy
2384478 i think this is half baked i dont think were ready for it i dont think the people want it
2384479 i dont know whos going to do it be justice minister because weve not been involved in any discussions on it it appears the alliance havent been properly involved in discussions on it i dont believe the sdlp has
2384480 so how you can announce an agreement without other parties being involved in it escapes me
2384481 stabber who got annoyed at the workers in a local queens deli and decided to stabb them while on camera
2384482 luke is special because he drops things down the stairs
2384483 com a diminui o da taxa de juro as pessoas come aram a procurar o que dava maior rentabilidade no longo prazo
2384484 se voc olhar o mercado de fundos de maneira geral tem um movimento para renda fixa mas na previd ncia diferente
2384485 embora a taxa de juros esteja aumentando o investidor continua pensando no longo prazo inclusive os novos participantes est o pensando em renda vari vel
2384486 ainda que neste ano sofremos com a volatilidade do mercado internacional caracter stica do investidor de a es a calma para investir no longo prazo
2384487 karena adat kebiasaan suku quraisy kebiasaan mereka melakukan perjalanan di musim dingin dan musim panas
2384488 katakan bepergianlah di bumi dan lihatlah bagaimana akibat orang orang zaman dahulu
2384489 its unfortunate that this hospital staff is being trained to work with obese patients with specially trained
2384490 of course by the way are you the owner of a russian team it can be arranged for 40 million per
2384491 what do you think the biggest adjustment has been from college to the pros
2384492 i got my capture card working this time but i couldnt get too many bloopers this week the games i talk about are braid geometry wars 2 splatterhouse 2 sonic the hedgehog wildwest guns and other game dlc enjoy
2384493 never pressure wash screens or windows because the force of the water can damage the units
2384494 also use extreme care when cleaning aluminum mesh since it can be dented or creased if too much pressure is placed on the screen
2384495 part of it is the way we see ourselves but its also how other people see us
2384496 historically weve been denied our manhood so we really want to cling to it as soon as boys are able to walk we call them little man anything that threatens that manhood we dont want
2384497 we know that the rate of suicide is going up in the black community
2384498 and studies show that one of the ways depression manifests itself is through aggression
2384499 if you feel like your life is not worth much then the lives of other people arent worth much either and you behave in a way thats not responsible
2384500 im not saying that depression robs you of discerning right and wrong
2384501 im saying if youre looking for causes dont overlook depression
2384502 of course we didnt score and when you dont score youre not going to win
2384503 i had been told fabulous legends of a prince charming since my cradle days but i never thought i would ever behold one in flesh manvendra is truly charming
2384504 had he been a frog and i had caught him i would have taken good care never to de metamorphose him with a kiss
2384505 if the gay movement needs a paradise sweden is the place the veritable valhalla
2384506 here i have seen the incredible members of the parliament cabinet and people from socio religio political spheres replete with multi gender proclivities hobnob without the blinking of an eye
2384507 in india the hypocrisy and worse the cowardice is nauseating in our parliament and state legislatures homosexuality is and has always been rampant
2384508 but when we the gay movement strive to overturn a senseless law will any single one of these stand up and support the proposal
2384509 the draconian ipc section 377 making homosexuality a crime has no bearing on the reality of our times leave alone the times when it was imposed upon an unsuspecting public unsuspecting because the illiterate masses were attuned to following official diktats without a word and those who could understand were too cowardly to raise a voice
2384510 get our presence felt in the legislatures of india starting with the rajya sabha lok sabha the state legislatures and down the line
2384511 there are ways to go about it get yourself elected and then show the rainbow colours the gay plumage but we would never wish to hide behind subterfuge
2384512 caring people like k sujata rao director general of indias aids body naco have urged me but i have not yet felt ready to abandon the field work i an engaged in fulltime
2384513 i am all for representation for our harassed community mind you it is by no means a minority community our sheer volume and weight can and will be effectively harnessed as our community inexorably makes itself seen heard and felt
2384514 also i feel that others like my most revered mentor and friend the most heroically outspoken champion of gay rights in india ashok row kavi merit the order of precedence
2384515 with his social clout he could flush out many a crypto gay parliamentarian and assorted establishment icons into open
2384516 he would always take the time to talk with me after mass he was a wonderful man i got to observe him in the way he dealt with others of all faiths he was a very humanistic christian and taught me a lot
2384517 this is the time of the year to be mindful of it
2384518 were pretty much on course to where we were last year in terms of counties
2384519 the goal is to make sure theres not another family that will go through what we want through
2384520 thats a lot more manpower they can cover a lot of territory
2384521 the way the game is played it puts it closer to election time
2384522 i want to make a statement i want a lot of family members there i want a lot of signatures
2384523 obviously the more money you bring in the more you can do
2384524 gannon and duarte are not ones to stay in five star hotels and eat in five star restaurants they want to stretch the money as far as they can go
2384525 theres been quite a few whether its been because of friday or the day i dont know
2384526 youll see things like that so that they can be married on a specific day such as valentines day or new years day
2384527 most of the time its superstition good luck that type of thing
2384528 its a huge convention center and theres probably 500 people watching
2384529 finding all your pieces identifying all your pieces right away
2384530 had his meter spun he would have had a world record
2384531 the nice part about having eric this year is we trained against each other
2384532 after the august floods the village wanted to find a way to help people
2384533 i appreciate that the village is trying to help but they need to fix the sewers first

2384578 what do you think the biggest adjustment has been from college to the pros
2384579 in a highly competitive marketplace it is very difficult for one or a few institutions to hold the line on best practices or to stand on the sidelines in the face of booming markets
2384580 financial institutions must be subject to a higher degree of official oversight than is necessary for virtually all other forms of commercial enterprise however official supervision is not a substitute for effective management of financial institutions
2384581 whats needed is a form of private initiative that will complement official oversight by insisting on industry practices that will help mitigate systemic risk
2384582 were very fortunate weve had people come to conshohocken to invest and develop
2384583 at the same time because of the success of conshohocken our change from a blue collar to a white collar community weve lost some things towns can be a victim of their own success its time we add something for the residents
2384584 and we may still move the borough offices in there theres been no decision
2384585 i cant think of any one reason on why i want to be a surgeon but i can think of a thousand reasons why i should quit they make it hard on purpose there are lives in our hands there comes a moment when its more than just a game and you either take that step forward or turn around and walk away i could quit but heres the thing i love the playing field
2384586 the will of god will never take you where the grace of god will not protect you
2384587 france 24 met a former wall street trading star joseph jett in the 90s he worked for a large new york firm kidder peabody kp fourteen years later joe jett accepted to give a version of his demise in a france 24 interview france 24 contacted jetts former colleagues but many refused to answer our questions most of them still work in the banking sector and have close ties with general electric the us heavyweight and former owner of kp those who dared to speak out were unananimous jett couldnt have operated alone his managers must have known what was going on
2384588 there must be clearly a distinction between the fog and pollution
2384589 the fog you see is based on the basis of humidity and heat it does not mean this fog is the same as pollution there can be pollution but the fog is not necessarily pollution
2384590 they do not have the same confidence they once had can we return sport to its very essence to the fair play concept we must if we do not then part of the world as weve known it for all of our lives is going to leave us
2384591 the public will desert any sport in time if theyre not satisfied by its integrity
2384592 there is a level of sophistication and intelligence that is evolving all the time
2384593 sure 90 of science fiction is crud thats because 90 of everything is crud
2384594 which concentrates on many of these teachers via satellite and cable tv in south wales the main adherents are pastored by ray bevan in kings church newport but the influence is also noticeable in the elim and assemblies of god pentecostal movements what is the attitude of word faith teachers the vibrant message delivered with great authority through these media and seemingly backed by scripture and buttressed by claims of the miraculous has led many astray these teachers often deliver cautions against those who would criticize their doctrines nay sayers
2384595 or lack of belief in healing or demons or the miraculous
2384596 until his death in 1948 kenyons gospel publishing society published materials from his writings and broadcasts read
2384597 2 corinthians 5 17 is recreated as a new species of being
2384598 you see man is a spirit being he is in the same class with god he was created in the image and likeness of god he had to be in order to become a partaker of the divine nature when he sinned he became a partaker of satans nature selfishness the part of man that is re created in sic his spirit god imparts to our spirit his own nature eternal life a new species of being that never existed before
2384599 jesus is no longer the only begotten son of god
2384600 we are the word made flesh just as jesus was
2384601 is there a god beside me yea there is no god i know not any
2384602 gloria copeland do you think that the punishment for our sin was to die on a cross
2384603 by following satan instead of god man then gave up the divine nature and took on the nature of satan
2384604 the second ploy is that of denying the validity of a passage that does not square with word faith teaching concerning the statement of
2384605 has unlimited power to create his own reality through positive confession capps in his publication
2384606 you have to believe that those things that you say everything that you say will come to pass
2384607 man was created in gods class a spirit being very capable of operating on the same level of faith as god this is not theory it is fact it is spiritual law it works every time it is applied correctly to imitate god you must talk like him and act like him
2384608 the word of god conceived in the heart formed by the tongue and spoken out of the mouth is creative power the spoken word will work for you as you continually confess it
2384609 well now you dont have a human do you no you are one you dont have a god in you you are one
2384610 as a believer you have the same spiritual capacity that jesus has your spirit is just as big as gods because you are born of him
2384611 from god and have everything that he says pre supposes that man knows what is best in every situation
2384612 despite all the fantastic convolutions that word faith teachers go through to try to explain the nature of pauls thorn in the flesh
2384613 believers voice of victory trinity broadcasting network videotape january 20 1991
2384614 ever increasing faith trinity broadcasting network videotape december 9 1990
2384615 for ye know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his poverty might be rich
2384616 2 corinthians 8 9 we are made rich in spiritual rewards on earth
2384617 unfortunately the word faith teachers never mention the casualties of their deception which are often picked up by orthodox christian counselors
2384618 once faced with this they either admit hat word faith teachings are fallacious and throw themselves into the arms of a loving sovereign god or they begin to consciously deny reality
2384619 coupled with a carefully conceived positive confession is really the only way to produce results because such methods release gods ability to bring about the things desired
2384620 often leads to some rather interesting instructions on how to
2384621 you checkbook you youve never been so prosperous since i owned you youre just jammed full of money
2384622 youre whole body why you just function so beautifully and so well why body you never have any problems youre a strong healthy body
2384623 release satanic powers say the word faith teachers the tongue a creative
2384624 and not almighty god and was pre existent as michael the archangel
2384625 he hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
2384626 prevention is straightforward prevent bites and vaccinate those at risk of bites
2384627 the waraos told us it was because there were too many bats that were biting the children
2384628 it is normal for the japanese at least those of my age
2384629 i wanted to work for trading firms to deal with the foreign people
2384630 we were basically a latecomer in the japanese domestic market the founder of sanyo worked for panasonic in its early days then he left the company and started sanyo electric in 1945 so because we were late in the japanese domestic market our focus has been on offshore markets
2384631 it is wonderful that our nation has made a commitment and this administration deserves a lot of credit for designating the worlds largest marine reserve but there is a responsibility that goes along with that
2384632 unfortunately in recent years the u s has not made picking up trash in our most special places in the ocean a priority
2384633 decided to reduce its level of commitment to removing marine debris and only address new accumulations
2384634 the administration is not keeping pace and this is disappointing
2384635 it is very disappointing here you have this designation as a monument and there has been less visible activity going on in the monument
2384636 additional cleanup and prevention resources are needed to protect this marine national monument
2384637 its asking a lot for a monument proclamation to do that but you have to start someplace
2384638 we can pick up plastic off the beach from now until the end of time but unless people stop putting it in the ocean our problem will never go away
2384639 jangan terlalu lama nak sebab anak anjing di area itu cepat sekali laku terjual
2384640 tidak pak saya yakin anjing itu akan tetap berada di sana untuk menungguku kembali
2384641 there are still some aspects of the deal that arent complete
2384642 lakeland has had the experience of being in the east before and it was pretty expensive for them
2384643 i knew the twins do a great job with their pitching staff

2384650 the miracle front office staff has allowed me the freedom to gain a knowledge of everything that goes into making them what they are today
2384651 this program is one of the best things we do in this league and i congratulate the general managers on their dedication and emphasis in administering this program the purpose of the program is to send a message that an education is key to success in life

2384668 tentunya suara tawa tergantung pada jenis kelamin tapi daya tariknya sangat ditentukan situasi dan kondisi orang itu dan lingkungan sekitar termasuk siapa yang diajak tertawa
2384669 bila orang sudah tertarik akan kemurahan senyum anda maka anda bisa membuatnya lebih tertarik atau dibikin biasa biasa saja dengan mengatur nada dan intonasi tawa
2384670 we have to be competitive salary wise there are other reasons to move to b c but salary is one that people take into consideration
2384671 this is a gold medal performance in elitism and arrogance
2384672 i dont know what world the government and premier are living in but its not the world the people of this province are living in
2384673 first we had the 30 per cent mla pay increase then a variety of municipal pay increases and now huge senior level bureaucrat pay increases we are on a dangerous trajectory with no end in sight
2384674 it definitely wouldnt be information that was intended for him or for anyone for that matter
2384675 the information you are in possession of is obviously sensitive and sharing that outside of you having it now could jeopardize the safety of members
2384676 im not sure what the call out was for but i dont want to see somebody get hurt over this
2384677 it seems like a rather significant screw up im not sure if the screw up is with bell or aliant the provider of our pager or whether its even related
2384678 i think his number was probably put in there in error
2384679 im sure there is limited information as to what you need to bring and where you need to meet
2384680 the vast majority of times the rcmp tactical squad is sitting off somewhere in the dark and never seen
2384681 prior to this students had to drive down randall road to college green drive and then wind back around campus

2384688 in my failure to perform my public duty i have brought shame and disgrace to myself and my loved ones

2384690 a bizarre and situationally driven form of self destructive behaviour
2384691 he indicated he was in toronto the police have not advised me the details of the negotiations
2384692 im sure you know thats why hes trying to negotiate he is facing extradition and a six year sentence and additional sentence in respect to these new charges
2384693 i dont expect that i will be asking for the maximum sentence but i will be asking for a substantial sentence
2384694 we cant really talk about anything that were doing with this file
2384695 i have no idea why mr tahvili is negotiating now
2384696 its ongoing were still following up leads and its a sensitive investigation and there isnt anything at this time that we can say publicly about it having said that were still asking for help from the public in order to locate him
2384697 were not in a position to make public what information we have
2384698 its easier to do it is bigger it includes upper manhattan
2384699 for all those reasons and the fact that georgia has demonstrated that it is a close ally we cannot simply sit by and say so be it what does south ossetia mean to us
2384700 we are asking our friends and the united states among them to somehow to try to mediate and try to persuade russia to stop this military aggression and invasion of georgia
2384701 the olympics shouldnt have been offered to china on the basis of their human rights record
2384702 the olympics for china is a giant spectacle a game but for us its much more than that its a chance to call attention to what is happening in tibet
2384703 its important that we show the world that we stand up for those in prison and dying
2384704 i threw the ball a lot better than the linescore said
2384705 i just really got outpitched theres nothing really more to say
2384706 that last start i was trying to get out alive
2384707 i didnt care if i gave up 100 runs that game i was so beat out there i was so exhausted out there
2384708 he was attacking the zone with like nine pitches it seemed like
2384709 when i hit it and drew caught it i didnt know where it went
2384710 i thought it kicked away from him just trying to make something positive here hoping we can get a run to score o c did a good job reading the throws
2384711 once he got out of that jam it affected the rest of the night
2384712 he did a good job coming back at us and pitching seven strong innings we didnt do much to him
2384713 he doesnt bother me as much as some of the other guys
2384714 when i pitch i try to think the other team is the best in baseball
2384715 can feel the difference see a little more life on the ball

2384764 ryanair is pursuing legal actions in a number of european countries to bring an end to this unlawful and anti consumer activity
2384765 ryanair will introduce new procedures to cancel all passenger bookings made through screenscraping websites we believe this is a quicker and more effective way of discouraging this unlawful activity
2384766 we are stunned that ryanair is treating its customers in this way at a time when many people are struggling to afford holidays overseas airlines should be finding ways to make it easier for families to book and travel not making it even harder
2384767 this move by ryanair can only penalise their own customers and damage their reputation as an airline and we would hope that they would seriously reconsider what they are doing

2384786 you have to have something sacred to you and the people around you i shared so much of my life i should have something to hold on to
2384787 what obama represents is we as a people are part of the american dream
2384788 we were left out of the dream at a certain point now the dream is you can be anything and its not cliche
2384789 it is categorically untrue that loreal paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the ad campaign
2384790 funerals are about journalism who was there and who wasnt thats not about estelle
2384791 we adored her to tell you the truth her passing is tough on us but its a blessing for her shes been so ill for so long shes in a better place now wherever she is
2384792 i am close to signing a deal to write a book
2384793 but everyone should hold on i have lots of stories ive never told and they will all be in my book
2384794 its an afghan government plan he gates has endorsed and we are now working to achieve
2384795 now who would pay for that those are the discussions we are just now beginning to enter into it would be wrong to assume we are going to shoulder this burden alone
2384796 we are going to work with our allies to determine how we can finance this necessary growth
2384797 quality versus quantity we are focused there on remediating and reforming the police forces that currently exist
2384798 the main additional responsibility he is assuming is for the training mission which is just an essential mission for the afghans and for us
2384799 the sooner they are a capable fighting force and can assume responsibility for protecting their own people and their borders the sooner us forces and the worlds forces can come out
2384800 we are looking for options and ways we can streamline the command and control arrangements for us forces in

2384805 we strongly believe there is credible evidence to show that
2384806 we are very disappointed by this and find it incredibly ironic that the same government that put the rifle in his hand is now seeking to up the ante because of his alleged use of that rifle
2384807 weve got to remember that everybody in fallujah had a rifle good guys and bad guys and to single out sgt nazario for the alleged use of that rifle in the charged offense really paints the picture of what the government seeks to do here
2384808 children need to be nurtured educated and cared for not thrown into the frontline of social reform
2384809 they are not and cannot be social engineers and social workers and surrogate parents as well as subject teachers all rolled into one
2384810 i used to get up in the morning and go to an office now i get up and go to a plane my kids still dont care where i am
2384811 theyve always known two parents to work in the household and as long as were back in time for bedtime they could care less where we are

2384859 well you might change your mind after you see this
2384860 amelia and i got them last year for halloween theres a black pair too what do you think
2384861 it must be because im in the presence of someone heavenly
2384862 if i knew that angels were like this i would have prayed to them instead of to god
2384863 promoting a peace and a culture of non violence a collective responsibility we are all part of one country ghana for which we are jointly responsible
2384864 war is a horrible thing and i know ghanaians would shy away from tendencies that can destroy the country
2384865 el agravio a la sociedad exige unidad y medidas dr sticas de las autoridades para frenar de una vez por todas esta grave situaci n as entiende el gobierno federal este justo reclamo no detendremos nuestros esfuerzos hasta que los criminales enfrenten todo el peso de la ley
2384866 ive started from many positions at kentucky speedway and its a track where you can pass
2384867 if you have a good car with the tires that firestone is giving us this year you can move pretty quickly i thought the track was better this year than last year i think theyve done a great job
2384868 dan was struggling earlier today and i was certainly hoping he could be a bit better maybe one spot better but not faster than me
2384869 its a good starting position for team target to be one and three i have to thank the team a lot they have certainly prepared great cars especially in qualifying
2384870 hopefully we can lead a lot of laps gain a lot of points and close in on that championship
2384871 there are four races left and i want to finish for the team very strong and thats what im focused on they can expect a very strong effort from the no 10 car tomorrow night scott has been very quick and thats what the benchmark is for tomorrow
2384872 thats where we were struggling a little bit on qualifying were still a little bit off but any day youre mixed up there with the ganassis it has to be a good day since theyre on a roll here
2384873 welcome to michigan we only gank 4 35 of your income off the top
2384874 there was no significant loss of life in those towers not a one
2384875 this attack happened in my hometown a hometown i do not live in or work in because of illegal behavior i hope those who swiped my ability to live there enjoy the message they got from god today
2384876 in that building existed little more than a bunch of companies which
2384877 now you know what its like to see your horrors mocked the way mine have been thats not mental illness thats a political message apparently delivered quite brilliantly
2384878 there was no significant loss of life in those towers their own evil
2384879 the effectiveness of stephane dions carbon tax could not be predicted or even measured after the fact
2384880 significant fuel reduction behaviour due to the 1970s oil crisis
2384881 october 16 1973 saudi arabia iran iraq abu dhabi kuwait and qatar unilaterally raise posted prices and announce production cuts
2384882 in the industrialized countries especially the united states the crisis caused the most hardship to the unemployed the marginalized social groups certain categories of aging workers and increasingly by younger workers schools and offices in the u s often closed down to save on heating oil and factories cut production and laid off workers in france the oil crisis ended the trente glorieuses 30 years of very high economic growth and began the ensuing decades of permanent unemployment in australia heating oil ceased being considered an appropriate winter heating fuel in canada the industrial east suffered many of the same problems of the united states the federal government attempted to correct this imbalance through the creation of the government owned petro canada and later the national energy program these efforts produced a great deal of anger in the west producing a sentiment of alienation that has remained a central element of canadian politics to this day overall the oil embargo had a sharply negative effect on the canadian economy the economic malaise in the united states easily crossed the border and increases in unemployment and stagflation hit canada as hard as the united states despite canadian fuel reserves
2384883 how much did the price have to rise in order to effect significant fuel reduction behaviour
2384884 since oil demand falls little with price rises prices had to rise dramatically to reduce demand
2384885 the carter administration began a phased decontrol of oil prices
2384886 basic human rights should be protected thats how i feel
2384887 its not going to go further than that its not going to go less than that
2384888 its opened my eyes there are so many different cultures and ways of looking at the world you have to learn not always to judge just respect
2384889 when i hit my driver like i did today this is an easy sport
2384890 its the kind of round ive been looking for to get myself back on the leaderboard and feeling the good vibes
2384891 when i got here on tuesday i called home and i said this is the hardest golf course ive ever played
2384892 if i were to play here every day i dont know if i would enjoy it its a very difficult golf course
2384893 im not that aggressive if im not hitting my driver good
2384894 if im hitting bad shots with it you dont hit it as much you hit it right where youve looked whale away
2384895 if youre hitting where youre aiming it every time youre hitting good
2384896 my senior year of high school i went out and watched tiger
2384897 a lot of the players they said hit the ball really long
2384898 its just a matter of taking care of the opportunities that im given theres weeks where you can play your best and not win and theres weeks where you can kind of stumble your way in and win
2384899 unfortunately things didnt happen for me on the back nine its very difficult and this is a major
2384900 theres a lot of golf left out here and the golf course is very difficult
2384901 so i think that it wont be overly difficult if you play well to make up some ground
2384902 weve missed a little bit on qualifying hopefully it looks like the car is pretty strong this week
2384903 we probably should have a lot bigger lead than weve got right now
2384904 weve to do what were capable of and hopefully the last four races we can string out that lead a little bit more
2384905 its still like 60 points its still 200 points in the game and what we need to do is just keep pushing as hard as we can
2384906 now its about going out there taking chances and trying to make some gains
2384907 definitely if i win some questions are going to stop so thats good
2384908 there were some research and development things we wanted to try in the trailer but we just didnt have the time
2384909 our target is for a top 10 obviously if we could come away with that wed feel great
2384910 creo que si la energ a sexual est ah no importa lo que haces
2384911 me gusta ir a los lugares de strip las mujeres son muy sexys y los strippers tienen los mejores cuerpos
2384912 tienes que dejarte ir y s lo sentirlo est bien que aprendas pasos y movimientos pero lo mejor es dejarlo sentir
2384913 si tambi n le ofrecen ser rockera o tapa de playboy supongo que tendr la edad para decidir sola por supuesto que estar a a favor de su carrera
2384914 fun and exciting work atmosphere we get to listen to music we laugh a lot and we help our clients succeed
2384915 i knew the bride when she used to rock n roll
2384916 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2384917 joe crede isnt going to help me right now good luck when crede is here ill be glad to put him in
2384918 im not going to put any timetables on his return
2384919 when he can come and play again hell let us know
2384920 im not going to say yes or no because i cant read his mind but i trust joe because when hes hurt he tells me right away joe has played with pain the last three years when he says he cant go i know how bad the pain is i dont think hes doing that
2384921 he will dictate how long hes going to be out there
2384922 i expect him to throw a pretty good game and hopefully we can keep him out there every five days
2384923 if youre on a pitch count youre not in the pennant race
2384924 we need a win we dont need to build people its too late
2384925 when hes good hes really good when hes bad hes really bad
2384926 today was one of those days when my best pitch my cutter was probably my worst pitch
2384927 i had the changeup working i threw a lot of curveballs for strikes and i had good command and good speed on my fastball it was one of those days when my best pitch wasnt even working for me
2384928 i thought it kicked away from right fielder j d drew
2384929 then i looked up and the balls on its way to second and i was like oh shoot im out
2384930 his bat was on my fastball so then i throw a slider and i just sped up his bat thats why he got a good swing i should have thrown my fastball where i was throwing it and not thrown the slider
2384931 49 prior to plaintiffs first use in commerce of the term the word pivot had not been used in any seduction context by any seduction guru in this context the tactic and the term which describes it were developed and debuted solely by plaintiff
2384932 i was sent from 5 diff sources the same letter
2384933 the random use of the word in one posting on a completely unrelated topic
2384934 vance do you realistically think this nut case can harm your personal or professional reputation
2384935 that i couldnt show damages because no one would reasonably rely on his statements in making a character judgment nor give his comments any weight in deciding to hire me as a photographer and they would probably say that nothing that goes on in asf reasonably impinges on my life now or in the future regarding statements made there
2384936 tell us all again about this lawyer in mass you have ready to sue me is there a reason why you wont name him her besides the reason there isnt any lawyer and its just you spewing another cowardly impotent threat just what is stopping u
2384937 dear sir i believe that the above is a scurrilous lie and is false
2384938 furthermore for you to claim that one such as ray gordon even rises
2384939 theres going to be a lot of drama and people saying i lost on the scale thats some expletive
2384940 i was willing to put my life on the line to make this happen i was going to win this tournament i was going to make sure that everyone back home knew that i had given my best and i gave it my whole effort i look back at it and know i gave it 110 percent ive been through cutting weight so many times i know the process this time my body wouldnt do it i just stood up and then i was looking at the ceiling
2384941 honestly this was the first time in five years that i came to a tournament and everything was working even though my shoulder is hurting and will need surgery after the olympics i had no other problems i came in 100 percent healthy
2384942 this has no impact todays announcement is about redeeming clients ars auction rate securities holdings
2384943 we trusted ubs and paid millions of dollars to them and still have no solution to our credit crisis
2384944 they turned their back on us just when we needed their support
2384945 nhhelco is a major participant in funding students loans for new new hampshire
2384946 we are staying on the course we are saying to ubs this should be addressed and if not we are going to take regulatory action soon
2384947 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2384948 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
2384949 the additional cost of carrying unnecessary fuel adversely affects americans financial success
2384950 we didnt see any proposed changes we thought needed to be made
2384951 to either not stop for fuel when needed or to carry insufficient amounts of fuel
2384952 adding fuel indiscriminately reduces profit sharing and possibly pension funding
2384953 its a safety of flight issue and it needs to be treated as such
2384954 if dispatchers and pilots are saying the airlines are pressuring them and its having a chilling effect on the decisions they make every day in regard to the fuel loads and it looks its like eroding the authority of the pilot in command then that issue needs the attention of the government regulators who are there to oversee the system
2384955 preseason is really important to me like all these guys
2384956 were working hard and this is where you get better
2384957 we will just have to keep working on all the areas that we have identified that need improvement a lot of guys got playing time some guys got quite a bit
2384958 i dont think it is very different than the other positions
2384959 sometimes the player doesnt have the opportunity to be productive on a particular play whether that is because of what the other team is doing or maybe because of another breakdown
2384960 then there are other times when he does in the end the bottom line is how do you feel the players production on any given play is rated toward the potential or what he could have done or he should have been able to do in that particular situation
2384961 im sure the next time he gets an opportunity to play he will try to take some of the experiences he had last night and build off those
2384962 i think every day is important whether its a game or practice or a meeting
2384963 its definitely a new experience but i was prepared to play well by the coaches
2384964 you just have to come back next week watch some film try to get better and move on
2384965 committing to hold all our governments to a higher standard of peace justice and respect for human dignity wherever they fall short
2384966 esqueda es uno de los j venes prometedores estoy hablando con l necesita un poco de continuidad pero seguramente va a ser una de las grandes promesas tiene unas condiciones b rbaras t cnicamente es uno de los jugadores m s dorados del futbol mexicano
2384967 me parece b rbaro porque creo que tenemos que dar el apoyo como club porque los jugadores son mexicanos y apoyar a eriksson no s lo a l sino a la selecci n mexicana me parece que hay un compromiso de parte de los clubes a entregar lo mejor lo que l elija del equipo porque est representando al pa s y eso es lo m s importante
2384968 no alcanza pero los compromisos que tenemos los clubes los campeonatos que hay pero me parece que es importante que toda la semana tenga continuidad y eso es lo que eriksson est buscando el poder trabajar al menos tres d as y as poder conocer mejor al grupo
2384969 es normal que en este tipo de plantillas donde todos quieren jugar por supuesto ahora tanto carlos s nchez como ismael van a tener la oportunidad de hacerlo y demostrar su categor a pero no s lo alcanza hablar sino que hay que demostrar dentro de la cancha su capacidad y jerarqu a

2384991 hey you i really enjoyed dinner last night estelle tasted my foot later and said that your juices are delicious who knew you could be so damn sexy anyway meet me at the book emporium at 3 30 today i want to get you something ciao amelia
2384992 i was just thinking about a dream i had about you last night
2384993 well we were in my bed and im not sure how we got there but there we were and you were
2384994 im sorry im not a very good story teller am i
2384995 well we were under the covers and it was getting really hot both of us were all sweaty and you were rubbing yourself up against me grinding into me
2384996 of course you were oh and you were pressing my arms against the mattress so that i couldnt move
2384997 my arms werent in pain at all and it actually felt really good you holding me down like that
2384998 mmh hmm and how long have you known that you were into s amp m
2384999 k well cross that river another day so what else happened
2385000 ah well i think we should try to reconstruct the dream sometime i for one would like to see if pinning you down is as hot as you make it sound
2385001 is called venus in furs you see everyones first post at our forum must contain a quote from an erotic book so i want you to read through this and find a passage that you like
2385002 so then i can start posting hey i havent even been to your site yet whats it called
2385003 words made flesh the name came from the concept that some people like to take actual sex scenes from books and act them out
2385004 but of course i told you how intellectual stimulation gets me hot why do you think that im attracted to you you dont think that youre a good storyteller but youve shown me your essays and i think they are really good
2385005 it doesnt matter what the subject or the format is the fact is that youve got talent youre problem is that youve been suckered into thinking that your self esteem should come from other people thats why youre so invested in the concept of love
2385006 love is not some magical state that inspires fairy tales love is just an emotion and emotions are just chemical reactions you cant let yourself be enslaved by them you have to be the one to take control of them in this world unconditional love will turn you into a doormat
2385007 so what youre just supposed to go through life with a heart of stone and never care about anything
2385008 see there you go again life is not black and white im not saying to completely forget love but you need to realize that compassion is a choice not an obligation
2385009 you see that guy over there i couldnt give a fuck whether he lives or dies know why
2385010 because he feels the same about me or maybe he doesnt want me to die but only because im hot but do you think that i would say the same thing about you if you stop and think about it youll realize that my compassion for you is much more genuine when i dont share it with everyone else in the world now listen i gotta go so heres your book i already paid for it buy yourself a drink something not too sweet and think about what i said k
2385011 i had a headache this morning i felt very bad i couldnt imagine how i would shoot feeling this bad
2385012 especially since its the first gold medal of the olympics i feel amazing
2385013 as for the final i wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2385014 im more proud of her than if i was to do it myself
2385015 i did my part i mean half of my job is done
2385016 i know i would do good even if he wasnt here if he couldnt be here for some reason i know he would do great if i wasnt here for him
2385017 its going to be a very emotional day but it wont be sombre
2385018 we are celebrating his life and it is a chance for the girls to tell everyone just how much they thought of him
2385019 i still cant believe it happened we still expect to wake up from it all
2385020 my daughters have flashbacks we are like shells on the outside we are okay its like having an
2385021 garrys life was taken so needlessly and you never get over that
2385022 it would help us and everybody to have a viable walkable downtown district
2385023 i am truly honored that the supreme court had the confidence in me to name me to this prestigious post
2385024 i look forward to the challenges in serving the people of illinois as one of its appellate judges
2385025 mary is a hard working judge whose love of the law is exceeded only by her willingness to study it
2385026 she will apply a steady hand to cases presented for her review
2385027 even during my days as a practicing attorney i wanted to be a member of a reviewing court
2385028 i worked hard and studied hard and todays announcement is really a dream come true
2385029 i could not think of a better candidate for the post
2385030 mary has experience as a trial attorney and a trial judge and we need people on the appellate court who have spent time in the trenches and know what we go through on a day to day basis
2385031 did you find a quote that was to your liking
2385032 yes as a matter of fact i read through the entire book
2385033 yep and i have to say that i can totally see severins point of view
2385034 hey if it werent for us submissive ones you strong ones would have nothing to dominate
2385035 my love was like a profound a bottomless abyss into which i kept sinking deeper and deeper from which nothing could save me
2385036 you have so much more strength than you give yourself credit for i bet you thought you knew how i would react to that quote didnt you i could tell by the way you spoke and yet you stood your ground because its what you believe in
2385037 listen sweetheart dont ever think that im going to judge you for the way you think hell estelle isnt exactly my cerebral twin either but our differences give us things to learn from each other now listen youre going to need to gather all of your strength for what we have planned tonight

2385045 you want to see me with another fine ass quit being such a smart ass
2385046 well one of the perks of having estelle as my bitch was that she told me everything theres this little site that they made up a kind of lesbians who are too afraid to live in the real world anonymous i got initiated into it by her personally and im willing to bet that sophia did too you know now that i think about it sophias never actually seen me before has she
2385047 you know your attempt to sound cold only make you sound more cute
2385048 that little stunt you pulled cost me my boyfriend he never wants to see me again or either of you
2385049 you stupid fuck whats wrong with you what did you think would happen if you told him
2385050 maybe relationships dont mean anything to you and little miss whore toy but to me theyre based on trust
2385051 it was a mistake he swore hed never do it again
2385052 look im sorry but i talked to her the other day and
2385053 he went over to her house one night when you were studying for finals
2385054 now isnt that better than that bitch you used to go out with
2385055 in fact that whore amelia stole my girlfriend from me too
2385056 oh shit you mean youre not a chick i thought this was a strap on
2385057 are you suggesting that what you two did was for my own good
2385058 that boy toy was broken and it was time to throw him out
2385059 i loved him yes he made a mistake but i forgave him thats what you do for love
2385060 dont you get it you dont mean to him what he does to you

2385070 we werent sure how youd take to what im about to tell you so we figured wed you know
2385071 estelle and i have been working on creating an adult community the theme behind it is erotic literature
2385072 and some of what weve come across in old literature is just so amazing there is some profound philosophy
2385073 it tastes best when you combine the cold with the hot
2385074 you know that everyone says that plot ruins porn right
2385075 we think that theres nothing wrong with combing physical indulgences with intellectual ones they really have much more in common than people think and quite frankly i find myself quite aroused at intellectual stimulation

2385078 mrs edwards has survived treatment for breast cancer and it is not surprising that coming out the other side of such an ordeal she has managed to find real joyfulness in her life thats a blessing im both happy for elizabeth and grateful that she has reminded me reminded all of us that every life has its share of gifts and burdens and that if we must endure the burdens we ought to try to remember to find the joy in the gifts indeed joyfulness is something i need to work on myself and hey i can feel some joy coming on for all of us on november 8th

2385080 we urge an immediate ceasefire in the fighting in south ossetia and for a resumption of direct dialogue between all parties
2385081 an immediate end of the armed clashes and direct talks between the parties
2385082 the european union calls for a dialogue between all parties which is the only way to a lasting solution of the crisis
2385083 perhaps the closest you can get today to experiencing the old soviet union as well as a good place to get the flavor of a good old fashioned cold war style proxy war between the united states and russia
2385084 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives

2385104 where are you tempted to give or cave just a little bit on your convictions you dont think you should physically be involved with someone until marriage but just a little kissing wont hurt you dont want to live under the pressure of debt but just a little debt wont hurt you want to honor god with your speech but just a little off color joking wont hurt you want to honor god with your eyes but just a little porn wont hurt you want to be healthy but just a little desert wont hurt you want to be productive but just a little more sleep wont hurt you want to have a great family but just a little more time in the office wont hurt people dont usually throw their life away in one big flub up they usually do it little bit by little bit 10 a little extra sleep a little more slumber a little folding of the hands to rest 11 then poverty will pounce on you like a bandit scarcity will attack you like an armed robber where are you tempted to give just a little bit
2385105 we find that abms decision to lead their workers to that room under false pretenses to be deplorable
2385106 these tactics are not just morally unjust but it does nothing to deal with the underlying problem of our broken immigration system
2385107 our policy is full compliance with the law and as such we cooperated with immigration and customs enforcement in this matter
2385108 if we were to find out later that that wasnt the case then we would terminate the contract

2385111 junior guard patrick beverley will not compete for the razorbacks in the 2008 09 basketball season
2385112 about a half hour later we go out for a cigarette break and this lady said youve got to get out of there its on fire we saw the smoke come down after that i grabbed the kids but left everything else in there
2385113 it was scary for a little bit thank god everyone got out ok
2385114 it was quick but it burned a long time it seemed like it took awhile to get out the fire
2385115 since we were on the sixth floor we were shouting down to the firefighters that it was in the center of the roof
2385116 we explored options on checks for two b 737 400 aircraft once space became available at our tullamarine facility a decision was taken to have the work done there
2385117 now is the time qantas should sit down with us to commit now to maintaining maintenance operations onshore
2385118 and to move off the path of cost cutting and any further possibilities of further job reductions in their maintenance and engineering area
2385119 all the highlights were rectified to the satisfaction of the qantas team before aircraft delivery to australia
2385120 you neednt know gps you neednt learn too much about this program
2385121 okay now pretend that if you dont make a decision in five minutes youll lose your free trip and itll be given to somebody else
2385122 err yes technically but youre still getting airfare and lodging for free isnt that good enough
2385123 both these guys have proven to be pretty solid guys brewster said

2385182 now is the time qantas should sit down with us to commit now to maintaining maintenance operations onshore

2385185 in terms of what hes saying about me i dont think its necessarily centralisation but its certainly about becoming more professional
2385186 there was a time when i first joined the party when people questioned whether elections should be the focus of our activity if you join a party youre saying you want a party political response to the challenges weve got
2385187 i think the party will always have roots in broader political actions its perfectly legitimate for politicians to engage in peaceful activism i see myself very much as an activists as well as a politician we want people to see us as politicians in a broader sense rather than just men in grey suits
2385188 id say radical progressive weve been pigeon holed into just being a party of the environment too much weve put social justice at the heart of our record weve been going out to the unions in recent years to communicate to them there is a party with the record they are looking for and its not the labour party
2385189 the green party has a clear message the transition from high to low carbon
2385190 given it has to happen one way or another it can either be forced on us or we can manage it in the best way obviously its frightening to realise your industry will change but a post carbon economy will need lots of skills and human power so its very good news for a lot of workers these industries will be more labour intensive than the fossil fuels they are set to replace
2385191 well concentrate on brighton pavilion norwich south and lewisham were already putting together the most professional campaigns weve ever had we can build on that

2385200 the housing market has returned to earth fast and hard
2385201 it means that market is not going to exist at all its barely hanging on now
2385202 paying attention to your credit is going to be paramount for people
2385203 i do not think this is a time to be holding onto foreclosed properties hoping for a better day
2385204 we have all these different stories from everywhere he says he doesnt remember anything hes my client and i believe him until i see solid evidence that hes not who he says he is
2385205 he wanted to live in the big country and maybe get famous now that i see all this hes really famous
2385206 i recall him thinking hes better than the rest of us
2385207 i recall him telling stories about having servants growing up and like that
2385208 we need to have catharsis we need to have closure we need to heal the chi and the feng shui
2385209 were going to be hard were going to be tough you want to admire that were going to be ruthless ruthless is good
2385210 im real enthused after what i saw out here tonight
2385211 we had very few mental mistakes we had some mistakes that we can correct but overall i was proud of the effort and focus its day five of fall camp and the players are still working hard to help our football team get better so with that im real pleased
2385212 that was kind of the case on both sides of the ball
2385213 defensively i thought we flew around and missed very few tackles with our ones twos and threes and i was pleased to see that we were able to make some plays offensively getting the ball to people out in space and did some good things in the running game also so im real pleased with that as well
2385214 reducing emissions from these vehicles will significantly reduce air pollution in major metropolitan areas like beijing
2385215 motorcycles and scooters are the primary form of transportation in india and china with volumes more than twice as large as the american automotive industry
2385216 its been a long struggle over the last three years or so but i can feel my game is swinging in the right direction
2385217 seventy one was probably the worst score i could have shot today its very encouraging for the next two rounds i think one or two over is going to win so im two back from that
2385218 after winning such a big tournament the us open i got lost with no direction at all
2385219 i was getting too bogged down with technical thoughts i decided to free my mind and empty my cup of all swing thoughts and just went out and played golf im not trying to put a perfect swing on a perfect shot
2385220 im using a new driver new shaft and im gaining another 20 yards which is nice but whats really helped is confidence
2385221 confidence is something you cant get overnight and you cant buy it cant get it from a psychologist its the kind of thing that snowballs
2385222 theres a long way to go but from what ive been doing shooting 75s and 80s for such a long completely gone now
2385223 its nothing im ever going to get out of my head
2385224 the water had her pinned against an apple tree and she was holding onto her son
2385225 she was yelling for help i cant hold onto him much longer
2385226 it poured so hard you couldnt see two feet in front of you for a really long time
2385227 there was so much roar from the water rushing its amazing the fire department heard the screams
2385228 our big concern now is that potentially we are not out of this
2385229 tirelessly promote every childs right to be raised by both parents on an equal basis in the event of separation and or divorce and further believes that such equality in parenting has been clearly shown to be in the best interests of children
2385230 they should be writing letters instead of doing this sob sniffle
2385231 the commander in chief and those under him authorized a systematic regime of torture the only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account
2385232 the ranking members of the senate and house intelligence committees were briefed dozens of times about the cias interrogation and detention program over the past seven years so any member who has held one of those posts including speaker pelosi would find it very hard at this point to point the finger at the white house without also implicating themselves

2385235 a car bomb parking by grocery market village in talafar town went off killing 16 individuals and wounded 25 others
2385236 the main reason for the armed resistance is the american military presence
2385237 if the american military begins to withdrawal there will be no need for these armed groups
2385238 the revolution may not be televised but it will be up loaded

2385245 cela ne sert rien et cest notre opinion les athl tes peuvent porter ce quils veulent condition quils respectent les r gles
2385246 when people havent had a lot of success a lot of times theyre scared of success
2385247 that make people look at the paper twice and say that happened
2385248 we just consider it opportunities for some guys to make plays to help us win football games were not trying to be cute or trying to be different what were trying to do is give our team a chance to win
2385249 we have the best athletic talent one through 15 that we have had since i have been here
2385250 it is just terrific to have that kind of talent out on the court what they were doing and the plays they were making for day one was terrific
2385251 we definitely have a lot of things to work on in order to get better
2385252 but i couldnt be more excited as a coach to have this kind of talent to work with
2385253 i have been up here all summer working hard with some of the other returners
2385254 i love the girls on this team and it feels great to have everyone back and have a full team
2385255 i was a little nervous at first but all of the girls were really nice so it was really good
2385256 we have had some good home schedules in years past but i think this years non conference home schedule can rank up there as one of the best weve ever had
2385257 creighton is a quality post season team and the two big xii opponents will most likely be ranked in the top 25 by the time they get here
2385258 it is a really strong home schedule that will be great for the fans
2385259 and i have to give a lot of the credit to assistant coach rebecca chilton peoples she worked really hard to get a home schedule of this quality in years past it has been assumed that it is easier to put together a good home schedule in womens basketball and although there are more opportunities it still takes a lot of time and hard work to put this kind of schedule together
2385260 it is a road schedule that will be very similar to a sun belt road schedule it has several teams that would be middle to top of the pack in the sun belt so i think it is a great road schedule in terms of preparing us for the conference
2385261 i have been here for nine years and i dont ever recall people talking about the sun belt tournament in the summer before the season starts like they are this year
2385262 people in jonesboro are already making plans i think that tells you how significant having the tournament in hot springs can be for our program

2385268 citrus oils particularly those already used as flavorings could be an ideal alternative to chemical based antimicrobials for food applications says a new paper

2385273 in the alternative people often brag about offenses they have perpetuated out of narcissism or grandiosity
2385274 that bravado is how people are often brought to justice in the long run

2385276 but when someone calls in and says i killed my childs father were no longer in the realm of entertainment all times are gmt 1 the time now is
2385277 the ruination they have wrought has been thorough it has been a professional job
2385278 we behold the majestic workings of the free market itself boring ever deeper into the tissues of the state
2385279 ruination they the conservative politicos and their corporate co conspirators have wrought

2385302 the ranking members of the senate and house intelligence committees were briefed dozens of times about the cias interrogation and detention program over the past seven years so any member who has held one of those posts including speaker pelosi would find it very hard at this point to point the finger at the white house without also implicating themselves

2385310 what the deputies committee has raised is given the possibility that political fragmentation in pakistan is going to continue do we need to change our strategy
2385311 the argument that we may destabilize pakistan has taken us to where we are right now
2385312 the revolution may not be televised but it will be up loaded
2385313 i know a lot of the players probably feel like every time they get corrected they are getting evaluated
2385314 well this is going to be the first opportunity that a player has to go out on his own and apply that knowledge without someone standing over him and watching him and telling them what to do bill belichick used to call it let the players play let them go out there and see what they can do there is not going to be any coaches standing behind them when the game comes
2385315 i think from a team standpoint with the older guys we are always evaluating system schemes and there are areas that we want to improve on third down red area efficiency on defense and turnover ratio those types of things
2385316 we will also do quality control relative to the style that we are playing and who are the kind of players that can be responsible to helping us affect those things in a positive way
2385317 nonetheless ask yourself is it the end no my friends you still have to go a long way

2385321 iran already stopped nuclear enrichment at the behest of europe for more than a year a reference to tehrans suspension of enrichment between late 2003 and mid 2005 to allow negotiations with the european union and what happened nothing
2385322 to place a verifiable cap on iranian enrichment and other nuclear capabilities well short of weaponization
2385323 the americans when they need the npt they talk about it when they dont need it they throw it away you dont do that with an international treaty
2385324 no evidence that iran was working actively to build nuclear weapons
2385325 with the shah we also came to the conclusion that iran was in great need of nuclear energy because our population was steadily growing and our gas and oil will run out thats why even though i was in the old regime i should be fair to the new regime because they are following the same line to speak frankly with its bellicose behavior the west is pushing iran towards nuclear weapons even if they dont want them now
2385326 the europeans say stop enrichment and well talk but the iranians already did that and nothing happened
2385327 at the time of the shah we signed contracts with both france and germany and even then they didnt deliver if i were in the current regime i wouldnt trust the west they dont even give iran civilian airplane parts which is costing hundreds of lives why should they believe that they will give them enriched uranium
2385328 for years now they are threatening us with an attack
2385329 these guys are ants when the time comes you crush them

2385332 for many years it was the only general store in town
2385333 it was so successful that my grandparents were able to send all four of their children to college and that was during the depression
2385334 she ran it and was always very visible in the store
2385335 and it was a great place to buy wedding gifts
2385336 we will not discuss issues related to sharia law this will not happen
2385337 once he got out of that jam it affected the rest of the night
2385338 he did a good job coming back at us and pitching seven strong innings we didnt do much to him
2385339 he doesnt bother me as much as some of the other guys
2385340 when i pitch i try to think the other team is the best in baseball
2385341 can feel the difference see a little more life on the ball

2385344 so then after the lord had spoken to them he was received up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of god
2385345 and joseph said to his father not so my father for this one is the firstborn put your right hand on his head
2385346 and he will set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left
2385347 yahweh said to my lord sit at my right hand till i make your enemies your footstool
2385348 sit at my right hand till i make your enemies your footstool
2385349 so then after the lord had spoken to them he was received up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of god
2385350 this jesus god has raised up of which we are all witnesses
2385351 sit at my right hand till i make your enemies your footstool
2385352 the god of our fathers raised up jesus whom you murdered by hanging on a tree him god has exalted to his right hand to be prince and savior to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins
2385353 who is he who condemns it is christ who died and furthermore is also risen who is even at the right hand of god who also makes intercession for us
2385354 if then you were raised with christ seek those things which are above where christ is sitting at the right hand of god
2385355 god who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets has in these last days spoken to us by his son whom he has appointed heir of all things through whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high
2385356 now this is the main point of the things we are saying we have such a high priest who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens
2385357 looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of god
2385358 and jesus came and spoke to them saying all authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth
2385359 who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of god angels and authorities and powers having been made subject to him
2385360 which he worked in christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come and he put all things under his feet and gave him to be head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him who fills all in all
2385361 but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down at the right hand of god from that time waiting till his enemies are made his footstool

2385363 and i also say to you that you are peter and on this rock i will build my church and the gates of hades shall not prevail against it and i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven
2385364 for the kingdom of heaven is like a man traveling to a far country who called his own servants and delivered his goods to them
2385365 after a long time the lord of those servants came and settled accounts with them
2385366 men of galilee why do you stand gazing up into heaven this same jesus who was taken up from you into heaven will so come in like manner as you saw him go into heaven
2385367 then comes the end when he delivers the kingdom to god the father when he puts an end to all rule and all authority and power for he must reign till he has put all enemies under his feet
2385368 now when all things are made subject to him then the son himself will also be subject to him who put all things under him that god may be all in all

2385386 gregory yet jay you know that conservatives are beginning to make an argument here about obama that hes famous for being famous that hes a light weight that hes presumptuous that hes self absorbed and that theres something mysterious about him all this talk about whether its weirdness or that you cant quite nail down what his core is all about is to say theres question mark above this guys head until you get that answered you have to vote for the guy you know and trust thats mccain
2385387 i am not judgemental we knew all along its just because he admitted it that now i can be the harpy partisan scold
2385388 david gregory just said young people were inspired by edwards and are let down and questioned whether it will have broader implications for the democratic party during the election
2385389 c amp ls late nite music club with herbie hancock
2385390 i feel like ive been waiting two years for this day to come
2385391 deep down in our hearts we knew the jury would find leflore guilty but at the same time you never know
2385392 there is no worse way to compound the tragedy of a senseless death than to prosecute an innocent person for it
2385393 that mr mccain is one of the most private individuals to run for president in history
2385394 you know how you can tell really private people they spend 26 years in public life as a politician they also do things like host saturday night live where they sing streisand tunes before a national tv audience
2385395 sitting here in the north phoenix baptist pews he has a look on his face like hed just as well suck a cock as do an altar call its one of his most likable qualities
2385396 but i think the audience really likes all the high energy in the third movement

2385408 while the rising costs of food and commodity prices are the result of many factors it is clear that the rfs has played a role in the dramatic increase in commodity prices
2385409 as farmers shift into higher levels of corn production to meet the rfs mandate additional pressures have been brought to bear on the prices of wheat soybeans rice and other food commodities
2385410 these market shifts coupled with rising energy prices and poor weather conditions have had a ripple effect on global food prices that is being felt by all
2385411 however the rising costs of food have been felt especially by low income individuals and persons living on fixed incomes
2385412 can you imagine a federal law that promoted community schools schools that serve the neediest children by bringing together under one roof all the services and activities they and their families need
2385413 imagine schools that are open all day and offer after school and evening recreational activities and homework assistance
2385414 and suppose the schools included child care and dental medical and counseling clinics
2385415 while the rising costs of food and commodity prices are the result of many factors it is clear that the rfs has played a role in the dramatic increase in commodity prices

2385419 written on them they would run out of ink the second time you used them
2385420 an important step in the process of reducing our dangerous dependence on foreign oil
2385421 the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
2385422 the son of man coming with the clouds of heaven
2385423 assuredly i say to you there are some standing here who shall not taste death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom
2385424 then the sign of the son of man will appear in heaven and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn and they will see the son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory

2385427 you may think you are the voice for arizona families but you certainly do not speak for my family or thousands of other families in arizona either i just have to wonder what kind of person could derive so much joy from hurting fellow americans by insuring that there will be laws that take away rights that they themselves enjoy when you single out the child of any family and fight for laws that will make them separate but equal the only causes you become champion of are bigotry and ignorance
2385428 in tom latham we have a congressman who has continually opposed womens reproductive rights and has given a green light and a blank check to george bushs war in iraq together we will make a difference for those struggling to get by on the minimum wage we will make a difference for those who cannot afford access to quality healthcare we will make a difference for those brave men and women returning from iraq and afghanistan and facing life with an injury and the scars of war we will make a difference when we repeal the unfunded mandate known as no child left behind we will make a difference when we invest in homegrown energy alternatives which lessen our dependence on foreign oil clean up our environment and put iowans to work at high paying jobs which cant be outsourced and can be unionized
2385429 a estr ia foi boa agora vamos para a pr xima luta
2385430 somebody was laying on my legs a lady next to me she had her arm crushed up the lady who was on my left a man was on top of her
2385431 i think im the luckiest one out of most people
2385432 if there is a loss of pressure or the tire becomes delaminated its much more difficult to control the vehicle
2385433 we have requested law enforcement agencies to be alert for any buses being operated by angel tours or iguala busmex since they are not authorized to operate legally
2385434 if found on the road we want law enforcement to immediately stop and place the vehicles out of service
2385435 this happened like katrina like challenger what we can do is pray
2385436 god will comfort them tell people to keep trusting in god do not blame anybody do not ask why now we just help each other to get through this
2385437 the church is like one big family here were very close we stick together
2385438 we are here with them to pray for those who are lost and for gods consolation in this time of grief and loss
2385439 the vietnamese catholic culture is very strong a lot of those who have come here have been through a great deal just to get to this country theyve always preserved their catholic faith this is a trial this is a challenge
2385440 acho que vai ser a olimp ada do s culo os chineses t m fama de fazer coisas grandiosas e organizadas ent o dever ser muito emocionante e com certeza inesquec vel estamos treinando bastante para chegar l e fazer bonito
2385441 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2385442 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2385443 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2385444 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2385445 were going to have a very clear message about how the campaign will cooperate and how the convention will be conducted when its appropriate to make that announcement
2385446 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2385447 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2385448 my address wasnt published and i only lived there a short while before carl and i got married and moved out of state
2385449 no one knew my address or my phone number you had to stalk me to figure this stuff out
2385450 i had no idea he lived anywhere in the vicinity i wonder if its possible that ivins moved to that location to be close to nancy
2385451 i said this happened and im sure youre the one who did it and he denied it
2385452 and i said well im still sure you did what can you do at that point
2385453 he seemed to know a lot about myself my children things i never remembered telling him which always disturbed me
2385454 i kept him at arms length as best i could
2385455 after a while after i decided that he was probably the perpetrator i was afraid of him
2385456 i thought that if he found out i had turned him in he would go after me and he knew how to do that this is something his colleagues dont seem to recognize in him
2385457 we already had firsthand experience with him going back and forth
2385458 i still believe we were headed in the right direction when we were talking about speculation
2385459 sabemos que tabus servem para serem quebrados mas queremos continuar vencendo fora temos a oportunidade de fazer um excelente jogo e n o deixar que eles quebrem esse tabu
2385460 lets face it all you have to do is look at the numbers and the quarterback rating
2385461 carr was 125 and anthony wright was 97 the frustrating thing was that you can pick a play here and there and say thats the game but we did have opportunities
2385462 these two david carr and anthony wright have gone head to head since camp began
2385463 and theres certainly some evidence as of thursday night that the competition is proving to bring out the best in both of them and its highly competitive
2385464 i think it was good for me to get out there and have a positive experience
2385465 going from one place to the other you never know how guys are going to react to you in the huddle or how its going to be out there but i had a good experience out there hopefully ill be able to build off that
2385466 faites ce que je dis pas ce que je fais
2385467 amis vrais de la vraie vie de tous les jours
2385468 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2385469 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2385470 they are killing civilians women and children with heavy artillery and rockets
2385471 all day today theyve been bombing georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population and we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all around the country
2385472 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2385473 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2385474 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2385475 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2385476 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2385477 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2385478 used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it
2385479 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2385480 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2385481 help two friends and former colleagues rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to move forward on their own
2385482 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2385483 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2385484 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2385485 ela fez um trabalho fant stico estou muito orgulhoso dela
2385486 against the best in the world you cant rely on just athleticism
2385487 it has to be team play you make the extra pass do the little things
2385488 i know im not the biggest or the quickest but with my brain i can make a difference
2385489 you mix and match four of us have played together here five together there seven there and then you have a teammate on the storm like australian lauren jackson who is now quote the enemy unquote were all very accustomed to making the switch
2385490 i know theres a lot of talk about the rest of the world catching up to the u s its time to put our preparation to a test
2385491 we are going to stick with that lineup as long as we dont run into any complications
2385492 dejesus is back and is obviously feeling better its good to have his bat back in there leaving mike in the leadoff spot just seemed the natural thing to do because hes been so successful it doesnt seem to affect david no matter where we put him in the top three spots
2385493 your goal isnt 500 but at this point in the season to get there it would be an accomplishment but at the same time i dont think thats our goal
2385494 it wont give us a sense of satisfaction but i guess its a small step in the right way
2385495 i will try to meet as many people as possible
2385496 just feeding people who cant afford to feed themselves thats what today is about
2385497 c mo es posible que los problemas con las hipotecas subprime que son un sector muy peque o de los mercados financieros globales hayan provocado este desastre
2385498 dudo que hayamos recorrido m s de un tercio de la crisis
2385499 no tendremos una recuperaci n de verdad hasta finales de 2010 o principios de 2011 porque muchas de las facturas de la burbuja de cr dito todav a no se han pasado al cobro
2385500 pero llevar a os no meses restablecer la confianza porque se han venido abajo las grandes asunciones de las finanzas del siglo xxi
2385501 we know contagious yawning is linked to empathy so it may mean dogs can empathise well with humans
2385502 i was going to say hes a piexce of work but that might not translate too well is that all right if i call you a piece of work
2385503 god loves you and i love you and you can count on both of us as a powerful message that people who wonder about their future can hear
2385504 i think we are welcomed but it was not a peaceful welcome
2385505 i think if you know what you believe it makes it a lot easier to answer questions i cant answer your question
2385506 we owe our veterans a debt we can never repay
2385507 it will be justified it will be fixed everything will be documented and it will be corrected
2385508 well have to wait and see what happens for the spring after we get information from the departments
2385509 it is important for the deans to approach the cuts in a differential manner in their departments they are the ones who can say this aspect of my physics program is more important than that aspect of my physics program
2385510 were just beginning to evaluate how well deal with it
2385511 regardless how big your budget is a million dollars is a million dollars it is hard to find ways to make the cuts
2385512 cuts are going to be very very difficult and its just too early to know the impact
2385513 i will be meeting with faculty administrators and staff for input ideas and options to address the reductions before final decisions and resolutions are made
2385514 at this time it is too early to determine the impact on potential unfulfilled positions or reduction in staffing
2385515 were asking people to start planning for 2010 and thinking hard what our important programs are and how we can invest in those
2385516 generally tries to protect the academic units that are delivering the core teaching and research
2385517 for the first two weeks i was alive i was known as vivienne because my parents had gotten into a petty feud over my name
2385518 no i need you to carry it all to vans room
2385519 take the stairs from the kitchen to the third floor turn off and take another small staircase into the east wing and keep walking straight its the fourth door on the right side between the gym and the library
2385520 hang you by your lip rings until gravity ripped them out poor salt on the wounds and then deep fry you in your own tears
2385521 i dunno besides the fact that the grounds are surrounded by looming gargoyles that im sure are going to eat me
2385522 thats where victors room is he refuses to let mom redecorate he says he likes the rustic gloomy black mould style
2385523 over there is going to be my yoga room and lets not forget the media room
2385524 i mean i usually try to have one room in one room
2385525 duh now are you going to help me unpack or do you want to go to mcdonalds and make fun of fat people
2385526 mom mom theres a boy on our porch and hes bleeding

2385535 i dunno austin maybe it has to do with your tits
2385536 damn it its always the gay boys no offence jordy
2385537 it could be worse he could be a serial killer too
2385538 but the fact that they killed a shit load of people nothing wrong with that
2385539 it just surprised us a little bit how long that small an amount of mercury can stick around in carpet
2385540 it depends on your family situation if youve got young children in the home then i would strongly recommend considering pulling out the carpet
2385541 i have to have at least 20 of them in my house
2385542 if i have to go through that once or twice a year with the money i save its worth it
2385543 i think this technology is phasing out its an interim technology
2385544 el presidente chino al final se ha ido sin regalos para su familia
2385545 porque china es el pa s m s poblado del mundo y los estados unidos la potencia m s importante incluso hay quien dice que la nica
2385546 nos interesa que las econom as de los pa ses que nos compran est n bien y esperamos que los estadounidenses aprecien lo que hacemos
2385547 estamos absolutamente convencidos de que tenemos el equipo correcto y que bajo el mando de wagoner superaremos estos tiempos de dificultados hacia un futuro m s brillante
2385548 estamos reaccionando r pidamente a los desaf os que encara la econom a estadounidense y el mercado del autom vil y seguiremos tomando las agresivas medidas necesarias para transformar nuestras operaciones en estados unidos
2385549 see it is not that i am against raw milk per se i am just against poisoning people for money raw or not so
2385550 a review of records from whole foods indicates that some of the stores received product from the recall list
2385551 at this time it is not known why the food listed under the usda recall was sold to the public after the recall date
2385552 no doubt when the chinese government has finished dealing with its people the tidy square will be presented again as a suitable site for tourists visiting dignitaries and the chinese public to come honor the heroes of chinas glorious revolution
2385553 it was just a crazy shot where god had to do something with that because that was just unbelievable
2385554 you all are very fortunate to be here because when i was your age we didnt have any kind of organization and we had to go out there and play against older guys
2385555 im so competitive i want to be the first one out of the elevator
2385556 its interesting to hear about the kind of effort he put into his game
2385557 it makes me feel like i could do it too if i practice as much as he did
2385558 because hes a great player so then theyll have a good chance to win lots of games
2385559 i just couldnt throw the ball over the plate consistently
2385560 they stayed around long enough to make it really entertaining at the end
2385561 but we got through it and our bullpen got the big out in the end
2385562 hes someone you think you should get but hes thrown real well against us twice now this year
2385563 he changes speeds he doesnt throw the same pitch twice and he throws everything for a strike
2385564 and hopefully give our offense a chance to get started which we did we put up three runs which helped out a lot
2385565 i saw it tailing the runner got on me pretty good if i could do it again i would hold it
2385566 you o king were watching and behold a great image this great image whose splendor was excellent stood before you and its form was awesome this images head was of fine gold its chest and arms of silver its belly and thighs of bronze its legs of iron its feet partly of iron and partly of clay
2385567 you watched while a stone was cut out without hands which struck the image on its feet of iron and clay and broke them in pieces then the iron the clay the bronze the silver and the gold were crushed together and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors the wind carried them away so that no trace of them was found and the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth
2385568 but after you shall arise another kingdom inferior to yours
2385569 then another a third kingdom of bronze which shall rule over all the earth
2385570 and the fourth kingdom shall be as strong as iron inasmuch as iron breaks in pieces and shatters everything and like iron that crushes that kingdom will break in pieces and crush all the others
2385571 whereas you saw the feet and toes partly of potters clay and partly of iron the kingdom shall be divided yet the strength of the iron shall be in it just as you saw the iron mixed with ceramic clay and as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly fragile as you saw iron mixed with ceramic clay they will mingle with the seed of men but they will not adhere to one another just as iron does not mix with clay
2385572 and in the days of these kings the god of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever inasmuch as you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it broke in pieces the iron the bronze the clay the silver and the gold the great god has made known to the king what will come to pass after this the dream is certain and its interpretation is sure
2385573 im soooo horny i cant keep my clothes on much longer
2385574 ah e tal eu perdi aos 14 anos e foi muita bom e sou grande macho na cama e todas me curtem
2385575 ao menos j f di enquanto tu ainda andas a bater a pu ta
2385576 he seems to think hell be able to start activity next week and go from there hell be in a splint for another week and start working out with us and start taking batting practice next week right now everything is good and well see in a week
2385577 he really believes he can play right handed right now
2385578 i wouldnt be afraid to do that whether we will nor not i dont know
2385579 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2385580 tomorrow were due to catch up with some university professors to talk about netbeans stuff
2385581 we will reach out to the d a and let them know what action well take
2385582 is a person of interest and we would love to talk with him
2385583 the price is gasoline has become a problem expanded offshore drilling of oil will lower the price in the short run but maybe im wrong about this even if it doesnt lower the price in the short run it can only help down the road when im older and when my children and grandchildren need gasoline therefore we should expand offshore drilling as soon as possible
2385584 13 things i meant to write about but never did
2385585 then he said he had to look at a lot of samples that the fbi had prepared to duplicate the letter material
2385586 the fbi must not let the death of bruce ivins deter it from completing a full and thorough investigation of the attacks
2385587 the chance to prove ivins guilt before a court of law has been lost but the need for a thorough investigation and a full accounting to the american people remains

2385623 knowledge workers are overloaded because they often work in a noisy cluttered harried environment and because they are fragmenting their attention all day long

2385693 its in everybodys best interests to try to have the commission respond to us so we can answer these questions and really put it behind us and continue to do the work of the ura and the citizens
2385694 the mayor is not going to get word from the commission
2385695 if he does they will be violating mr fords right to confidentiality
2385696 your failure thus far when you have granted such expediency in the past and possess said authority violates my clients rights
2385697 only the commission may act upon the closing of a preliminary inquiry to date the commission has not acted upon the matter involving your client
2385698 if a formal investigation had been launched pat wouldve been notified and he hasnt been notified
2385699 as a matter of law there cant be an investigation

2385701 if in fact mr fishers statements are accurate and correct
2385702 lets let them conclude their investigation and once we do that well make our decisions here on the ura level

2385707 and the second is like it you shall love your neighbor as yourself
2385708 on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets
2385709 behold the days are coming says yahweh when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah
2385710 not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day that i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt my covenant which they broke though i was a husband to them says yahweh
2385711 but this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days says yahweh i will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts and i will be their god and they shall be my people
2385712 all authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth
2385713 go therefore and make disciples of all the nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit
2385714 teaching them to observe all things that i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even to the end of the age

2385720 simon has declared how god at the first visited the gentiles to take out of them a people for his name
2385721 and with this the words of the prophets agree just as it is written
2385722 the deliverer will come out of zion and he will turn away ungodliness from jacob 27 for this is my covenant with them when i take away their sins
2385723 all israel was saved i did not lose one of my people
2385724 for who has known the mind of the lord or who has become his counselor
2385725 or who has first given to him and it shall be repaid to him
2385726 get out of your country from your family and from your fathers house to a land that i will show you
2385727 to your descendants i have given this land from the river of egypt to the great river the river euphrates
2385728 also i give to you and your descendants after you the land in which you are a stranger all the land of canaan as an everlasting possession and i will be their god
2385729 dwell in this land and i will be with you and bless you for to you and your descendants i give all these lands and i will perform the oath which i swore to abraham your father
2385730 send men to spy out the land of canaan which i am giving to the children of israel from each tribe of their fathers you shall send a man every one a leader among them
2385731 the land we passed through to spy out is an exceedingly good land
2385732 if yahweh delights in us then he will bring us into this land and give it to us a land which flows with milk and honey
2385733 only do not rebel against yahweh nor fear the people of the land for they are our bread their protection has departed from them and yahweh is with us do not fear them
2385734 how long shall i bear with this evil congregation who complain against me i have heard the complaints which the children of israel make against me
2385735 say to them as i live says yahweh just as you have spoken in my hearing so i will do to you
2385736 here we are and we will go up to the place which yahweh has promised for we have sinned
2385737 now why do you transgress the command of yahweh for this will not succeed
2385738 do not go up lest you be defeated by your enemies for yahweh is not among you
2385739 for the amalekites and the canaanites are there before you and you shall fall by the sword because you have turned away from yahweh yahweh will not be with you
2385740 all authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth
2385741 go therefore and make disciples of all the nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit
2385742 lord will you at this time restore the kingdom to israel
2385743 it is not for you to know times or seasons which the father has put in his own authority
2385744 but you shall receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you and you shall be witnesses to me in jerusalem and in all judea and samaria and to the end of the earth
2385745 honor your father and your mother that your days may be long upon the land which the lord your god is giving you
2385746 that it may be well with you and you may live long on the earth
2385747 come i will show you the bride the lambs wife
2385748 let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters
2385749 see now i dwell in a house of cedar but the ark of god dwells inside tent curtains
2385750 for i have not dwelt in a house since the time that i brought the children of israel up from egypt even to this day but have moved about in a tent and in a tabernacle
2385751 wherever i have moved about with all the children of israel have i ever spoken a word to anyone from the tribes of israel whom i commanded to shepherd my people israel saying why have you not built me a house of cedar
2385752 since the time that i commanded judges to be over my people israel and have caused you to rest from all your enemies also yahweh tells you that he will make you a house
2385753 when your days are fulfilled and you rest with your fathers i will set up your seed after you who will come from your body and i will establish his kingdom
2385754 he shall build a house for my name and i will establish the throne of his kingdom forever
2385755 but if you or your sons at all turn from following me and do not keep my commandments and my statutes which i have set before you but go and serve other gods and worship them
2385756 then i will cut off israel from the land which i have given them and this house which i have consecrated for my name i will cast out of my sight israel will be a proverb and a byword among all peoples
2385757 and as for this house which is exalted everyone who passes by it will be astonished and will hiss and say why has yahweh done thus to this land and to this house
2385758 do not trust in these lying words saying the temple of yahweh the temple of yahweh the temple of yahweh are these
2385759 why is it that you were looking for me did you not know that i had to be in my fathers house
2385760 he who swears by the temple swears by it and by him who dwells in it
2385761 is it not written my house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations
2385762 our fathers worshiped on this mountain and you jews say that in jerusalem is the place where one ought to worship
2385763 woman believe me the hour is coming when you will neither on this mountain nor in jerusalem worship the father
2385764 you worship what you do not know we know what we worship for salvation is of the jews
2385765 but the hour is coming and now is when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and truth for the father is seeking such to worship him
2385766 god is spirit and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth
2385767 what sign do you show to us since you do these things
2385768 destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it up
2385769 it has taken forty six years to build this temple and will you raise it up in three days
2385770 why does this man speak blasphemies like this who can forgive sins but god alone
2385771 and i also say to you that you are peter and on this rock i will build my church and the gates of hades shall not prevail against it
2385772 behold i lay in zion a chief cornerstone elect precious and he who believes on him will by no means be put to shame
2385773 the stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone
2385774 i will dwell in them and walk among them i will be their god and they shall be my people
2385775 behold i am setting a plumb line in the midst of my people ekklesia israel i will not pass by them anymore
2385776 this is he who was in the congregation ekklesia in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him on mount sinai and with our fathers the one who received the living oracles to give to us
2385777 and as for ishmael i have heard you behold i have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly he shall beget twelve princes and i will make him a great nation
2385778 but my covenant i will establish with isaac whom sarah shall bear to you at this set time next year
2385779 take now your son your only son isaac whom you love and go to the land of moriah and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which i shall tell you
2385780 and the uncircumcised male child who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin that person shall be cut off from his people he has broken my covenant
2385781 he who is eight days old among you shall be circumcised every male child in your generations he who is born in your house or bought with money from any foreigner who is not your descendant when god instituted circumcision abraham was to circumcise not only his physical children but also male children who were physical descendents of abraham that is a foreigner who was circumcised became a descendent of abraham summary thus the picture that we get from the genesis is that the descendents of abraham those who would inherit the promises were initially comprised of jacobs physical descendents minus those who were not circumcised plus those foreigners who were circumcised more ot evidence spiritual circumcision we later learn that although physical circumcision was important and was required for entrance into the covenant what god really wanted was spiritual circumcision jere 4 4 nkjv circumcise yourselves to the lord and take away the foreskins of your hearts you men of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem lest my fury come forth like fire and burn so that no one can quench it because of the evil of your doings
2385782 they are not all israel who are descended from israel
2385783 at this time i will come and sarah shall have a son
2385784 and do not think to say to yourselves we have abraham as our father for i say to you that god is able to raise up children to abraham from these stones
2385785 get out of your country from your family and from your fathers house to a land that i will show you 2 i will make you a great nation i will bless you and make your name great and you shall be a blessing 3 i will bless those who bless you and i will curse him who curses you and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed
2385786 in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed because you have obeyed my voice
2385787 blessed is egypt my people and assyria the work of my hands and israel my inheritance
2385788 and i say to you that many will come from east and west and sit down with abraham isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven
2385789 but the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into outer darkness there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
2385790 all authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth
2385791 go therefore and make disciples of all the nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit
2385792 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life

2385811 i made sure not to fall asleep because i could have fallen over

2385817 when we were walking down another avalanche struck it hit two sherpas who were helping us and an oxygen bottle came cascading down and hit me in the back of the head
2385818 the avalanche would have taken me away with it but i was lucky one of the sherpas his name was pemba grabbed me from behind he was holding my neck he saved my life
2385819 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2385820 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2385821 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2385822 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help

2385824 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2385825 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2385826 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2385827 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2385828 i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame
2385829 i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm johns conduct has done to us think also about the real harm that the present voyeurism does and give me and my family the privacy we need at this time
2385830 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false

2385850 never had a conversation with john edwards or anyone else about it
2385851 i just was terribly upset by the way they were being treated and particularly by the way their kids were being treated
2385852 these kids when they would go to school they could have three paparazzi taking pictures of them it was just really horrible
2385853 i decided independently to help two friends and former colleagues rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to conduct a normal life
2385854 john edwards was not aware that assistance was provided to anyone involved in this matter i did this of my own volition and without the knowledge instruction or suggestion of john edwards or anyone else the assistance was offered and accepted without condition

2385873 dont try this at home todays interpreter and the apostles hermeneutic
2385874 the difference between human interpretation and divine inspiration separates the modern day exegete from the nt writer in such a way that the former is not able to employ the methods of the latter
2385875 in other words when the apostle paul quoted or alluded to the ot in his epistles he wasnt applying god given hermeneutical principles to various passages in the old testament
2385876 dont try this at home todays interpreter and the apostles hermeneutic
2385877 while the nt use of the ot can be a thorny issue and waymeyer does raise some valid concerns his conclusion is that we should not even attempt to find interpretive principles in how the nt writers used the ot

2385970 he got us to hit the ball on the ground
2385971 when you dont throw a million mph youve got to be able to hit your spots and just let them know that youre going to control that part of the plate
2385972 apparently there is a third inning in detroit when youre pitching
2385973 if you look at that right handed hitting starting lineup for us it was pretty impressive
2385974 it started to bother me after my first at bat and just got worse as the night went on i dont know if i can play tomorrow we just have to see
2385975 it is a role requiring patient and skilful forging of compromise and consensus
2385976 i fully respect the verdict of the irish people and i have made that clear to my european colleagues

2386003 meanwhile beijing has steadily been taking a tougher line on religious practices and cultural expressions of tibetan pride

2386012 i knew that the class had to be highly structured and thats when i got the idea to model it on the work that i do every day here at pfaffmann
2386013 it was neat to see what discoveries they would come up with every day
2386014 mr and mrs godfrey and their family live in the immense mansion built by mr smith the pipe manufacturer on winebiddle and penn avenues
2386015 decidedly domestic mrs godfrey rarely goes out except in response to calls of missionary or church work she is a baptist to which she is devoted their wealth would reach about the 300 000 figure misses jessie and hattie godfrey the daughters of the house are both bright young ladies the former a musician and the latter something of a beauty
2386016 gave us a great two hours on how to do quality research
2386017 that was the first week of class and he set the stage perfectly for what i wanted to do
2386018 we not only spent a lot of time looking at the history of the building and the people who lived there but also mortar analysis and how the building has physically changed and what is necessary to better preserve it
2386019 the experience of presenting to an audience and having media interviews was invaluable
2386020 that made it much more intense than any other class ive ever taken
2386021 he was very demanding and was very involved in it himself
2386022 he was part of our group and pushed us pretty hard

2386035 if the film was as good as akshay kumars entrance scene then it would have been a good watch
2386036 well its because i only invited people who i have a good relationship with
2386037 it would be a problem since your hair is pink laughs
2386038 we need to do a better job getting to the relievers with a good lead
2386039 right now our struggles are were swinging at some pitches we shouldnt be swinging at
2386040 overall we just need to put together some good at bats and try to string some things together

2386043 i dont think i have the stuff to get away with walking a lot of guys
2386044 thats the way its been my whole life in the minor leagues thats what the twins preach they say we have some great defenders behind you make them work were going to make some great plays behind you make guys earn their way on base thats what i tried to do
2386045 you dont really do anything particular in the first inning maybe you feel just a little stronger physically
2386046 normally we go out there swinging and were aggressive but kyle davies early on couldnt locate his pitches and we didnt chase anything out of the zone
2386047 when slowey pitches he is going to challenge the hitters and keep the ball around the plate he was pretty effective tonight
2386048 we missed a few opportunities to put the game away or at least add on and we didnt do that
2386049 we left the bases loaded a couple of times there was one inning really where we got it done they stayed around long enough to make it real entertaining at the end slowey pitched good enough and battled and the bullpen did a super job
2386050 we left too many men on base davies has a fairly quick 15 pitch first inning three up three down and then just couldnt locate
2386051 i threw strikes in the first inning and they were pretty much where i wanted them
2386052 the second inning i couldnt locate the ball im probably thinking a little bit too much a starting pitcher should block out all the negative thoughts and concentrate on making youre pitches i got into a rut and couldnt find the strike zone
2386053 i think if hed take his shoes off hed be a stud

2386062 every class ive had is a learning experience for a student and for a teacher

2386076 thats usually what i try to do go out and throw strikes they were swinging early and that helped me out
2386077 the first couple innings i was trying to do too much and you cant pitch that way
2386078 if theres a guy thats got every pitching going like that theres really not anything you can do as a hitter

2386247 next step after 200 would be global recession and bad news for everybody
2386248 growth last quarter fell on a year on year basis and this has to do with the policies implemented over the prior year to raise taxes on oil industries
2386249 this made it difficult for foreign capital to come in

2386272 i actually think that given the number of comments made from industry executives at e3 or thereabouts about how they didnt put enough resources against development of wii games that the industry has realized that the old adage of only first party games sell on nintendo systems is absolutely incorrect i think youre right that the data will cause a few eyebrows to lift

2386283 and aerith well shes been immortalized as the biggest shock in all of rpg history somehow even though most of the people we know barely batted an eye when she bit the dust

2386285 we like it fine but its nowhere near as good as people make it out to be and doesnt deserve the crushing amount of misty eyed nostalgia it forcibly extracts and thats as true today as it was in 1997
2386286 also i notice you couldnt still anwser the question of why people still buy the ff7 series
2386287 youre sounding like the stereotypical mainstream rpg fan that came into the genre with ff7s aggressive and highly innacurate marketing campaign bash dragon quest checked hold some animosity towards nintendo for no reason checked consider ff7 as one of the best games ever when in fact it was mediocre clusterfuck that sold on hype from the tone of your comment checked

2386300 but my mother who was a simple housewife she showed me the snake when i was a child
2386301 how dare this man come in here and name a snake after his wife
2386302 it gives the impression that people here depend on people from abroad to come and show us things in our own backyard

2386305 almost all of these new fields have already reached peak production and are now experiencing rapid rates of decline fand when the stable base of old but giant fields also starts to deplete
2386306 what will this do to the worlds average depletion rate
2386307 when you have someone who is the head of u s oil policy call you and say shit about five times in 20 seconds this is so much worse than what theyve warned us about
2386308 between now and the election if this all breaks out and bush is misinformed he can mispronounce every head of state in the world but this this will sink you
2386309 world conventional oil production may increase two decades or more before it begins to decline
2386310 turning its taps on and off when it has felt such action was in its strategic interests to do so
2386311 possibility that saddam hussein may remove iraqi oil from the market for an extended period
2386312 represent a major asset that can quickly add capacity to world oil markets and inject a more competitive tenor to oil trade
2386313 the united states appear more similar to a poor developing country
2386314 foreign nations some of whom do not share our interests
2386315 i am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows that the iraq war is largely about oil
2386316 the reaction to and reversal of mossadeqs nationalization of anglo iranian oil in 1951 resulting in the cias overthrow of iranian prime minister mossadeq and the installation of the shah in 1953 and the aborted effort by britain and france to reverse nassers takeover of the key suez canal link for oil flows to europe in 1956
2386317 world growth over the next quarter century at rates commensurate with the past quarter century will require between one fourth and two fifths more oil than we use today
2386318 extremists could control a key part of the global energy supply
2386319 all liquid fuels and is accounted at the product level sources include natural gas liquids and condensates refinery processing gains and the production of conventional and unconventional oil
2386320 produced from underground hydrocarbon reservoirs by means of production wells
2386321 and or other fuel that needs additional processing to produce synthetic crude
2386322 suggest that world oil peaking will occur in less than 25 years
2386323 previous energy transitions wood to coal coal to oil etc
2386324 be close to reaching its peak if it has not already done so
2386325 almost 90 percent of the worlds proven extra heavy oil reserves
2386326 we wouldnt be surprised if this easy oil would peak somewhere in the next ten years
2386327 suddenly the world is facing a moral and political issue that has no precedent should we use grain to fuel cars or to feed people
2386328 some analysts have questioned the saudi kingdoms ability to meet sudden surges in demand because of its lack of spare production capacity and others like matthew simmons have estimated that saudi production may be moving towards a period of sustained decline
2386329 declining on average about 5 percent per year roughly 4 3 million barrels per day and thus even sustaining current levels of consumption
2386330 the depletion of conventional sources especially those close to the major markets in the united states western europe and asia means that the production and transport of oil will become even more dependent on an infrastructure that is already vulnerable
2386331 the united states should expect and support a strong military posture in the persian gulf in particular that permits suitably rapid deployment to the region if required any nation or subnational group that contemplates violence on any scale must take into account the possibility of u
2386332 the changing role of national oil companies in international energy markets
2386333 emphasizing that national oil companies now controlled 77 percent of the worlds total reserves whereas western multinational oil companies controlled a mere 10 percent it contended that this was the key issue in managing the current world oil supply problem
2386334 if the united states were able to wish into existence a world that would favor its terms of trade and superpower status
2386335 could block the vital oil transitway the strait of hormuz
2386336 a desperate superpower might feel it has no choice except to attempt to control the largest remaining oil fields on the planet at any cost
2386337 the prospects for long term energy production in venezuela ecuador and mexico are currently at risk
2386338 if we dont create a solution to the enormous potential gap between our inherent demand for energy and the availability of energy we will have the nastiest and last war well ever fight
2386339 due to commercial disputes local instability or ideology russia venezuela iran nigeria and iraq are not investing in new long term production capacity
2386340 the inevitability of modern energy imperialism needs to be recognized
2386341 energy imperialism is here to stay and efforts should therefore focus on making it a more benign force

2386359 a very aggressive play if that ball gets through its a different story but it was obviously a huge play
2386360 the first set i won 6 3 but i really didnt feel super comfortable
2386361 the second set was probably the first really good set i have played in four months i started to move the ball around well so that was a really good feeling
2386362 i think this match could be one that i look back on as a turning point in the year
2386363 i made a couple of mistakes the guy started to feel much more comfortable on the court and the momentum was gone
2386364 i didnt serve very well in the third set and the balls are pretty slow so it was difficult for my game i could not change it by serving and volleying it was perfect for him because he was playing very simple tennis
2386365 yes it would be good if i am but i am not going to shoot myself if i am not
2386366 love is mysterious knowledge i knew tionna as well as i did in part because i came to love her this i believe is crucial to the practice of anthropology and there is no point in denying it this kind of mysterious knowledge neither replaces objectivity nor renders it impossible although they exist in tension with each other learning to manage love and science in relationships as a fieldworker must is a little like having two brains not always a comfortable experience

2386424 even by the elastic standards of political ads this is more than a stretch its baloney its also a marker on the path toward the kind of simplistic counterproductive demonizing that many expect will poison the fall campaign
2386425 do not look at me look over there look at obama this is what i think of him
2386426 we the citizens of the united states of america have the ultimate responsibility to elect the
2386427 nobody denied senator obama the opportunity to visit our wounded being cared for at landstuhl obviously as a sitting senator he has an interest in that and can certainly visit in an official capacity
2386428 restrictions on what you can do as a candidate for political office that stems from trying to maintain political neutrality and not have the military involved in politics
2386429 the senators staff was informed of the limits on what the military can do with respect to a political campaign and how we could support a senators visit to landstuhl and quite frankly i expected them to have the visit
2386430 a concern that maybe our visit was going to be perceived as political
2386431 americans want a respectful campaign they do they want it now people say well negative adds they move numbers they may but do we have to go to the lowest common denominator i dont think so
2386432 see in my line of work you got to keep repeating things over and over and over again for the truth to sink in to kind of catapult the propaganda
2386433 he could have gone he should have made the effort who does he think he is

2386436 this ad asserts a mccain campaign talking point that obama wouldn t make time for wounded troops unless cameras were allowed to follow him but did make time to work out at a gym
2386437 presidential candidate x did not admonish his fellow soldiers for using flamethrowers on vietnamese children
2386438 this is the best that mccain can come up with

2386473 add together the unfunded liabilities from medicare and social security and it comes to 99 2 trillion over the infinite horizon traditional medicare composes about 69 percent the new drug benefit roughly 17 percent and social security the remaining 14 percent
2386474 lets say you and i and bruce ericson and every u s citizen who is alive today decided to fully address this unfunded liability through lump sum payments from our own pocketbooks so that all of us and all future generations could be secure in the knowledge that we and they would receive promised benefits in perpetuity how much would we have to pay if we split the tab again the math is painful with a total population of 304 million from infants to the elderly the per person payment to the federal treasury would come to 330 000 this comes to 1 3 million per family of four over 25 times the average households income
2386475 they say we are 53 trillion short of fulfilling the promises the government is making to the american people in todays dollars
2386476 meaning that if we want to keep the promises of medicare medicaid and social security which are basically the three major entitlement programs today we would have to set aside 53 trillion dollars and invest them at treasury rates in order to do it
2386477 for the last 40 years the federal government has had to tax every dollar made in america at 18 3 cents on that dollar to pay the bills of the federal government
2386478 by the time my three children who are three five and six years old are my age the federal government will have to tax 40 cents out of every dollar made in america just to pay the bills for the federal government at that time
2386479 they said that the current low rate the 10 percent bracket for low income americans would have to go up to 25 percent
2386480 those would be the tax rates you would have to have if you wanted to tax your way out of this problem
2386481 and if you did that all experts conclude you would literally crash the american economy
2386482 the legacy of this country has always been that each generation confronts the challenges before it so that the next generation is better off
2386483 in the past we brought down the iron curtain and won the cold war
2386484 the problem that we have right now putting foreign policy aside and our fight with islamic radicalism is that we have an economic crisis we have a fiscal crisis and that is we will bankrupt this country and the best century in america will be the last century
2386485 unless we turn our fiscal situation around and pay off this debt and change the way these programs work to a more sustainable path the next generation will have inferior living standards
2386486 last night i had a piece of toast for dinner
2386487 get your wheelbarrows while theyre hot ladies and gentlemen right over here
2386488 once we get all of them doing that our work here will be done
2386489 well you see theres this thing about those of us who live life on this mortal coil where you know we die
2386490 youre sick you know that what about your mom or raven or nana
2386491 theyll be okay now ill be able to watch out for them like i should have
2386492 do you remember when we first met you told me that i made a terrible brooding artist because i always had that stupid smile on my face

2386494 you know how sand in an hourglass seems to flow faster as the amount in the top decreases thats what my life feels like

2386497 what the hell is wrong with you this is how you entertain yourself pitting abused animals against each other
2386498 that two animals that may very well have done the same thing to each other had they merely crossed paths on the street its nothing
2386499 right you want to speak to me about the rights of animals that act on instinct robert you told me yesterday that you planned to enlist is that correct
2386500 id never seen anything die before i joined never been in a fight death was a fairy tale to me boot camp was hell i learned quite a bit about rock climbing following directions about killing i became close friends with a boy named george we were as close as brothers after graduation a few of the officers took our class out drinking we ended up rowdy loud and in the middle of nowhere next thing i know george and i are facing off wrestling george was bigger than me and got the upper hand he had me by the throat cutting off my air i panicked and the alcohol prevented me from realizing the the officers wouldnt have allowed him to really harm me training kicked in it happened fast i killed him
2386501 we look after our own the officers swore every man there to secrecy sliced deep into my arm
2386502 they told their superiors that george had drank too much and attacked me said it was self defense i never forgave myself for killing him or for lying about his final moments
2386503 robert you are a kind soul youre innocent in ways that you wont understand until you are as old as i am possibly older but the military its not for people like you or like i used to be its for people like them
2386504 people who derive pleasure from pain and death and violence
2386505 ultimately it is your decision but i urge you to take into account what you saw here tonight and the way you truly feel inside what happens in those barracks and on those training fields is not noble or glorious or even human at times
2386506 i dont know who it is but i just have this feeling deep down that whoever you are looking for has been in front of you all this time
2386507 who cares about the distance just make it happen if this person is out there dont make the mistake i made and let them go
2386508 we got close we had a tight crew of friends who hung out and ran together

2386510 eddie was the king of it who made people whether they were 15 or 50 years old a part of that world a man who was accepting of all races all types of people
2386511 he would walk into a room full of people and put a smile on everyones face
2386512 he was an artist a very unique person a guy who touched a lot of lives
2386513 he was the glue that kept the whole crew together
2386514 he united so many people who you would think would never party or even be seen together because of him i have met a million people i would never have met ever
2386515 did he kill himself thats the rumor going around and yeah he had his problems here and there
2386516 to the people close to him who knew him that story is skeptical
2386517 were just not sure it would make me feel better knowing but that story sounds just too simple
2386518 youre killin me babe i came down here early to talk to you about the internship but youre not here i need your email address so i can send you some paperwork theyre in the selection process right now
2386519 why keep myself in a teeny consideration box for new jobs
2386520 entertaining any requests for mr boltens compliance with the senate judiciary subpoena
2386521 she talked to sgt marquette and told him that i didnt want to go and thats it and marquette said that i had to go and if i didnt that id have a warrant for my arrest and i wouldnt be able to get no government loans or nothing like that so my mom doesnt really know anything about it so she believed it and she told me and i believed it too because i didnt know much about it either
2386522 this is what will happen you want to go to school you will not get no loans because all college loans are federal and government loans so youll be black marked from that as soon as you get pulled over for a speeding ticket or anything with the law theyre gonna see that youre a deserter then theyre going to apprehend you take you to jail you will do your time as you deserve all that lovey dovey i want to go to college and all this guess what you just threw it out the window because you just screwed your life
2386523 well have a warrant ok so give me a call back
2386524 negative administrative action just because someone has done something wrong doesnt mean that they get the death penalty
2386525 if im dead is pretty boring i fink ive already hummed all th songs i know
2386526 the department is not aware of karl rove playing any role in the decision to appoint mr griffin
2386527 not aware of anyone lobbying either inside or outside of the administration for mr griffins appointment
2386528 it will be as much about the cover up as about the firings
2386529 are going to tell a narrative and they have taken their investigation right into the white house
2386530 i knew that then white house political director sara taylor and taylors then deputy scott jennings had expressed interest in promoting mr griffin for appointment to be u s attorney and i assumed because they reported to karl rove that he was interested in that
2386531 in february when i participated in the drafting of that february 23 letter i did not remember then ever having talked directly to mr rove about it i dont remember now ever having talked to mr rove about it im not sure whether mr rove was supportive of mr griffins appointment
2386532 kyle didnt want to traffic in assumptions so he circulated the letter to the white house for confirmation whether what he believed to be true was accurate or not he drafted the letter according to his understanding of the facts and he circulated it beforehand to other people for clearance to assure that it accorded with their understanding of the facts
2386533 chris did not recall karls interest when he reviewed the letter
2386534 we have no record of that letter even leaving the white house counsels office
2386535 im concerned we imply that well pull down griffins nomination should pryor object
2386536 i think we should gum this to death ask the senators to give tim a chance meet with him give him some time in office to see how he performs etc they ultimately say no never and the longer they forestall the better then we can tell them well look for other candidates and otherwise run out the clock all of this should be done in good faith of course
2386537 the only thing really at work here is a repeal of the ags appointment authority there is some risk that well lose that authority but if we dont ever exercise it then whats the point of having it
2386538 im not 100 percent sure that tim was the guy on which to test drive this authority but know that getting him appointed was important to harriet karl etc
2386539 the principals never adopted it and it was never done
2386540 we will make the equipment work but this is not something that ohio should be satisfied with for the long term
2386541 our goal is to have ohio taxpayers compensated for this equipment that doesnt function properly
2386542 per our conversation yesterday i have attached the new reliance letter required by sba to this email
2386543 i t is important to recognize that it is not for us to consider as a matter of policy whether home schooling should be permitted in california that job is for the legislature
2386544 we are now seeing floods and landslides closing road and railways
2386545 this is just the kind of impact we will expect to see more of as the climate changes further
2386546 scotland has the potential to produce the best climate change legislation anywhere in the world setting the benchmark for the climate talks over the next 18 months
2386547 the snp have promised a lot but the detailed legislation will need to include all of the climate change gases and emissions from international aviation and shipping if it is to capture all of scotlands direct impact
2386548 because of the troubles bethlehem is no longer a top tourist destination but it would be good if more people came to see the situation for themselves if it is safe enough for a bunch of sissy artists then it is safe enough for anyone
2386549 clearly there is an increase in the number of women who use violence in their everyday life and when they are out drinking on the streets around the country
2386550 its a new phenomenon and it does stretch the resources of the police service
2386551 more often dealt with by more formal methods like reprimands final warnings and prosecution
2386552 young women are seen as the future of the population and we have much more concerns about their behaviour
2386553 traditionally young women have been much more informally socially controlled than young men and we may be seeing some changes
2386554 we strongly advise you not to travel to the regions of south ossetia abkhazia and the pankisi gorge north of akhmeta because of the threat of terrorist and criminal activity related to local separatist movements
2386555 serious fighting has broken out in south ossetia and tensions remain high in other separatist regions the situation could deteriorate further without warning
2386556 its just incredible that he would die on july 4 the same day of the declaration of independence and the same day that john adams died and he certainly is a patriot in the mold of those great men
2386557 if you live in south florida and youre not attracted to latins your dating options are severely limited

2386560 located between the wheatbelt and the nullarbor plain it covers more than 16 million hectares which is around twice the size of tasmania
2386561 the area is a treasure trove of unique plants and wildlife with hundreds of species found nowhere else
2386562 the survival of the woodlands which is currently under threat from wildfires feral animals and the impacts of the resource boom is imperative for the longevity of these plants and animals
2386563 at the moment these areas have minimal protection by the wa government leaving them open to serious degradation and damage the group said
2386564 de cada duas bolas que eu recebo uma eu fa o minha m dia sempre foi essa e como o pessoal do vila tem me dado muitos passes bons tenho certeza de que pelo menos um gol eu fa o no corinthians
2386565 o t lio um grande personagem do futebol brasileiro que sempre fez isso d um charme ao futebol e bom ele provoca sem insultar sem desrespeitar
2386566 claro que haver marca o especial em cima dele pois se deixar centroavante sozinho complica ainda mais o t lio que um definidor
2386567 nem sei o que ele falou para come o de conversa ele promete gol em diversos jogos quando cumpre a m dia enaltece quando n o consegue a m dia satiriza para a gente indiferente respeitamos o t lio e o encaramos como um grande finalizador mas nada al m disso
2386568 ser um jogo dif cil o vila vem de duas vit rias estava quase em crise mas fez 4 a 0 no mar lia e 1 a 0 no barueri na rapidez do futebol est embalado de novo o serra dourada estar cheio e nesse ambiente o volume de jogo deles cresce n o podemos deixar isso acontecer
2386569 nothing you can say or do will convince me you didnt steal that money
2386570 well weve always said that we want our program to be able to compete with the best teams in the league and the fact that we are picking up oklahoma texas and texas tech is something that we look forward to we want to be able to play against all the best teams in our league and be able to beat them thats the test for our program we will never truly get over the hump in my eyes i dont know how anybody else sees it but in my eyes until were able to defeat those teams as well we talk about the schedule yes it is tougher but lets back up a minute here and think everybody talked about last years schedule and just stop and think for a minute that kansass football coach has been asked about his 2000 schedule not being tough in a year where they defeated nebraska texas a amp m colorado and virginia tech all that tells me is that were making progress if youre asking me those questions
2386571 our situation today as i sit here is no different than it was a year ago
2386572 the original plan was to have the baby on her due date which was the fourth of august
2386573 but if we went a week past the doctor said we were going to have to have a c section
2386574 then last night things got a little exciting and i started contracting
2386575 we were all kind of joking about it how amazing would that have been
2386576 i wasnt induced it was all natural it just happened
2386577 these trees are over 75 years old they were here 25 years before the school was built
2386578 and theyre saying essentially we dont have to comply with the city law
2386579 my understanding is that it was a mistake and the district stopped it
2386580 this is exactly the kind of up to date information we are looking for we will be liaising to get access to the footage
2386581 gender identity or expression means a gender related identity appearance expression or behavior of an individual regardless of the individuals assigned sex at birth
2386582 no one should be fired harassed or denied promotion simply because they dont fit the stereotypes for masculinity or femininity
2386583 a man who was merely a man and said the sort of things jesus said would not be a great moral teacher he would either be a lunatic on the level with a man who says he is a poached egg or he would be the devil of hell you must take your choice either this was and is the son of god or else a madman or something worse you can shut him up for a fool or you can fall at his feet and call him lord and god but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher he has not left that open to us
2386584 we explored options on checks for two b 737 400 aircraft once space became available at our tullamarine facility a decision was taken to have the work done there
2386585 now is the time qantas should sit down with us to commit now to maintaining maintenance operations onshore
2386586 and to move off the path of cost cutting and any further possibilities of further job reductions in their maintenance and engineering area
2386587 all the highlights were rectified to the satisfaction of the qantas team before aircraft delivery to australia
2386588 with regards to the string of faults that were reported in the media malaysia airlines investigated and established that these were unsubstantiated
2386589 we explored options on checks for two b 737 400 aircraft once space became available at our tullamarine facility a decision was taken to have the work done there
2386590 researchers have long wanted to find a way to move a patients disease into the test tube to develop cells that could be cultured into the many tissues relevant to diseases of the blood the brain and the heart for example
2386591 now we have a way to do just that to derive pluripotent cells from patients with disease which means the cells can make any tissue and can grow forever
2386592 this enables us to model thousands of conditions using classical cell culture techniques
2386593 what is the deal with cutting down the croatan national forest
2386594 how would you like it if we cut down some trees around your house
2386595 i walked in and i set up next to the komo cameraman and a woman asked me to leave
2386596 three of rossis guys grabbed on to me picked me up and dragged me out the back door and put me in a submission hold and twisted my arm around and tried to take away my camera
2386597 we find your activities a little suspicious in front of our guild office
2386598 the only people who we dont allow into our private events are democratic operatives with recording devices and video cameras
2386599 and in these days of youtube they are known to use select footage out of context to make attack ads
2386600 anyone whos welcome to work in good faith to improve our state is welcome to come to a dino rossi event but democratic operatives with video recording devices dont quite meet that standard
2386601 he just gives it 110 percent every single time i ask
2386602 im so grateful that barkley gets to have the surgery and enjoy his retirement
2386603 this house is supposed to be a place where people come and enjoy it but its a home its family what better way to symbolize the governors mansion as home and family than to have a wedding
2386604 for fuel prices to rival repaying a home loan as a major financial consideration shows just how much the cost of petrol has factored into australian household budgets
2386605 thankfully prices have come down with the global price of oil dropping in recent weeks but the steep cost of petrol is now firmly in the australian financial psyche
2386606 the australian economy has certainly slowed down and the pressure will be on the rba and the banks to reduce rates in the next few months
2386607 we will send out an sos weve already had offers of conkers from as far as aberdeen
2386608 we need them a specific size and shape about one and a quarter 3 2cm to one and a half inch 3 8cm diameter and fairly round
2386609 were always optimistic weve had various threats before but i must admit we are getting more apprehensive now
2386610 i cant imagine that the horse chestnut will become extinct it would be a disaster if that did happen
2386611 for example we dont yet know the total number of horse chestnut trees in britain affected by bleeding cankers
2386612 there is a limit to what can be done to combat diseases of trees
2386613 the key things are to encourage tree owners and woodland managers to practise good woodland management and tree care to ensure maximum tree health
2386614 the healthier a tree is the better it is able to withstand attacks by pests and diseases
2386615 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2386616 we have received reports from our defence ministry that five russian military aircraft have taken off from russias north caucasus region heading for tbilisi said national security council secretary alexander lomaia georgian president mikheil saakashvili said earlier that 30 people had been killed mostly military personnel while a rebel leader said 1400 were killed in the fighting we deplore the russian military action in georgia which is a violation of georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity
2386617 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2386618 somebody was laying on my legs a lady next to me she had her arm crushed up the lady who was on my left a man was on top of her

2386620 if there is a loss of pressure or the tire becomes delaminated its much more difficult to control the vehicle
2386621 we have requested law enforcement agencies to be alert for any buses being operated by angel tours or iguala busmex since they are not authorized to operate legally
2386622 if found on the road we want law enforcement to immediately stop and place the vehicles out of service
2386623 this happened like katrina like challenger what we can do is pray
2386624 god will comfort them tell people to keep trusting in god do not blame anybody do not ask why now we just help each other to get through this
2386625 the church is like one big family here were very close we stick together
2386626 we are here with them to pray for those who are lost and for gods consolation in this time of grief and loss
2386627 the vietnamese catholic culture is very strong a lot of those who have come here have been through a great deal just to get to this country theyve always preserved their catholic faith this is a trial this is a challenge
2386628 um grupo de adolescentes viajando sozinhos pela primeira vez resolvem fazer a brincadeira do copo as perguntas eram todas respondidas e todos pensavam que quem estava mexendo o copo era o rapaz da foto at que o copo quebrou as pessoas estranharam mas logo deixaram o assunto de lado esse rapaz foi o primeiro a ir dormir naquela noite seus amigos foram aprontar com ele e tiraram uma foto mas no dia seguinte ele n o acordou todos tentaram mas foi em v o ao perceberem o que aconteceu o levaram para o hospital j era tarde a necr psia acusou que o rapaz j estava sem ar no corpo h mais de 8 horas al m de ter o cora o estra alhado como se tivesse sido comprimido algumas semanas depois quando as fotos foram reveladas isto apareceu

2386630 he swam a fair way out he was 250m out to sea at one point and he was out there for a long time
2386631 it was very fortunate he didnt drown it was very cold
2386632 they get put back in jail and then the same process they bond out again
2386633 its just an ongoing over and over again process its almost a vicious cycle
2386634 a lot of people are bonding out and theyre not making court dates
2386635 i just get frustrated when i talk about the system i really do
2386636 ikke er et menneske der skubber sine medarbejdere foran sig
2386637 he always demanded that female workers signaled to him with their eyes that they desperately wanted to be laid on the boardroom table as soon as he gave the word
2386638 i didnt realise at first that he wasnt speaking metaphorically
2386639 if we had no sexual harassment we would have no children
2386640 this has been a difficult week and a half for us
2386641 we lost our family dogs we did it at the hands of sheriffs deputies who burst through our front door rifles blazing
2386642 i heard gunfire shoot off there was a brief pause and more gunfire
2386643 i noticed my two dead dogs lying in pools of their own blood
2386644 she was literally in the kitchen cooking a lovely pasta dish and they brought down the door and shot our dogs
2386645 they didnt know my name all they knew was my wifes name they matched that to the registration of the car
2386646 it was that lack of communication that really led to what has really been the most traumatic experience of our lives
2386647 i didnt sign up for this fight but i think what we have to do now is make changes to how prince georges county police and prince georges county sheriffs department operate
2386648 the special operations team that supported us made a decision about the necessity of entry at the point of being on the scene
2386649 weve done these similar kinds of operations over and over again to the tune of removing billions of dollars of drugs from the community and without people or animals being harmed
2386650 we dont want any of our operations to result in the injury or loss of anybody and certainly not animals
2386651 i would say that the dogs presented a threat i would imagine to the special operations situation
2386652 she said if the police shot your dogs dead and did this to you how can i trust them

2386655 dont get your point since you dont make sense whatsoever discrediting this patriot
2386656 he won a bronze medal in osaka japan in last years world championships
2386657 patent no 2938402394 have you ever wondered what some of those other 2938402393 patents are heres a website with some
2386658 many turn a blind eye so as not to be victims of drug trafficking because they simply send them to the cemetery
2386659 instead of confronting drug traffickers law enforcement agencies are intimidated and threatened by them
2386660 the catholic prelate said drug trafficking and consumption are so serious that it will be difficult to detain its advance because the country is already infected by other nations
2386661 this is a great start for the olympics it proves that we have the ability to hold a successful olympics
2386662 i can feel all the huge changes in this city i remember when i had no television and no telephone there used to be only small houses and now there are big buildings everywhere
2386663 i feel very proud of it it means that china is entering into the world it doesnt mean that china is a threat to the world it means china is a member of the world
2386664 we are showing our 5 000 years of history but we are also showing how modern we are
2386665 look at them theres no end to it because we are so strong
2386666 i know you dont cook so how did his happen
2386667 man kan alltid stanna kvar h r nd svenskarna klarar inte av att skicka tillbaka oss i alla fall
2386668 i do not think this is a time to be holding onto foreclosed properties hoping for a better day
2386669 prevention is straightforward prevent bites and vaccinate those at risk of bites
2386670 this is extremely dramatic and broad based a remarkable downturn all across the commodities
2386671 its a perfect case of the markets getting ahead of themselves
2386672 every 300 point gain in the dow has been in the context of a bear market
2386673 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2386674 my address wasnt published and i only lived there a short while before carl and i got married and moved out of state
2386675 no one knew my address or my phone number you had to stalk me to figure this stuff out
2386676 i had no idea he lived anywhere in the vicinity i wonder if its possible that ivins moved to that location to be close to nancy
2386677 i said this happened and im sure youre the one who did it and he denied it
2386678 and i said well im still sure you did what can you do at that point
2386679 he seemed to know a lot about myself my children things i never remembered telling him which always disturbed me
2386680 i kept him at arms length as best i could
2386681 after a while after i decided that he was probably the perpetrator i was afraid of him
2386682 i thought that if he found out i had turned him in he would go after me and he knew how to do that this is something his colleagues dont seem to recognize in him
2386683 we already had firsthand experience with him going back and forth
2386684 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2386685 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2386686 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2386687 my friends we will disagree on a specific issue and thats healthy
2386688 i dont believe in ethanol subsidies but i believe in renewable fuels
2386689 we dont need another politician in washington who puts self interest and political expediency ahead of problem solving
2386690 i will always always always put my country first i have done that from the time i was in prison and was offered a chance to go home before my comrades
2386691 i put my country first then and will continue to put country first
2386692 now even as we speak there are those who are preparing to divide us the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes well i say to them tonight theres not a liberal america and a conservative america theres the united states of america theres not a black america and white america and latino america and asian america theres the united states of america
2386693 oh i think he still speaks about it and im sure itll be a theme at our convention
2386694 it seems that when i do that then they fill it up with briefings and prep and issues and meetings
2386695 last saturday okay that is a down day start out with meetings and it lasts all day long until the evening ah i see
2386696 i think the thing that helps me i probably i dont know if you like this much detail if i can sleep in to about 7 30 or 8 then it really helps me
2386697 when i get up real early like 5 30 or 6 then you know you dont go to bed until 10 10 30 or 11 it seems to help me to get up a little later in the morning
2386698 never cranky or testy i just think i do better i kinda can tell and i think my staff can tell you if i put in three or four 18 hour 20 hour days in a row then im not sharp its just a fact i can be sharp if i get a little more rest
2386699 i like the reaction of people i liked going to the iowa state fair this morning i liked going to sturgis
2386700 grrr grrr grrr i like those things it seems to me that were going to those kinds of things that are really fun that i would never be able to do otherwise
2386701 i think it has been good humor i really do
2386702 first negative ads against me were moveon org against me next was by the democratic national committee against me the next was by senator obama against me those were negative ads and we responded
2386703 nah i cant i have not gambled in years really i cant remember ill figure it out but its been a long time
2386704 it doesnt matter what they say or how they say it
2386705 the only thing you can be sure about is their resume what have they done
2386706 his plan invests very little in renewable sources of energy and hes opposed to helping the auto industry retool
2386707 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems
2386708 if you try to make a living by selling butter to someone you can get in trouble and get arrested
2386709 i never thought that 10 to 13 point lead in wisconsin could last very long
2386710 there is decent evidence the race is tightening not just here but nationally
2386711 you better get it right or youll be driving for ups
2386712 he makes you get down and dirty until you like it
2386713 he wants you to stick your face in there and nail people i guess you could say he gives you a gladiator mindset
2386714 yeah hes loud and blunt but we like it because we always know where we stand you have to be tough mentally because its a psychological process all the guys are different i think he studies us to see how we learn how we interact and who can take what
2386715 after a while the screaming doesnt really bother you hes just communicating he gives it to us but he likes us to give it back to him we work real hard but he makes it fun
2386716 now defensive players might not like it but they do things we dont like too
2386717 i dont like them giving me a head slap but they do it i dont like it when they get their hands in my face but they do that too
2386718 hes a hell of a coach who got away from football for a little bit but that fires burning again
2386719 he has interesting ways of getting results out of players hes fun to watch not only on the field but in the classroom
2386720 we think its cut blocking important that we do it to create running lanes
2386721 its not like you can cut each other in practice its a part of camp you just stay away from so we try to simulate it on bags blocking dummies
2386722 we need a lot of work in the preseason to get good at it its hard to get good at it because you dont cut in practice you dont want guys on the ground alex has a lot of drills that he uses and well see where we are against the broncos
2386723 he gets after you and makes a lot of noise but he makes you better
2386724 he has unbelievable energy but its crazy because he doesnt drink a lot of coffee and he doesnt drink red bull he just wakes up in the morning and hes like a firecracker
2386725 all he wants is for us to get better and be successful
2386726 for a young guy hell make you want to jump off the roof
2386727 ive always said alex will make you good or hell make you gone
2386728 i love the guy he knows what hes doing and hes been doing this for a long time hes had some of the best offensive linemen the best running backs and the best offenses in this league year in and year out
2386729 alex didnt cuss around me as much then as he does now
2386730 i love to watch him coach he makes the linemen want to kill him he enjoys pushing peoples buttons because it makes them better
2386731 everybody goes to his clinics to find out how he does it but its no secret its just a mentality
2386732 i absolutely think its going to be a positive addition to have an experienced administrator heading up or at least putting in additional support for middle grades
2386733 i dont think its an accident that district 20 downtown was selected as the place to place this individual
2386734 and ive been in love and ive gotten married and i have my green card those are the main things that have happened i have a pretty good life
2386735 once she quit a chunk of my soul quit because i was so used to her it was very uncomfortable even now if she was to come back and say lets dive together again i probably would go until 2012
2386736 not everybody has the talent to pull somebody together and get this synchro thing going on
2386737 vera was the leader for our team and now i have to be a leader for nastia and its difficult

2386752 part of the operators of drugs control in peravia province what they do is go to collect their toll at the points where drugs are sold

2386788 the reality is that he ended up with the football and tried to make the best out of a bad situation he made a nice play the competitor in him probably got the best of him and he lowered his shoulder and the end result was a broken collarbone

2386810 she was visibly shaken and probably hypothermic because of the water temperature her hands might not work she may think they will but once they are cold when she goes to grab a rope she might lose it

2386844 everybody knows how the cfl works the flip flops the first half of the season and the second half of the season teams get hot and you want to be in first place
2386845 to be in first place says a lot because everybody talent wise theres a lot of parity
2386846 thats the great balance of our team theres a lot of weapons
2386847 there would always be one play that we dont make and weve got to make that play to keep the drive going
2386848 like ryan expressed some guys are playing good some arent
2386849 in this sport as everybody knows its not a one man show its the team the team has to win and were not getting a team effort right now
2386850 im a picky eater so i was always a bad vegetarian i never ate lentils and all the other good for you things you were supposed to eat to get protein
2386851 it did take a bit of a pep talk to take the first bite

2386861 he refused to take me along saying that it was a private gathering
2386862 they told me he boarded a flight to dubai at 11 14am the same day
2386863 i didnt expect this at all as he was a religious man who lived according to the sunnah he has always treated me well however i have never met his family except for a female cousin
2386864 now that hes gone i have to pay the monthly installments for our car and for the supermarket premises
2386865 parents must do a background check on the future husbands of their daughters especially if they are foreigners to avoid cases like this

2386870 i dont think so i think this right here is the real you when you walk away you are just running from it youre afraid of it of me you dont like being vulnerable you have to stay guarded
2386871 guarded i am not guarded you dont think i feel you you dont think i take you with me every time i leave that you are a part of me but i just cant
2386872 and you are a part of me the best part the only part that counts
2386873 but i cant be it is too draining too much responsibility
2386874 there is nothing you have to do though i ask nothing of you i ask nothing but to let go and be yourself cast your fear aside and trust
2386875 i am there are too many faults out there to change the world
2386876 how dare you put me is this position you take this great moment this good day and you weigh it down with your words your feelings of grander i cant take it anymore i cant take the pressure i cant save you
2386877 you dont have to but you are going to yes i know
2386878 i think it is time you forget your feelings it is time you forget me
2386879 but maybe it is time you forget this place forget this moment
2386880 uhm you dont have to sit on the toilet right now the laxative takes a couple of hours to kick in

2386884 it seems justin and i always end up back with each other i do date other people and go out and have fun but it is really hard for other guys to accept how my life is and my crazy schedule before even considering marriage we would actually have to be together exclusively for awhile lol

2386893 dave get us out of this car right now this man is going to kill us i am serious
2386894 ok theres a crowd thats about to become a riot do you know where we are did the man before tell you
2386895 we wanted to consider the whole spectrum of forces including pollution that the architecture would have to withstand
2386896 unfortunately i am going to be gone for nine days starting this afternoon a more than trivial reason is that for three weeks now i have not seen the sun here but it is noticeably less smoggy today than for the last long stretch so the omens may be good for your visit
2386897 if chinese officials do succeed in temporarily clearing the air in beijing for the olympic games one is left to wonder what chinese will say if severe air pollution once again is allowed to return will they interpret this to mean that there can only be potemkinized clean air for foreign visitors
2386898 it is just and fair that the dti budget as approved in yesterdays hearing be withdrawn after failing to deliver the full text of the jpepa this morning
2386899 dti sec peter favila promised to have the full text delivered not to me but to the committee on appropriations and committee chair so i am not surprised that the chair has decided to hold the dti budget as if there had been no hearing yesterday
2386900 that is if and when the full text of the jpepa has been disclosed and meaningfully consulted with the public
2386901 the philippine government should be committed to the welfare and interest of the filipino people and not just bow down to the request of japan for the immediate signing of the agreement
2386902 with the jpepa already signed the supreme court nor congress cannot do anything about the irreversible effects of the agreement
2386903 we were given the copies of the jpepa only yesterday after the agreement has already been signed
2386904 the secrecy with which the philippine government has conducted the jpepa negotiations violated the right of the people to effective and reasonable participation in economic decision making and their right to due process
2386905 the non involvement of the filipino people in the jpepa negotiation process effectively results in the bargaining away of their economic and property rights without their knowledge and participation in violation of the due process clause under the constitution
2386906 with the jpepa already signed we are all bound by the stipulations of the agreement even our objections will no longer be heard
2386907 the minister wanted us to tell the magistrate to grant bail to his son
2386908 irrespective of the powers and the positions the persons who are responsible for the alleged threat must be brought before the law and punished
2386909 at a time when the protection of justice is pertinent to the public the sri lanka judges association or any judge would not allow any chance to those who try go above the law any person who challenges and threatens the impartiality and independence of the judges and the judiciary would not be allowed to run away from the law
2386910 it is seen from this incident that a certain group of people had tried to exert undue influence and interfere with an impending case in a manner prejudicial to the independence of the judiciary our association wishes to state that this act no matter who had committed should be condemned as highly repugnant

2386914 they had broken his spirit when they put him in solitary he was on the outs i was worried about him and his safety and his well being
2386915 we get to visit him three times a week like everybody else but it sucks i cant just walk over to his room and give him a hug or talk to him or confide in him at least hes not locked in hell basically and his personality is slowly coming back i bring that out of him
2386916 as i write this it is midsummers eve a turning point of the year and the faeries time they say hello and by the way i see one now with a candle on his head to light the way this image seems appropriate as faeries bring a lightness of spirit to our lives as well as illumination of ideas they certainly have for me
2386917 his quest to fulfil his promise takes him across the border and deep into the realms of faeries where things of course operate in accordance with an entirely different set of rules

2386928 the police will do nothing because the criminals will bribe them and theyll be back on the street in one day

2386947 two thousand filipino medical workers whose chance to be issued us immigrant visas may be jeopardized
2386948 though we are far from home we are still filipino citizens and thus we sought protection and assistance from your respective offices we are not financially affluent or politically well connected to influence the decisions of those in power but what we have is the wellness of truth behind our claims if you cannot give us assistance then to whom to we go to are you just going to turn a blind eye and deaf ear to the exploitations and discrimination against you fellowmen is the philippine government willing to settle for mediocrity when something can be done or shall we let the media assist us in bringing these issues to the fore

2386952 minister wanted the magistrate to grant bail to his son
2386953 this is not the kind of treatment our ofws deserve
2386954 while gma has been actively peddling filipino workers abroad it took her this long to release funds for the protection and evacuation of at least 30 000 filipinos in lebanon
2386955 in the past nine days since the military offensives in lebanon the philippine government could not even guarantee protection for the filipinos resorting only to pleas for foreign assistance to allow filipinos to board their evacuation vessels out of lebanon
2386956 while foreign aid would be very much welcome these countries have their own citizens to evacuate
2386957 the lack of a clear evacuation plan agonizes our overseas workers and their families here in the philippines
2386958 i have met distressed families in general santos city who have not yet been able to contact their loved ones in lebanon
2386959 we hail our overseas workers for saving our economy and sending remittances which last year soared to 10 3 billion dollars but we cannot assure them protection when they are in danger is this how we should be treating our filipinos abroad
2386960 this manifests the philippine governments lack of sincerity to protect the growing number of citizens working abroad
2386961 the government sends its workers overseas for failing to produce local employment but does not immediately respond to protect the workers it sends away
2386962 the government should take a more pro active stance and provide a clear evacuation plan for our workers in lebanon
2386963 sec romulo should seize the opportunity to visit suu kyi in myanmar and discuss with the junta the issues confronting burma including the release of suu kyi
2386964 a similar call has been adopted by the philippine house of representatives as manifested in house resolution 996
2386965 our solidarity with burma is not difficult to grasp since the philippines also confronts human rights abuses and violations committed by its government
2386966 as a people who have once toppled a military regime we should also be in the forefront in fighting for the people of burma
2386967 as the philippines chairs the asean we would be in the best position to engage with the junta to promote democratic reforms in myanmar
2386968 we remain hopeful that upon the pressure of the asean community the military junta will re think its hard line stance and pave the way for the transition to democracy in burma
2386969 a few years ago we had to cancel due to high heat that was in advance and i think people will remember the end of the world scenario when birdstone won the travers and we had to cancel the last race you go back over the past few decades and youll find a few places where we had to cancel after the fifth race or the remainder of the card

2386987 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want
2386988 of course i mean for a lot of americans including the family that i grew up with i mean its fundamental to how you judge people and human character whether you keep your word whether you keep what is your ultimate word which is that you love your spouse and youll stay with them i think the most important qualities in a president in todays world are trustworthiness sincerity honesty strength of leadership and and certainly that goes to a part of that

2386992 the pakistani prime minister shaukat aziz came to washington and the talks were about f 16 the paks need to fight
2386993 with u s troops tied down in iraq and afghanistan the war in pakistan is being fought mostly by proxy
2386994 more than being a warning to gma not to issue a similar proclamation the supreme courts decision establishes the presidents culpability with regard to her illegal actions during the celebration of the 20 th anniversary of the 1986 people power
2386995 we call for justice for the illegal arrests of up prof randy david and akbayan president ronald llamas violent dispersal of rallies imposition of standards on media and the warrantless search of tribune offices
2386996 the arroyo administration not only violated the rights of individuals and groups who have filed this case but ultimately the right of the filipino people to celebrate the democratic and peaceful victories of edsa

2387043 a principal advantage of linspire its codec licensing agreement with microsoft no longer applies
2387044 with the linspire acquisition we had three desktop brands and two distinct code bases from joint discussions with our respective engineering teams it made eminent sense to combine our efforts with a single code base and two brands

2387060 the perception of drivers vs science theres a whole world of difference there

2387082 this is a stopgap measure at helping these students get a high school diploma its certainly not going to help them go onto post secondary education which really should be our goal
2387083 if the students in prince william are simply trying to get through and some of our students are not as highly motivated as we might want them to be and it helps them get matriculated through then thats a good thing
2387084 it doesnt help their gpa at all we just give them a pass a standard credit

2387099 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2387100 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2387101 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2387102 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2387103 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2387104 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2387118 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

2387155 is they didnt have a proper warrant to do what they did they actually didnt give us a warrant at all until 71 hours after it happened and thats really whats disturbing despite all the mistakes that were made theyre holding to their guns saying they did nothing wrong
2387156 this happened to us we cant get our dogs back and we know that but the reason we asked for federal authorities to investigate this is because this is a systemic problem and we want to make sure that while it happened to us and thats a tragedy we dont want it to happen to anyone else

2387207 firstly a big thank you for the opportunity to stay in osseja it was a very special time for the family to spend a week together in such different and special surroundings the flat made for a very comfortable base from which to explore the area we ran out of time to do all the things we had in mind each day we went off with our picnic and managed some walking as well as exploring something or somewhere new like the parc animalier we drove to pick up the yellow train to villefranche which was interesting to visit we managed to get into the open carriage for our dramatic return journey the weather was perfect the neighbours were very friendly and the cats were interesting the kitchen is very well equipped and the beds are very comfortable
2387208 we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at your place the apartment was lovely and your notes on things to do and see were excellent i hope to return
2387209 we loved your apartment and the bottle of wine to welcome us was very thoughtful the apartment and osseja were so peaceful and the surrounding area is very interesting we would have done much more walking but the weather at the end of august was too hot for this we loved the thermal pool at llo and had some wonderful drives around the area we did the forest drive behind osseja up to the top as recommended by you and loved the wild horses it would have been good to spend a few more days there the apartment is very comfortable and has everything you need your agent isabelle was extremely helpful and your neighbours friendly we would recommend the apartment to anyone who wishes to explore the area many thanks and kind regards

2387216 hes seeing that its not too far away which should be exciting for everybody
2387217 its also getting the shoulder back in shape and the mechanics and getting the muscle memory fired up again
2387218 i wouldnt say im comfortable but i am more confident im just trying to put everything together its going to be good to have an actual show against somebody whos not used to us to see if i can actually do this or not
2387219 i just want to show i can make plays on the ball and be tough in run support
2387220 i was close but thats all i had nothing left in the tank
2387221 i was going full speed all out and i think it ticked my glove
2387222 that man knows how to drive in runs how could he not make the all star team if corey catches that ball it would have been big time the greatest he ran a long way
2387223 thats quinteros first home run in a couple of years
2387224 when it goes bad whatever can go bad goes bad
2387225 whats tough is that we came back the guys kept fighting
2387226 i mean coco cordero had two outs and nobody on base and the next thing you know there is four runs up there
2387227 thats whats tough when you see that happen over and over and it isnt just one or two runs its four runs
2387228 i asked catcher david ross about the pitch and he said it was outside it was close
2387229 then the next pitch is a home run and then lee hits the foul pole for a home run and it was just another bad night

2387237 its not what we do in front of eighty thousand people on sundays that defines who we are just as we are not defined by what we do on sundays in church its what we do and how we live monday through saturday when no one is watching that defines our legacy its more than a game its life and we all have a chance to make a difference as we live our lives between sundays
2387238 i want to leave a legacy how will they remember me did i choose to love did i point to you enough to make a mark on things i want to leave an offering a child of mercy and grace who blessed your name unapologetically and leave that kind of legacy

2387484 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preferences to minorities i think the american people are going once they see the obamanation theyre going to demand a tweaking of that and say you have to put the majority into office
2387485 large numbers of these people really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2387486 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2387487 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2387488 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2387489 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2387490 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2387491 those were the good old days for straight white males but for everyone else it was a pretty raw deal

2387500 the tremendous downtown changes have given the residents a renewed sense of confidence and optimism about the future of the city
2387501 externally its really helped us to reset the image of kansas city
2387502 in order for us to go downtown and bring jobs into downtown we wanted cordish to push along with their plan under a specific timeframe

2387511 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2387512 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2387513 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry

2387535 the killer feature in dashboard and konfabulator is imo the ability to integrate a web like interface with the os this opens the way for a lot of ideas in making linux easier to use for regular users but also for advanced users who feel more comfortable using the browser than typing and remembering complex command lines the implementation for firefox of a system exec feature similar with dashboard and konfabulator is not trivial but not that complex as i mentioned in a previous post the async execution is the tricky part but it has a reasonably straight solution ill try to find a server and post the sources im sure there are better implementations using the event queue but it works well enough for me now the remaining part is dealing with installing and running widgets in firefox and exactly emulating the interface im not expecting dashboard widgets to work unmodified but with small changes konfabulator has an simpler interface but its not html like ill only see if i can implement a similar api for simpler transition this has been a very interesting mini project for me i found a lot about how firefox works and i hope itll serve its purpose and ill be able to reduce my use of cli and have a nicer interface for the linux commands i use even if some already have

2387551 we have always envisaged the ports and local law enforcement agencies of the united states as a very large and important market for these devices
2387552 the orders in recent months by jacksonville sheriffs office and now contra costa confirm our belief in the uniqueness and importance of the technology and of the products we have to offer
2387553 a large number of us law enforcement agencies and ports have shown significant interest in the uis and we look forward to confirming additional orders in the near future

2387557 the consensus of the board was that they would not be in favor of mining the property
2387558 the board will take formal action that will remove mining of the property from future consideration and will also not do any research regarding this issue
2387559 when we talked about doing the tests it was never my intention to mine the property
2387560 in my mind it was never going to go any further than the tests we were going to do
2387561 the current nature of the discussion is preliminary and any change in the use of the property is not imminent
2387562 the property may remain a golf course indefinitely and no changes will be implemented prior to the 2011 season
2387563 as rounds have decreased and inflationary expenses increased the park district has had to consider subsidizing golf operations during the past several years

2387584 what happened to the john edwards 100 000 mini doc webisodes
2387585 they removed some of the requirements for xbla games but there are still a lot of requirements and i believe that at least for a single player game like my game the vast majority of these requirements are unnecessary
2387586 i put in a tremendous amount of work meeting all these requirements when i could have put that work into the actual game and made it even a little more polished little bit better
2387587 but i feel like it actually decreases the quality of games because people spend so much of their energy on these things that users dont even really care about
2387588 i definitely had a couple of unpleasant business interactions with microsoft
2387589 nothing horrible well nothing quite bad enough to cause me to cancel releasing the game on arcade
2387590 but what would keep me from putting another game on arcade again is just that theyve changed the business deal at least as ive heard
2387591 if its as ive heard that it is i couldnt even necessarily break even
2387592 money is not really my goal so even if braid does very well thats not my concern im not going to do a sequel to braid i dont care how many copies it sells
2387593 i mean maybe in five years when im motivated if i have a really fresh idea for it but im not waiting in the wings with a level pack or dlc or anything
2387594 i didnt want to do them on the old dashboard because its covered with ads everywhere
2387595 braid is about setting a mood and a feeling and you cant do it while theres like a burger king ad there flashing i just felt that juxtaposition would have been bad for the game
2387596 they didnt try to dictate the game design as many publishers might they were very hands off there and what is in the final game is exactly what i wanted to put there
2387597 they also bent a lot of xbla rules in order to help me make the game the way i wanted which was pretty cool of them
2387598 technically illegal if you go by the book but they saw what i was trying to do and went with it

2387600 ive been writing off microsofts chances of even getting a foothold in japan for quite a while now but maybe i was wrong the latest figures to emerge arent huge and wont have microsofts accountants licking their lips but they do show the console is at least heading in the right direction

2387607 and god saw all the things that he had made and they were very good
2387608 do i not fill heaven and earth saith the lord
2387609 in him we live and move and have our being
2387610 the lord is sweet to all and his tender mercies are over all his works
2387611 for you love all things that are and hate none of the things which you made
2387612 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth
2387613 in the beginning o lord you founded the earth and the heavens are the works of your hands they shall perish but you remain all of them shall grow old like a garment and as a vesture you shall change them and they shall be changed but you are always the same and your years shall not fail
2387614 im such a mystery as anyone can see there isnt anybody else exactly quite like me and when its party time like 1999 ill party by myself because im such a special guy
2387615 you missed the fact that fremont native jacob ben widmar was added to the cast as well in his broadway
2387616 paris making a mockery of celeb issue and john mccain nooooo mccain did that all by himself
2387617 melinda finish the vocal of her album all of that happens quickly then we will see her cd on shelves this
2387618 the feature you are trying to use is on a network resource that is unavailable
2387619 unfettered markets do not operate well on their own a conclusion reinforced by the current financial debacle
2387620 they removed some of the requirements for xbla games but there are still a lot of requirements and i believe that at least for a single player game like my game the vast majority of these requirements are unnecessary
2387621 i put in a tremendous amount of work meeting all these requirements when i could have put that work into the actual game and made it even a little more polished little bit better
2387622 but i feel like it actually decreases the quality of games because people spend so much of their energy on these things that users dont even really care about
2387623 i definitely had a couple of unpleasant business interactions with microsoft
2387624 nothing horrible well nothing quite bad enough to cause me to cancel releasing the game on arcade
2387625 but what would keep me from putting another game on arcade again is just that theyve changed the business deal at least as ive heard
2387626 if its as ive heard that it is i couldnt even necessarily break even
2387627 money is not really my goal so even if braid does very well thats not my concern im not going to do a sequel to braid i dont care how many copies it sells
2387628 i mean maybe in five years when im motivated if i have a really fresh idea for it but im not waiting in the wings with a level pack or dlc or anything
2387629 i didnt want to do them on the old dashboard because its covered with ads everywhere
2387630 braid is about setting a mood and a feeling and you cant do it while theres like a burger king ad there flashing i just felt that juxtaposition would have been bad for the game

2387634 we have to let the people know that they are at risk of being detained
2387635 cbp strives to treat all travelers with respect and in a professional manner while maintaining the focus of our mission which is to protect all citizens and visitors in the united states
2387636 anyone in the u s unlawfully should not be surprised if they are encountered or arrested to be placed in removal proceedings
2387637 its not a question of whether its right or wrong its the law
2387638 they federal agents seem to be desperate to capture people to prove that they are enforcing the law they are going to go to any extreme
2387639 authorities may seek to identify and verify their legal stay in this country
2387640 the charges against the mayor are very serious and the state of affairs is clearly hurting the business of our community
2387641 i sincerely hope that the mayors legal issues are dealt with quickly so these ongoing sagas no longer interfere with the important work before the leaders in detroit wayne county and the state
2387642 lets take it step by step i want my day in court
2387643 mayor kilpatrick thanked his team for their continued commitment and focus on moving the city of detroit forward
2387644 he told the staff he plans to continue his work on moving an aggressive agenda forward for the city of detroit
2387645 i do not think the answer should be a complete and total remand
2387646 im sure that the mayors family is going to be very happy to have him back home
2387647 in my almost 20 years first as a prosecutor and now as an attorney general i cannot recall ever seeing let alone hearing of a situation where a police officer trying to serve a subpoena was assaulted
2387648 ma per meritarsi a pieno quel titolo e possibilmente mantenerlo non basta fare la bella faccia per un periodo e poi chiedere scusa dopo aver fatto una cosa senza senso come non cagarmi per mesi per chiss quale motivo
2387649 at some airlines these days if you want a glass of water you have to pay for it theyre that strapped
2387650 so how willing are airlines to put up the money for ohare theyre not willing at all
2387651 they dont have a prayer of getting this done by 2014
2387652 its way too costly and nobodys going to be foolish enough to pay for it
2387653 when these plans for ohare were first being put together oil was nowhere near 50 a barrel let alone 100
2387654 airlines are challenged right now and we at ohare want them to be able to get back on their feet
2387655 but for them to add more profitable routes they need more runways here ohare hasnt added a new runway since 1971 we havent increased our infrastructure as other airports have continued to add runways
2387656 chicago doesnt have the most stellar record in doing things in the most cost effective way
2387657 so the realities are that airlines are saying we dont necessarily mind paying for improvements but we dont want to pay for a boondoggle and we dont want to pay for a lot of political cumshaw
2387658 making ohare more efficient is an incredibly important move for aviation infrastructure
2387659 its a challenge for chicago to finish ohare but they have to press ahead they have to be successful

2387665 i feel like i am standing in the middle of the room screaming at the top of my lungs and no one even looks up
2387666 im thinking he was sick they normally hang from under eves or under a deck behind a shutter etc they dont do daylight heres a pic of your bat checking in to the hospital
2387667 i figure by now the bat has a name is getting three square meals a day of all the bugs he can eat
2387668 its not the camera that takes the photo its the photographer
2387669 we want to encourage people to use their bicycle and during peak commute is when people need transit many people who ride bicycles dont have the luxury of having other forms of transportation and i dont think we should penalize them for doing the right thing
2387670 its still not enough to keep up with the rising gas costs
2387671 our number one priority is of course to stop the criminalisation of good parents by repealing the anti smacking law
2387672 this has to be the most anti family socially destructive legislation parliament has passed in a long while
2387673 completing the petition to force a referendum was always only going to be the first stage of the battle
2387674 in fact when nationals leader john key announced their pledge of 10 policy items at their conference last weekend not a single one of them addresses any of the social engineering labour has forced upon the nation in the past six to nine years
2387675 national surely is the party to maintain the status quo easy she goes dont rock the boat
2387676 our message to the voters in this election is this give the kiwi party your support on election day and the bradford anti smacking law will be gone by lunchtime
2387677 once the law has been repealed we must then get serious about the nations child abuse by appointing a royal commission to understand and address the wider causes of family breakdown family violence and child abuse in response to the more than 300 000 kiwis that signed our petition on this matter
2387678 then we must restore our democracy by ensuring that we can have binding referenda on controversial issues it must never happen again that more than 90 per cent of our elected representatives could ignore 80 per cent of the population ever again

2387681 i was so elated not only for the team but for this kid who weve shuttled back and forth to columbus i dont know how many times over the last two years i have a lot of confidence in him

2387685 that was definitely one of those feelings you wish you could have every day
2387686 the biggest thing that win gave me apart from the 2 million was a window to take a break
2387687 since then i havent played back to back weeks until fort smith and the bmw in may this year there was a lot of rust every week ive been top 10 in birdies bogeys and doubles very inconsistent
2387688 we are all trying to be a little more positive
2387689 we figured out its not as hard as weve been making it we all got tired of playing bad and we know were better than what weve been doing
2387690 after the great start i think i did a pretty good job of staying in the present
2387691 he kind of kept me focused and we fed of each other its a good start im four back but this golf course isnt that easy
2387692 every couple of months i would check my bank account to make sure it was like wow now the money is starting to be spent and i need another win

2387694 lea t hampton is going broke glam town 12m in the hole
2387695 everybody perceives east hampton to be the home of the rich and famous
2387696 when the summers over its just the same old town just like all these other towns
2387697 the disparity between rich and poor is probably unmatched anywhere in the world you have the heads of multinational corporations billionaires but of the year round population half the work force are undocumented immigrants living below the poverty level
2387698 i dont mind providing the programs but what the general public has to understand is that we dont manufacture money here
2387699 somebody was clearly not paying attention to the bottom line
2387700 i have a debt to bernie for so many reasons that i can never possibly repay he was my mentor my partner and my friend he was like a father to me and he treated me like a son
2387701 he loved talent and he loved the action he never wavered in that he was always a wise and honest voice in my life he was clear on the hard realities of show business but he never lost his love of the game
2387702 the muppet show which aired in the u s in firstrun syndication from 1976 1981 brillstein also helped henson move into features and to strike innovative deals with hbo and plus a slew of international outlets for the critically praised 1980s kidvid skein fraggle rock
2387703 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2387704 whatever decision is made its going to be a collaborative decision
2387705 i think all this sort of speculation is much ado about very little
2387706 were just working out the details however those details play out that doesnt change the bottom line the fact that everyones on the same team here
2387707 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2387708 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2387709 we want to give the millions of people who will watch the opening as well as the hundreds of athletes taking part the message that there are no human rights in tibet
2387710 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let him down
2387711 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2387712 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2387713 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2387714 when you look into a mirror do you like whats looking at you now that youve seen your true reflections what on earth are you gonna do
2387715 i actually walked the country to see who i am who i really am but i dont know what the result of that will be
2387716 but for me personally id rather be successful or unsuccessful based on who i really am not based on some plastic ken doll that you put up in front of audiences thats not me you know
2387717 imagine how much fun it will be when you have 3 throwing up at the same time
2387718 candor is most effective where nations have built a relationship of respect and trust
2387719 ive worked hard to build that respect and trust i appreciate the chinese leadership that have worked hard to build that respect and trust
2387720 it is a commitment to strengthen that foundation for years to come
2387721 we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
2387722 chinese citizens have freedom of religion these are indisputable facts
2387723 weve had these back and forths with china for years
2387724 im not making any predictions about medal counts but i can tell you the u s athletes are ready to come and compete in the spirit of friendship
2387725 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2387726 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2387727 this is a glorious but also huge task for anyone
2387728 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down that was why i was nervous
2387729 every time i must balance myself in the air and hold the torch as close to the cauldron gas outlet but every time the wind blew in different directions
2387730 means china is standing side by side with the rest of the world
2387731 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2387732 are a chance for the rest of the world to discover what china really is
2387733 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china

2387736 instead of complaining about the state of the education system as we correct the same mistakes year after year ive got a better idea
2387737 university teachers should simply accept as variant spelling those words our students most commonly misspell
2387738 there are enormous advantages in having a coherent system of spelling
2387739 it makes it easier to communicate maybe during a learning phase there is some scope for error but i would hope that by the time people get to university they have learnt to spell
2387740 as is true in all conventions were still working out the mechanics the coordination
2387741 we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party is fully unified heading into the november election
2387742 while no decisions have been made yet i will make sure that we keep you up to date and involved with all of the convention activity

2387744 this is a major victory for the rights of parents over the education of their children

2387746 it is quite an honor to be introduced by your dad
2387747 i wasnt exactly sure what to say to you except to start with god i love our country and i love what we stand for and i love being with you

2387751 nbc sort of limped to its 1 billion because of the slow marketplace
2387752 but a lot of late money did flow in including election money
2387753 transcend a down marketplace and any controversial issues having to do with the host country

2387755 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2387756 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2387757 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2387758 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2387759 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preferences to minorities i think the american people are going once they see the obamanation theyre going to demand a tweaking of that and say you have to put the majority into office
2387760 this incredible response and excitement shows that there is a huge appetite for change in colorado
2387761 are a chance for the rest of the world to discover what china really is
2387762 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china

2387768 the chosen one would prefer to allocate funds for research into alternatives to water
2387769 but the potentate recognizes the advantages of an immediate planet side source of fresh drinking water
2387770 all sides agree we need to break our dependence from other planets for our water supply the way to achieve that independence is through alternatives to water not through more drilling
2387771 we also need to see a reduction in regulations so we can build more desalinization plants
2387772 we havent built any refineries here on earth since the 1970s were letting other planets make all the money and hold us hostage for their water
2387773 the models used by the empire cannot be shut off so they must have cut power to the building
2387774 rubbed some people the wrong way and that her job was not secure and that the raise she had been expecting was denied
2387775 hospitals are either eating the cost or passing it along to insurers so you and i are paying it in increased premiums

2387783 when presented with stimuli that have two valid mutually contradictory interpretations your brain just picks one then sometimes it picks the other
2387784 one hundred and fifty russian tanks armoured personnel carriers and other vehicles have entered south ossetia
2387785 this is a clear intrusion on another countrys territory we have russian tanks on our territory jets on our territory in broad daylight
2387786 we cannot allow the deaths of our countrymen to go unpunished the guilty parties will receive the punishment they deserve
2387787 i am obliged to protect the lives and dignity of russian citizens no matter where they are located
2387788 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
2387789 its not about georgia anymore its about america its values we are a freedom loving nation that is right now under attack
2387790 we forget that the united states actually saved russia from the nazis
2387791 georgia attacked ossetia which hasnt been a part of georgia for more than 15 years
2387792 so why dont the russians be big boys and take on the us instead of georgia dan rather usa

2387797 to create a solution using rfid equipment and our software we needed a company that could provide long range dependable and cost effective equipment aaid was willing to work with us and provided the best long range rfid products we could find to reach our objective
2387798 this wasnt something imposed it seems that this backtracking would be the result of the backlash from anti muslim hate web sites and islamophobes on the internet
2387799 i would have thought that people would have been more sensitive and sympathetic to the concern to the members of our community who want to celebrate their religious faith
2387800 its a little disingenuous to say that they tyson were responding to employee concerns the proposal came from workers themselves
2387801 for over a hundred years labor day has stood as a symbol to honor the working men and women of this country but for the past few years traditions like labor day have been under attack this time its gone too far and we as patriotic americans must draw our line in the sand

2387805 why doesnt obama just come out with an ad saying how mccain has 6 houses
2387806 the resolution does not contain a specific provision to raise tax rates but rather assumes that most of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire as scheduled in 2011
2387807 obama has stated repeatedly that his plan would increase taxes only for those making more than 250 000 per year
2387808 oh john mccain and family have 11 houses in addition to that jet and 500 shoes
2387809 but but but you said that you wouldnt bomb israel you are a racist ahmadinejad and you are mean
2387810 all this star power is being produced by the media and the hollywood left not actual achievment
2387811 the resolution does not contain a specific provision to raise tax rates but rather assumes that most of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire as scheduled in 2011
2387812 obama has stated repeatedly that his plan would increase taxes only for those making more than 250 000 per year
2387813 obama is just a younger jimmy carter without the alcoholic younger brother
2387814 the perennial gop claim that he wants to raise taxes
2387815 shoes homes i dont care what people do with their money i care what people do with my money
2387816 obama voted to raise taxes on people making just 42 000 he promises more taxes on small business seniors your life savings your family
2387817 it is immoral for a government to take money earned by individuals and re distribute that money to others who have not earned it nobody owes you a job either if you have not taken advantage of all the educational opportunities available in the us dont complain or blame others for your situation take some personal responsibility and quit whining
2387818 at a morning town hall meeting in lima mccain was dogged by democratic complaints that his campaign manager rick davis was a highly paid lobbyist for german owned dhl who lobbied congress to accept a dhl proposal to buy airborne express airborne ran its operations out of the wilmington air park in clinton county and now dhl now proposes to leave wilmington
2387819 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
2387820 what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2387821 john mccain wears 500 shoes john mccains 23 year old daughter is out of college but she doesnt have a job she lives off the welfare of her family fortune and hangs out with heidi montag can working class americans relate to this
2387822 obama grew up on foodstamps paid for his on college education if what you say is true what jobs did obama have to pay for college and support for himself while going to college
2387823 that must be where this faker developed his taste for arugula and pate theres a reason why corsis book obama nation
2387824 spokesman hari sevugan this ad is a lie and it s part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam
2387825 republicans are nothing but bible thumping racists biggots and homophobes
2387826 i heard that obama promises to do for america what kwami kilpatrick has done for detroit
2387827 a politician who will say what he has to in order to get elected
2387828 that statement is false and here is information to prove it
2387829 no people in history have ever survived who thought they could protect their freedom by making themselves inoffensive to their enemies
2387830 all tyranny needs to gain a foothold is for people of good conscience to remain silent

2387833 are we nominating a candidate who is worse than john kerry or al gore
2387834 the reason so many families are hurting today is because we ve had eight years of failed bush policies that senator mccain wants to continue for another four and that s what barack obama will change as president

2387840 the final straw was the feds hopelessly slow tightening from 2004 onwards there was no excuse for the interest rates of 1pc and then they went through this ludicrous metronome dance of quarter point hikes
2387841 by making banks raise capital against their balance sheets it gave them a strong incentive to move off balance sheets
2387842 policymakers interpreted the quiescence in inflation to mean that there was no good reason to raise rates when growth accelerated and no impediment to lowering them when growth faltered
2387843 my sympathies go to the unfortunate citizens of those countries that implement inflation targeting
2387844 the troubles in the sub prime sector seem unlikely to spill over to the broader economy or the financial system
2387845 the fed was in this mental state that it was just a short term problem

2387854 we urge restraint on all sides that violence would be curtailed and that direct dialogue could ensue in order to help resolve their differences
2387855 blood shed in south ossetia will weigh on their conscience
2387856 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2387857 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
2387858 georgia has a 2 000 strong contingent supporting the u s led coalition in iraq and washington provides training and equipment to the georgian military
2387859 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
2387860 its not about georgia anymore its about america its values we are a freedom loving nation that is right now under attack

2387863 we feel we made an important investment in keeping these older products alive
2387864 we had people on the drafting committee that had been clinton supporters that had been obama supporters by the end we were all in agreement on what should be in the platform
2387865 they did a nice job melding the clinton views and the obama views together not that they were that far apart
2387866 the first woman in american history to win presidential primaries in our nation
2387867 our party is proud to have put 18 million cracks in the highest glass ceiling
2387868 working together we can cut poverty in half within 10 years
2387869 coverage should be made affordable for all americans with direct financial assistance through tax credits and other means

2387876 people are now coming around to the fact that growth is slowing both in the u s and overseas so demand for commodities will decline
2387877 everybody is scrambling to get out of the ship before the guy next to them
2387878 its amazing how fast commodities have become the last place people want to have their money
2387879 it looks like the bulls have run out of ammo
2387880 with poor demand prospects ahead theres not a lot of reason to be buying commodities right now
2387881 i dont see them with their scorched fingers coming back into the market that money is gone for a while
2387882 but were not expecting that to happen for at least a few quarters
2387883 but the question is how intense is it and how long will it last
2387884 add together the unfunded liabilities from medicare and social security and it comes to 99 2 trillion over the infinite horizon traditional medicare composes about 69 percent the new drug benefit roughly 17 percent and social security the remaining 14 percent
2387885 lets say you and i and bruce ericson and every u s citizen who is alive today decided to fully address this unfunded liability through lump sum payments from our own pocketbooks so that all of us and all future generations could be secure in the knowledge that we and they would receive promised benefits in perpetuity how much would we have to pay if we split the tab again the math is painful with a total population of 304 million from infants to the elderly the per person payment to the federal treasury would come to 330 000 this comes to 1 3 million per family of four over 25 times the average households income
2387886 we urge all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
2387887 we are working on mediation efforts to secure a cease fire and we are urging the parties to restart their dialogue
2387888 countries like germany and france were already resistant to the idea of giving a nato security guarantee to a country with an open dispute with russia i cant see how they can get the consensus of 26 states anytime soon
2387889 we will not allow the deaths of our compatriots to go unpunished
2387890 weve been encouraging everyone involved and every international party to engage in talks for years months days hours
2387891 we find ourselves in a situation similar to where the czechs were in 1968 to where the hungarians found themselves in 1956
2387892 the conflict might be short and hot but my sense is that neither party wants a prolonged conflict
2387893 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2387894 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2387895 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2387896 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help

2387898 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2387899 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2387900 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2387901 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2387902 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it

2387910 the offense did a pretty good job getting it out from the goalline senior tailback byron lawrence the nations fourth leading returning rusher with 1 377 yards last year had a couple of nice cuts and the offensive line got some things done
2387911 the offense made some plays our tailbacks looked good and both quarterbacks showed some encouraging signs
2387912 defensively we had some younger guys mixed in and at times we had busts you want your mistakes to happen now so we can learn from them and get it straightened out by aug 30 you live and learn hopefully
2387913 these are new guys who will play weve got to get them ready to go theyll be fine
2387914 we need them to get back out there theyre good enough to play right away theyre just not healthy right now and that means theyre missing time they need to be ready to go aug 30

2387927 they wont take my fuel surcharge till they pry it from my cold dead hand
2387928 because fuel prices have been so highly volatile we elected to implement the fuel supplement as a separate charge so we would be in a position to promptly and effectively make adjustments to the amount based on the potential for ongoing changes to fuel prices
2387929 you should expect that fuel supplements are going to be around at least for a while
2387930 at this time we have no plans to eliminate the surcharge
2387931 weve chosen to use the supplement because it specifically highlights that issue for our guests
2387932 it ensures our guests know about it and know specifically what its designed to do
2387933 people need to be mindful of the fact that the fuel supplements being collected do not cover the record high fuel costs that we have experienced in recent years

2387954 the hebrew bible is the one artifact from antiquity that not only maintained its integrity but continues to have a vital powerful effect thousands of years later i believe that in its present form the hebrew bible is a product of a very carefully worked out plan to achieve symmetry totality even perfection theres a deliberate effort made to pool together all the heterogeneous elements in the jewish tradition and make a single whole this book was intended to reflect what they believed about the perfection of god more especially about the importance of his word it was to reflect in written form the activity of god in the world and the link between members committed to this word just as god created the universe and rules the universe and directs history through the word spoken here in the bible is the word written its the equivalent of the word spoken this makes the bible something even more special not just another relic from antiquity it has a unique quality my brother who is a professed atheist says the bible is the richest source that he knows for human experience

2387962 mighty russia population 150m and tiny georgia population 4 6m its former colony and now fiercely independent neighbour are in terrible danger of blundering into a bloody and pointless conflict in the caucasus it would sorely damage relations between moscow the european union and the us it could also destabilise the rest of the caucasus region washington and brussels can urge restraint but the only country that can stop the nonsense is russia itself mr saakashvili does not want to take on moscow but mr putin and dmitry medvedev his anointed successor seem to want to prove two things that georgia is far too unstable to join nato and that they alone can determine the future of the former soviet space they are right that neither the us alone nor the nato allies would dream of intervening in a military confrontation but georgia is only unstable because of russian policies encouraging secessionists sends a terrible signal to others inside russia especially in the rebellious north caucasus moscows policy may be macho but in the long run it will be utterly self defeating

2387972 when artists like rirkrit tiravanija create high profile aestheticised versions of these ordinary spaces of resistance inside art galleries they risk perpetuating the myth that the right and proper place for non commodified exchange and aesthetic experience is a special architectural space rather than recognizing that everyday life itself is riddled with such opportunities

2387980 this email see forwarded below is being sent to people from garth turner using email addresses he culled from his blogs comment system a comment system that does not include an opt in for email marketing he is using constant contact to process his email list but it seems that he is in violation of constant contacts terms of service so i dont think constant contact is to blame
2387981 garth turners deranged fans threaten those who complain of being spammed alluding to a beating with a baseball bat
2387982 since when do those who are spammed the criminals who ought to be punished surrounded by people like this is it no wonder that garth turner thinks that he can spam with impunity
2387983 as his technical partner i ensure that mr turner leads by example and conducts all his activities in an open and responsible manner
2387984 it must also be noted that this complaint has been submitted by a vociferous partisan opponent to mr turner as such this complaint likely is motivated by pure partisan venom and therefore carries little credibility

2388001 it will also means that customers will be paying more for less as providers are forced to continually build out their networks to stay ahead of the massive bandwidth consumption growth
2388002 weekend thoughts i dont want to do this on my own
2388003 of acting according to the needs of the context and the tenor of the time
2388004 i am referring to an art without artwork without authorship not signed by an artist and above all without a spectator or audience
2388005 it is on this basis that i feel art needs to avoid artworld framing devices i also sense that many artists today feel that intuition although many shy away from taking the necessary steps toward a genuine stealth art practice one that requires forsaking artwork authorship and spectatorship
2388006 stealth art is a clandestine border crosser like the secret agent so why then does art so adamantly refuse to forsake its artistic visibility even though doing so would have the explicit advantage of giving it more use value and even make it better art providing adequacy between form and content i suspect it is because the reliable signature attesting to the artists occupational identity and the artworld recognition it provides is the ultimate art commodity still valued by enterprise culture
2388007 there are more stealth practices going on than the artworld ever acknowledges or even knows about this is for the self evident reason that they are by definition and by design hard to see let alone recognize but also because they subvert mainstream artworld values for there is nothing to exhibit and thus nothing to sell stealth practices tend to be written off as non art if not quite nonexistent the art critical challenge is to draw attention to them in an appropriately elusive way both for their intrinsic worth and because they obey a certain art historical logic stealth and spy art practices have become a viable way of pursuing art at a historical moment when art has withdrawn from the world though that may appear grossly counterintuitive to anyone whose only sources are the official organs of the artworld like flash art or art forum in the face of the omnipresence of the cultural and consciousness industries art has withdrawn from the world and has hidden before our very eyes the only place it is safe from artworld recuperation the only place left where the artworld is not looking for it
2388008 the purpose of this project is for large collections of materials to become accessible so that knowledge ideas and expertise can be freely shared and exchanged
2388009 works and artifacts that retain fine arts complex ambitions for the culture while eschewing the specialized language of fine art in favor of mass accessibility it can be manifested in games toys fashion public sculpture books hoaxes indeed in any product that has contact with the public
2388010 1 if i hear one more museum podcast feature visitors to the museum and what they think of im going to delete them from my feeds museums all employ armies of people who do interesting things conservation research building installing curating and so on podcasting was made for telling us what cool things those people are up to instead we too oft get joe schmoe saying that the comb in a magritte looks soooo reallllll
2388011 suggesting that a museum work a little harder when it comes to programming its podcast isnt one of them
2388012 why take rhetorical potshots at the public whose mission it is for cultural institutions to serve and educate about why there might be more to be said about magritte for instance

2388032 no one knew my address or my phone number you had to stalk me to figure this stuff out
2388033 i had no idea he lived anywhere in the vicinity i wonder if its possible that ivins moved to that location to be close to nancy
2388034 i said this happened and im sure youre the one who did it and he denied it
2388035 and i said well im still sure you did what can you do at that point
2388036 he seemed to know a lot about myself my children things i never remembered telling him which always disturbed me
2388037 i kept him at arms length as best i could
2388038 after a while after i decided that he was probably the perpetrator i was afraid of him
2388039 i thought that if he found out i had turned him in he would go after me and he knew how to do that this is something his colleagues dont seem to recognize in him
2388040 we already had firsthand experience with him going back and forth
2388041 im sorry it took me so long to get back to you but there were some things that needed my attention
2388042 now i think some explanation might be in order what do you remember from the party two days ago
2388043 i remember being at the party and dancing with you having a few drinks but not much else
2388044 but you will not be using that to address me
2388045 and you were perfectly willing at the party you told me that you had no family or friends here just your job and you really didnt like that you were ready to be my pet you even signed a letter of resignation now there is no one that will miss you
2388046 you have been in your cell for a long time pet i would imagine that you need to relieve yourself
2388047 you can use it and you will even if i stand here and watch you

2388053 now what was the lesson you were to be learning
2388054 well it appears that i need to go to the next level for this lesson
2388055 this is high pet now i have a few things to do so i will leave you for a while this room is sound proofed so dont be shy about yelling

2388058 this is 10 times 20 times bigger than the nba
2388059 its bigger than the nba because i am representing my whole country all the states all 50 states thats compared to the city of cleveland that i represent in the nba
2388060 i knew then that it was going to be a long two weeks
2388061 that team was just not a team i couldnt watch any of the olympic games after that

2388067 im serious take heed you have been blessed to be called at such a young age

2388069 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me
2388070 has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
2388071 its very difficult out there and i made it more so
2388072 i got off to a bad start and kept it going unfortunately
2388073 when you get on a bogey run around here its very difficult to get off it the course is very very severe its set up as extremely difficult as any course ive ever played
2388074 its nothing like the place that we came and did so well at four years ago
2388075 this tournament is not going to be won at one under par
2388076 i just need to make sure that i stay around where i am maybe a little closer to par if i can and im sure that will have a chance on sunday
2388077 i hit a good shot probably two yards farther left than i needed to that just caught the slope to the left
2388078 i had a long putt up and over and left to right from probably about 50 feet and hit it just a little too soft i hit it about six feet short
2388079 youll venture through space exploring new civilizations and life forms
2388080 youll also beam down to planets and have adventures inside your ship its a galactic wide game theres going to be tons of space to investigate we have a great system for exploration which will allow for almost infinite possibilities
2388081 as it became apparent they werent going to continue to function they decided to sell off the license we swooped in and grabbed it we took no assets there was nothing to be had to be honest were building
2388082 there might be a ship called enterprise flying around but its probably not the same ship anymore
2388083 most of the characters will have either retired or passed on but youll definitely be going to all the places you know and love from star trek expect to see oldies like vulcan and bajor but also fan favorites like andoria and qonos
2388084 i think publishers have concluded the only games that work are the surefire 500 million box office kind of games like spider man and shrek
2388085 the transformers game really surprised people how well it did but the movie was big i dont think they expected the dark knight movie to be this big
2388086 it was a struggle i did my best to be ready for the week but clearly im not the harder i tried the worse it got i havent got the focus this week im just not with it
2388087 obviously im still just having a hangover after winning the open
2388088 you would love to try and go with the flow and thats what you try and do but the harder you try the worse you make it certainly that was the case for me
2388089 playing on the pga tour prepared me for this week
2388090 ive been playing well and its getting better every week i know a lot of the guys and it just feels like another pga tour event
2388091 i thought going out early it was going to be softer on the greens but that wasnt the case
2388092 i left a few putts out there but overall it was a very good ball striking round
2388093 a moeda deve ter sido feita por um profissional o trabalho impressionante
2388094 it was a lie from the beginning throughout the war and even today
2388095 i do think we need to examine the issues of both gulf war syndrome and the anthrax vaccine and how they can be dealt with they are political problems for us
2388096 bioport should not be able to keep that contract for years they never met any goals or objectives for years they got bonuses that equaled or exceeded their salaries and didnt accomplish their goals
2388097 the damage that was done to our tigers in the armed forces is incredible
2388098 hundreds of pilots have left the air force rather than take the shot 6 million to train one pilot thats a high price to pay right
2388099 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2388100 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2388101 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2388102 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2388103 were going to have a very clear message about how the campaign will cooperate and how the convention will be conducted when its appropriate to make that announcement
2388104 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2388105 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2388106 once he got out of that jam it affected the rest of the night
2388107 he did a good job coming back at us and pitching seven strong innings we didnt do much to him
2388108 he doesnt bother me as much as some of the other guys
2388109 when i pitch i try to think the other team is the best in baseball
2388110 can feel the difference see a little more life on the ball
2388111 we need to do a better job getting to the relievers with a good lead
2388112 somebody was laying on my legs a lady next to me she had her arm crushed up the lady who was on my left a man was on top of her
2388113 i think im the luckiest one out of most people
2388114 if there is a loss of pressure or the tire becomes delaminated its much more difficult to control the vehicle
2388115 we have requested law enforcement agencies to be alert for any buses being operated by angel tours or iguala busmex since they are not authorized to operate legally
2388116 if found on the road we want law enforcement to immediately stop and place the vehicles out of service
2388117 this happened like katrina like challenger what we can do is pray
2388118 god will comfort them tell people to keep trusting in god do not blame anybody do not ask why now we just help each other to get through this
2388119 the church is like one big family here were very close we stick together
2388120 we are here with them to pray for those who are lost and for gods consolation in this time of grief and loss
2388121 the vietnamese catholic culture is very strong a lot of those who have come here have been through a great deal just to get to this country theyve always preserved their catholic faith this is a trial this is a challenge
2388122 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2388123 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2388124 georgian military forces completely control all the territory of south ossetia
2388125 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2388126 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
2388127 definitely being the eldest son my mom my parents theyve been waiting for this day a long time
2388128 theyre flying in from the mainland so im really fortunate for them to fly in for us and im really fortunate that they are able to make it this morning
2388129 everybodys so delightful i just im just overwhelmed i just cried and cried i hope they didnt take me crying but anyway it was tears of joy kirk
2388130 i told her i was like dont cry dont cry but i broke down when i hugged my mom yeah
2388131 i think just for everybody to have a good time everything just go well everything just
2388132 yeah i wanna give all this up and feed the homeless i wanna give all this up and teach orangutans sign language im gonna bike around the countryside with my
2388133 ive learned a lot become a better professional and a better man because of my experience and my time in new york i dont regret or feel ashamed about anything that happened to me in my time in new york
2388134 the most difficult part is just the realization that the organization no longer wants you
2388135 you spend eight years there and in the blink of an eye youre no longer wanted there
2388136 my address wasnt published and i only lived there a short while before carl and i got married and moved out of state
2388137 no one knew my address or my phone number you had to stalk me to figure this stuff out
2388138 i had no idea he lived anywhere in the vicinity i wonder if its possible that ivins moved to that location to be close to nancy
2388139 i said this happened and im sure youre the one who did it and he denied it
2388140 and i said well im still sure you did what can you do at that point
2388141 he seemed to know a lot about myself my children things i never remembered telling him which always disturbed me
2388142 i kept him at arms length as best i could
2388143 after a while after i decided that he was probably the perpetrator i was afraid of him
2388144 i thought that if he found out i had turned him in he would go after me and he knew how to do that this is something his colleagues dont seem to recognize in him
2388145 we already had firsthand experience with him going back and forth
2388146 i might go to zippys i might go to rainbow drive inn i havent decided yet
2388147 the main purpose of me being here right now before i head off and see my grandma is to say thank you to all of you because all of you worked so hard to put me in the position where i may have the honor of serving as your president of the united states
2388148 gas prices have gone up the roof food prices have gone through the roof and its time that you have got some real relief so its time to have an energy policy in this country that makes sense
2388149 this is the government of the single mom who like my mother who was living here in honolulu had to get food stamps sometimes but still was able to get me a good education and still was able to send me to college i promise you we will not just win here in hawaii we will win all across the country we will and you and i together we will change this country and we will change this world see ya on the beach
2388150 theres never a good time for a vacation the fact of the matter is we had a much longer primary season than the republicans did
2388151 senator mccain had a bout 23 or 4 months where he was not competing i had 3 days where i was not competing
2388152 so at some point its important for me to see my grandma and its important for me to spend some time with those 2 girls and a wife who likes to see me once in a while too
2388153 how would your hawaii background influence your leadership in terms of how it would impact some specifics here education our military population you addressed energy already
2388154 obviously the history of pearl harbor is a profound one one of the things i do every time i visit is go to punchbowl cemetery where my grandfather is interred and thats something that as commander in chief id be very sensitive to and want to spend time on
2388155 she is as sharp as shes ever been her body is not in great shape shes got osteoperosis which means she cant travel she cant sit for long periods of time on a plane so thats why its so important for me to take these trips back to hawaii i missed going back to see her last december which is when i usually go because we were in middle of the iowa caucus process
2388156 i will be working on the convention speech i spent time writing the convention speech i delivered 4 years ago i want to spend some time and now is a little bit of time when you can step back and reflect on those issues
2388157 i will not be talking about the vice presidential process until ive introduced my vice presidential running mate to all of you and to the american people
2388158 the edwards family indicated they probably wouldnt be attending the convention but this is a difficult and painful time for them
2388159 hawaii is always going to be a special part of my life its the place where i grew up
2388160 i think anybody who isnt interested in coming back to hawaii probably hasnt been here
2388161 if youre going to discard of any type of mail like a pre approved credit application you have bank statements credit card statements you should always shred them
2388162 you should be very conscious if youre providing any information over a website if youre not familiar with it and dont understand the purpose of why someones requesting it you should never do it
2388163 a lot of the different offers out there do have different varying degrees i think its wise to have some form of identity theft protection
2388164 i think it gets more difficult in the afternoon so the leaders are going to have a harder time tomorrow
2388165 as the greens get firmer or crustier and bumpier and the ball doesnt check and you cant hit it firm enough all of the guys who are in the lead and the top half of the field will have a tougher course tomorrow afternoon
2388166 its similar very similar to what we see at opens normally
2388167 a inten o com essa rede gigante era chamar a aten o mesmo para essa tradi o do nordeste que t o rica
2388168 o maior desafio era construir o suporte nas redes comuns a base feita de madeira maci a mas para a gigante ficaria invi vel conseguimos fazer um suporte de madeira que n o fosse t o pesado s agora
2388169 a rede vai com certeza chamar aten o para c quem sabe at n o venham mais turistas n o
2388170 systematically recognizing rebates from c amp as suppliers before those cost reductions had in fact been earned
2388171 under the insurance policies the money may run out by the end of 2008
2388172 the delay in getting to trial in this case has caused and continues to cause excruciating stress in every aspect of my life it is extremely difficult to exist in a state of uncertainty and limbo the presumption of innocence may apply in the courtroom but not in many other areas of life i appear to be presumed guilty in the eyes of the business community until proven innocent
2388173 barnabas legal team estimates based on the recent burn rate that the d amp o policy funds could easily be exhausted by the end of september and will last no longer than december 2008
2388174 r egardless of how he attempts to characterize the charged conduct attributable to him barnaba cannot escape the reality of being charged together with each of his codefendants in all of the securities fraud related counts in the indictment
2388175 these condominiums wont be finished for 18 months to two years
2388176 and i think by that time the market conditions will have changed
2388177 was done in tandem with him and what he wants to do on his property
2388178 we think all of these projects will complement each other
2388179 this wasnt something imposed it seems that this backtracking would be the result of the backlash from anti muslim hate web sites and islamophobes on the internet
2388180 i would have thought that people would have been more sensitive and sympathetic to the concern to the members of our community who want to celebrate their religious faith
2388181 its a little disingenuous to say that they tyson were responding to employee concerns the proposal came from workers themselves
2388182 for over a hundred years labor day has stood as a symbol to honor the working men and women of this country but for the past few years traditions like labor day have been under attack this time its gone too far and we as patriotic americans must draw our line in the sand
2388183 the amount being paid to the music industry even though their games are entirely dependent on the content we own and control is far too small
2388184 i just found them in the trunk of my car
2388185 there might be a few more transactions like this too i mean ive got a mortgage
2388186 people from farragut come in wanting loans anywhere from 300 to 500
2388187 without the pawn industry the middle class and below would have nowhere to go
2388188 were having to be picky if someone shows up with a whole truckload of tools i tell them no thanks ive got plenty
2388189 if i said i wouldnt take anything else but one single item gold would be it
2388190 its good to see public acknowledgment that our story was accurate all along
2388191 probably the biggest question about this whole mess is why the mainstream media protected edwards by ignoring the story for the past 8 months
2388192 i think its entirely appropriate for a news organization to wait to report a story until they have information that theyre comfortable with reporting
2388193 all i can say is that were not in the business of printing things we dont know to be true
2388194 the problem with a story like this is that its very very difficult to ascertain the truth until one of the people steps forward
2388195 the national enquirer is a supermarket tabloid that is accurate some of the time and inaccurate some of the time
2388196 it was the subject of late night talk shows and certainly all over the web
2388197 it was in our culture and in our faces and to act as if it didnt exist would be to ignore reality
2388198 i dont know if others were confused by the fact that it seemed tawdry to follow a tip that began with a tabloid
2388199 the truth of the matter is journalists take tips from all sorts of sources and some of them are unsavory thats not so important as what you do with the tip
2388200 its nice in the woods i think the woods smell good
2388201 im doing what i can with what i know now
2388202 children do not need to be made to learn to be better told what to do or shown how if they are given access to enough of the world they will see clearly enough what things are truly important to themselves and to others and they will make for themselves a better path into that world than anyone else could make for them
2388203 unschooling my children is enabling me to see them for all they are and all they can become unschooling my children is enabling me to see that life really is for living and exploring and singing and creating and discovering and trying and doing and being
2388204 while the boat by now some furlongs from land was hard pressed by rough waves for there was a head wind
2388205 in the fourth watch of the night he came towards them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were terrified it is a ghost they said and cried out in fear
2388206 jesus said come then peter got out of the boat and started walking towards jesus across the water
2388207 and at once he made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side while he sent the crowds away after sending the crowds away he went up into the hills by himself to pray
2388208 but then noticing the wind he took fright and began to sink
2388209 suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him
2388210 mid toil and tribulation and tumult of war she waits consummation of peace forevermore till with that vision glorious her longing eyes are blest and the great church victorious shall be the church at rest o happy ones and holy lord give us grace that we like those the meek and lowly on high may dwell thee
2388211 why do you put a piece of wood in the pot
2388212 to keep the water steady to keep it from spilling
2388213 so when our heart is distressed and agitated put the wood of the cross into the center of our heart to keep it steady in ever storm and distress the presence of jesus will bring peace and serenity and calm
2388214 take heart it is i do not be afraid come
2388215 this is an intriguing and rather original set of music jonas hellborg whose conception of the acoustic bass guitar is much closer to a guitar than to a bass teams up with drummer tony williams and the flexible soldier string quartet the sparse sextet explores songs that according to the liners are influenced by arab music jimi hendrix tony williams lifetime and bartok a variety of moods are explored and the unusual blend of instruments and styles grow in interest each time they are heard it is a pity though that the playing time is less than 37 minutes
2388216 well apparently youre more than just a friend lo udah cukup kenal gw gw udah cukup kenal lo bisa dibilang lo udah di lingkaran dalem gw sih walaupun belom dalame dalem banget ga tau ya mungkin karena gw punya ade cewe jadi hampir semua cewe yang deket sama gw ya gw treat as a little sister that i have to take care of gw baru sadar itu akhir akhir ini klise mungkin tapi emang bener terserah mau percaya apa ga gw juga ngerasa kita ga bisa lebih dari ini walaupun dipaksa kayak gimana pun juga gw ga akan nge bullshit lo terlalu baik buat gw atau all that crap ga lah basi itu cuma it doesnt feel right aja daripada sama sama nyesel di kemudian hari gw minta maaf kalo ngebuat lo ga nyaman dan mungkin salah paham gw udah bilang kan im not such a good guy gw kadang kadang emang suka flirty sih gw akuin tapi cuma ke temen temen cewe yang udah deket aja ga enak aja sama yang ga terlalu deket tapi ya gw minta maaf atas semua hal yang bikin lo ga enak selama ini
2388217 oh why did you have to play your game on me i shouldve known right from the start youd go and break my heart
2388218 i dont want to be your friend i just want to be your lover no matter how it ends no matter how it starts
2388219 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2388220 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2388221 next 100 and today i will be posting the last part of our list of 100 women political bloggers
2388222 we try to be very sensitive to make sure that we have vetted everything that is said and when youre doing live television thats nearly impossible
2388223 when i interview outside counsel if they come in here with four lawyers and try to tell me why theyre special they probably wont get the job
2388224 why because i look at staffing and i dont mind paying 500 an hour as long as im going to talk to god but if im going to be charged 500 an hour because three associates together spent hours researching an issue and im getting the memo that comes out of three associates research im offended
2388225 this job is exciting in a new way every day
2388226 because shes a creative butterfly we never know where shes going to land
2388227 much of what i do is triage making a decision about what has to be done immediately because of either legal risk or running the business and what can be put off and what can be delegated and what do i have to do myself
2388228 in terms of dealing with her as a person ive been doing that so long shes just a very great person and a good client
2388229 ive never felt this good in my football career since high school
2388230 those other two things become easier when your body is in better shape
2388231 now instead of having to concentrate on the physical as well as the mental and the team leadership part i think youre going to see him progress dramatically in the other two areas because hes in so much better shape physically
2388232 even coming in early in january i didnt know every single thing about the playbook all my reads all my sights what my hot routes were stuff like that i worked really hard during the spring and i think ive got a pretty good handle
2388233 so i think that theyre kind of competing against each other to see who would get more reps because armandos more that change of pace guy hes almost like his own separate entity like hes 1 a already and then well see from the other two guys who gets more reps based off of performance
2388234 the only one that is just borderline is will yeatman
2388235 about a month ago he had a bit of a hamstring pull he ran really good when we were running he ran really well and hes going to practice i think that i would probably limit him a little bit from extra running and things like that in the very beginning
2388236 the one guy who made plays all spring all over the field all the time was brian smith
2388237 and in this defense the guy who is in position to do that all the time is the middle linebacker brian is the one guy who stood out for the coaching staff every day every play
2388238 weve got to find out what we have with dayne
2388239 but right now the depth chart as we walk in the door is very clearly established with jimmy no 1 evan sharpley no 2 and dayne no 3 that is walking in the door right now youve still got to go by what you see
2388240 instead of getting that six man rotation for five spots like weve done in the past those other four guys are settled in nicely
2388241 those two veterans turkovich and duncan that have playing experience are going to battle it out and may the best man win
2388242 the feedback on michael floyd from jimmy clausen has been through the roof
2388243 its been very very very good very very very positive
2388244 in my opinion auto generating descriptions is a load of bull
2388245 if god created everything then god created evil since evil exists and according to the principal that our works define who we are then god is evil
2388246 what kind of question is this of course it exists have you never been cold
2388247 in fact sir cold does not exist according to the laws of physics what we consider cold is in reality the absence of heat every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy absolute zero 460 f is the total absence of heat all matter becomes inert and incapable of reaction at that temperature cold does not exist we have created this word to describe how we feel if we have no heat
2388248 once again you are wrong sir darkness does not exist either darkness is in reality the absence of light light we can study but not darkness in fact we can use newtons prism to break white light into many colors and study the various wavelengths of each color you cannot measure darkness a simple ray of light can break into a world of darkness and illuminate it how can you know how dark a certain space is you measure the amount of light present isnt this correct darkness is a term used by man to describe what happens when there is no light present
2388249 of course as i have already said we see it everyday it is in the daily example of mans inhumanity to man it is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world these manifestations are nothing else but evil
2388250 evil dies not exist sir or at least is does not exist unto itself evil is simply the absence of god it is just like of god god did not create evil evil is the result of what happens when man does not have gods love present in his heart its like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light

2388266 the economy is limping along and businesses are doing whatever they can to remain competitive
2388267 so we had fewer people working shorter hours and producing more
2388268 while we are disappointed in the cancellation of our performance it seems various misconceptions of us have been relegated as proof
2388269 im going to think about producing my own shows as the group and everyone at the label and koch entertainment our distribution is disappointed with this turn of events
2388270 well he doesnt seem to have a problem with it
2388271 we are pleased that in two separate patent cases in front of two different itc judges broadcom has prevailed at trial with rulings that support our position that sirf infringes our intellectual property but that we do not infringe theirs

2388283 there are signs pointing to it but with no lights the roadway itself is barely visible even when the bright lights of the car are turned on
2388284 but john mccain is four more years of george w bush
2388285 the danger from iran is grave it is real and my goal will be to eliminate this threat
2388286 let there be no doubt i will always keep the threat of military action on the table to defend our security and our ally israel sometimes there are no alternatives to confrontation
2388287 michael moore is a supporter of yours and has endorsed you but in his new book mikes election guide he says the following go ahead and fill in the blank ive provided a full list of outrageously offensive lines already taken out of context in advance to make it easy for rightwing commentators and fox news will you still accept his endorsement or do you denounce him
2388288 i got here at 4 40 this morning and it was really spooky it was just me and a few maintenance workers
2388289 im first and im glad to be first and im proud to be here im so thrilled
2388290 were terribly excited and the process is awesome that everybody can come out here to this beautiful field and see a great man
2388291 please remove your pin youre going to go through a metal detector
2388292 im really happy that he saw it to take this time out to come and to say a word to us here
2388293 its wonderful for people to have it free rather than having to spend the money because thats whats its all about including all the people
2388294 its a good alternative to those of who cant afford the expensive fundraisers
2388295 if you have a chair please take your chair back to your car

2388298 this is the start of his vacation and so we really appreciate that hes taking the time to thank the people of hawaii for their support
2388299 hes the most famous person in the world right now
2388300 the only book i use is the book of love
2388301 if god created everything then god created evil since evil exists and according to the principal that our works define who we are then god is evil
2388302 what kind of question is this of course it exists have you never been cold
2388303 in fact sir cold does not exist according to the laws of physics what we consider cold is in reality the absence of heat every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy absolute zero 460 f is the total absence of heat all matter becomes inert and incapable of reaction at that temperature cold does not exist we have created this word to describe how we feel if we have no heat
2388304 once again you are wrong sir darkness does not exist either darkness is in reality the absence of light light we can study but not darkness in fact we can use newtons prism to break white light into many colors and study the various wavelengths of each color you cannot measure darkness a simple ray of light can break into a world of darkness and illuminate it how can you know how dark a certain space is you measure the amount of light present isnt this correct darkness is a term used by man to describe what happens when there is no light present
2388305 of course as i have already said we see it everyday it is in the daily example of mans inhumanity to man it is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world these manifestations are nothing else but evil
2388306 evil dies not exist sir or at least is does not exist unto itself evil is simply the absence of god it is just like of god god did not create evil evil is the result of what happens when man does not have gods love present in his heart its like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light
2388307 in the oath i gave my word and promise to protect and defend and obey the u s constitution and the utah constitution as well i had never read either and knew virtually nothing about them
2388308 i notice from your columns that john coles of new wine is advocating the gamaliel principle as a means of assessing the so called revival meetings led by the canadian todd bentley
2388309 if this plan or undertaking is of men it will fail but if it is of god you will not be able to overthrow them
2388310 if you look at the color outside the window things look like its mid may
2388311 everything is lush and green and here it is august
2388312 its been several years since weve had a summer like this
2388313 in my own part of south overland park ive only watered my yard once and that was because i was going to be gone
2388314 theres really been no need to water anything its definitely a year to save on the water bill
2388315 we havent had very many people calling us to say dont mow this week
2388316 the weather has kept things green this year for sure
2388317 we probably get two or three that are not like this
2388318 the recidivism rate depending on whose statistics youre looking at is anywhere between 30 and 60 percent
2388319 if we can address those recidivism rates with that finite group of individuals and cut that in half then you will see a dramatic reduction in crime
2388320 these are people who have already been in the system and for whatever reason they are statistically likely to re offend
2388321 we need to address them with job training substance abuse counseling and anger control management
2388322 i want to use the drug court model that was so successful for first time offenders with repeat offenders if we can reduce those recidivism rates then well reduce the violent crime rates significantly
2388323 i think we need change from the top and hes sincere
2388324 it doesnt take a lot to show progress based on what weve had for the last four years anything at all beats what weve had the kind of commitments he makes will be the kind of commitments hell deliver on
2388325 i hope americans will see it as change as a breath of fresh air i hope people will see him as someone who is inclusive and someone who can bring us together and make us live up to our reputation not only domestically but internationally as well theres a breath of fresh air on the horizon
2388326 so ive got to get it in gear while im in dubai i plan on learning how to speak hebrew i want to be able to learn and write hebrew and learn and write arabic
2388327 i hope to bring back a culture that nobody knows about
2388328 i hope to bring back a bit of understanding and bridge the gap between americans especially african americans and the arabian people and their culture my main goal is to hopefully bring youth together
2388329 i cant imagine what lexy his wife is going through
2388330 hes done that hike before he was completely skilled and he grew up in those mountains
2388331 we stopped at 3 a m because of the driving rainstorm
2388332 why did he go this route what were his thoughts what was he trying to accomplish
2388333 he probably summited and was on his way down when he fell
2388334 we can only speculate that he slipped unfortunately quandary peak claims a lot of people probably eight to 10 over the last six years
2388335 children who dont look good dont feel good dont act good
2388336 our children dont know about income they know about outcome
2388337 this really helps it helped even before the gas prices but now it really does
2388338 if these claims were true which they are not plaintiff would not be entitled to recover against gloria squitiro
2388339 if the missouri general assembly had intended for the act to impose individual liability it could have easily included the word employee
2388340 another position of like nature and salary and instead chose to quit her employment
2388341 before we opened the community center we were kind of philandering
2388342 it was due to the fact that we didnt have any space to put any art but this facility really brought the need for their expertise now they are focused
2388343 kids can interact with it the community center is filled with all kinds of people coming in to swim or work out and i think we picked a group of offerings that is really family friendly
2388344 has the experience drive and expertise to assist the board in their public protection mandate
2388345 people are very attached to their animals i hope you appreciate that
2388346 he kicked the dog he hit the dog on the head and threw it out of the room
2388347 the cover up is not only as bad as the crime
2388348 lord lord did we not cast out demons in your name
2388349 said kristine konrad the mother of three boys 11 9 and 3 whom she teaches at her san leandro home
2388350 this is a major victory for the rights of parents over the education of their children
2388351 i was driving down the new jersey turnpike when i heard
2388352 it took me exactly from one rest stop to the next to conclude that i wanted to dive right in
2388353 i realized that i was moving into a situation that was very fluid
2388354 is on the cusp of a new phase that will present interesting and challenging legal issues
2388355 and she is a leader who carries herself with great self confidence and a presence that commands the room
2388356 a lot of private developers are either unwilling to do it or dont know how to interact with an agency like the housing authority
2388357 one of the historic issues with public housing was that it separated people from the larger community
2388358 this is more of a community than the high rise was people have a better speaking relationship
2388359 they got the results of your blood work and they want you to come over
2388360 hi this is june siang a law graduates going to do clp in this coming septemeber i visited laweddie com and it clarifies many doubts in my head i just want to say thank you mr eddie
2388361 the evidence shows thornton saw him and wanted another gun
2388362 she gathered us kids around the table and said i cant raise four kids on a ward clerks salary
2388363 she said im going back to school so things are going to be tough around here
2388364 collins worked nights at trinity lutheran hospital and went to avila college during the day where she got her four year degree in nursing
2388365 maybe things were tougher than i thought but mom just didnt let us know
2388366 we were preached about college from the time i was in kindergarten first grade
2388367 it was ingrained in our heads so much we never thought we wouldnt go to college
2388368 that was always her goal but being a school nurse didnt pay enough for four kids
2388369 she went above and beyond her job buying school supplies clothes underwear if the students needed them
2388370 she was a person who had a sense of responsibility
2388371 she volunteered at her church she worked in school with inner city kids and she was a good mother
2388372 we are just so thankful that the last years of her life she was doing what she wanted to do
2388373 i never in my life and never will be that kind of person
2388374 if he violates probation mr slaughter will go to prison for a substantial period of time
2388375 the state believes this defendant is a danger to the community
2388376 as crazy as it sounds yoda and the entire star wars series itself offers some fantastic suggestions to get us on the right path towards success only problem is few people have taken the time to do something as ridiculous as i have ponder how the classic tale can teach us a few things about making money
2388377 they get along well but dont want to start world war iii
2388378 second i think the reason so many christians care so little about environmental issues is nothing to do with their eschatology but rather because of syncretism we have made it possible to mix christianity with secular materialistic consumerism
2388379 americans are tired of things having meaning if things have meaning then that means you have to think about them
2388380 setiap produsen susu sudah mempertimbangkan agar seimbang jadi kalo dicampur dengan susu lain osmosisnya jadi tidak berimbang
2388381 por eso es que hay bastante p rater a aqu
2388382 why should i be any better than how you were
2388383 a science center should affect us all with a compelling desire to visit see explore engage and have fun when we walk away it is from a memorable experience a learning experience the science center design we create must at its heart change lives
2388384 at such a point asking for greater grace on both sides is like saying to a slave you need to accept your fate with grace and in return i the master will be gracious to you my inferior indeed scripture demands that we all stand up for justice but with love and in non violent ways
2388385 we dont know exactly what happened but the suspicion is that she may have died a day or so before of natural causes and perhaps had an electric blanket on the bed
2388386 she volunteered at the y she was very active in her greek orthodox church
2388387 she was a very nice lady and we all miss her a lot
2388388 a lot of neighbors here helped her out its a big loss to everybody
2388389 hasnt the individualistic question about personal salvation almost completely left us all arent we really under the impression that there are more important things than that question perhaps not more important than the matter itself but more important than the question i know it sounds pretty monstrous to say that but fundamentally isnt this biblical does the question about saving ones soul appear in the old testament at all arent righteousness and the kingdom of god on earth the focus of everything and isnt it true that romans 3 24ff is not an individualistic doctrine of salvation but the culmination of the view that god alone is righteous it is not with the beyond that we are concerned but with this world as created and preserved subjected to laws reconciled and restored what is above this world is in the gospel intended to exist for this world i mean that not in the anthropocentric sense of the liberal mystic pietistic ethical theology but in the biblical sense of the creation and of the incarnation crucifixion and resurrection of jesus christ
2388390 cheap grace is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance baptism without church discipline communion without confession absolution without personal confession cheap grace is grace without discipleship grace without the cross grace without jesus christ living and incarnate costly grace is the gospel which must be sought again and again the gift which must be asked for the door at which a person must knock such grace is costly because it calls us to follow and it is grace because it calls us to follow jesus christ it is costly because it costs us our life and it is grace because it gives us the only true life it is costly because it condemns sin and grace because it justifies the sinner above all it is costly because it cost god the life of gods son you were bought at a price and what has cost god much cannot be cheap for us above all it is grace because god did not reckon gods son too dear a price to pay for our life but delivered him up for us costly grace is the incarnation of god
2388391 you can sum up where weve landed in four simple sentences the world is sinful thats why god doesnt affirm it indiscriminately god loves the world thats why god doesnt punish it in justice what does god do with this double bind god forgives
2388392 youve got egos in the room but youve got to leave those at the door and work as friends
2388393 were trying to get a better idea of what kind of places they travel and feed in
2388394 so we can put more of that habitat out there
2388395 thats going to be the time that we can see whether the birds are staying
2388396 we think having the females there now will keep them around better
2388397 the things we re doing with nastia we re taking her to a higher level
2388398 random thoughts on a friday midmorning and yes im weird
2388399 stopping climate change is not the reason we should be attempting to live more simply in the first place the point about say travelling by public transport instead of your own private car is that such actions have their own intrinsic worth such green practices express a level of esteem for the world around us and the community we live in
2388400 you can always tell when the republicans are getting restless because the vice presidents motorcade pulls into the capital and darth vader emerges
2388401 i think publishers have concluded the only games that work are the surefire 500 million box office kind of games like spider man and shrek
2388402 the transformers game really surprised people how well it did but the movie was big i dont think they expected the dark knight movie to be this big
2388403 it just seems to be a scandalous waste they want to dig up one of the most prized parks possibly two in hammersmith and fulham
2388404 for them to propose the park plan when they had this piece of land here where they are building luxury flats is quite frankly a disgrace
2388405 how the welfare state robs americans of money and spirit
2388406 in 2005 total federal state and local government expenditures on 85 welfare programs were 620 billion thats larger than national defense 495 billion or public education 472 billion
2388407 the 2005 official poverty count was 37 million persons that means welfare expenditures per poor person were 16 750 or 67 000 for a poor family of four
2388408 those figures understate poverty spending because the poor benefit from non welfare programs such as social security medicare private charity and uncompensated medical care
2388409 the question that naturally arises is if were spending enough to lift everyone out of poverty why is there still poverty the obvious answer is that poor people are not receiving all the money being spent in their name non poor people are getting the bulk of it
2388410 brownings concluding chapter tells us what the welfare state costs us he acknowledges the non economic costs such as infringements on liberty and strains on the political process but focuses on the quantitative economic costs
2388411 the disincentive effects of social security have reduced the gdp by 10 the federal income tax as opposed to a proportional tax by 9 and past deficits by 3 5 for a total of 22 5 browning guesses that welfare programs have reduced gdp by 2 5 the overall effect of redistributionist policies has created incentives that have reduced gdp by a total of 25 without those our gdp would be close to 18 trillion instead of 14 trillion

2388420 this is a gargantuan story on the net made by those who care not the mainstream media or paid street teamers
2388421 the church confesses that it has witnessed the arbitrary use of brutal force the suffering in body and soul of countless innocent people that it has witnessed oppression hatred and murder without raising its voice for the victims and without finding ways of rushing to help them it has become guilty of the lives of the weakest and most defenseless brothers and sisters of jesus christ the church confesses that it has looked on silently as the poor were exploited and robbed while the strong were enriched and corrupted the church confesses its guilt toward the countless people whose lives have been destroyed by slander denunciation and defamation it has not condemned the slanderers for their wrongs and has thereby left the slandered to their fate the church confesses that it has coveted security tranquility peace property and honour to which it had no claim and therefore has not bridled human covetousness but promoted it
2388422 this mark therefore is as it were an approval of a true and lawful church a church is to be sought only where god presides and where christ reigns and that in short there is no church but that which is founded upon god is gathered under the auspices of christ and is united in his name
2388423 we never exceeded the thermal limit which is 90 degrees
2388424 the fact that we dont have two nuclear units available of course isnt what it would be on a day of high demand
2388425 the price of power right now is about 15 to 20 percent lower than it was earlier in the week
2388426 you want to keep them to a minimum but you take it into account
2388427 we know that were going to have some unplanned shutdowns and thats taken into account as far as how youre going to meet the demand
2388428 they were just great characters in gone country and threw themselves into it gone country is a total fish out of water show where these guys came in from their homes threw themselves into nashville lifestyle and it was a blast to watch
2388429 they were such fun to work with the producers came and said we have to get these guys involved in some other programming so we really tried to find a show that was a fish out of water type show again that allowed them to interact with real people
2388430 i went to go get my apron in the kitchen and there was a massive goat there
2388431 bobby could check a guest in and then he turns around and there might be an animal there for him to contend with he certainly didnt have it easy
2388432 i wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2388433 i know what im capable of doing and i know what he is i feel good
2388434 i tested it i threw it in the pool and it didnt move at all
2388435 its not the same watching it at home as seeing it in your capital
2388436 theyre not paying enough attention to people outside of beijing
2388437 everyone is asking me about the big screen there is no screen here
2388438 we just like to think theres a little a little laura in everybody
2388439 i couldnt afford a bed for awhile so i slept on the floor in the room i had
2388440 so it was me the dog and the sleeping bag for about a month and a half
2388441 he understands that if i need to do this then im going to do it theres no reservations
2388442 its a title fight but its not just a title fight its against one of the best in the weight and in the world across weights

2388445 i dont see any advantage of it said bela karoyli who coached comaneci in 1976

2388447 she practiced her whole life for this said her father and coach valeri liukin

2388453 this raises serious concerns about the commitment of russia to respect georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as questions about ultimate russian intentions and objectives
2388454 there are reports about ethnic cleansing in villages of south ossetia the population is panicking and the number of refugees is increasing a humanitarian catastrophe is in the offing and here tbilisi is using the tactic of scorched earth
2388455 it is the russian federation who really was supporting and is supporting militarily the regime in tskhinvali and sukhumi who are the perpetrators of the ethnic cleansing

2388457 you sit on your couch beer or soda in your hand and junk food by your side watching tv for hours thats ordinary you work around the clock not because you have to feed your family but for no other reason than to park a better car in your garage than your neighbours have thats ordinary you get up from your couch to play with your kids or you give time and energy to help educate a prisoner or lend an ear to an elderly person thats extraordinary why because you are giving every gift breaks the barrier between the sacred and the mundane and floods the mundane with the sacred when a gift is given life becomes extraordinary because gods own gift giving flows through the giver
2388458 some scholars of popular religion describe santa as a god of consumerist materialism whose sole purpose is to give and indeed many people think of god in this way as a santa claus conveniently enlarged to divine proportions god is an infinitely rich always available and unfailingly generous giver or at least thats what we feel a god worthy of divinity ought to be a santa claus god demands nothing from us the difference between a santa claus god and a gift giving god is this a santa claus god gives simply so we can have and enjoy things the true god gives so we can become joyful givers and not just self absorbed receivers god the giver has made us to be givers and obliges us therefore to give

2388493 was that pitts is currently working for a public relations firm whose clients include major pharmaceutical companies
2388494 i think its important to note that per full disclosure i was never asked i would like to assume that when i am called for interviews that the producers have done their due diligence
2388495 i also want to be clear that on the other programs mentioned

2388607 the successful completion of phase 2a trials on our oral insulin capsule is a major accomplishment for oramed the success of this trial will allow us to continue pushing forward at a steady pace to make an oral insulin capsule a reality for millions of diabetics around the world while we are quite excited about the progress we have made with our oral insulin capsule oramed is also focused on the oral delivery of other drugs and vaccines through our proprietary platform technology and we expect to share our developments in these areas with you as well

2388887 why cant this guy understand our spit is just as important
2388888 after silence that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music

2388890 they dont fully grasp the loan aspect of this that its something you need to pay back
2388891 students are handling credit much more responsibly than we think
2388892 if they run out of money when theyre out its probably a good time to go home
2388893 my bottom line is to say no to any credit cards except one
2388894 they shouldnt be getting any from vendors on campus or stores
2388895 if youre going to transfer a balance to a new card make sure there is a cap on the interest rate
2388896 video and other media services are going to push the speed of consumer network connections up as the demand is going to be huge
2388897 we were at todays speed of about 10mbps about 10 to 15 years ago so you could take that as a precedent for how long it will take for the commercial networks to catch up with us today
2388898 the lhc experiment would not be possible without the power and throughput of the lcg cern has not got the capacity to solely process the vast amount of data on site the tier one sites will be busy refining the data and enhancing the software that analyses it growing the processing operations of the grid
2388899 is to make sure that those physicists are getting the most useful and relevant data grid technology is transforming the way that experiments are being carried out ten years ago these institutions were working on their own now they work closely together
2388900 we have run it up to 250mbps to 300mbps each way sustained over several days so far we are in the final shakedown at the moment and seem to be in good shape to face the challenges the lhc will throw at us
2388901 the biggest challenge is for the software to work out which of the 200 or so tier two sites has which data you need to be able to move vast amounts of data from site to site check it has all got there flag up any problems and correct those immediately it quickly gets immensely complicated

2388908 every athlete and federation has the right to appeal the selection process and i am glad that it has been resolved
2388909 you and i have shared some significant trials and tribulations
2388910 this is the only real estate where lincoln and washington actually intersected
2388911 kids in high school need to know about that through the examples of washington and lincoln they need to think of what changes they can make in the world
2388912 i think i learned more in these couple of weeks than ive learned in three years of history classes
2388913 what can the declaration of independence tell us about life in 2008
2388914 there was nothing civil about it at all a house divided surely will fall
2388915 hes a true professional it was equal or better than broadway as far as i was concerned
2388916 bobs love of theater is contagious his standards incredibly high and his work ethic impeccable
2388917 i only planned to stay a couple of years i stayed because i loved it
2388918 it reminded me life is short and you have to make the most of it
2388919 like p t barnum he exudes energy and creativity he motivates people
2388920 i chose to make my hobby and my passion my career
2388921 we always thought and bob promoted that we were performing on a greater level than high school and you take that with you
2388922 bob taught us theres going to be rejection in life
2388923 you can have confidence even if you dont get that leading role
2388924 i doubt id want to get into my costume now
2388925 if he sat there and just watched id think something was wrong
2388926 tap into the camaraderie that was associated with a chance to connect with an audience after high school those experiences are few and far between
2388927 it popped in my head to lay it down in the fairway and hit a shot down there
2388928 if the pin was easier you might have saw a bit more of that but where they put the pin its pretty much impossible you have to try to get up where you can chip on
2388929 just because its a shorter hole doesnt make it a great hole
2388930 when i wake up in the morning and look in the mirror this is my challenge
2388931 i want to win on a road course and its the last chance i have this year to do it thats what it really boils down to
2388932 i just want more laps to get in the rhythm of road course racing i seem to have the pace for a handful of laps doing the right thing
2388933 im not sure if its being overaggressive what that really is i keep searching for it i cant find that half a tenth i just need more seat time
2388934 we qualified well at sonoma and we led at the beginning but we didnt race in traffic like we wanted to
2388935 this race here is very important for the points but its more of a personal challenge for myself and crew chief chad knaus its a race that were looking at to help us down the road we want to get out of here with a decent finish
2388936 every great driver wants to feel like they can win at every track they go to
2388937 jimmie is an awesome driver he proves it every weekend hes in the same equipment that im in so i can appreciate it more so than a lot of people can
2388938 road courses are not easy to win on i feel like theyve had some opportunities to win and they havent worked out hes been getting better and better when we go test hes usually faster than me i feel like its just a matter of time more than anything
2388939 the crazy thing is i do better in these other vehicles than i do in the cup car i just have to figure out how
2388940 it just shows how hard it is to stay on top weve put a lot of hard work in and have established ourselves as a contender
2388941 i never thought i would win at richmond and finally conquered that track it would be extremely satisfying to win at watkins glen
2388942 as much as we can talk about what our cars are doing and what were looking for in setups we do all that we can there
2388943 but when you get in the car and youre looking for a half a tenth of a second per corner and it totals up to a three or four tenths advantage from start to finish of a lap its really tough to communicate those things
2388944 its such a small difference its just a little everywhere i just need to do it more
2388945 when i hit my driver like i did this is an easy sport
2388946 its the kind of round ive been looking for to get myself back on the leader board and feeling the good vibes
2388947 when i got here on tuesday i called home and i said this is the hardest golf course ive ever played
2388948 if i were to play here every day i dont know if i would enjoy it its a very difficult golf course
2388949 im not that aggressive if im not hitting my driver good
2388950 if im hitting bad shots with it you dont hit it as much you hit it right where youve looked whale away
2388951 if youre hitting where youre aiming it every time youre hitting good
2388952 my senior year of high school i went out and watched tiger woods
2388953 a lot of the players they said hit the ball really long
2388954 if you did a stat over the last five years on who made the most pars id probably have one of the top 10 averages on tour
2388955 and in tournaments like this you have to be patient and realize that pars are pretty good
2388956 when im not at the golf course i try not to think about golf and the kids make it easy we had a few laughs then you go to sleep and wake up and every days different
2388957 if you really knew what i thought about this golf course youd think i could never have a chance of playing well or winning on it
2388958 if you hit in the rough getting on the green is more luck than skill so i understand where the players are coming from but you dont have to like it
2388959 you just have to accept it you have to try hard on every shot hit every shot to the best of your ability and see what happens you just have to avoid the big numbers
2388960 thats how i was able to get back in the british i was 5 over after two holes and 8 over at one point the wind was blowing 40 miles an hour and your hands were numb but why quit just try hard on every shot whos to say whats going to happen
2388961 i lost my head a little bit thursday i was 6 over the last eight holes and it was all mental it was one three putt after another but like i said you wake up and its a different day
2388962 no i think ive proved that i can play out here
2388963 to me thats all that matters if i sit here and think about winning another major ill be thinking about it for the rest of my life
2388964 i know i can win another one its just a matter of taking care of the opportunities that im given there are weeks that you can play your best and not win and there are weeks where you can kind of just stumble your way in and win so you cant think about it i dont have to prove anything to anybody but myself i dont think that if i cant win another major that my career is not fulfilled because it is

2388966 you cant just talk about it you have to go out there and do it
2388967 we didnt really get anything going try anything or do anything
2388968 but with that right handed hitting lineup youd think you would be able to get more than two runs
2388969 it wasnt a good bunt but it took a funny hop
2388970 what sri aurobindo represents in the earths history is not a teaching not even a revelation it is a decisive action direct from the supreme
2388971 we rely on a digital satellite feed for the transmission unfortunately we have had very heavy rain as a storm passed directly over the stations studio facility the rain was so heavy that it interfered with our primary digital satellite feed which is not at all unusual we have a back up satellite path that uses a different technology and is less susceptible to rain fade unfortunately when we initially switched to it there was no audio path that is regrettable that problem was corrected as quickly as we could we continued to monitor the signal from our primary feed and decided until we were satisfied we could provide a reliable hd feed we were staying with our back up to maintain the integrity of the broadcast this is very unfortunate and we regret the inconvenience
2388972 if you lived through the 1990s and saw how bill clinton campaigned on hope and ending partisan divisions only to be dragged through the mud in epic fashion its hard to view obamas rise without a tinge of dread
2388973 because it is one of the few that actually learns
2388974 i am coming at you you will explode in a couple of minutes
2388975 it was something i thought i could work through but it stuck with me
2388976 i just wasnt myself i didnt have location my velocity i realized after that game i couldnt keep going the way it was
2388977 i just got pumped because im getting ready to pitch and
2388978 it turned purple but they said i broke a blood vessel
2388979 with some of these things the technology is so new the concept so bizarre that there would only be a handful of well tapped in athletes using it but they will be experimenting at the beijing olympics because it is the ultimate
2388980 the problem is that some of the drugs would now fly under the radar with the tattoo technique because athletes would be taking a much smaller dose
2388981 im not sure my role in this game long term is as a closer
2388982 but if i can throw a couple of innings and help save our bullpen ill do what i can to help
2388983 the great gospel imperatives to holiness are ever rooted in indicatives of grace that are able to sustain the weight of those imperatives
2388984 give up their normal lives and attempt to live like christians for three weeks
2388985 yeah i tried that born again thing it didnt work
2388986 let no unwholesome words come out of your computer but only what is constructive in order to meet the need of the moment that what you communicate will give grace to everyone who ever reads it

2388989 all a mans ways seem innocent to him but motives are weighed by the lord
2388990 the first to present his case seems right till another comes forward and questions him
2388991 one seldom knows the full facts v 8 and ones motives in spreading a story are seldom as pure as one pretends v 10 to run to the law or to the neighbors is usually to run away from the duty of personal relationship
2388992 if your brother sins against you go and tell him his fault between you and him alone if he listens to you you have gained your brother
2388993 the reality is with the major effort were making for the iraqi parliament to take a two month vacation in the middle of summer is impossible to understand
2388994 perhaps much of our slow progress in the walk of faith is to be traced to our overlooking the love of the spirit

2388997 ive heard a lot of comments this week like hes wearing a lions jersey so theres no way he can win
2388998 hopefully that has nothing to do with it and i can be victorious with this on
2388999 i think i just try to get my game ready for these i just like tough conditions i think im a fairly straight driver and they get the fairways firm and fast so although im not an extremely long hitter im able to get the ball out there a pretty good distance even with these long holes
2389000 tee to green i was fine it was just all those three putts
2389001 he was a catcher who crouched low to the ground with one leg out and moved around a lot
2389002 he chattered and was always talking he was mr hustle and his uniform was always dirty you had to know tim some people didnt care for that chatter and others thought it was for fun he was a jokester nothing bothered him
2389003 i remember in batting practice before a game he was a human pitching machine hed throw one strike after another and you better be ready to hit because he never stopped there was no loafing when tim was playing ball if you came late to a game he made sure you didnt want to be late again
2389004 he treated me like a son i worked with him day in and day out for 13 years and never once did he call himself the owner he was more like a co worker and a friend
2389005 a lot of people never saw his sense of humor but i did we used to laugh daily
2389006 i know life sometimes can get tough and i know life sometimes can be a drag

2389065 mccains campaign has been making a clear play for women voters in recent weeks hosting conference calls with republican women and touting that his policies on national security the economy and healthcare appeal to women voters
2389066 but the suggestion that women and feminist women at that will be lining up behind him is a fairytale at least it should be mccains record and policies on issues of importance to women are neither moderate nor maverick
2389067 in the nation katha pollitt put it simply t o vote for mccain a feminist would have to be insane

2389124 some people dont know exactly what words to use or how to use them and the virtual prayer room will tell you pray for your governors pray for your pastor
2389125 to get people praying on the same page with the same vision in mind and the same goal in mind it helps to unify a church around what it is that theyre seeking god for
2389126 a lot of churches just see prayer as something they do when theres a problem or when someone has cancer or theres a crisis
2389127 i think that what we try to emphasize is that prayer really needs to be the foundation of what they do
2389128 you may see more people coming to christ you just may see more lives being touched within the services you actually may see an increase of giving you may see marriages restored or more visitors that are being drawn to the church but the presence of god will always bring results

2389368 everybody in the locker room were happy for brett that he gets to still play and were going to move forward together as a team
2389369 a sense of relief you could say it in a lot of ways im about press conferenced out number one thats something its a responsibility i understand but it was something that the situation needed to be resolved and it was nice to get to a finality of that
2389370 im relieved that were talking about football our football team and thats what the focus needs to be on
2389371 im just reassured of the fact that things happen for a reason just to trust god in every situation and try and remain patient and even keeled because theres going to be ups and downs in life as in football and the things you cant control are the things often you want to worry about the most
2389372 but its really useless to worry about those because theyre really out of your control this situation was a prime example of that
2389373 it started to bother me after my first at bat and just got worse as the night went on i dont know if i can play saturday we just have to see

2389379 you cannot bring in tanks like to budapest in 1956
2389380 theyve started a military operation using all kinds of heavy artillery and tanks
2389381 this is a very sad and worrying development to which of course well have to respond
2389382 the main risk factor is not technology but rather culture and change management
2389383 this guy has been tried hes been given the sentence hes been given and if the government tried to keep him past that 5 1 2 months his defense team which is very dedicated to him would be all over them and i dont think the administration wants to brook that kind of world reaction
2389384 they also got slapped down on the conspiracy charge so they had a double defeat here in some ways
2389385 charlie swift who has had this case for five years and mr hamdan embraced mr hamdan raised his arms and gave a victory signal the judge quite remarkably said i hope mr hamdan youre soon able to join your family in yemen and mr hamdan said inshallah god willing and the judge answered him inshallah it was an amazingly emotional scene

2389396 your shirt says univercity of boston faculty of science do i look stupid to you
2389397 when we reach the end of this line i am going to tell the security guards that you cut in

2389420 ive worked hard to build that respect and trust i appreciate the chinese leadership that have worked hard to build that respect and trust
2389421 it is a commitment to strengthen that foundation for years to come

2389429 im just lucky to be alive right now and if things like that can happen in the united states of america then i cant imagine whats happening in china and tibet right now
2389430 its planned as much as it can be but based on the situation in beijing its got to be left up to each day as it comes
2389431 theyre very well trained to spot trouble and make an end to the trouble and that is to tackle the person with a banner to quickly wrap him in some sort of way and push him into a van and hes gone
2389432 the greek anti doping body has requested that the greek athletics federation withdraw the athlete from the games

2389441 ive learned a lot become a better professional and a better man because of my experience and my time in new york i dont regret or feel ashamed about anything that happened to me in my time in new york
2389442 the most difficult part is just the realization that the organization no longer wants you
2389443 you spend eight years there and in the blink of an eye youre no longer wanted there
2389444 it makes me feel good i know im a good quarterback and i can play this game and can start and help a team win
2389445 i certainly dont want to compromise my position and the things that are going on
2389446 im glad to have a few teams interested and im excited about that
2389447 with all the speculation i always knew that this could be a possibility
2389448 emotionally i dont think i was totally prepared but at least mentally i was prepared and i knew i could handle the situation no matter what it would be
2389449 ive learned a lot become a better professional and a better man because of my experience and my time in new york i dont regret or feel ashamed about anything that happened to me in my time in new york
2389450 the most difficult part is just the realization that the organization no longer wants you
2389451 you spend eight years there and in the blink of an eye youre no longer wanted there
2389452 the olympics for china is a giant spectacle a game but for us its much more than that its a chance to call attention to what is happening in tibet
2389453 the chinese government can be lets say difficult maybe all this attention will push them to change
2389454 i dont think people are meant to be by themselves thats why if you actually find someone you care about its important to let go of the little things even if you cant let go all the way because nothing sucks more than feeling all alone no matter how many people are around

2389471 hai orang orang yang beriman bertakwalah kepada allah swt dengan sebenar benar takwa dan janganlah sekali kali kamu mati melainkan kamu berserah diri
2389472 hai sekalian manusia bertakwalah kepada rabb mu yang talah menciptakan kamu dari diri yang satu dan darinya allah swt menciptakan isterinya dan daripada keduanya allah swt memperkembangbiakan laki laki dan perempuan yang banyak dan bertakwalah kepada allah swt yang dengan mempergunakan nama nya kamu saling meminta satu sama lain dan peliharalah hubungan silaturrahim sesungguhnya allah swt selalu menjaga dan mengawasi kamu
2389473 hai orang orang yang beriman bertakwalah kamu kepada allah swt dan katakanlah perkataan yang benar niscaya allah swt memperbaiki bagimu amalan amalanmu dan mengampuni bagimu dosa dosamu dan barangsiapa mentaati allah swt dan rasul nya maka sesungguhnya ia telah mendapat kemenangan yang besar
2389474 maka datanglah sesudah mereka pengganti yang jelek yang menyia nyiakan shalat dan menuruti hawa nafsunya maka kelak mereka akan menemui kesesatan
2389475 celakalah orang yang shalat yaitu orang orang yang lalai dari shalatnya dan orang orang yang berbuat riya serta enggan menolong dengan barang yang berguna
2389476 apakah yang memasukkan kamu ke dalam neraka saqar mereka menjawab kami dahulu tidak termasuk orang orang yang mengerjakan shalat
2389477 perjanjian antara kita dan mereka adalah shalat barangsiapa yang meninggalkannya maka benar benar dia telah kafir
2389478 barangsiapa sengaja meninggalkan shalat maka dia telah terlepas diri dari tanggungan allah swt
2389479 jauhilah olehmu sekalian persangkaan karena persangkaan itu adalah perkataan yang paling dusta
2389480 hati hatilah kamu terhadap hadits dari aku kecuali yang benar benar kamu ketahui
2389481 shahih li dzatihi dan shahih li ghairihi serta hasan li dzatihi dan hasan li ghairihi 6 syeikh al albani berkata hadits ini lemah
2389482 barangsiapa sholatnya tidak dapat mencegahnya dari perbuatan keji dan munkar maka ia tidak menambah sesuatu pun dari allah swt kecuali kejauhan
2389483 barangsiapa shalatnya tidak menjadikannya mencegah dari perbuatan keji dan munkar maka tidak ada shalat baginya tidak mengerjakan shalat
2389484 dua rakaat dengan memakai sorban lebih baik dari tujuh puluh rakaat tanpa memakai sorban as suyuthi dalam kitab shaghir dengan perawi dailami dalam musnadnya al firdaus dengan sanad dari jabir r a abu naim dari jabir r a dalam sanadnya terdapat perawi bernama thariq bin abdur rahman yang oleh adz dzahabi telah ditempatkan dalam deretan dhuafa
2389485 ia ibnu safar tidak dapat diterima riwayatnya dan tidak boleh dijadikan hujjah
2389486 para nabi tidak dibiarkan begitu saja dalam kuburnya setelah empat puluh hari dari kematiannya tetapi mereka melakukan shalat di hadapan allah swt hingga ditiupnya sangkakala kelak
2389487 tidak ada yang lebih utama bagi seorang hamba yang ditinggalkannya bagi keluarganya ketika beranjak pergi safar daripada dua rakaat yang dilakukannya di rumah
2389488 dua rakaat yang dikerjakan orang yang telah berkeluarga telah menikah lebih utama daripada tujuh puluh rakaat yang dilakukan orang yang masih lajang
2389489 saya tidak mengenalnya ia juga tidak dikenal oleh muhadditsin dan berita yang dibawahnya batil
2389490 barangsiapa membeli baju seharga sepuluh dirham sedangkan di dalamnya terdapat satu dirham uang haram maka shalatnya tidak diterima selama mengenakan baju tersebut
2389491 apa gunanya shalatku bagi seorang yang ruhnya tergadai dalam kuburnya dan tidak diangkat ke langit untuk menghadap allah swt kalau ada di antara kalian ada yang menjamin utangnya maka aku akan menshalatinya karena sesungguhnya shalatku berguna baginya
2389492 dua hal tergantung di leher leher para muadzin bagi kaum muslimin yaitu shalat dan puasa mereka
2389493 sanad riwayat ini dhaif disebabkan adanya buqyah bin al walid yang dikenal oleh kalangan muhadditsin sebagai pen tadlis pencampur aduk riwayat perawi
2389494 sebagian dosa dosa ada dosa yang tidak dapat terampuni dengan amalan shalat atau puasa atau haji atau umrah
2389495 tidak ada yang meriwayatkan dari malik kecuali yahya kemudian hanya secara tunggal pula diriwayatkan darinya oleh muhammad bin salam al mashri
2389496 muhammad bin salam terbukti telah meriwayatkan hadits munkar dari yahya adapun ibnu asakir menyatakan bahwa riwayat ini
2389497 sesungguhnya sebagian dari dosa tidak dapat terampuni dengan puasa atau shalat atau haji atau jihad namun hanya dengan kesedhan kesusahan dan kepayahan dalam menuntut ilmu
2389498 apabila salah seorang dari kamu melepaskan sandalnya sepatunya ketika akan shalat maka janganlah ditempatkan di hadapannya sehingga menjadikannya imamnya dan jangan pula di belakangnya karena akan diimami oleh saudaranya sesama muslim
2389499 tidak ada diriwayatkan oleh abu bakrah kecuali dengan sanad ini
2389500 abu bakrah tidak berbobot maksudnya tidak dianggap oleh kalangan muhadditsin
2389501 dia termasuk deretan perawi sanad yang tidak dianggap oleh muhadditsin
2389502 tetapkanlah kedua terompahmu pada kakimu dan apabil kamu lepaskan maka letakkanlah di antara kedua kakimu dan janganlah kemu letakkan di kananmu dan jangan pula di sebelah kanan temanmu serta jangan pula di belakangmu karena akan mengganggu orang yang di belakangmu
2389503 shalat di masjidil haram pahalanya seperti menjalankan shalat seratus ribu kali dan shalat di masjidku sepuluh ribu kali sedangkan shalat di masjid tapal batas menghadapi musuh pahalanya seribu shalat
2389504 ia terbukti meriwayatkan dari abu iqal dari anas banyak sekali riwayat munkar dan palsu
2389505 terbukti telah meriwayatkan dari ibnu uyainah dan buqyah hadits hadits maudhu
2389506 telah memberitakan kepada kami al walid bin muslim dari zuhair bin muhammad dari abdullah bin muhammad bin aqli dari jabir r a
2389507 ia pernah tinggal di negeri syam kemudian di hejaz mekah periwayatan penduduk syam darinya tidaklah istiqamah karenanya menjadi dhaif disebbabkannya
2389508 seolah olah diriwayatkan dari zuhair oleh penduduk syam yang lain
2389509 telah diriwayatkan oleh ath thabrani dalam al ausath dan riwayat abdullah bin muhammad bin aqli dan ibnu khuzaimah dan ibnu hibban dalam sahih keduanya dari riwayat zuhair bin muhammad
2389510 hadits diriwayatkan oleh ath thabrani dalam al ausath nya dan dalam sanad terdapat muhammad bin aqil yang periwayatannya hasan namun memiliki kelemahan sedangkan perawi lainnya semuanya akurat
2389511 ia perawi benar dan periwayatannya dari ikrimah secara khusus banyak ketidakmantapannya dan telah berubah pada akhir hidupnya dan barangkali ia di jadi hadits ini adalah dhaif sanad dan matannya adapun redaksi yang sahih adalah dengan lafal
2389512 telah memberitakan kepada kami al hasan bin hammad al kufi telah memberitakan kepada kami abdullah bin muhammad al adawi ia berkata
2389513 telah memberitakan kepadaku ubadah bin ubadah bin abdullah dari thalhah bin abdullah secara marfu
2389514 hadits ini tidak terjaga dan al adawi tidak sahih periwayatan haditsnya
2389515 telah memberitahukan kepadaku abu an nashr al faqih dan muhammad bin al hasan asy syami keduanya berkata
2389516 sanad ini justru sangat gelap di dalamnya terdapat abdullah bin muhammad al adawi perawi tertuduh
2389517 wahai ali perumpamaan bagi orang yang tidak menyempurnakan shalatnya bagaikan wanita yang sedang hamil ketika telah dekat masa persalinannya gugurlah kandungannya menjadilah dia tidak sebagai ibu yang mempunyai anak dan tidak pula sebagai wanita hamil
2389518 musa bin ubaidah tidak dapat dijadikan landasan dan telah terbukti adanya ikhtilaf di dalam sanadnya zaid bin al habbab dan asbath bin muhammad meriwayatkan begitu sedangkan sulaiman bin bilal meriwayatkan dari musa bin ubaidah dari saleh bin suwaid dari ali dengan sanad yang
2389519 dan seterusnya seraya menututrkan sanadnya hingga sulaiman kemudian sanad tersebut disambungkan kepada nabi saw oleh ibnu syadzan di dalam kitab
2389520 riwayat ini ada syahidnya dari jalan lain yang menguatkan komentar kalau seandainya ada riwayat yang shahih maka kita dapat menggunakan riwayat tersebut itu menjadi dasar bukan dari hadits ini imam bukhari pernah meriwayatkan yang artinya telah bersabda rasulullah saw kalau seandainya aku tidak memberatkan ummatku tentu aku perintahkan mereka itu menggunakan siwak pada tiap kali mereka mau melakukan shalat
2389521 apabila kamu shalat angkatlah sing singkanlah pakaianmu yang di bawah mata kaki karena segala sesuatu dari pakaian yang di bawah mata kaki yang mengenai tanah akan berada di neraka
2389522 isa bin qirthas itu adalah salah seorang rafidhah ibnu hibban berkata lagi
2389523 saya mendengar rasulullah saw menyebut nyebut amalan pada suatu hari lalu beliau ersabda
2389524 telah memberitakan kepada kami al fadhl bin al aghar al kalabi dari ayahnya dari abdullah ibnu masud r
2389525 ia telah meriwayatkan dari al aghar al kalabi dan muslim bin ibrahim telah meriwayatkan darinya
2389526 hadits gharib kami tidak mengetahuinya kecuali dari jalan ini sedangkan bakar bin khunais ini dibicarakan oleh ibnul mubarak dan ditinggalkan periwayatan0nya ketika sudah lanjut usianya dan hadits ini juga diriwayatkan dari zaid bin arthat dari jubair bin nafir dari nabi saw
2389527 sesungguhnya kamu tidak akan kembali kepada allah dengan sesuatu yang lebih utama
2389528 diriwayatkan oleh ath thabrani dalam al kabir dan di dalam isnad nya terdapat laits bin abi sulaim sedangkan dia itu dibicarakan oleh para ahli hadits
2389529 sholat adalah tiang agama barang siapa yang meninggalkan shalat maka sesungguhnya dia telah merobohkan agama
2389530 adiy dari aisyah tetapi hanya melalui jalan buzai bin hasan abu al khalil rawi ini adalah seorang yang
2389531 satu shalat dengan menggunakan cincin itu ganjarannya sama dengan 70 kali shalat dengan tidak menggunakan cincin
2389532 seorang shahabat bertanya kepada rasulullah saw yaa rasulullah saw sesungguhnya aku telah tinggalkan shalat rasulullah saw menjawab hendaklah engkau mengqadla menggantikan shalat yang telah engkau tinggalkan itu shahabat itu bertanya bagaimana cara aku mengqadla rasulullah saw menjawab hendaklah engkau lakukan bersama shalat yang serupa pada tiap tiap kali engkau shalat shabat itu bertanya sebelum atau sesudahnya rasulullah saw menjawab tidak akan tetapi sebelumnya rawi yang tertuduh dalam sanad ini ialah abdan az zaahid periksa keterangan ini dalam kitab al fawaa idul majmuuah halaman 16 hadits no 6 bab kitabus salah periksa juga kitab al laaly juz ii halaman 13
2389533 barang siapa yang membantu orang yang meninggalkan shalat walaupun hanya sesuap sedikit maka seolah olah dia telah membunuh memerangi semua nabi
2389534 dari ummi salamah dia berkata adalah nabi saw apabila beliau sedang shalat orang yang melihatnya beranggapan bahwa sesungguhnya beliau hanya sebuah jasad yang tidak ada ruhnya
2389535 apabila telah tiba waktu makan malam asya dan telah masuk waktu shalat isya maka dahulukanlah

2389578 t his interview will open many peoples eyes it will shake islam from the roots and im not exaggerating
2389579 what other case do you know where a son of a hamas leader who was raised on the tenets of extremist islam comes out against it
2389580 a verse like love thine enemy had a great influence on me
2389581 at this stage i was still a muslim and i thought that i would remain one but every day i saw the terrible things done in the name of religion by those who considered themselves great believers
2389582 i studied islam more thoroughly and found no answers there i re examined the koran and the principals of the faith and found how it is mistaken and misleading
2389583 the people who supposedly represent the religion admired mohammed more than god killed innocent people in the name of islam beat their wives and dont have any idea what god is
2389584 i have no doubt that theyll go to hell i have a message for them there is only one way to paradise the way of jesus who sacrificed himself on the cross for all of us
2389585 i felt responsible it was better for me to be there rather than a gang of fools who would poison his mind
2389586 i tried to understand those people their thoughts in order to change them from inside by means of a strong person like my father who admitted to me in the past that he does not support suicide attacks
2389587 nobody knows them and how they operate as well as i do
2389588 then in prison i understood that not everyone in hamas is like my father hes a nice friendly man but i discovered how evil his colleagues are
2389589 after my release i lost the faith i had in those who ostensibly represented islam
2389590 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas
2389591 islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death
2389592 in palestinian culture a suicide terrorist becomes a hero a martyr
2389593 they hamas are blind and ignorant its true there are good and bad people everywhere but hamas supporters dont understand that they are led by a wicked and cruel group that brainwashes the children and gets them to believe that if they carry out a suicide attack theyll get to paradise
2389594 take them out of the darkness and the prison of islam
2389595 in that way theyll have an opportunity to correct their mistakes to become better people and to bring a chance for peace in the middle east
2389596 but at the moment at least my ambitions are only to find work a place to live
2389597 i was about to become one of those homeless people in the united states
2389598 but people from the church are helping me im dependent on them
2389599 i know that im endangering my life and am even liable to lose my father but i hope that hell understand this and that god will give him and my family patience and willingness to open their eyes to jesus and to christianity
2389600 maybe one day ill be able to return to palestine and to ramallah with jesus in the kingdom of god
2389601 its not that often we play a gig this good
2389602 because he was the county supervisor for the district where the property is when the complaints were made
2389603 he doesnt know if he had any contact with it
2389604 i couldnt afford a bed for awhile so i slept on the floor in the room i had
2389605 so it was me the dog and the sleeping bag for about a month and a half
2389606 he understands that if i need to do this then im going to do it theres no reservations
2389607 its a title fight but its not just a title fight its against one of the best in the weight and in the world across weights
2389608 nice music leonard i really enjoyed it but tell me dont you get tired of playing baby tunes
2389609 an amazing addition to our staff her r sum is simply put mind blowing
2389610 however what i really liked is in the past year hes made a concerted effort to be a better rebounder and use his size inside to take advantage of matchups
2389611 he was always a shooter but hes made an effort to drive to the basket to attack the rim
2389612 i think that was a good move on his part
2389613 coach barnes said he needed a bigger version of a j
2389614 i think he just does it to make sure we know whats going on
2389615 im pretty sure he always knows exactly whats going on on the field
2389616 the first thing that jumps out at you is the team speed
2389617 the maturity level is always the no 1 concern when youve got a lot of young guys
2389618 how are they going to react under pressure how are they going to act in a tough situation how are they going to react when a negative play happens how are they going to act when a positive play happens can you move onto the next thing
2389619 in 04 i hated every minute of it i didnt enjoy it
2389620 it will rip my heart out when i have to sit there and watch that race the 200 here on the sidelines
2389621 i have been aiming for a result in the 58 seconds i want to show a battle at a high level
2389622 i left athens with a little bit of a chip on my shoulder
2389623 he has his coaches come to my pool and kind of watch how i train
2389624 but i could care less about how he trains i know what it takes for me to swim fast and i know what it takes for me to win the gold medal
2389625 i win that race by a body length it was just a really bad day at the office and a really important day at the office like i said before im past it im over it ive got a really good thing going on here and ive having the time of my life
2389626 if anyone can make a mistake its him because everybody is watching him if he makes a mistake slip right on by him like you did me
2389627 chris has been here forever and he knows it about as good as anybody hes tremendous in the blitz pickup game and has great hands
2389628 vondrell is a little more of a downhill runner hes a move the pile kind of guy
2389629 fozzy has unbelievable lateral quickness he would remind our fans somewhat of hodges mitchell where he has the ability to jump lateral and then pick speed up really quickly
2389630 in this time in college you need more than one running back mcgee said
2389631 all three of the guys bring a different aspect to the game individually and when you put all of that together it makes us a dangerous group collectively ogbonnaya said
2389632 we feed off one another and it makes us better

2389674 turn left at the kermit the frog then go right at the gumby
2389675 rookies are fine and dandy and im glad to see them progressing but i dont fall in love with rookies
2389676 it aint the best there were some missed tackles there were some third down conversions there was some rushing yardage there was getting pushed around there were some snaps where we had people dogtrotting we did some things we werent very proud of
2389677 we were glad to win the ballgame but by no stretch of the imagination was that a work of art their backups just played a little bit worse than our backups
2389678 we will get to see guys under the big lights
2389679 we will get to see guys we havent seen at this level in an nfl exhibition game its probably as fast as any game they will ever play so we get to see the young guys in that situation

2389681 putting on a game jersey and getting back into the flow of things seeing a lot of different coverages a lot of things that we havent seen yet so far in camp and a lot of different looks that we have to get used to in the regular season
2389682 weve got some stuff we want to take the next step toward
2389683 were not going to reinvent the offense in a week but we are going to take some steps
2389684 theyre being bombarded like they are in the west to eat all the wrong foods the western worlds food industries without even realizing it have precipitated an epidemic with enormous health consequences
2389685 and in the dawn armed with a burning patience we shall enter the splendid cities

2389701 well come together and discuss our ideas and im sure there will be a little bit of juggling but the advantage of these four days is everybody gets all the reps
2389702 he is a guy who last year was slated as a starter and started a few games before his shoulder injury took him out of the lineup and he had to sit out
2389703 he is a little behind the eight ball because he missed so much time and wasnt able to practice all spring but i think he gets the message right now that he is working with the second unit and he has to work his way up to that first unit
2389704 ideally hell come on and start dominating people like he can and get back into the starting lineup
2389705 i dont think any of them had one of their better days
2389706 weve got a big change coming halfway through this weekend ben

2389724 la tutela se convirti en el ngel de la guarda de los colombianos es la herramienta fundamental y m s r pida para que los colombianos hagan valer sus derechos es necesario reflexionar sobre modificar la administraci n p blica las superintendencias y la responsabilidad social de las empresas privadas al momento de prestar los servicios antes que pensar en cambiar o reformar la acci n de tutela el problema no est en modificar jur dicamente la tutela sino tratar de combatir las causas que originan tanto acceso tanta demanda

2389732 the other half is related to other harms that happen to people when drinking primarily drunk driving drunk driving crashes pedestrian injuries violent assaults and various criminal behaviors and various injuries
2389733 its not a pretty picture its quite ugly from the public health point of view its a much bigger problem than crime related to illegal drugs
2389734 lucky that were sane after all weve been through we cant complain but sometimes we still do lifes been good to us so far
2389735 ee times has traditionally been a news oriented publication but news because of its very nature is best served up online there is an important category of information however that is not as well suited to online and that is the thought piece the extended essay content that most readers prefer to consume offline
2389736 while crichton paints scientists full of hubris causing death and destruction threatening our entire way of life he himself is setting back the public perception of not only individual branches of science but of science itself and he has the gall to think he understands the science better than the scientists doing the work at least in the case of global warming he lectured to packed crowds and advised politicians about his skewed and incorrect views all the while claiming the working climatologists doing the work had the skewed and incorrect views

2389746 lord have mercy on my son for he is a lunatic and is very ill for he often falls into the fire and often into the water i brought him to your disciples but they could not cure him
2389747 o faithless and perverse generation how long shall i be with you how long shall i put up with you bring him here to me
2389748 because of your little faith for truly i say to you if you have faith the size of a mustard seed you will say to this mountain move from here to there and it will move and nothing will be impossible to you

2389751 there was a struggle and he ran off making his escape by plunging into the icy water
2389752 he swam a fair way out he was 250m out to sea at one point and he was out there for a long time

2389759 russian armoured vehicles have entered the northern suburbs of tskhinvali
2389760 what russia is doing in georgia is open unhidden aggression and a challenge to the whole world
2389761 if the whole world does not stop russia today then russian tanks will be able to reach any other european capital
2389762 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil

2389782 no falta qui n afirme que su iglesia parroquial dedicada a s antonio abad es el templo que en forma de casa fuerte edificaron los templarios a cuya orden militar dicen que por tradici n consta haber pertenecido esta villa nada hay que justifique al presente esta aseveraci n pues aunque la iglesia parroquial es reputada obra del siglo xiii habi ndose hundido en el terremoto de 1 755 ha sido completamente reformada y no se conserva rasgos ostensibles que permitan el supuesto
2389783 ignor ndose hasta hoy la fecha de su construcci n
2389784 la iglesia que sirve de parroquia en la villa de trigueros es un castillo y plaza fuerte con todos los pertrechos necesarios dentro y fuera para hacerse fuertes y defenderse de los enemigos porque sus muros son muy gruesos y tienen por la parte de afuera almenas y por dentro sus troneras y andenes para desde ellos ofender y defenderse
2389785 la orden militar de santa mar a de espa a y la iglesia parroquial de trigueros

2389787 es muy notable que en toda la historia castellana no haya memoria de una tan grande operaci n del rey como el establecimiento y dotaci n de una orden militar que como dice en estos privilegios establecimos a servicio de dios y a loor de la virgen santa mar a su madre

2389789 decimos parte del monasterio porque dada la vida ef mera de la orden a la par que las vicisitudes y cambios constantes de dominio caracter sticos de aquellos tiempos es lo m s probable que de la traza total del monasterio s lo se construyera y rematara extinguida tal vez la orden de santa mar a nuestra iglesia con toda la solidez rudeza y aguerrido aspecto que conserv hasta la segunda mitad del siglo xviii en que fu destruida por el terremoto
2389790 we did it at the hands of sheriffs deputies who burst through our front door rifles blazing
2389791 it was concluded that ms tomsic and the calvo family were innocent victims of drug traffickers
2389792 i called him to express my sorrow and regret for that and for the loss of the familys beloved dogs
2389793 the door flew open i heard gunfire shoot off there was a brief pause and more gunfire
2389794 i noticed my two dead dogs lying in pools of their own blood
2389795 it was that lack of communication that really led to what has really been the most traumatic experience of our lives
2389796 theyve arrested the real criminals involved were pleased to have that and get our name back as well but really this doesnt excuse what they did
2389797 the little man is healthy happy and as loud as his daddy
2389798 he wanted to live in the big country and maybe get famous now that i see all this hes really famous
2389799 there is a pending investigation to determine who this guy is
2389800 i recall him thinking hes better than the rest of us

2389818 its really important to the guys in the shop the guys on the team that put so much effort into it
2389819 i think a lot of them were nervous they werent sure what was going on because there were so many rumors flying around and there was always something being said about dei and about their future not being good and not being bright and this and that
2389820 at the end of the day those guys have to go home to their families and think about that stuff as bad as it might sound it feels good for them the guys are really pumped up in the shop we had a big meeting at the shop and i told them all and there was a big cheer everybody was happy and that made me feel good they put a lot into it and im glad to see that they were happy about it

2389823 so he is a very important part of our team hes a huge leader with all four of our drivers were really excited about him being there its amazing how granular martin gets with the details of what we need to do to accelerate our program to the next level

2389826 it wasnt so much the two companies blending i think as it was we brought in some new technology weve got some new things and we still havent figured out exactly how to apply them to when we show up on friday and into the race car
2389827 i think now that this is over we can look at bringing in some more people and bringing in some new people that can help keep things organized help us try to relate that information from the shop to the racetrack a little bit better and make some gains there
2389828 i was happy for martin and dei because he can see next year what the landscapes like
2389829 he remains the premier driver for that whole company i think martin made the right decision to wait it out for another year

2389859 and if you elect to stay i expect you to be rowing all in the same direction if you elect to stay i expect you to avoid documenting your immaturity on listservs
