1050301 should posterity inquire why their ancestors destitute of military education or experience abandoned their peaceful abodes to encounter the perils of uncertain warfare let them be told it was not to execute the mandates of a tyrant in subjugating their fellow men but it was in defence of our most precious rights and privileges it was a display of that genuine patriotism and true glory which it is ever most honourable to venerate and cherish while their own hearts glow with patriotic fervor let them reflect that true glory consists in the love of peace and the culture of benevolence and good will to men let their souls hold in detestation every species of warfare save that which may secure and defend the invaluable heritage which their fathers have bequeathed them and for which their memories should be embalmed with the incense of gratitude

1050305 hinton also contends that the district court usurped the jurys role by instructing the jury that a knife is a deadly weapon as a matter of law because hinton failed to object to the courts deadly weapon instruction at trial we review the instruction for plain error
1050306 at trial the district court instructed the jury that a knife is a deadly weapon
1050307 t he instruction erroneously informs the jury that a knife is a deadly weapon as a matter of law and thereby relieves the jury of its fact finding function diminishes the states burden of proof and violates hintons right to due process
1050308 we conclude that the district courts deadly weapon instruction erroneously removed from the jurys consideration the factual issue of whether the knife constituted a deadly weapon a necessary element of the burglary offense and a required factual finding for the deadly weapon enhancements to the robbery and sexual assault charges we further conclude that this error was plain and that it affected hintons substantial rights accordingly the burglary conviction and deadly weapon enhancements must be reversed
1050309 garrett next asserts that the district court erred in instructing the jury that a knife is a deadly weapon for the purposes of the deadly weapon enhancement rather than allowing the jury to make their own determination we disagree
1050310 generally it is the district courts duty to determine whether the instrument is an inherently dangerous weapon it is only in a few close cases where the court cannot determine as a matter of law whether the weapon is or is not a deadly weapon that the issue is appropriately submitted to the jury
1050311 w e discern no error in the district courts jury instruction that a knife is a deadly weapon as a matter of law

1050324 the state charged appellant emmanuel hernandez with first degree murder with the use of a deadly weapon for shooting and killing jose gonzalez in front of the palm hills apartments in las vegas at the states request the district court admitted at trial the preliminary hearing testimony of a witness who did not arrive to testify as scheduled in this appeal we address the burden placed on the proponent of an absent witnesss preliminary hearing testimony to show that reasonable diligence was used to acquire the presence of the witness in general before preliminary hearing testimony may be entered into evidence in a criminal trial the proponent must demonstrate that the witness is absent despite the proponents reasonable efforts to procure the witnesss attendance we conclude first that if a motion to admit preliminary hearing testimony is untimely the proponent of the testimony must support the motion with an affidavit or sworn testimony demonstrating good cause for the untimely motion good cause to allow an untimely motion exists only when the proponent has exercised reasonable diligence to procure the attendance of the witness before the expiration of the motion deadline we conclude second that in this case although the state may have exercised reasonable diligence before the expiration of the motion deadline it did not demonstrate that it exercised reasonable diligence to secure the presence of the witness when it became aware of her absence after the expiration of the deadline and therefore the district court erred when it granted the states motion to admit the witnesss preliminary hearing testimony

1050420 keeping pesticides out of the river also keeps pesticides out of drinking water and out of our bodies
1050421 were extremely pleased with the settlement but it is only the first step
1050422 well continue to keep a close eye on this process to make sure that salmon and steelhead are protected from these dangerous poisons
1050423 what the hell will i do with this piece of software
1050424 its pretty fun playing with this software n even without knowing much you could actually make sum music
1050425 in the longer run the meter at your back door could become a nerve center for converting your residence into a
1050426 reminiscent of benito mussolinis edict of the 1920s which banned groups of five or more people
1050427 gatherings in a bid to protect public decorum and prevent damage to public parks and gardens
1050428 there is no emergency situation in novara there is no need for such a fascist edict there are other better ways to tackle the citys problems
1050429 this is needed to limit public disturbance the citizens of novara asked for it i understand opposition left councillors plan to gather and protest in groups of more than three we will not fine them this time
1050430 one thing i will say though is that to compare the ordinance with fascism is absurd we are trying to solve issues but are being accused of fascism
1050431 i really dont see the need for troops on streets it will have a completely negative effect
1050432 i have already had people calling me after reading reports of troops on streets in italy and asking me is there some sort of civil war going on
1050433 its an image boosting operation that risks turning into a boomerang
1050434 it will make italy look like a country in the grip of an uncontrolled security emergency
1050435 paratroopers guarding the centres of the major tourist cities arent exactly a great calling card for a country at the height of the tourist season
1050436 we will have one soldier for every 10 municipalities doing nothing except going to the bar with a policeman its a joke and to cap it all its only a provisional measure
1050437 here lies a man who lived life for all that its worth
1050438 just playing me a cd see if i like music or not now ive heard this im thinking there must have been something else going on now im thinking why did they play that same cd to me as well theyre playing this cd in iraq and theyre playing the same cd in cuba it means to me there is a programme theyre not playing music because they think people like or dislike matchbox twenty more than other music or kris kristofferson more than other music there is a reason theres something else going on obviously i dont know what it is but there must be some other intent
1050439 you dont know how deep the rabbit hole goes do you but you know it is deep you know it is deep
1050440 you mean they did it just because it seemed so weird
1050441 i can imagine that might work on a devout muslim from an arab country but jamal is british he was raised in manchester he knows all about ghetto blasters and fleetwood mac and country and western music
1050442 on a surface level that would be ridiculous but guant namo and abu ghraib were anything but surface
1050443 most interesting but i havent a clue i know that subliminal messages can be incorporated and that they have a powerful influence there are laws prohibiting it in the us but im not aware of any uses like you describe i would imagine however that it would be classified and no one without a need to know would be aware anyway if it were frequencies it would probably need to be in the audible range or they wouldnt need to mask them with other sounds
1050444 you can bet this activity was purposeful if you can get anybody to talk to you about this it would be interesting to know the success rate of this technique
1050445 strikes me the story you tell is just plain kindness which still exists
1050446 is there anything you can tell me about the use of subliminal sounds and frequencies in the militarys arsenal if anyone alive today is equipped to answer that question surely you are
1050447 i dont know much about this subject but im sure ive seen your name linked with something called a psycho correction device
1050448 how would you do that blast someone with silent sounds without it affecting us anybody whos out there would hear it
1050449 very low frequency sound which can travel long distances and easily penetrate most buildings and vehicles biophysical effects nausea loss of bowels disorientation vomiting potential internal organ damage or death may occur
1050450 involves influencing subjects visually or aurally with embedded subliminal messages
1050451 these people are despairing because they are being held lawlessly
1050452 theres no end in sight theyre not being brought before any independent judges theyre not being charged and convicted for any crime
1050453 theyre in a worse situation than convicted criminals and its an act of desperation
1050454 they have no regard for life either ours or their own i believe this was not an act of desperation but an act of asymmetrical warfare waged against us
1050455 if its perfectly legal and theres nothing going wrong there well why dont they have it in america and then the american court system can supervise it
1050456 now shes wearing just one necklace with a cross on it to remind you she is madonna
1050457 i reckon we probably need to bring another player in so we are still looking to add to our squad
1050458 yes i think about it and im scared very scared about it
1050459 if they cant get this done in one week well take it to another level the state troopers and perhaps the national guard here
1050460 its very dangerous nobody wants to be chased harassed or raped or anything around here
1050461 every officer in queens south this is discussed every day at roll call
1050462 we visit showrooms not open to the public not accessible to anyone but people on our tours
1050463 we buy clothes and or accessories at or below wholesale or below and sometimes its so far below its almost stealing
1050464 we are not open to the public we are only open to pams group pam is the only person we let up here as a personal shopper

1050467 negative emotions and tensions between the new eu immigrants and local communities
1050468 the complaint is to be resolved the paper has amended some online articles and removed others
1050469 the newspaper wishes to make clear that it wasnt in any way anti polish
1050470 we are pleased that the daily mail could see that some of the wording they had in their headlines was harmful and they have taken far more care
1050471 if you take the balance of articles published by us the polish migrant has not been identified as a hate figure and we have often and continuously drawn attention to the benefits britain has and does derive from the skills that immigrants bring us
1050472 we ran an in depth series the new britons by fiona barton which had a very balanced and fair assessment of the virtues of polish immigrants
1050473 the headline on a major feature by one of our top writers read poles apart hard working reliable honest meet the polish builders plumbers and decorators putting work shy britons to shame
1050474 the organization wasnt able to give anything back because of a lack of funding and a lack of manpower
1050475 it used to be more active in past years but that kind of went by the wayside
1050476 the purpose behind the merger of our two organizations is simple to give you the best value best representation strongest voice and most exposure for your investment
1050477 now shes wearing just one necklace with a cross on it to remind you she is madonna
1050478 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle
1050479 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1050480 i explained i was with the state press but the secret service man said that didnt matter and that i would have to go
1050481 i would first express regret that your reporter was moved and i can tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt that race had nothing to do with it
1050482 were deeply concerned and disturbed that our reporter of all of those in that area was asked to move
1050483 my understanding is that stephen was the only reporter approached and asked to leave the area and the only reporter in that area who is black another reporter who stood up for stephen was then asked to leave

1050495 why do you think im wearing a hat and jacket inside
1050496 blaine i wish i had the budget to buy some tanned leather like your skin at mood
1050497 i told oj that gloves just did not work with his overall style
1050498 im hot because im fly and use self tanner you aint because you think were in the 40s and were not
1050499 i wonder if i stare at him long enough can i make him disappear
1050500 yes these are actual patterns from christian sirianos collection ive got more in the case
1050501 wow i think hes even getting a tan from his shirt
1050502 do you think i look good in my hot pink shirt or not maybe lime green looks better on me what do you think
1050503 my camera flash was broken but my pictures still turned out great because my sweatshirt was so bright
1050504 you think using a picture of heidi as inspiration will score you points
1050505 kenley how did these pictures of pleasantville get in here
1050506 psst a little hint your designs will continue to struggle so long as your personal appearance requires eye protection
1050507 say licious one more time and i will beat you
1050508 i hope i can make my design stand out on the runway
1050509 if bubble yum had a tan flavor it would be call blayne i licious
1050510 he makes fun of stella but in about 10 years shes going to be making pants out of him
1050511 his face reminds me of a tan leather purse i once had it was my favorite i still cant believe i lost that thing
1050512 i think his face just got tanner all on its own
1050513 do you think tim would notice if i switched the lightbulbs in here with uv bulbs this competition leaves no time for tanning
1050514 how many bottles of pepto bismol died to make that sweatshirt blayne
1050515 i wonder if blayne was an extra in the dark crystal
1050516 shouldnt you at least get a blindingly bright sweatshirt that fits
1050517 no cause it might mess with my mad orange throwing skills
1050518 im looking at this picture of a prada bag do you think if i keep tanning i can become one by the time the fall season comes in
1050519 i didnt know a kitten heeled peep toe could be used like that
1050520 i wonder if i look really close i can see where his skin ends and tan starts
1050521 do you think this shirt is girlicious enough for the runway show today
1050522 i think it would look better if you had some matching pants
1050523 would you guys just shut the hell up and get to your dress
1050524 blayne take your luscious tan and go lay down by your dish i dont recall giving you permission to talk to me
1050525 hey daniel see that shirt blayne is wearing i had it when i was in the 5th grade
1050526 hmm i wonder which picture would look better with my tan
1050527 you and daniel are like day and night sun and moon tan and never seen the light of day
1050528 no blayne i cant help you pick a photo im too distracted by your tan
1050529 uhh i have a naked tim gun in this shot
1050530 holla at ya boy is the whitest thing i have ever heard you say
1050531 now shes wearing just one necklace with a cross on it to remind you she is madonna
1050532 there are so many worries over the economy oil prices the banking industry yes theres a lot of concern
1050533 theres very little being done by those people less gift giving less parties
1050534 you know why greed people are more greedy they dont give instead of corporate gifts they do the opposite squeeze more and more from people while giving less and less
1050535 wall street is the source of the problem you see across the country it rose out of the financial sector which spread into the housing sector
1050536 the thing to keep in mind is that wall street is extraordinarily resilient it will come back the only question is when there will be extraordinary opportunities for some
1050537 but this is an opportunity for the talented to get ahead the less talented will be weeded out
1050538 is pretty mysterious for those who do not work there
1050539 the gchq i first knew was very much a cold war organisation
1050540 we were very hierarchical with a rather rigid structure and limited internal communications this is not a criticism the work we did during that period was excellent and our response to crises such as the falklands war could be first class
1050541 but by the 1990s it became clear that a different approach was needed for a very different world with volatile and global threats and the arrival of the internet
1050542 the cold war focus was on the soviet union now our biggest area of work by far is our contribution to counter terrorism
1050543 and support to deployed british forces has become a major activity
1050544 being summoned to robin cooks office the day after the 1997 election to be given instructions to negotiate the return of the national trade unions to gchq

1050550 ive not had one ounce of trouble from anybody they are an honest group of footballers working hard
1050551 they can have as big as a season as they want im the front man but they have to go out perform and believe in what they are doing
1050552 flagrant violation of article 19 1 right to life guaranteed as a fundamental right by the constitution

1050558 scarlett had come to india with her mother who left the minor girl in the company of one julio with the intention that he would take care of the girl while fiona herself was holidaying in karnataka
1050559 saxena was amar singhs pa whenever i called up singhs residence saxena came on line i used to request saxena to allow me to speak to singh how can he then become my employee
1050560 saxena was amar singhs pa whenever i called up singhs residence saxena came on line i used to request saxena to allow me to speak to singh how can he then become my employee
1050561 i am confused as to who sanjeev saxena is is it the man whom i used to meet at amar singhs house or is it the man who is seen on the cd
1050562 singh had requested me to give the house to him soon after i became rajya sabha mp representing sp since then i never went there everybody knows that it was amar singhs office
1050563 during the press conference singh said that saxena was my employee but later on added that saxena resigned on july 20 and went with siddiqui when he switched over to bsp before the july 22 vote the contradiction is evident in his statements
1050564 may be they think i am too powerful or influential it could also be a conspiracy to malign the muslim community or it could be that amar singh wants to take revenge and shift the attention away from himself
1050565 as the attack on our embassy in kabul on july 7 has tragically shown terrorism has no barriers and is not bound by any restraints it was an attack on the friendship between india and afghanistan
1050566 we have agreed that we will not allow terrorism to stand in our way we will fight it unitedly and with full determination we will fulfil all our commitments to afghanistan
1050567 the attack on the indian embassy in kabul was an attack on the friendship between india and afghanistan president hamid karzais presence today conveys a befitting response to that attack
1050568 determination to fight terrorism unitedly and with all the forces at their command
1050569 india has proved to be a valuable ally and is in the forefront of rebuilding afghanistan
1050570 brought the peoples of the two countries closer and is a tribute to the precious indian and afghan lives that were lost in making this project a reality
1050571 together india and afghanistan are facing the challenges of terrorism of cold blooded brutal murderous activity in our two countries
1050572 because chelators bind indescriminately to metal ions they can deplete the body of essential metals such as copper zinc selenium and calcium in portersville pa in 2005 a 5 year old boy with autism died from cardiac arrest after being injected with a chelation agent
1050573 no justification for giving children dmsa in the absence of very high levels of heavy metal exposure
1050574 carries more than minimal risk and offers no demonstrable benefit to the participants
1050575 it is absolutely true that each month sees the release of some beautiful cds
1050576 just a few years ago robyn ludwick needed open mic nights to gain confidence in her songwriting and performing there were no traces of that early tentativeness in her 2005 debut for so long and now too much desire confirms any lingering hesitations disappeared long ago ludwicks vocal talents and songwriting prowess shine on too much desire a 12 song collection of songs about desperate love i knew i liked for so long from the first listen but i didnt recognize its greatness until months later when i heard it played over the sound system during an intermission at the cactus cafe too much desire has the same potential i really like it and i think theres a good chance that someday soon i may truly love it
1050577 this band is easily one of the best kept country pop secrets in the united states
1050578 i find it impossible to listen to it without smiling at the sheer exuberance of these tracks
1050579 how weird are they that stupid they cannot see that these brave men and women love this great country so much that they are willing to leave their families behind and go fight a war knowing they might not come back

1050582 the youth segment of the market is the future of the sport and our business
1050583 making season passes affordable is a key step in our efforts to attract and retain the youth market by allowing them to visit frequently and develop deep and meaningful relationships with the mountain
1050584 at a time when the cost of everything from gas to groceries is on the rise we have been listening to our local customers and are doing everything we can to make mt bachelor as affordable as possible
1050585 mt bachelor offers one of the longest seasons in the country and we hope central oregonians will recognize the value that comes with the purchase of a mt bachelor season pass
1050586 take 2 ebenfalls n schrottiges spiel zu einem seiner d mmlichen filmchen ver ffentlicht hat ne rolle spielt
1050587 i mean we only offered the 20 mil do to favre so he would stay the hell out of aarons way but i guess when aaron heard about it he thought that sounded like a good deal to his credit he did say he was willing to accept as little as 15 million to not play you know given his comparative lack of experience
1050588 listen i understand the way this whole favre thing has gone down definitely and i dont really hold it against the organization you know
1050589 but at the same time weve got one guy whos made a career of playing every damn game and getting the job done and another guy whos used to standing around and getting paid millions of dollars to not play right so it seems to me that paying the stand around guy to play and the playing guy to stand around was kindof a weird plan in the first place
1050590 to be honest that makes a whole lot of sense to me im a little surprised nobody thought of it earlier
1050591 actually though i would think a rodge could ask for even more than the 20 million they offered me to not play money to not play football and hes been doing it professionally for years now this could be his moment to cash in on all that experience
1050592 a few audience questions centered on the vibration issues associated with the constellation launch
1050593 griffin did point out that contrary to press reports the bush administration has not interfered with political appointments on staffing
1050594 the thing this team has excelled at is building for the present as well as the future

1050598 if theres one thing this organization knows its how to handle young pitchers
1050599 the ballpark that has been proposed on the north side of the city will never work
1050600 first i have heard from very good sources they are considering selling the naming rights to a chewing gum company which is absurd and ludicrous
1050601 also the team is talking about growing ivy on the outfield walls are these guys on opium or what i know for a fact that at least two of the cubs outfielders are allergic to ivy i just hope these fat cats are willing to have that blood on their hands
1050602 im just so happy right now i wouldnt care if we didnt win another championship for a century
1050603 of course im not speaking literally id fucking kill myself if we went that long without a title seriously

1050863 there are so many worries over the economy oil prices the banking industry yes theres a lot of concern
1050864 theres very little being done by those people less gift giving less parties
1050865 you know why greed people are more greedy they dont give instead of corporate gifts they do the opposite squeeze more and more from people while giving less and less
1050866 wall street is the source of the problem you see across the country it rose out of the financial sector which spread into the housing sector
1050867 the thing to keep in mind is that wall street is extraordinarily resilient it will come back the only question is when there will be extraordinary opportunities for some
1050868 i am equally confident that the games will leave a great legacy for china
1050869 china is a nation in transition with a great future tremendous potential and some challenges i believe history will view the 2008 olympics as a significant milestone in chinas remarkable transformation
1050870 some of the changes are easy to see the birds nest the main stadium and the water cube the swimming complex are already architectural landmarks
1050871 long after the games end these and other olympic venues will encourage the youth of china to participate in sport spectators will be inspired to become athletes and athletes will be inspired to achieve their best in world class venues
1050872 the venues are just a small part of the construction legacy that will benefit china after the games
1050873 new airport terminals new roads and highways new parks and a host of other projects that were initiated or accelerated because of the games will improve the quality of life and contribute to chinas
1050874 many of the infrastructure investments and other steps taken as a result of the olympics will help china deal with environmental challenges
1050875 chinas role as our olympic host has opened a window to the worlds most populous nation
1050876 we have already seen the courage and determination of the chinese people in another context
1050877 the world mourned the staggering loss of life from the earthquake in sichuan province and marveled at the courageous response by the chinese people
1050878 starting this weekend and over the next 16 days the world will have another reason to come together to share common emotions
1050879 all of us in the olympic family hope that the beijing games will help the healing process in china and deepen the worlds knowledge of this remarkable country
1050880 i said at the outset that i believe these games will be historic
1050881 they are already a landmark event for the olympic movement
1050882 the mere fact that the olympic games are coming to china home to nearly 20 percent of the worlds population is significant
1050883 a billion television viewers are expected to watch live coverage of the opening ceremony on friday
1050884 the beijing games will significantly advance our goals of universality and fair play in several ways
1050885 we will see a record number of participating national teams 205 and a record number of women athletes about 45 percent of all the competitors
1050886 an unprecedented effort against doping with more stringent testing then ever before and new steps to combat irregular betting including closer co operation with law enforcement
1050887 the changes that are occurring in china are a microcosm of the changes in the rest of the world

1050890 please dont be all over him like that anymore wait until im over him and ill let you know for sure when i am please for now can you just talk with him and not touch him
1050891 many people are hung up on this issue we think if god is sovereign anyway and he determines who is going to heaven and who is not then why do i need to inconvenience myself take risks and share the gospel the answer is that god has commanded it he not only ordains the ends he ordains the means i know that i dont have regenerating power but god who saves by sovereign grace is pleased to use my witness and your witness to give the eternal gift of saving life in christ i always assume that if god has placed me in a certain relationship in a certain work place and a certain neighborhood he must sovereignly have chosen them to hear the gospel

1050893 the cost of inaction in the fight against global warming is too great
1050894 with passage of the biofuels bill the green communities act and now the green jobs initiative and the global warming solutions act this legislature has taken bold steps to address this critical challenge
1050895 massachusetts has a unique opportunity to lead the way in green energy technology
1050896 this bill will allow us to provide the carrots and sticks necessary to encourage businesses to be more efficient and to encourage creativity and innovation this is a win win for the state as we work to reduce green house gases improve energy efficiency and develop emerging green technologies
1050897 the evidence is clear that the burning of fossil fuels continues to take a dramatic toll on our environment and pain at the pump will only worsen
1050898 these environmental and consumer costs demand solutions and the house voted to make massachusetts a part of the clean energy solution
1050899 we have a shared responsibility to make the world a better healthier place to live for the next generation and for every generation that follows

1050941 it means there is some inflation leaking into the system and it puts the fed in a difficult position
1050942 but given the weakness of the economy it means theyre going to have to tolerate more inflation than they like

1050963 there are inherent tensions here for instance showing you more text or images for every result may enable you to better pick out the best result but a result page that has too much information takes longer to download and longer to visually process so every piece of information that we add to the result page has to be carefully considered to ensure that the benefit to the user outweighs the cost of dealing with that additional information this is true of every part of the search experience from typing in a query to scanning results to further exploration

1050971 we have told the defence ministry that arms purchases are potentially dangerous and therefore it should inform us of each and every one of its transactions
1050972 recent history shows that the greater the secrecy and the more limited the transparency in arms purchasing the more likely there is to be corruption involved
1050973 renewing the operational capability of the armed forces to guarantee our defence is very important and for that very reason there must be transparency at each step of the acquisition process
1050974 we have informed the defence ministry that classified purchases of war material are exceptions to the rule and must be justified according to stringent conditions we have also indicated the rules that must be complied with prior to declaring an acquisition to be a secret of state
1050975 paradoxically when i was defence minister as a retired army general military procurement was transparent while now that the defence minister is a civilian arms acquisitions are secret

1050987 i was surprised by some of the statements in the police evidence in mr gregsons assistant police commissioner wayne gregson evidence that we didnt co operate and were adversarial
1050988 at all times everyone at the sunday times co operated the police said it was a straightforward exercise but 27 police officers turning up at your workplace isnt a straightforward exercise
1050989 that was in consultation with detective sergeant allan jane the conversation i had with detective sergeant jane was at times jovial i dispute that we were unhelpful or not co operative
1050990 its just a last ditch effort to keep the scumbag breathing
1050991 he never should have been breathing in the first place i dont care i really dont care what anyone thinks about this except texas i love texas texas is in my blood

1050996 most of our friends abroad have long since come to the conclusion that this country on this topic just doesnt get it
1050997 this state is seen as uncaring and hateful and this case is just right on the top
1050998 most texans however consider death a just penalty in certain rare circumstances many europeans disagree so be it
1050999 unfortunately i doubt that the international community is likely to brush this off as simply the actions of texas in the international community and under all u s treaty obligations the united states is responsible for texas actions
1051000 and so the only way they sic figure theyre going to win this election is if they make you scared of me
1051001 it was dramatic the whole building moved and it lasted for a while

1051003 its a sizeable cut in terms of the prestige of having the magazine going to embassies
1051004 not be renewing our subscriptions to a number of magazines including art monthly australia
1051005 however we do not wish to receive any more magazines for the rest of this financial year
1051006 nor do we foresee at this stage that we will be renewing our subscription at a later date
1051007 we lost some big full page ads mostly federal government bodies but we picked up a lot of smaller ads as a show of support so it balanced out
1051008 a cheap stunt might have been to secure a provocative image by henson for the cover given that his offending works were all cleared by the classification board before we went to print
1051009 if the issue of agitation for salary increase by the nations workforce is not handled with care the inflation rate may rise up to two digits which is not good for the nations economy developing nations of the world always lay emphasis on the production aspect of the economy and not the recurrent expenditure which include payment of salary

1051014 labour is underestimating the new conservatives in just the same way the tories underestimated new labour 11 years ago
1051015 the conservative analysis is that this over controlling state is not only disastrously unpopular it is also one of the key reasons why labour despite all its spending has failed to achieve its goals endless supervision has been an expensive distraction and has sapped energy and morale out of public life
1051016 we must exterminate the sort of people who do not fit in declared george bernard shaw at the turn of the 20th century
1051017 the new dividing line between labour and the tories is less about a left right split than about an authoritarian approach on one side and a more liberal one on the other and labour are on the wrong side of it

1051025 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
1051026 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors

1051029 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
1051030 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid

1051066 das kontingent an freifl gen steht allen aufsichtsratsmitgliedern der lufthansa ag zu den vertretern der arbeitnehmer und anteilseigner gleicherma en es wird hier aber offensichtlich mit zweierlei ma gemessen es ist eben nicht dasselbe wenn zwei das gleiche tun

1051072 the first half of 2008 saw the most difficult financial markets for several decades marked by significant declines in profitability throughout much of our industry with consequent recapitalisation and restructuring
1051073 the outlook for the near term remains highly challenging with significant uncertainty
1051074 globally consumer confidence is declining and despite the short term success of the recent fiscal stimulus the us economy continues to be weak driven by continuing housing market difficulties
1051075 the uk and other economies in europe which had enjoyed housing market booms have also weakened the decline in credit availability is accelerating this process
1051076 ultimately the real economy will recover from this crisis although it may get worse before it gets better
1051077 in the emerging markets where hsbc is the leading international bank growth remained strong in the period as real asset prices continued to rise and infrastructure development continued to boost economic growth which supported consumer confidence and spending
1051078 the treadmill is going faster than the legs at least when it comes to consumers and their spending household consumption surged in june but much of that went to purchase higher priced food and energy

1051090 we hebben de spelers duidelijkheid gegeven de transfertermijn sluit aan het einde van de maand en we verwachten dat er nog wel wat gaat gebeuren met een aantal spelers van ons uiteindelijk willen we met een selectie van ongeveer 24 spelers werken
1051091 aan hen is duidelijk gemaakt dat de kans klein is dat ze op wedstrijddagen bij de uiteindelijke selectie van achttien spelers zitten
1051092 we gaan in beroep tegen de hoogte van dat bedrag en de genoemde feiten
1051093 we vinden dat ook de hoofdrolspelers voormalig directeur theo de rooij en ploegleider erik breukink in de rechtszaal hun zegje moeten kunnen doen
1051094 het verder verstrakken van het monetair beleid cre ert risicos
1051095 de imf directeurs vinden over het algemeen dat de rente best ongewijzigd blijft
1051096 ik voel me als een klein kind met een nieuw speelgoedje
1051097 ik ben heel tevreden met hoe ik er nu voorsta ik popel dan ook om af te reizen naar peking ik voel me als een klein kind met een nieuw speelgoedje
1051098 het parcours is op maat van sven gesneden als hij met de hitte wegkan is er in peking zeker iets mogelijk
1051099 wij hebben enorm veel tijd doorgebracht in de klimaatkamer van de leuvense universiteit dat was niet gemakkelijk sven vertoonde veel ups en downs ik heb ondervonden dat elke training een aanslag was op de conditie van sven hij trainde op de intensiteit van de wedstrijd maar dikwijls moest sven dan al volledig uitgeput stoppen na nauwelijks n uur
1051100 soms gebeurde het dat sven de dag nadien een prima gevoel overhield aan een loodzware oefensessie in de klimaatkamer daar was werkelijk geen lijn in te trekken wij hebben dan alle ups en downs naast elkaar gelegd toen kwamen we tot de slotsom dat sven naarmate hij meer tijd in die kamer doorbracht beter en beter presteerde
1051101 in tegenstelling met het veldrijden spits ik nu alles toe op n enkele wedstrijd met name de olympische rit
1051102 in functie daarvan heb ik weinig mountainbikewedstrijden gereden ik speelde dan ook steeds met de vraag of mijn conditie goed genoeg was maar de ronde van het waals gewest heeft mij gerustgesteld die werd gereden in heel warme omstandigheden
1051103 ik voel mij nu heel goed ik doe echter bijna geen competitie meer omdat ik bang ben om te vallen trouwens tot aan de olympische wedstrijd zal ik veel rust inbouwen en af en toe eens prikkelen om mijn hartslag omhoog te duwen in china is het vooral recuperatie aanpassen aan het klimaat de jetlag en vooral fris blijven ik heb een gebrek aan mountainbike ervaring mountainbike is een enorm zware sport ik weet dat ik daarbij roofbouw op mijn lichaam pleeg
1051104 dat stelt niet zo veel voor een heuvel zoals er in het leuvense veel zijn en waarop korte snokken afgewisseld met technische afdalingen nodig zijn maar hoedje af voor de chinezen die het parcours uitgebouwd hebben tot een juweeltje met compacte kleine rondjes
1051105 het loof van de plant wordt geel en de aardappelen blijven klein
1051106 we waren stomverbaasd we moesten de lijnen wel verplaatsen daar zijn we vele vele uren aan kwijtgeraakt

1051113 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle
1051114 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1051115 we believe he is very well respected both in industry and in the investor community
1051116 from motorolas perspective we expect this will improve the companys competitive positioning faster than if an executive of lesser stature had been attracted as ceo

1051149 el trato discriminatorio que el ejecutivo de rodr guez zapatero dar a algunas comunidades aut nomas como la valenciana mediante el nuevo modelo de gesti n aeroportuaria recientemente anunciado

1051162 since 1950 with the onset of industrialized fisheries we have rapidly reduced the resource base to less than 10 percent not just for some stocks but for entire communities of these large fish species from the tropics to the poles
1051163 were in a phase where increasing fishing effort produces less catch

1051244 with a lot of hand coded algorithms youre not going to get any advantage from improvements in the operating systems or languages

1051264 love between a married couple expressed in sex brings the human body closer to heaven the ecstasy in the joy of sexual intercourse can be likened to the joy of eternal life this is why the conjugal act allows spouses to begin to understand the sweetness of encountering god
1051265 when a woman is excited she wants to experience absolute pleasure as much as a man does the feeling of sexual dissatisfaction for a woman who is already excited is a great physical and psychological suffering

1051335 we have not had running water for the past six months and we have since stopped using the toilets because they are blocked people here use the bush
1051336 we have to do that because if they pupils come here without water there will be an outbreak of diseases we are just being cautious
1051337 we last had water on the 13th of this month and we were assured that water would be restored but up to now nothing has happened
1051338 i dont have any idea what we are paying for every month our bills keep on rising yet we are not getting the water
1051339 the persistence of the water crisis simply means the constant exposure of the residents to a health disaster
1051340 this was a reckless decision which continues to haunt residents in all towns as well as threaten their dear lives
1051341 we are also demanding that water management responsibility be surrendered to our local authority the city of harare
1051342 we have made several calls to zesa but nothing has materialised at one time i was told there was no fuel and now they are saying thieves drained oil from a local sub station

1051345 the orbit of steins with which rosetta will rendezvous on 5 september closing to a distance of 800 km is only known thanks to ground observations but not yet with the accuracy we would like for the close fly by
1051346 we will be able to use the first data set for the trajectory correction manoeuvre planned for mid august
1051347 starting 11 days before closest approach as the distance with steins decreases the two rosetta navigation cameras will finally be able to see and track the asteroid too
1051348 we will already be able to use the first data set for the trajectory correction manoeuvre planned for mid august
1051349 but osiris will also take this opportunity to obtain light curves of steins light curves tell us how the asteroid brightness varies with time providing us with additional preparatory information about the asteroid such as better knowledge of its shape and rotation characteristics

1051356 it is one thing to develop a technology in a university lab but another to develop it in the field with all of the uncertainties and unknown challenges that arent always technically and socially apparent

1051358 king tubby was a jamaican electronics and sound engineer known primarily for his influence on the development of dub in the 1960s and 1970s tubbys innovative studio work which saw him elevate the role of record producer to a creative height previously only reserved for composers and musicians would prove to be highly influential across many genres of popular music he is often cited as the inventor of the concept of the remix and so may be seen as a direct antecedent of much dance and electronic music production king tubbys production work in the 1970s would see him become one of the best known celebrities in jamaica and would generate interest in his production techniques from musicians across the world tubby built on his considerable knowledge of electronics to repair adapt and design his own studio equipment which made use of a combination of old devices and new technologies to produce a studio capable of the precise atmospheric sounds which would become tubbys trademark with a variety of effects units connected to his mixer tubby was able to play the mixing desk like an instrument bringing instruments and vocals in and out of the mix literally dubbing them to create an entirely new genre dub music using existing master tapes or his own highly skilled session musicians tubby would twist the instrumental parts of songs into unexpected configurations which highlighted the heavy rhythms of their bass and drum parts with minute snatches of vocals horns and keyboard these techniques mirrored the actions of the soundsystem selectors who had long used eq equipment to emphasise certain aspects of particular records but tubby was able to use his custom built studio to take this technique into unexpected areas often transforming a hit song to the point where it was almost unrecognizeable from its original it is unlikely that a complete discography of tubbys production work could be created based on the number of labels artists and producers with whom he worked and subsequent repressings of these releases sometimes contained contradictory information his name is credited on hundreds of b side labels with the possibility that many others were by his hand yet uncredited due to similarities with his known work king tubby was shot and killed on february 6 1989 by an unknown group of people outside his home in duhaney park upon returning from a session at his waterhouse studio it is thought that the murder was probably an attempt at robbery

1051360 the room where the bottles are filled is completely flooded and water runs freely to the storage room
1051361 there is no prior disinfection of the empty bottles or of the lids
1051362 there is no problem with our water the only thing the inspection team mentioned to us concerned problems with the walls of the building but i do not believe that this justifies the closing of the company
1051363 i first heard an alarm before i saw him running towards the house pantless

1051365 brain metastases are rarely treated with drugs because many drugs do not cross the blood brain barrier a special wall of blood vessels in the brain that prevents the passage of most foreign substances from the bloodstream into the brain and spinal cord
1051366 for example trastuzumab herceptin is an fda approved antibody that targets her2 and it can inhibit breast cancers growth these antibodies are too large to pass the blood brain barrier to impact the cancer cells that have migrated to the brain however our mouse model suggests that lapatinib may successfully get across if successful in humans the drug may provide a new approach to treating brain metastases
1051367 lapatinib was tested in a human clinical study of brain metastases and showed only modest results
1051368 however we asked a different question rather than asking lapatinib to melt a golf ball sized metastasis in the brain we asked if it would be more effective at preventing micrometastases or small undetectable metastases from growing into large metastatic tumors
1051369 these findings indicate that lapatinib may be beneficial in the treatment of patients with her2 positive breast cancer who may have micrometastases and are thus at risk for the development of brain metastases
1051370 such fundamental knowledge holds great potential for the development of improved biologically inspired structural materials for example soldier first responder and military vehicle armor applications
1051371 many of the design principles we describe durable interfaces and energy dissipating mechanisms for instance may be translatable to human armor systems
1051372 we are excited to be working with greenbank as they grow their portfolio of merchants with the addition of mess highly advanced platform integrating all payment authorization settlement and real time online reporting into one seamless interface
1051373 we work diligently to provide a full range of solutions that will allow merchants to focus on what they do best sell their products and services to consumers
1051374 our merchant customers can now utilize the web to take advantage of unsurpassed business management tools to process e commerce and traditional payment methods without the unnecessary it and integration expense
1051375 we will be using the vasco solution to enable secure 24 7 remote support of our enterprise based applications
1051376 these systems are essential to the operation of our sales force support of our merchants and prospective customers we are always looking for ways to increase the level of support for our customers with an emphasis on security vascos two factor authentication solution was a perfect match that enabled us to do just that
1051377 we are glad that encore payment systems chose vasco to secure their credit card processing and merchant solutions
1051378 vasco offers a secure and flexible authentication solution and provides user friendly password management helping companies achieve compliance with pcis requirements

1051380 the safety profile is favorable for ongoing development of pbt2 future trials that are larger and longer will establish if the effects of pbt2 on biomarkers and cognition that are reported here translate into clinical effectiveness
1051381 to go forward as an ad treatment pbt 2 must still surmount the high hurdle of additional safety and efficacy testing in large scale clinical trials if we assume that the amyloid hypothesis holds water future clinical studies with pbt 2 will not only test the mettle of metal protein attenuating compounds but also provide the first real world test of the importance of metal ion homeostasis in the pathogenesis of ad
1051382 were not going to make any excuses for this sort of parking which sets a very poor example
1051383 this doesnt alter the fact that the vehicle should have been parked properly in the first place

1051386 the people have been struggling since 2003 because of drought which has reduced pasture and increased population migration
1051387 the drought has had a heavy toll on the livestock with 40 to 70 percent dying in various parts of the country
1051388 rising food prices are having a double impact of not only reducing food security but also the ability of families to assist each other
1051389 the rising cost of living is undermining food security more than usual particularly for poor households whose monthly income is far below the cost of the minimum expenditure basket
1051390 in the worst case a total of 341 000 people 54 percent of the population are expected to need emergency food and water supplies by august
1051391 we urgently need assistance from the international community to provide the support vitally needed by the population
1051392 successive droughts high staple food prices decreased remittances high inflation and a lack of sufficient resources to respond adequately to the current food crisis may lead to famine in certain areas particularly in the northwest and southeast pastoral livelihood zones
1051393 we are committed to ensuring that all communities which lack access to portable water will in small time have it sufficiently
1051394 even though we are succeeding in preventing organ rejection we havent made much progress to improve long term survival
1051395 unfortunately most kidney transplant patients will go back on dialysis in eight to ten years in part because the anti rejection drugs can be toxic to the kidneys
1051396 successful low dose regimens of tacrolimus and other anti rejection medications require highly precise ultra sensitive drug monitoring assays
1051397 at low doses even the slightest variation in blood level readings could be devastating to transplant patients the consequence for the laboratory is twofold it must have accurate precise testing for immunosuppressive drugs and tacrolimus tests that are accurate to 4 ng ml are no longer adequate
1051398 the challenge for the laboratory therefore is to assure with the utmost confidence to the physician that a tacrolimus blood level of 3 ng ml is exactly right and not 5
1051399 the functional sensitivity in our hands was 0 9 ng ml exceeding the package insert claim of 2 ng ml we are fully confident the architect tacrolimus assay meets our requirement for low level tacrolimus monitoring
1051400 the architect tacrolimus assay is the only automated transplant monitoring test that meets international standards for low level monitoring
1051401 while researchers continue to investigate amyloid as a target for alzheimers therapies it is the most mature theory being pursued we must also examine other potential avenues given the urgency of conquering this disease
1051402 we cant leave any stone unturned if we hope to aid the 5 million people currently living with alzheimers and the millions more that will be devastated by this epidemic
1051403 we must develop better treatments for alzheimers that go beyond improving symptoms to drugs that actually change the course of the disease delaying the onset of alzheimers and slowing the progression of the disease means that millions of people would not get alzheimers and that many who do get the disease might only experience mild symptoms in addition delaying the onset and slowing the progression of alzheimers in the next five years could generate billions of dollars annually in medicare and medicaid savings for nursing home care alone
1051404 while the results of the trial were certainly disappointing just because the flurizan phase iii clinical trial failed doesnt mean that other amyloid targeted therapies in the clinical trial pipeline arent valid we learn a great deal from every clinical study
1051405 there are many ways to impact amyloid and its role in alzheimers there are other drugs in development that target amyloid with mechanisms of action that are different from this one one or more of these drugs may ultimately prove successful
1051406 this was the largest and longest placebo controlled ad treatment trial ever completed
1051407 while the trial did not meet its endpoints it was well designed and executed and it provided clear answers regarding flurizans lack of efficacy and its safety
1051408 the fact that both the drug treated and placebo groups declined over the course of the trial and that the placebo treated patients declined at the expected rate shows that we can do this type of trial in people with mild alzheimers as the first trial to ever study a large population of mild alzheimers patients weve collected very valuable data on the progression of the disease in its earliest stages we are confident that the results of this study will help researchers in their quest to develop new and better treatments for alzheimers
1051409 this drug candidate in this dose in this group did not work but like much good science the study raises as many questions as it does provide answers was the dose right was the study long enough did they start the intervention early enough in the course of the disease designing and executing clinical studies that answer these questions will help us defeat alzheimers disease
1051410 the only way we are going to solve the problem of alzheimers is for scientists and companies to have the courage to make significant investments in these large scale trials which may or may not work this was a very well done study and the company and scientists are to be commended for that
1051411 these results indicate that pbt2 is having an impact on the underlying biology of alzheimers which is very exciting
1051412 this is a critical proof of concept and the safety and efficacy demonstrated by pbt2 in this study warrant evaluation in larger scale clinical trials in alzheimers
1051413 this is the first instance of a disease modifying alzheimers therapy that has attained its primary pre specified cognitive efficacy target in a clinical trial
1051414 this trial therefore provides the first clinical trial evidence that an alzheimers therapy aimed at blocking tau aggregation may be a viable disease modifying treatment we now need to confirm this in a larger phase iii trial
1051415 our results appear to meet the draft emea clinical guidelines for disease modifying therapy supported by spect and pet evidence of efficacy in brain regions heavily affected by tau pathology
1051416 were very excited by these results and we look forward to further research on this product
1051417 this is an innovative completely different approach and we believe that medical foods such as souvenaid tm can be a valuable part of alzheimers disease management were committed to a high level of scientific rigor in the next trial to further test souvenaid tm
1051418 souvenaid tm is a medical food product backed by 10 years of research much of the conceptual work and early pre clinical work was done at under professor richard wurtman and supported principally by the national institutes of health
1051419 safety and efficacy of tarenflurbil in subjects with mild alzheimers disease results from an 18 month multi center phase 3 trial
1051420 targeting ab as a modifying therapy of alzheimers disease safety efficacy and biomarker findings of a phase 2a randomised double blind placebo controlled trial of pbt2
1051421 tau aggregation inhibitor tai therapy with rember tm arrests disease progression in mild and moderate alzheimers disease over 50 weeks
1051422 the efficacy of souvenaid in mild alzheimers disease a randomized controlled double blind parallel group multi centre multi country clinical trial
1051423 this study was limited in its size design and goals
1051424 but if the findings seen in these post hoc analyses are replicated in the global phase 3 program it would be a validation of the amyloid hypothesis and could change how physicians approach the treatment of alzheimers disease
1051425 the clinically significant benefit seen with bapineuzumab treatment in the apoe4 non carrier subgroup is encouraging
1051426 these results across multiple endpoints are consistent with what we have seen for beta amyloid immunotherapy from animal studies through to the patients
1051427 these data represent scientific validation of our decision to move rapidly into phase 3 last year
1051428 in our phase 3 program we will learn much more since we will be able to study bapineuzumab in larger patient populations and better assess the results in apoe4 carriers and non carriers in separate trials we are encouraged by these results and well achieve greater insight as we move forward
1051429 brings a whole host of different ingredients to the table
1051430 we are hard pressed to imagine a better candidate than dr jha
1051431 we believe he is very well respected both in industry and in the investor community
1051432 from motorolas perspective we expect this will improve the companys competitive positioning
1051433 when we eat without washing our hands not minding what we touch with our hands we stand the risk of contacting serious diseases
1051434 but this requires a change in the culture and that is why an elected council is the only body that can really take the lead rather than some appointed body
1051435 orphanage get their vater supply from local water vendors at a high rate i found this pathetic and unacceptable i decided instantly to do something worth i prayed to god to give me the guidance to achieve my objectives thereby making it possible for these helpless kids to have running and portable water
1051436 guys i know this isnt going to make me popular but i think youre being hypocritical you are sitting here talking about the people in our church with problems when most of us are overweight fat if you will and scripture speaks against that but none of us will because it would get too personal
1051437 if we are out of our mind it is for the sake of god if we are in our right mind it is for you
1051438 sanjays technical expertise and industry experience make him ideally suited to lead mobile devices
1051439 before whitehead the idea that any part of the telecommunications market could be open to competition was radical
1051440 in television you had three networks in telephone you had ma bell and nobody else
1051441 all the stuff that has come since cable television and cellphones and broadband springs from the idea that tom whitehead introduced that a competitive market would bring innovation and diversity
1051442 you cant say that everything thats happened since 1974 is attributable to one guy i guess but if you could it would be tom he was very very important
1051443 extending a tv signal beyond its ordinary broadcast range in those days required using long chains of microwave repeaters one every 30 miles or so
1051444 for the next three and a half years whitehead fought ceaselessly for open skies
1051445 the open skies policy whitehead wanted finally became law in 1974
1051446 its not exactly correct to say that whiteheads struggle against the telecommunications monopolies has been largely forgotten
1051447 while we discussed the need to optimise water supplies by harnessing wastewater and treating it to drinking water quality standards for portable use we somehow fell short of water and sanitation as a single entity that requires integration for the betterment of its management
1051448 the reality is that as the population continues to grow and water demands increase rather exponentially and as societies become more urbanised solutions become more and more complex
1051449 the major contributor to the recent outbreaks in the area was unsafe water
1051450 in kisumu many wells are built near the latrine eventually the sewage seeps into the wells
1051451 people need to be made aware of water safety by fetching their water from a safe source and boiling it

1051454 this is a long overdue project we are also doing this to give the town a new image in keeping abreast of technological advancements and the changing needs of the society
1051455 we felt that it was time we change to a new system in order to do away with all these problems of water leakages and blocked oxidation ponds once such a project has been completed the town will surely benefit a lot from it
1051456 they say the water from unprotected sources is thick and tastes sweet yet some of the sources that i visited were untidy and surrounded by faeces

1051467 i used to think it was something he did for emphasis or to simplify a complex concept but i now realise that hes merely mimicking the way it was explained to him
1051468 to its pedestrians new york offers secret gardens off the driven path glorious displays of art and architecture spontaneous entertainment while it punishes motorists with one way streets
1051469 i had not just spent a couple of hours in a queue and a whole day in anticipation to be snubbed with a half hearted hand shake i want a bit more of a reaction
1051470 i was in south african a couple of weeks ago with nelson mandela i met 200 wonderful children at his birthday party
1051471 i like south africa and visit there often did you know about the party
1051472 the hardest part about eating out in new york is the sheer choice
1051473 its downright dizzying you wont be able to conquer the citys culinary scene but you can have some great meals trying
1051474 genres from classic diner and jewish deli fare to helplessly hip upscale celebrity chef offerings and the authentic ethnic flavours of italy france israel japan south india brazil mexico shall we go on
1051475 sixty years of countless reform schemes to aid agencies and dozens of different plans and 2 3 trillion later the aid industry is still failing to reach the beautiful goal of making poverty history the evidence points to an unpopular conclusion big plans will always fail to reach the beautiful goal
1051476 insiders have enough knowledge to find solutions and that most solutions must be homegrown
1051477 i have so many kids coming out of alex i have changed their lives i have changed their family by becoming involved in ballet you have changed an entire family through one child you are changing the whole fabric of that society change comes about by changing one persons life not the masses
1051478 its a pity about the blacks they got wonderful rhythm but unfortunately they really cant do classical ballet
1051479 it was something i needed to do and it was something that the children yearned for they loved it
1051480 understanding the whole package of what makes a ballet dancer
1051481 the need for this academy resulting in the production of dancers of an international standard that can go out into the marketplace and earn their living from dance has been identified by the community and a solution has been requested repeatedly over many years
1051482 the academy will in addition produce a number of qualified teachers of dance from the community
1051483 for those who finish school and are brain stuck that do not know what to do it the imaginationlab gives you a good idea of what you want to do
1051484 into a sandpit and give them lots of toys to play with to stimulate their creativity
1051485 from a macro perspective the purpose of the lab is to bring previously disadvantaged talent into the advertising creative and brand building industry by creating a ladder for them to climb that gives people the opportunity to climb into a field where they naturally belong
1051486 talent was literally just sitting on the street falling through the cracks
1051487 the lab and vega who administer the lab are not based on forcing an outcome on students but rather allows them to engage with creativity as a process
1051488 they put your head into everything branding copy writing design you also find out about yourself and learn about who you are and what you like you learn about yourself
1051489 i am having a lot of fun after finishing matric i was caught up with other things and i didnt know what to do with my life it made me realise that theres more to life than to sit around and wait thinking that things will come to me it made me realise this is who i am and this is what i want to do
1051490 we ourselves feel that what we are doing is just a drop in the ocean but the ocean would be less because of that missing drop
1051491 here was my she ro in handcuffs going to court and next to her was this african american man and he was her attorney that was the first time in my life i realised that there were african american attorneys
1051492 and i knew of african american preachers because sunday morning is the most segregated hour in all of america but male or female i had not seen or heard of an african american attorney before
1051493 and i said damn this is what you can do this is what you can be the kind of person that defends angela davis that is what i want to do
1051494 i run the office for the region and i am also the grant maker for philanthropy and arts and crafts
1051495 so im bouncing back between south african and cambridge massachusetts and it must have been month number five when the then representative of this office john gerhard came to me and said to me alice im about to lose a staff member and i need some help
1051496 and i said to him you know john i am on sabbatical and i am probably going to just go back to the states eventually but okay since i am running out of money and i could use it i could do this for four or five months and then ill finish off my sabbatical and then ill go back to the us
1051497 i said to myself what are you going to do you are going back to where to do what
1051498 i was just saying man there is all this stuff going on why the hell would you want to go back to the us to beat your head against that wall
1051499 and you have social and economic rights that are being written into the constitution very explicitly in a way they dont exist in the us
1051500 you can be in a place where youre starting from scratch starting with a clean slate
1051501 in an atmosphere where you would be helpful helping to facilitate the development of the human rights arena and the development of a progressive human rights culture that cannot happen in the us right now
1051502 what is it south africa alive with possibility i heard the ad and i bought into it
1051503 it was a great disappointment to my father who didnt understand it at all
1051504 as since i was 14 i had declared that i was going to be a lawyer so what the hell did grad school and history have to do with being a lawyer why didnt i just stay on track
1051505 this was 1978 79 80 and people were looking at me in grad schools and law school like i was crazy
1051506 they would say to me in terms of the law and those issues you would need to look at international law and as a young professional you dont get to work in the united nations un you need to be seasoned and older and there really is no way to marry these two
1051507 so i stayed a year at grad school and then went to law school as i said that i was going to do
1051508 so i said thats my job thats written for me and ive never felt that way before in my life and i said somebody wrote that job for me and i applied and amazingly i got the job
1051509 at that point we were particularly trying to help increase the numbers and expand the educational credentials of black south africans
1051510 in about 1989 i started to feel itchy like okay this is a great job and im doing great things but im a grant maker im funding public interest law centers im funding human law attorneys to do things you as a donor are not the doer you are funding helping those who do
1051511 and i need to do it sooner rather than later
1051512 because the longer i take to go back to it the less credibility i will have to get back into the field
1051513 it was something i was very passionate about and nearly everybody i worked with in that agency was as passionate about you could literally just work 24 hours a day seven days a week and still not do enough or not give enough
1051514 it was very very demanding and exhausting and all consuming i decided to take a break so i took a years sabbatical with six months worth of money
1051515 his dad is around and sees him every other weekend disney dad
1051516 you do the discipline you do the hard work and they come in and heres tickets to world cup soccer or heres that playstation that you wanted and youre but he doesnt need it and hes like he wanted it
1051517 i like parenting for the most part i say to my kid i think ill keep you i think the warrantee has run out although every once in a while i threaten to take him back and get my money back and he says you know its against the law
1051518 i come in with my list of things i want to do that i want to accomplish and then life is what kicks in when you are sitting around planning other things
1051519 i get phone calls and i get staff members and i get e mails from new york saying we need x yesterday and can you meet with so and so whos at the front door who hasnt got a meeting so i come in and have a crazy day
1051520 we were always running from one aunties house to one uncles house to the park with my cousins
1051521 you have to arrange a play date you have to arrange to go to the movies or the mall
1051522 we would literally just go the park and strike up a game like something like double dutch hide and seek what have you
1051523 is good stuff to play after 10pm once the older and more respectable crew have settled down for the evening
1051524 a very cute little girl grabbed my leg and asked where are my parents where are my brothers
1051525 i saw her parents and brothers were on a plane that was set to take off in three minutes
1051526 i ran quickly because i knew that every minute mattered at the same time the police tried to contact the flight attendants to get them to stop the plane when i reached the gate the plane was no longer there
1051527 were in shock theyre very responsible and organized top notch people apparently one relied on the other and this is what happened

1051551 we found the imprint in clay remarkably well preserved of a seal with the name of gedaliah the son of pashur
1051552 how absolutely fantastic and special this find is can only be realised when you hold in your hand this magnificent one centimetre piece of clay and know that it survived 2600 years in the debris of the destruction and came to us complete and in perfect condition
1051553 the letters are in ancient hebrew and are very clearly preserved
1051554 the first stars were very different from stars like the sun
1051555 this general picture of star formation and the ability to compare how stellar objects form in different time periods and regions of the universe will eventually allow investigation into the origins of life and planets
1051556 we do see stars in our galaxy that have very different properties than our sun and its possible these are second generation stars
1051557 abundance of elements in the universe has increased as stars have accumulated and the formation and destruction of stars continues to spread these elements further across the universe
1051558 dr yoshida has taken the study of primordial star formation to a new level with this simulation but it still gets us only to the halfway point toward our final goal it is like laying the foundation of a skyscraper
1051559 we must continue our studies in this area to understand how the initially tiny protostar grows layer by layer to eventually form a massive star

1051572 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy

1051583 i did an interview yesterday with metal hammer magazine in europe and the guy had just spoken to don dokken and don s response to that same question was the interviewer told me was that this is all coming from george nobody else has any interest now that is absolutely not true the actual truth is that yes my management company has been instrumental in encouraging this to happen and im all for it but everybody else has agreed in principle at three different occasions over the past few years at looking into doing this to try to put it together and have it make sense and for various reasons it has not happened but to characterize this as im the one that is pounding the table and everyone else is reluctant astronauts is completely false my management company would get a hold of don and hed say yeah im down lets see what we can put together weve tried to put various tours together and recording sessions together and different reformations and all that weve had vh1 on board our own show record deals reasonably good tours and other things for one reason or another it doesnt happen in the 11th hour and thats ok but he mischaracterized it and was being untruthful about that just to set the record straight im always down of course this is a business and id love to see some closure of the dokken thing for myself the fans and the band before i hang my guitar up

1051717 i dont know why i was struck so hard at that moment

1051724 or to fall back on the inevitable wwii anology we can accept and even in some ways admire admiral canaris the german intell chief for betraying germany because that was a pecuiliar situation we would have no respect whatsoever for him if he did not find it at all difficult

1051734 one of the most comforting sights for the war weary citizens of france or belgium was a patrol of american gis coming into their village
1051735 the sight of those american kids meant cigarettes candy c rations and freedom they had come not to conquer or terrorize but to liberate

1051778 wie jeder wei wollte ich immer nach spanien weil ich eine starke bindung zu diesem land habe
1051779 rafael ist ein toller spieler einer der in jeder partie der saison den unterschied ausmachen kann
1051780 in den niederlanden hatte ich f nf gute jahre aber in deutschland ist es schwerer das ist ein gro er schritt f r mich
1051781 f r jeden klub ist es eine ehre so einen au ergew hnlichen spieler wie ihn zu haben
1051782 ihn zu verlieren ist ein gro er verlust aber wir m ssen diese entscheidung akzeptieren
1051783 er ist ein kompletter techniker mit einem tollen charakter und au ergew hnlichen f higkeiten
1051784 nat rlich h tten wir leichtere gegner erwischen k nnen aber ich bin nicht traurig ber das los da ich in spanien gelebt und auch einige jahre dort gespielt habe zwischen 1992 und 1997 beim fc barcelona
1051785 es wird f r mich einfach werden informationen ber unseren gegner bekommen ich kenne den spanischen fu ball sehr gut
1051786 wir sind nicht favorit also ist alles was wir gegen deportivo erreichen gut sie werden ein attraktiver gegner f r unsere fans sein und mit ein wenig gl ck k nnen wir weiterkommen deportivo ist definitiv ein starkes team aber nicht so dass wir sagen m ssten wir haben keine chance
1051787 wir stehen vor zwei gro en spielen und machen uns hoffnungen

1051789 es ist ein tolles los ich wollte etwas in der richtung
1051790 wir spielen gegen einen starken gegner eine mannschaft die wir schlagen k nnen aber ich h tte auch kein problem gehabt gegen ein italienisches oder spanisches team zu spielen es w re finanziell super und meine spieler h tten sich mit akteuren starker mannschaften messen k nnen
1051791 we have two but a lot of times we dont have enough people to run them
1051792 in some communities out there its the volunteer fire department or nothing
1051793 theres not the economic base to support a career department so if they cant keep the volunteer fire department viable then the potential exists that theyre not going to have any protection at all
1051794 your mom and your dad was in the fire service and their parents were in the fire service and it just goes on from generation to generation
1051795 it makes you wonder where well be 20 years from now
1051796 every time i hear the pager go off you know you wonder whos gonna be there and whos not
1051797 sometimes you just dont have anybody to go especially during the day
1051798 i hate to admit it but theres been more times this year where other departments have had to help us out

1051821 theres a philosophy that goes across all of our games and that philosophy stays true from game to game so it probably draws some comparisons
1051822 one philosophy is that our artists feel like if theyre just using photorealism not creating a unique look for the game not stylizing so that its uniquely blizzard then theyre not doing their jobs
1051823 weird and stupid video game moments in video game history
1051824 we have not been able to see the leading edge of the epidemic
1051825 its troubling but not surprising to those who have been working against this epidemic for years
1051826 it tells us however where we need to continue to focus our priorities
1051827 keeping for inflation that is an actual decrease over the years
1051828 over the last eight years the domestic aids epidemic has been starved for resources
1051829 we have not been investing sufficient resources in fighting the aids epidemic in black america
1051830 we have very few programs designed for and by black gay men
1051831 why dont we have a national strategy to address an epidemic with 56 000 cases a year

1051844 peoples picture of the disease is skewed they make the assumption that people with ms end up in a wheelchair but thats simply not true
1051845 an increasing number of treatments have been shown to be effective in the early stages arguably theres evidence that by using these treatments early we maybe changing the natural history of the disease long term

1051879 those who should get in get in those who should be kept out are kept out and those who should not be here will be required to leave
1051880 the thing about this research is that this work has confirmed that our economy based on parasitic capitalism where the small elite sits atop the heap of men and gorges on their lifeblood is destroying the social fabric of america
1051881 this system is based on a stacked deck where the top elites always reap the profits that are made to rise to the top through the corporate profits based system
1051882 the research confirmed that the rowing inequities of such a system were ever increasing and with them elevated social tensions
1051883 despite all the reports shortcomings and its hypocrisy it does make some sound observations about what is needed for our immediate survival we should take it as a guide to what our government knows about the coming mega crisis and a template to help us see what changes we could make if there were truly a new economy a new social contract a new american state for it is obvious to all those who take the time to look that we are headed into a period of national freefall when american society plunges head first into a dark abyss of uncertainty as the old order passes away and the new world order rushes in to fill the void we are seeing the planned collapse of america coming down the road we are on what are we going to do to get our nation off that highway to hell

1052095 for china the olympics has been both a galvanizing force and an exercise in pride partly deserved partly not
1052096 recently however the exercise has not gone entirely according to plan in spite of their inevitability the mass protests in tibet xinjiang the muslim part of western china and mongolia still caught the government off their usually rigid guard even more unpredictable has been the tumultuous time the government has had trying to control the coverage of these events and when widespread public sympathy during the sichuan earthquake led to a huge demand for news the state could no longer reasonably control the local and foreign media
1052097 the olympics have laid bare the illogic behind the governments approach it invites the world in but then restricts entry for fear that a bunch of teva wearing hippies might show up and disrupt the games of course there will be controversy china is a totalitarian state after all but in courting the public stage china is also courting widespread scrutiny of its atrocious human rights record
1052098 above all what i blame most on the olympics is how it implicates architecture in the fabrication of this whole spectacle and even uses it to mask real urban problems confronting beijing without a doubt omas cctv and herzog and de meurons olympic stadium will remain masterpieces in the landscape of the city but within its soviet inspired planning fabric with its concentric highways lapping outward from the hub of the forbidden city huge monolithic style building threatens to add to the isolation of beijings vast alienating stretches anyone who has traveled through rush hour there where it routinely takes 60 minutes to budge five miles will have contemplated the poor planning implicated by this level of congestion
1052099 city planners said the code would help create beautiful places full of life in the suburbs but 40 or so commercial real estate owners representing properties that would be subject to the citys proposed rules didnt see it that way
1052100 think what if today was the last day of your life what would you do with it how would you treat those you love and those around you suddenly the things around you that have so much meaning will seem so unimportant and the purpose and meaning of your life will emerge from the shadows

1052105 well i wasnt going to say anything about it but yeah part of the reason i want to move out is because shelly wants to move in with me
1052106 dad i got to go but i think i will be moving out soon and shelly will be moving in with me were in love and thats that i know what im doing ad i dont need you to tell me what it is that im doing wrong or what im not doing right

1052326 in addition to the overall market challenges were the specific aspects of the property including a single brand majority of revenues from print a served market franchising that could be adversely affected by the weak economy and home financing market and a hockey stick for earnings growth in the second half of this year
1052327 i wouldnt be surprised if they could not receive any financing from traditional lenders and or the buyers tried to re trade the deal on terms unacceptable to peter shea

1052351 ik voel me als een klein kind met een nieuw speelgoedje
1052352 ik ben heel tevreden met hoe ik er nu voorsta ik popel dan ook om af te reizen naar peking ik voel me als een klein kind met een nieuw speelgoedje
1052353 het parcours is op maat van sven gesneden als hij met de hitte wegkan is er in peking zeker iets mogelijk
1052354 wij hebben enorm veel tijd doorgebracht in de klimaatkamer van de leuvense universiteit dat was niet gemakkelijk sven vertoonde veel ups en downs ik heb ondervonden dat elke training een aanslag was op de conditie van sven hij trainde op de intensiteit van de wedstrijd maar dikwijls moest sven dan al volledig uitgeput stoppen na nauwelijks n uur
1052355 soms gebeurde het dat sven de dag nadien een prima gevoel overhield aan een loodzware oefensessie in de klimaatkamer daar was werkelijk geen lijn in te trekken wij hebben dan alle ups en downs naast elkaar gelegd toen kwamen we tot de slotsom dat sven naarmate hij meer tijd in die kamer doorbracht beter en beter presteerde
1052356 in tegenstelling met het veldrijden spits ik nu alles toe op n enkele wedstrijd met name de olympische rit
1052357 in functie daarvan heb ik weinig mountainbikewedstrijden gereden ik speelde dan ook steeds met de vraag of mijn conditie goed genoeg was maar de ronde van het waals gewest heeft mij gerustgesteld die werd gereden in heel warme omstandigheden
1052358 ik voel mij nu heel goed ik doe echter bijna geen competitie meer omdat ik bang ben om te vallen trouwens tot aan de olympische wedstrijd zal ik veel rust inbouwen en af en toe eens prikkelen om mijn hartslag omhoog te duwen in china is het vooral recuperatie aanpassen aan het klimaat de jetlag en vooral fris blijven ik heb een gebrek aan mountainbike ervaring mountainbike is een enorm zware sport ik weet dat ik daarbij roofbouw op mijn lichaam pleeg
1052359 dat stelt niet zo veel voor een heuvel zoals er in het leuvense veel zijn en waarop korte snokken afgewisseld met technische afdalingen nodig zijn maar hoedje af voor de chinezen die het parcours uitgebouwd hebben tot een juweeltje met compacte kleine rondjes
1052360 we hebben de spelers duidelijkheid gegeven de transfertermijn sluit aan het einde van de maand en we verwachten dat er nog wel wat gaat gebeuren met een aantal spelers van ons uiteindelijk willen we met een selectie van ongeveer 24 spelers werken
1052361 aan hen is duidelijk gemaakt dat de kans klein is dat ze op wedstrijddagen bij de uiteindelijke selectie van achttien spelers zitten
1052362 we gaan in beroep tegen de hoogte van dat bedrag en de genoemde feiten
1052363 we vinden dat ook de hoofdrolspelers voormalig directeur theo de rooij en ploegleider erik breukink in de rechtszaal hun zegje moeten kunnen doen
1052364 we merken dat het bedrijfsklimaat op verschillende fronten lastiger wordt de turbulentie op de kredietmarkten zal nog tot in 2009 duren

1052403 exceptional achievement in and the deracialisation of the arts and for outstanding contribution to the development of black artists
1052404 as chronicler of the south african situation i could not think in european terms my approach had to originate here otherwise my art would be of little importance
1052405 south africa is at present embroiled in a classical revolutionary situation and that the stimulation arising from the situation should affect all elements of the creative society and in particular the artist and if the times have little influence on the artists work especially such momentous times he should seek a new profession
1052406 today printmaking particularly the linocut which skotnes introduced at polly street in the early 1960s is a particularly south african medium and a cornerstone of what is known as township art
1052407 it was undoubtedly initially through the medium of prints that cecil was able to produce what later became described as work which had at its core a spirit of africa
1052408 skotnes was a pioneer of printmaking in south africa as very few artists were working in this medium when he began his printmaking career in 1954 today he stands in art history as one of south africas supreme printmakers

1052419 schon 2007 haben zwei eisenbahnerinnen im betriebsdienst ihre ausbildung bei uns begonnen dieser berufszweig ist eigentlich von m nnern dominiert darum freuen wir uns umso mehr dass wir nun schon die dritte auszubildende f r diesen beruf bei uns begeistern k nnen
1052420 auf dieser rennstrecke ist eine pole position besonders viel wert da man im rennen einfach nicht so gut berholen kann die temperaturen w hrend des qualifyings waren schon hart eigentlich bin ich als spanier ja an hitze gew hnt aber hier kommt noch eine entsprechende feuchtigkeit dazu mir lief w hrend des fahrens richtig der schwei bers gesicht allerdings hatte ich vorher viel getrunken und f hlte mich entsprechend fit stolz bin ich auf die teamleistung von eurointernational facundo als bester rookie auf platz vier ist nat rlich toll
1052421 nat rlich m chte ich am liebsten immer ganz vorne stehen aber zweimal in der ersten startreihe ist nat rlich auch gut meine h rtesten konkurrenten in der gesamtwertung esteban und adrien konnte ich in der qualifikation hinter mir lassen hoffentlich gelingt mir das auch im rennen ich will endlich mal ganz oben aufs treppchen
1052422 f r mich als rookie ist das ein fantastisches ergebnis beim testen lief es hier schon gut ich kam mit viel selbstbewusstsein nach ungarn ich wusste dass es hei werden w rde deshalb bereitete ich mich mit viel fitness training vor zwei stunden im fitnessstudio zudem noch tennis und fu ball das hat sicherlich etwas gebracht nach hockenheim fiel auch die doppel belastung schule und motorsport weg ich jetzt sommerferien habe

1052428 i dont this is a terrorist attack so im not scared
1052429 got clues suggesting that the east turkestan islamic movement planned to make terrorist attacks during august 1 8 just ahead of the opening of the olympic games in beijing
1052430 ahead of the olympics it is a very powerful symbolic attack because security in xinjiang is at an all time high
1052431 starting from the minute i am sworn into the office however it must be understood it is unrealistic to expect that a u s president alone can snap his fingers and suddenly bring about peace in this region
1052432 those who try to impede a dialogue between hamas and fatah and the palestinian home front to be united they are giving priority in their own interests over palestinian national interests
1052433 it seems the delay to make a formal decision to the proposal is due to the us rejection to a dialogue
1052434 before the british left in may 1948 they humiliated the arabs we used to think that they sold petrol for only five dinars but when we opened the bottles we discovered that they sold us water
1052435 i want to tell you what had happened to me and my family when we lived in al ramlah a village the israelis took in 1948 my six children and i sat at home one of her children is my father two men knocked on the door when we opened the door they told us to leave the house because there would be clashes we didnt believe them i was cooking for my children then we suddenly heard shelling and bombing i took my children and went to the catholic convent to hide there we met a lot of people both christians and muslims the children were afraid and cried because of the sounds they heard there was no food or water anymore so we were obliged to bring what we had in our houses the israeli soldiers told the boys and men to visit a specific place if they wanted to get permission to be in the streets but the israelis were lying when the men went to the place they all were taken to prison the israeli airplanes shelled most of the houses the snipers killed many boys men women and children even dogs and cats in the street
1052436 after a few days my brother who lived in bethlehem came to al ramlah to take me and my sons with him my husband didnt come but he followed us after that many families in al ramlah left their houses and went to other places some of them went to nablus bethlehem hebron jordan and even some immigrated to america the jews took a lot of gold and jewelry from the women they sold it and bought weapons with the money after they won they were happy they drank wine and whiskey threw the bottles in the air and broke them on the streets
1052437 i was with my son who is my dad now going to the market to buy some vegetables and fruits while we were walking we saw airplanes in the sky at first we thought that they were jordanian a car came and a man shouted from the window at the people and urged them to go home because these airplanes are israeli and would shell the area we all went quickly to our houses i held my son under my arms and ran home they kept shelling every night then the israelis soldiers entered bethlehem they used to walk in the streets without any fear they felt safe and secure we looked at them from the windows without making noise so as not to be seen the war ended after only six days
1052438 on the morning of 5 june 1967 while we sat at home we heard bombing and shelling we went quickly to a nearby cave to hide nearly 60 persons were hiding in the cave during the nights nothing happened we used to go out and to look at the places that had been shelled in the early morning at one point we saw many israeli airplanes initially we thought that they belonged to iraq and that there is still war out there but unfortunately the war ended in six days and because of that they also call this war the six day war after this war the israelis entered the west bank after many years when the first intifada began in 1987 the israeli government began to require permission for people to come and go between the west bank and inside the israeli boundaries life continued up until now but with more hurt more pain less land unclear dreams and hope
1052439 yes we did go but we were shocked because a jewish family was living in it and this jewish family didnt allow us to go in and visit the house it was all very hurtful and difficult so we cant think about doing something in this place because it is not our choice
1052440 sovereign israeli land imagine that and the israeli prime minister
1052441 the rockets made a loud sound and a small fire they made a lot of smoke
1052442 these soldiers were sent by the israeli government to know if it is true or not true that there really was a rocket they need to be able to report to the news stations that they know what happened
1052443 the first made a fire these rockets today were behind our home without fire
1052444 next time they will make a big rocket and we are dead
1052445 we are worried that this will happen the children are worried
1052446 if the israeli government wants to make peace they will put their hand on this land and they will force the settlers to leave they have stolen these lands this is my land from my father from my grandfather they have been here since 1984 referring to when the bracha settlement was first built we have been here forever

1052450 this village of 5 000 people is essentially being locked down under curfew under a seige as tight as anything that the gaza strip has experienced since last friday
1052451 palestinians have been protesting for weeks now that their land has been taken by the separation barrier
1052452 since last friday 35 people had been injured from rubber bullets and 100 from tear gas fired at the villages directly into their houses and the local medical centre has been running out of supplies
1052453 the soldiers have been coming for days claiming that they want to let bulldozers do their work what do they expect the palestinian people to do they have the legitimate right to defend themselves and their land
1052454 israel should stop hiding behind what they call security what they are doing is ghettoising the palestinian people separating the people and their land
1052455 casualties and other patients were prevented from leaving the village for treatment
1052456 the case of nilin is a unique case of resistance
1052457 the people go to protect their land at every minute of the day and its something the israelis dont want they dont want this kind of resistance to spread to other villages
1052458 we should restore our position in cuba and other countries

1052471 it is unbelievable and unacceptable that we gazan residents have to continue to live in this dangerous situation neither our arab dignity nor standard moral and ethics can justify a situation where more than 215 medical patients have died the life are lost caused by the israeli led international blockade of our borders

1052540 i havent seen the letter i havent got any comment
1052541 i am still committed to the raiders however i am appealing the process of these events in the hope that i can be back on the field in the lime green as soon as possible if the club allows it
1052542 beating st george isnt necessarily going to assure us of a semi final and losing wont mean we wont but at the end of the day if we lose it just puts us under the pump
1052543 i imagine he only used that description of rugby league because it was a national description and thus a very common term
1052544 by and large we can judge the feds the ecbs and the bank of englands intervention as a success from a liquidity standpoint and bnp paribas continued function is proof of that
1052545 the fed and the ecb used existing tools and when needed devised new tools such as the term auction facility to keep markets functioning the pervasive fear that gripped the markets last year is gone still theres no denying the economic impact of the housing recession it will take about 0 5 0 7 off the eus gdp and about 1 0 1 2 off the u k s gdp in 2008
1052546 how does it differ from your everyday run of the mill profit
1052547 is it some absolute number a matter of return on equity or sales or does it merely depend on who earns it
1052548 we were the unlikeliest lot and that is precisely why god has chosen us
1052549 its kinda like being god except the graphics are better
1052550 it would be perfect to have 15 events over 34 weeks but 15 events over 38 weeks is a pretty good effort
1052551 i imagine he only used that description of rugby league because it was a national description and thus a very common term
1052552 i was detailed by cabinet as per presidential directive cab 45 a 2005 to draft the bill and have since embarked on intensive campaigns to sell the good spirit and intentions of the intended legislation at kgotla meetings through direct contact with the media practitioners in the public and private sector engagements with media practitioners through the forum of the media advisory committee which i chair and several others
1052553 i am pleased to acknowledge that at its meeting on 19th july 2008 misa botswana chapter published a position paper in which they acknowledge that the drafting of the bill was preceded by a consultative process that sought the views of several stakeholders culminating in an agreement on principles that should underpin any law aimed at regulating the mass media in botswana
1052554 we are very clear on our stance on the bill we dont want it it is unfair for the minister to claim that we are in agreement i think what she is trying to do now is to divide the media the bill is draconian the bill undermines freedom of expression
1052555 he told me he had proposed several times but she kept telling him she wanted to give their relationship more time when he asked her again a couple of weeks ago she finally said yes
1052556 as with all unsolved murders this case remains open and subject to review
1052557 this remains a met police investigation officers from the homicide command from the specialist crime directorate led by commander simon foy will today begin the process of further assessment and scrutiny of the available evidence to establish whether there are further potential investigative leads in this case
1052558 to be quite honest and practical i dont think theyll ever find who done it
1052559 i will maintain that i will look anyone in the eye and state i have not killed jill dando
1052560 the portuguese attorney general in his recent statement made it very clear indeed that theres absolutely no evidence of any wrongdoing by kate and gerry in any way shape or form and journalists should bear that in mind when they examine the police files
1052561 a lot of this is historical detail drafted by officers who failed to find madeleine and who quite wrongfully were going down inaccurate lines of supposition and assumption
1052562 earlier on in the week i asked the boys for a special effort for me today and they came through they really did come through
1052563 sometimes these things go the reverse of what you want them to so i was just hoping the player group would be focused
1052564 i didnt want them to go over the top they were cool calm and collected and in the first quarter pav matthew pavlich and luke mcpharlin just unloaded with three goals each and made my day a lot easier
1052565 milestones and last games i havent got the stats on them but they can certainly go either way because of the fact youve got a lot of things to lose and the opposition prey on it
1052566 its a day the fremantle football club will never forget its very important you send off your players in the right manner and we did that today
1052567 it meant the world to me to be able to say goodbye to the fans
1052568 they have been terrific they supported me through thick and thin
1052569 probably retire it for life i would have thought or a week
1052570 i was one of the people that when he hurt his knee for the second time thought that was going to curtail his career
1052571 to see him out there today is an amazing effort of what hes done and how hes gone about it
1052572 i imagine he only used that description of rugby league because it was a national description and thus a very common term
1052573 i guess the rest of this year we have an opportunity to blood a few kids see how they handle first grade
1052574 but thats also difficult because you dont want to throw them into a side thats playing poorly its sort of a catch 22 with how many guys you look to bring in
1052575 unfortunately thats the way it is at the moment theres not a lot we can do about it
1052576 we need to move on as a club and i dont think the players today were thinking oh i wish sonny bill was here
1052577 we prepared as well as we could and i thought the atmosphere was okay pregame in the dressing room but we just fell into the same traps weve done the last couple of weeks and conceded near on 30 points in the first half
1052578 im not sure what emotion im feeling at present i guess disappointment is one of them
1052579 its difficult its a difficult time for the club its a difficult time for me personally and for all the players and fans its difficult
1052580 the three first halves over the last three weeks weve probably conceded 75 80 points you just cant do that and hope to win and missed tackles are through the roof ive really got no answers
1052581 i imagine he only used that description of rugby league because it was a national description and thus a very common term
1052582 it was one we needed to win to give us that break from fourth it was a classic eight point game for us today and weve been building for that
1052583 that was surprising how we started but to fight back and to be able to win the game was pleasing
1052584 it was like we had stage fright as if its a big game and we didnt want to attack the ball
1052585 it was really disappointing obviously we fought our way back by quartertime to be in it at least
1052586 we are sort of a fifth to eighth team at the moment so its whether we can pick that level up or get some personnel back
1052587 theres no point in stumbling into the top four you want to win games of footy and unless we start winning were not going to finish there anyway
1052588 i imagine he only used that description of rugby league because it was a national description and thus a very common term
1052589 our dominance rises our supremacy emerges to be placed on high
1052590 weve been waiting to use it for a while to be honest but theres a few new fellas that obviously needed a bit of work so weve been working on it to make sure everyones up to speed
1052591 that certainly adds a little bit extra to the boys and they enjoyed doing it so we decided right at the start of the week that it would be time to do it
1052592 it was fine towards the end i guess the lungs ran out of puff a wee bit but i got through pretty good i was pretty happy to be back out on the field
1052593 they never got any hot football and some of the tackles that went in forced turnovers and we put the ball at the right end of the paddock
1052594 this keeps us alive in the tri nations and the bledisloe cup
1052595 we dont underestimate the magnitude of that task weve got two away games now
1052596 i imagine he only used that description of rugby league because it was a national description and thus a very common term
1052597 a bit of a reality check might be good for the guys bring us back down to earth
1052598 the work ethic within the group has been great and we prepared well for this game so i think it just reinforces how tough it is to win away from home and i think we need that heading to south africa
1052599 we were confident whether we were over confident i dont know
1052600 we get a couple of days off now hopefully get the niggles bumps and bruises out of the way and i guess get away from footy because its been pretty full on over the last couple of weeks and get a bit of balance going on
1052601 the whole experience wasnt pleasant but the key for us is to make it a piece of growth
1052602 you dont see too many roads without bends in them
1052603 to be honest i think we tend to put our own barriers in front of ourselves that arent necessarily there
1052604 most barriers in this game are self imposed its what you think of it if you think winning away from homes tough then its tough
1052605 i imagine he only used that description of rugby league because it was a national description and thus a very common term
1052606 the bill is a contentious issue so it cannot be treated like any other issue which the minister could come and elaborate btv should have known very well that the media fraternity is contesting the ministers position they should know that they needed to invite the other side so their viewers can get a balanced view
1052607 this is an indication to us that you cannot have a political leader having any role in the control of the media as the bill suggests
1052608 shouldnt we let the minister explain to the nation what the bill is all about
1052609 you know that in the show we sometimes have one on one interviews with our guests so there was nothing really extraordinary about our invitation to the minister
1052610 since its come up so quickly and so close to the coast its not going to be like hurricane dolly where we were watching it for a week
1052611 people need to take it seriously and allow the possibility that it could be a low end hurricane
1052612 storms never do exactly what we expect we always prepare for one level of intensity higher than it is
1052613 we feel that it is consistent with the governments approach that it wants to listen and learn from the experiences of people in this country
1052614 we will continue to work with the energy companies and others to make sure that we provide help including social tariffs for those groups
1052615 protecting those who struggle to heat their homes is an absolute priority for the government
1052616 i had it in my head that i was going down there to have an operation and it is great that i can play again
1052617 they told me that from the off that there could be a possibility that i couldnt play again but everything came back positive after having my neck in a brace for 12 weeks so it was all about the specialist having a look at it and giving me the all clear which he did
1052618 its been frustrating to have to wait so long and i wasnt able to do anything whilst i was in the neck brace and i was literally sitting about watching training and watching the season get away from us
1052619 youre probably looking at next season and because of being off for three months ive lost a lot of weight so its all about getting myself fit now
1052620 were in auckland next week and were playing teams that are all desperate to stay in the eight which is good and a bit of challenger for us
1052621 weve done this enough times now we know what works and what doesnt
1052622 weve got to try and fine tune it so when the big games come around if were in them weve got a game were all confident in
1052623 if youre games not right for the finals thats when you get torn apart and beaten
1052624 i still think theres a long way to go for our attack yet we were a bit rusty
1052625 we can all concede we can do a little better than we did today
1052626 what we do know it the chemistry is there and its just a matter getting the right mix
1052627 darren lockyer is building some confidence and still gets around the park well their forwards get good metres
1052628 justin hodges will be better for the run and karmichael hunt was very good at the back as he always is
1052629 theyve got a lot to look forward to theyre right up there
1052630 i imagine he only used that description of rugby league because it was a national description and thus a very common term

1052638 what is the point in living if i dont have anyone to talk to
1052639 kenji and noi do not speak each others languages so they turn to a fractured english to communicate and pen ek manages to flesh out the difficulties that the situation brings about

1052642 the policy can no longer be blind to the green carbon thats in these natural forests he said
1052643 we need to start factoring in the carbon value of these forests when deciding what to do with them

1052672 one of the most sensible ways to help deal with rising energy costs is to improve the energy efficiency of our homes it has been estimated that householders can save up to 500 a year by bringing their houses up to modern energy efficiency standards
1052673 i would urge people to consider how best they might take advantage of this opportunity to not only help themselves but also others in their community as well as the environment
1052674 a net gain of 10 beds since 2005 this is what the minister has to show after three full years and a 40bn spend in total three in patient beds a year
1052675 this would be laughable if it wasnt for the thousands of patients tragically affected by the ministers ineptitude in health patients on trolleys can blame the ministers abject failure to increase capacity
1052676 there are continual calls for more hospital beds as the solution to the a amp e problems and it seems sometimes to all problems let me state clearly to the house that we have provided more acute hospital beds we are providing more acute hospital beds at present and we will provide more hospital beds in the future
1052677 reassurances must be given from government that they will make the necessary resources available to all hospitals that will allow the highest hygiene standards to be implemented at each ward in each hospital around the country
1052678 whatever the costs you cannot scrimp on resources for cleaning hospitals
1052679 its clear that the police are simply adding cases of people who they think are engaging in activities that are critical of chinese rule
1052680 what the government appears to be doing is to conflate terrorism with criminal acts and other cases of dissent
1052681 i dont think its accurate to say that my comments have nothing to do with race
1052682 heres what i was saying and i think this should be undisputed that i dont come out of central casting when it comes to presidential races for a whole range of reasons im young im new to the national scene my name is barack obama i am african american i was born in hawaii i spent time in indonesia i do not have the typical biography of a presidential candidate what that means is that im sort of unfamiliar and people are still trying to get a fix on who i am where i come from what my values are and so forth in a way that might not be true if i seemed more familiar
1052683 michaels training is going really well and by the time we get back hell be ready to train with the group

1052687 we took five marks inside 50 in the last quarter but we did attack deep and koschitzke and riewoldt took some good marks
1052688 a lot of players stood up and we started getting some reward for effort
1052689 you dont get any more points but youre running out of opportunities to get enough wins on the board and clearly we havent got enough yet so every week is really important

1052704 he had saved his pocket money with the intention of buying a new set of golf clubs while on holiday in america

1052712 dina is still working on the date of the party but its looking like towards the end of the year lindsays new album spirit in the dark is out in november so the wedding could be held around then theyve been keeping the relationship quiet for months and trying to pass each other off as just good friends but theyve decided it isnt a fling its for life so they want to make their romance public
1052713 a couple of years ago i attended a downing street brainstorm on
1052714 how much freedom is there in china there are two competing ways to see it international human rights groups say
1052715 hsbc this morning announced pre tax profits for the first half of the year that will turn out to be more
1052716 i reckon we probably need to bring another player in so we are still looking to add to our squad
1052717 its not about p2p specifically that people should be getting excited
1052718 some unfairly neglected books of the past century that may not survive much longer in this one
1052719 one of those novels that from the standpoint of the official arbiters of culture has very little to recommend it except for its near perfection
1052720 but it is sometimes hard to remember that not very long ago poetry was if nothing else and admittedly sometimes there was nothing else a pleasure to read in an almost physical sensuous way in the rush and the rhythm of its words and there were few poets in the twentieth century more purely pleasurable to read in this regard than conrad aiken who possessed a quality of musicality not only greater than any current poets but greater i think than nearly any of his contemporaries
1052721 steinbeck took the world on its own terms then as he would do if he were alive and writing today
1052722 when a novel succeeds as anna karenina of course does in creating a character that at least begins to approach the unfathomable complexity of an actual flesh and blood human we consider it to be at least in some degree a great work the power of the dog set on a montana ranch some time in the 1920s is a great and greatly neglected work of art because it contains one of the most complex and fully realized if utterly loathsome characters i have ever encountered in a work of fiction
1052723 for xylitol to be successfully used in oral health promotion programmes amongst primary school children an effective means of delivering xylitol must be identified gummy bears would seem to be more ideal than chewing gum
1052724 these results suggest that a xylitol gummy bear snack may be an alternative to xylitol chewing gum for dental caries prevention
1052725 a larger clinical trial is needed to confirm the xylitol results
1052726 a community of gay and lesbian people and family and friends of gay and lesbian people
1052727 to hear the stories of other parents and gay people
1052728 society has moved on from where it once was but there are still lots of areas where gay people feel discriminated against and the church is one of them they feel marginalized because they dont feel comfortable to reveal who they are
1052729 were all to be treated with dignity and respect thats the churchs social justice teaching
1052730 faced additional challenges from the church randall had been attending with the couples daughters
1052731 has just been one more branch of the loving and caring outreach that he virus so desperately needed
1052732 if north american churches do not accept the need for moratoria on same sex blessings and the consecration of gay clergy we are no further forward we continue to be in grave peril
1052733 we are concerned with the continuing patronising attitude of the west towards the rest of the churches
1052734 for people who think that this is going to lead us to disenfranchise any gay or lesbian person they are sadly mistaken
1052735 it sends the wrong message that gays and lesbians are still strangers at the gate
1052736 we are dismayed at the lack of clarity and the resulting confusion of the archbishops approach to human sexuality especially homosexuality
1052737 we are painfully aware that this issue has the potential to rip the fabric of the anglican communion apart and we are distressed that the archbishop should inflame divisions even further
1052738 both affirms the centrality and authority of the scriptures for all christian discourse and sets out the range of views on human sexuality held within the church of ireland
1052739 the bishops letter also encourages an attitude of respect for one another and indicates that the church is in a period of active listening on the issue of human sexuality
1052740 to the established principles within anglicanism of using scripture tradition and reason in coming to agreed understandings
1052741 the church of ireland does not have any provision for the blessing of same sex relationships and it defines marriage as between one man and one woman
1052742 i have communicated with croke park and i have told them the feeling here in cork there is a strong feeling here after last year they the supporters feel that they deserve it this year and i think there should be some appreciation of that on the part of croke park
1052743 with the hope that everyone can give their best in a genuine olympic spirit
1052744 provides the international community a good example of coexistence between people of many different origins while respecting common dignity may once again sport be a pledge of brotherhood and peace among peoples
1052745 there is for me a special significance in signing this pledge and it will give me a peace of mind and heart that i have not experienced since 1968 in 1968 i was a young franciscan priest studying in the graduate school of religious education at catholic university
1052746 since they as well as many other professors and graduate students were signing the protest document i went along and did so also
1052747 in 1975 for personal reasons not related to any doubts or questions about the faith or the church or the religious life i requested and obtained a dispensation from pope paul vi returning me to the lay state later i was married in the church and raised my two children in the faith i have had many conversations with my pastor and with his assistant who is my spiritual director about my days as a franciscan priest and have been active in many of our parishs lay apostolate and ministries
1052748 but i have always regretted having signed the protest document against pope pauls teaching in 1968 and having learned a few years ago that fr faricy had publicly repudiated signing the protest i had wished that i too could repudiate in some official way having signed the protest and so your pledge document offers me an opportunity to correct my mistake and find healing and telling you about all this helps me to feel that my repudiation of the protest is now known and accepted in a kind of semi official sort of way by an authority in the church
1052749 and thank you for reading this thereby humoring an old man who despite everything else knows that he is a priest forever according to the order of melchizedek
1052750 in christs kingdom it is never too late even after forty years to fully embrace the truth all of us make mistakes and all of us sin but he gives us all a chance to be reconciled with him and turn our sorrow into joy
1052751 priests desire to let his repudiation be a public testimony to others
1052752 if the baby is healthy they may want to keep it if it is any way deformed and they would like to give it for adoption surely we would be ready to take it up through mother teresas nuns through jeevan jal through any such agencies
1052753 any attempt against human life has repercussions it cheapens our attitude to life as a whole today we face a culture of death in many ways i think we have to take steps to counteract that rather than promote it any attack on life especially an unborn life will assuredly have harmful consequences i foresee for society
1052754 put the value of life back in first place eluana is a young woman who is alive she is not attached to any machine and this does not involve pulling any plug
1052755 simply not giving her anything to eat or drink and this would be a crime an immense crime
1052756 as a foundation trust local people can become members and even governors of our organisation
1052757 membership is free but it gives people a much greater say than ever before in the way our services are developed and delivered in this area
1052758 our large plus is the individiuality there is no other medium which is capable to access so much up to date information and combine them together in the way our search engine does
1052759 we regard ourselves as an innovative information service provider it is our goal to integrate the search engine as a standard service on the internet sites of all online affine pharmaceutical and dental companies from hotel booking over city maps up to links to technical literature the possibilities are unlimited
1052760 we believe the money should not be sitting idly by and it should be used for gods work
1052761 if we dont need the money in this diocese then we should just give it away
1052762 its clear they votf are trotting out the same tired points they tried to make last year
1052763 according to their logic our cash reserves have increased by 80 million in two years
1052764 the lambeth conference is required to do something rather than live down to the worst expectations of the bishops who stayed away
1052765 we need to negotiate a separation in the communion sooner rather than later to leave the strongest possibility of remaining in some kind of fellowship
1052766 the most unhealthy thing would be to allow the debate to continue for a long time
1052767 we would have only ourselves to blame if more of the provinces go their own way
1052768 the vast majority want to take steps towards restoring communion but a smaller group base the language of communion on feelings what it means to me what can i get from it
1052769 a major question is how we move towards that point the highest degree of fellowship whilst allowing for an orderly separation
1052770 the traditionalists are in the minority and an increasing number in the church of england would side with the american church now
1052771 the people in the pew wonder what all the fuss is about
1052772 my greatest worry about the covenant is wholl still be around to use it
1052773 there have been positive effects in parts of canada the us and england when homosexual people are accepted as gods children and are treated with dignity
1052774 paul was not embarrassed to wear his faith on his sleeve he was not hesitant to invite others to meet christ he was not reticent to let people know what christ had come to mean to him
1052775 people would come in some were disgruntled hurt and angry and they would involve themselves in a series of meetings about the church and the churchs teachings
1052776 it gets the word out you know sometimes people need an invitation its certainly one way of doing it
1052777 we do quite a bit for children and teens but this will be more on trying to strengthen adult faith formation
1052778 for those who have been baptized and perhaps never really learned their faith or immersed themselves in the church we are concerned about deepening their faith
1052779 nothing kept paul from preaching christ not imprisonment shipwreck or any other adversity
1052780 he traveled the known world from corinth to rome to ephesus to thessalonica just as he had turned his life around on the road to damascus he invited others to meet christ he was not always successful but he was undaunted in his mission
1052781 the consulting kit is perfect for anyone who is knowledgeable in a particular area and can use their expertise to help guide others in making better decisions explains jamie opielski director of customer relations bizymoms com

1052788 i teach ballet and once i month i compete in ballroom dancing
1052789 go back to their apostolic ministries and tell the story of the lambeth conference in such a way that makes things happen
1052790 a strong level of support for more coherent co ordinated attempts by the communion where justice and international developmental issues were concerned
1052791 covenanted future has the potential to make us more of a church more of a catholic church in the proper sense a church that is which understands its ministry and service and sacraments as united and interdependent throughout the world
1052792 the global horizon of the church matters because churches without this are always in danger of slowly surrendering to the culture around them and of losing sight of their calling to challenge that culture
1052793 in the months ahead it will be important to invite those absent from lambeth to be involved in these next stages much in the gafcon documents is consonant with much of what we have sought to say and do and we need to look for the best way of building bridges
1052794 we may not have put an end to our problems

1052806 well jake i think youll be happy to hear that our company loves your disc
1052807 henry flemington nj hey chris is there any way to assess how much team usa players know about their opponents are they thinking about the strengths and weaknesses of this or that player from greece spain argentina etc or are they more just trying to play as well as they can chris sheridan theyre more comfortable playing against players they know no question but the scouting staff is filling them in on all individual and team tendencies and the players are paying attention one member of the support staff intentionally sent one of the team usa bigs a scouting tape of an opponents guards just to see if the player was watching the cds the next day the player asked why he got the wrong tape
1052808 when you watch the other teams who are experienced with international ball they initiate their offensive sets about six to eight feet back from the three point line their wing shooters hover a good three to four feet back from the line the us however like good nba players initiate their offense at or a few feet behind the three point line their wings toe it this is especially the case with slash minded players like anthony wade james and bryant in the nba this is fine the wider arc of the 3 point line adds another 6 feet to the space within it giving penetrators more room to operate and generating greater spacing but the international arc is so much shorter when a player penetrates the help defense has three or four fewer feet to cover to collapse on them watching the games at times it does seem amazing how quickly the defenses will jam penetration and attack post players when redd is on the floor he actually sits where the normal three point line is and that does help the spacing and our half court offense deron willams and paul are also adept at making their moves well outside the three point line probably because as point guards they are a little more used to making moves further out using as much floor as they can to create space on their defender hopefully theyll figure that out it would help dwight howard greatly on defense this team ballhawks too damn much all of em a team can support one ballhawk maybe two but when all of the guys are chasing the ball there are too many open shots i still dont think were going to lose but some disciplined team is going to make us pay and keep it close that team will be spain
1052809 the last court case that could delay the arena moves back into state court next month when critics will appeal a lower court ruling dismissing their challenges to the projects environmental impact statement critics who have yet to win in court filed another lawsuit aimed at stopping the arena on friday but with fewer plaintiffs some of the original plaintiffs have settled with ratner and sold their properties to him meanwhile in spite of the continuing credit crisis ratner is moving ahead on two major residential complexes one in lower manhattan and downtown brooklyn an indication he still has ready sources of financing both projects are now under construction the manhattan site at 60 beekman place will rise 76 stories while the brooklyn site at 80 dekalb will rise 36 stories frank gehry the architect for the barclays center is also the architect on the lower manhattan project
1052810 up and coming young coaches with nba potential are an incredibly scarce commodity and nba gms love the idea of offering the expanded responsibility associated with being a d league head coach to an up and coming assistant who might otherwise jump at another opportunity or even cultivate their next assistant head coach from the outside
1052811 oden should be able to do several things right away for one he will eat space in the lane as much as any center in the league even if hes not strictly the biggest his quickness will make up for that he can cover a ton of territory hes also intimidating with that shot blocking ability if he gets off to any start at all teams will fear the blazers key by january second he should help clear up at least part of our rebounding problem third provided hes worked on a low post move during the past year he should give us our best post option since mike dunleavy was forcing rasheed to play down there however i do not expect oden to be playing complete starters minutes coming off of the knee surgery at least not right away nor do i expect him to be at full speed running or cutting nor displaying the phenomenal leaping ability i saw amare stoudemire in summer league when he was coming back from his knee surgery and he looked bad as in i wonder if this guy will ever be effective again bad obviously he is effective again as will oden be but it may take some time most of a season would not surprise me this year is going to be a trial run for greg i anticipate at the end of the season he will say he is somewhat disappointed in his rookie campaign even as the rest of us are saying it wasnt too bad for a guy just entering the league off of microfracture i assume well see flashes of brilliance but sustained production may have to wait in other words 75 80 of greg oden is still going to transform this team but i dont see him getting close to rookie of the year status or anything like that
1052812 through three exhibitions deron williams has been the u s s top point guard even if he hasnt always played the position williams was on the attack the whole game epitomized by one play in the fourth quarter he took out the ball and tried to rush it in as quickly as possible williams practically snatched it back from dwyane wade drove the lane and hit anthony for a layup after fighting one of russias big men for position on defense williams led the u s on the fast break and hit michael redd for a three pointer to make it 70 52 instead of trying for some alley oop dunk williams made the great read in looking back to redd williams also made a nice strip of j r holden following bryants lead of hounding russias top ball handler in the first quarter leading to a chris paul layup and knocked down a three pointer to end the quarter against russias zone the more i watch the u s the more i think their best five might be williams bryant wade anthony and james theyre missing a true big man obviously but as far as explosiveness that lineup would be it
1052813 studies have shown that guys who played in the olympics world championships are not any more likely to be injured the following season although the sample size is pretty small i think it will be interesting to see this year if i were a cleveland fan i wouldnt be that worried about lebron but kidd in dallas is another matter will he be a little more worn down and not bounce back as fast that matters as dependant as dallas will be on kidd to contend
1052814 i feel like im still a teenager because im perpetually in high school
1052815 an ordinance would be promulgated to make provisions for procedure to be followed by the existing municipal taxation tribunal for disposal of its functions it has been decided to amend sections 169 170 and 171 of the dmc act 1957
1052816 section 169 which was first amended in 2003 is being further amended to make provisions for smooth functioning of the municipal taxation tribunal which was constituted in 2007 for hearing appeals against levy or assessment or revision of assessment of any tax under the act after introduction of the unit area method of assessment of property tax
1052817 as no formal provision exist in law regarding the procedure to be followed by the tribunal for its functions which are mainly judicial in nature it is necessary to provide a proper legal back up to the procedure to avoid any legal complications in future
1052818 this is definitely not a traditional game console but more of a peripheral selling appliance
1052819 we do have to remember inflation is at a 16 year high so the rba is not going to be rushed into cutting interest rates
1052820 we think they are more likely to stay on hold at least one more month
1052821 these findings may be used by clinicians and researchers to inform their decisions regarding which forms of complementary medicine to address and research
1052822 are needed to help focus nationwide research priorities on the most widely used forms of complementary medicine to assess their effectiveness in improving survivors quality of life
1052823 in the case of treating the common cold a self limiting illness
1052824 the minimal clinically important benefit may not be as important as the minimal clinically important harm to families and clinicians especially with respect to their evaluation in children
1052825 especially concerning given that current estimates suggest that 41 to 45 of children in canada and the united states use natural health products
1052826 given the growing body of evidence suggesting that ginseng may be an effective upper respiratory tract infection prophylaxis
1052827 spiritual leadership of a global communion should not be reduced to one man appointed by a secular government
1052828 archbishop orombi isnt the first person who has used this language of colonial relics about the canterbury relationship i think its a misunderstanding really it would be fair only if canterbury governed now i dont govern the communion
1052829 we have come to see this as a remnant of british colonialism and it is not serving us well
1052830 i dont govern the anglican communion i preside and i convene and there is a sense in which i have a hand in shaping the agenda
1052831 but given the fact that the programme for this conference was very largely designed by people quite outside the european context and given the fact that some of the things we have been talking about are very much instances of partnership between the developing world and churches here i think the charge of colonialism is a bit of a red herring
1052832 in the bible morality means justice compassion the defence of the needy it means humility realism self questioning repentance and generosity thats quite a lot to be going on with
1052833 day by day it means very little even if theyve heard about it
1052834 in zimbabwe of course it has been used as a major issue in and out of the church
1052835 i think youd find other cases of gay people being attacked not only in africa but throughout the world its not just a local problem but the overwhelming concern of most africans is clean water food employment transparent governance
1052836 its an absolute priority for me certainly in the visits to africa ive made over the last few years we always ask beforehand what outcome we want its not enough for the archbishop to go and be photographed kissing babies
1052837 in sudan lambeth palace the london office of the archbishop helped a bit creating a relationship between the world food programme and a couple of dioceses through church schools for the security of food distribution in burundi we have managed to help put in place a grant from irish aid towards school building there
1052838 in the last couple of years we have been in very regular contact and some of my staff here have been heavily involved in that
1052839 the archbishop of cape town and myself spoke together with the secretary general of the united nations after a conversation with the zimbabwean bishops to understand the seriousness of the situation in that country
1052840 we did try last year with the former bishop of harare to see if there was anything we could do through the world food programme to allow the churches to assist but of course that was the point at which the government of zimbabwe and government supporters wanted absolutely nothing in foreign aid and what a frustrating experience that was
1052841 in south africa the anglican church in electing a new leader skipped a generation and went to a relatively young bishop who has a consistent track record and history with disadvantaged people in soweto and re building the church in south africa and i think with archbishop thabo they got it just right
1052842 there is concern but not panic about that i cannot see the patterns of recruitment by militant islam working the same way in africa as in other parts of the world
1052843 the odd thing is that obama bears a distinct resemblance to the most cherished hero in chick lit history the senator is a modern incarnation of the clever haughty reserved and fastidious mr darcy

1052849 we are excited to bring eight more restaurants and an array of shopping destinations to the residents of eastern henrico county who have been eagerly awaiting the opening of their new lifestyle center

1052856 there will be games that will be enhanced by the wii motion plus as well as games that can only be played with it users will need four if they have four controllers but were going to try to offer it for as little as possible we havent announced the price yet but the cost of making the wii motion plus is not that much so i think we can make it very affordable
1052857 he wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game
1052858 he wanted money to play the game his parents who work as civil servants did not have enough money to give him
1052859 this time bomb has already exploded and the situation could get worse today it is a cab driver but tomorrow it could be a video game shop owner
1052860 what would you suggest to a local entrepreneur like me who lacks connections and financial means to get his clothing label off the ground given the fact that i have managed to create a brand that has been well received by literally thousands of people from all over the world i know my label is unique and hundreds of other people seem to think so too they like the name the logo and the concept and guess what i have not even launched a collection yet how many other cash strapped clothing startup can do the same it is few and far between to create a good brand is by no means an easy feat mine has the potential to be a cult brand in the likes of apple computer and harley davidson if only there are people who have the foresight to see the huge potential of my label yes i know the usual way is to write a business plan and source for investments i do not know how to write a professional one yet but even if i do get one done most likely the investors would want me to assemble a management team to complement each others strengths and weaknesses the problem is that my limited network puts me at a disadvantage to find the relevant people who would want to join me the other option is to hire employees but then i need money to do that it is a chicken and egg situation i welcome your insightful suggestions

1052876 despite such a clear demonstration of the power of integrating search and offline channels
1052877 surprisingly the strategy has yet to gain widespread adoption unfortunately by failing to integrate their efforts with offline search marketers are essentially ignoring the very channels that drive users to search obviously there is a big disconnect between search marketing strategy and search engine user behavior
1052878 theres no question about the combined power of search and offline channels that is well established
1052879 whats missing from this equation is the right environment to truly push integration forward and fully reap its benefits it is incumbent upon the cmo to break down the silos eliminate the obstacles that plague its progress and create a culture that rewards integrated efforts
1052880 while search marketers are diversifying their digital content portfolios with videos press releases and images to remain competitive in the blended search landscape
1052881 their lack of alignment with user behavior suggests that they are missing the mark again this speaks to the big disconnect between search marketer strategy and search engine user behavior to fully capitalize on their efforts search marketers need to take user behavior into consideration at all times
1052882 companies that operate in competitive environments know that they need to market in order to generate new business but for far too long it has been nearly impossible to accurately measure the return on those investments
1052883 with flexphone plus companies know exactly where each new customer comes from allowing them to focus their limited marketing resources on successful marketing techniques not waste money on things that dont bring results
1052884 a doctor who participated in our beta test discovered that the customer service tips she had taught her staff were not being used
1052885 instead of that continuing unnoticed and uncorrected it became a learning opportunity for that office
1052886 any company that likes to make decisions based on data and not anecdotes or gut feelings will appreciate flexphone plus
1052887 no matter what industry you are in you always want to spend resources wisely have a properly trained staff and see results

1052932 weve been so used to doing this stuff all over the field lets put them in a box and lets play lets have a war and see what happens
1052933 its going to get reinforced reinforced reinforced reinforced reinforced particularly on days when theyre a little tired they had that thing on saturday
1052934 hey wed better go boys and thats what its about
1052935 i think they just want to keep it ingrained in us that we can talk about it and it sounds good this is the right way to play football but if you dont come to practice every day and put work in and do the right things every day its not going to work
1052936 with vincent its the ties there how he would fit into the system and the fact that michigan offered him first
1052937 with brandin he feels comfortable with that staff and feels he can come right in and play linebacker or whatever position they are going to play him theres no guarantees but those are reasons why i think those two will pick michigan
1052938 i went to michigans camp and i think im their number one guy
1052939 if they end up offering both of us at the same time and it is first come first serve then i will probably take it
1052940 but if they give me a week or two then i would probably take that week or two and talk it over with my parents
1052941 i know michigan has come on strong as of late and if i had to guess id say thats where darius is currently leaning
1052942 they always have good defensive backs and i liked guys like charles woodson and desmond howard they always have their players highly drafted and i like the new coaches they seem nice and i definitely plan to take a visit there this fall
1052943 i love their new style of offense they are gonna run under coach rich rodriguez
1052944 its the same offense we run at my high school and they said i could play quarterback there
1052945 coach rodriguez says they need a guy like me to run his offense
1052946 but they are also looking at me for corner or receiver i guess the defensive coordinator wants me for cornerback and the offensive coordinator wants me for quarterback either way theyve got a spot for me
1052947 they michigan want to come see me play they havent seen me play in person theyve just seen my film they are going to see a game and go from there i think in september
1052948 kwame is a player that gives us depth at the center position and we feel that he will have an opportunity to grow within our system
1052949 a sophisticated and creative blog that pokes rambunctious irreverent and most of all sexy fun at the game of poker and everyone who is connected with it
1052950 youve made me so angry i wish i could reach into my screen and just pound your scummy worthless head in
1052951 if you ask me you should just go straight to wicked chops poker instead these guys are awesome
1052952 wicked chops is wickedly funny and wickedly irreverent and posts a lot of photos of wickedly attractive women if that aint poker what is
1052953 dont know the significance of the fact that matt damon is worried about them
1052954 am i not human wanted ahmad haran amp ali kushayb for crimes against humanity
1052955 people usually children go about on christmas eve singing wearing masks or otherwise disguised

1052957 are grantmakers a species of investor building benevolent enterprises that produce a measurable return for society or are they more passive enablers of good seeking mainly to support those who pursue charitable ends by whatever path
1052958 in which alone the free and full development of our personalities is possible
1052959 a long term plan of action designed to achieve a particular goal
1052960 why do you want a permanent staffed foundation why not get active in your lifetime and work with nonprofit leaders to move the needle on the causes you care about develop successor leadership within those organizations create alliances do what you can while alive no permanent staff administering a pile of money will ever have your vision energy and commitment
1052961 im not yet convinced that business wonks armed with strategies and metrics will consistently outperform grantmakers who work opportunistically without a rigid plan constantly adjusting their tactics to a landscape that presents new opportunities and challenges
1052962 the more things change the more they stay the same
1052963 and yet while maureen packs a ray gun and travels from planet to planet in a flying saucer she also plays the reassuring role of post war housewife and mom staying at home to prepare a nice meatloaf while her husband goes off to protect the ship from tentacled aliens lets face it shes a bit of a throwback its easier for us to imagine a world in which solid objects spontaneously shift form than one in which the basic relations of power between men and women are renegotiated
1052964 basic relations of power between men and women are renegotiated
1052965 reminds me of the time my ex foundation boss and i were at harvard for a review of a case study by the business school about the foundations major transformation to a new way of doing business
1052966 are we fully transparent ie do we tell all all the time or just when it suits our purpose
1052967 do we treat our grantees with respect and recognize that they know a whole lot more than any one program officer about the needs of the fields in which they work and the services needed by those they are trying to help
1052968 are we willing to admit we dont know everything and that we cant do it all no matter how best our intentions
1052969 how do we prevent ourselves from becoming so attached to how we do business that we become like that proverbial frog who boils to death because it cant tell the water in the pot is slowly heating
1052970 as far as i notice what passes in philanthropic meetings and holy hurrahs there is very little depth of interest the speakers warm each others skin and lubricate each others tongue and the words flow and the superlatives thicken and the lips quiver and the eyes moisten and an observer new to such scenes would say here was true fire the assembly were all ready to martyred and the effect of such a spirit on the community would be irresistible but they separate and go to the shop to the dance to bed and an hour afterwards they care so little for the matter that on slightest temptation each one would disclaim the meeting yes he went but they were for carrying it too far etc etc the lesson is to know that men are superficially very inflammable but that these fervors do not strike down and reach the action and habit of the man
1052971 the level of giving to diverse communities has remained stagnant at levels far below proportionality
1052972 based on a sample of 1 263 larger foundations figures include only grants awarded to recipient organizations that could be identified as serving specific populations or grants whose descriptions specified a benefit for a specific population
1052973 how can tax exempt institutions that benefit from power inequalities and control great wealth work toward equal opportunity and social economic and political power for those without it
1052974 what kind of an enterprise is mainstream philanthropy that it can be so easily rattled by the notion of social justice
1052975 the challenge in the u s context is to better understand how our values habits of mind institutions and economic and political structures enable poverty to persist in marginalized communities defined by race ethnicity class national origin and other characteristics
1052976 hmm i can either advocate for structural change that will lead to an uncertain outcome and that sounds like it will threaten my comfortable place in society or i could just write another big check to the ballet
1052977 we are where we are in these comfortable comfortable places not by talent alone
1052978 the overwhelming majority of social programs with impact studies do not show a significant change in participants lives a year or two after the program
1052979 why is it that philanthropy has learned so much about metrics and yet has so little by way of measurable success to show for it
1052980 the first things funders need to be accountable for is the quality of the program which theyre funding that requires patience and a use of funds for things like training
1052981 note that it would be absurd for us to call the gas company thank them for their outputs namely the gas they deliver to our houses and then complain that they havent demonstrated to us any outcomes or impacts why is it that we reserve this nonsense for the people who work in the nonprofit sector
1052982 hey my furnace shut down and its freezing in here
1052983 what has been the effect of your mentoring on the childs grades and test scores
1052984 did the child go to college and ultimately serve society by going to work at the gas company
1052985 did the example of the childs success encourage tv rrr denizen of a parallel universe to take up the snackletuner
1052986 can you demonstrate to me that because of your efforts people are now meeting their full potential
1052987 why cant our sector do anything as cool as that
1052988 its been set in july for years and theres really no reason for it to be there necessarily

1052996 i recall brian mentioning that he had a lot of largely instrumental tracks hed accumulated and since in his words he hates writing words i suggested i have a go at writing some words and tunes over a few of them and we see what happens
1052997 when we started this work we started to think we were making something like electronic gospel a music where singing was the central event but whose sonic landscapes were not the type normally associated with that way of singing
1052998 this thought tapped into my long love affair with gospel music which curiously was inadvertently initiated by david and the talking heads
1052999 the live shows will maybe try to draw a line linking this new material with what we did 30 years ago a little bit anyway
1053000 wed like to be in more markets but in order to go out and start buying markets you need to develop some clarity around what youre trying to buy and what its worth i dont see that clarity any time through 2009
1053001 how many crimes have been committed using a legally registered machine gun or other class 3 weap
1053002 i think its funny that people are blaming the justice system rather than the criminals themselves

1053007 a new study at the jet propulsion labs shows that weak gravitational pull of a
1053008 it would exert a gentle gravitational force changing the asteroids velocity by only 0 22 microns per second each day but over a long enough time that could steer it away from the keyhole
1053009 i made a mistake and i know what i did was wrong
1053010 we need leaders who are committed to transformational reform we need a monumental shift and we need it now
1053011 we cant do better at least in our caucus until we dedicate ourselves to a new direction
1053012 and as a first step in this direction i believe it is imperative that bill deweese resign as house majority leader
1053013 was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term
1053014 when sen mccain talks about the failure of politicians in washington to do anything about our energy crisis its important to remember that hes been a part of that failure
1053015 and now after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices the only energy proposal hes really promoting is more offshore drilling a position he recently adopted that has become the centerpiece of his plan and one that will not make a real dent in current gas prices
1053016 willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1053017 a political answer of the sort washington has given us
1053018 we cant simply pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1053019 t boone pickens is right we need a much bolder and much bigger set of solutions
1053020 to replace all the oil we import from the middle east
1053021 sen mccain would not take the steps or achieve the goals that i outlined today like george bush and dick cheney before him he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like george bush and dick cheney hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long
1053022 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1053023 to extend this financing commitment is a tremendous vote of confidence in our company and its business plan
1053024 after a careful examination of this offer against the offer perseus provided last week we believe this new agreement offers immediate access to greater liquidity under more favorable terms
1053025 to assess their reorganization options from a position of greater financial strength
1053026 sen obama has looked at this issue he recognizes that americans are suffering that we have a unique situation with rising gas prices and this is one occasion where we really need to look at this strategically and he made the decision that we do need to tap the strategic petroleum reserve
1053027 there has been a very intentional effort to paint him as somebody outside the mainstream other hes not one of us
1053028 i think the mccain campaign has been scrupulous about not directly saying it but its the subtext of this campaign everybody knows that there are certain kinds of signals as a native of the south i can tell you when you see this charlton heston ad the one thats code for hes uppity he ought to stay in his place everybody gets that who is from a southern background we all understand that when mccain comes out and starts talking about affirmative action im against quotas we get what thats about
1053029 not because it asked the question is barack obama ready for the job thats a very legitimate criticism and i think barack obama made it a little bit worse by his stumbling response later the problem is that mccain mccains strategy has to hinge in my view on one thing how does a republican survive in october and november a huge anti republican vote luckily for the party mccain is a different kind of republican so everything in the campaign ought to build toward that case and when if you get off into the small juvenile stuff about britney spears i think you distract from that
1053030 for someone to discuss retirement and then to come back and change his mind a day later im worried a lot about it im worried about where hes at mentally because these things happen sometimes and they come back up again because maybe they come back and maybe it isnt necessarily for the right reasons so were going to continue to communicate with him and push him out there on the field and get him better
1053031 certainly nothing to dismiss out of hand if you actually take this energy crisis seriously

1053063 there is no question the media is biased in its coverage of obama the funny thing about bias is that it acts like a pair of blinders if you have it you usually cant see it the bias is evident by the fact that almost no one in the media pointed out the obvious about obamas trip he had to go on the trip because he has no experience or accomplishments in foreign relations
1053064 the next policy statement is unlikely to include a signal to financial markets that the fomc is prepared to raise interest rates at the next meeting on september 16

1053068 it takes two to three years to field a new platform and in the best case motorolas been at it for 18 months
1053069 even then there is no guarantee the new platform would be compelling so the pace of recovery will remain the same
1053070 we are hard pressed to imagine a better candidate than dr jha and believe that his appointment is a significant positive catalyst for motorolas shares
1053071 mustaches i know a girl in michigan who does that

1053078 i was pretty impressed that he made it that way without getting hurt
1053079 he let us know that he looked both ways before crossing the road stopped in the middle and then crossed again
1053080 we kept him in the back coloring and kept him pretty occupied until the police showed up
1053081 but i think the greater concern is the distance that this child went and the timeframe that he was not in the day care
1053082 she pugh is a caring woman and i like how she takes the children

1053101 the uk is under no obligation under international law to assist foreign courts and tribunals in assuring that torture evidence is not admitted
1053102 it is hm governments position that evidence held by the uk government that us and moroccan authorities engaged in torture or rendition cannot be obtained
1053103 if it is correct that in the course of an interrogation in which material supplied by the defendant hm government was employed the claimant binyam mohamed was tortured then it is arguable that there is an obligation to disclose material which may assist claimant in establishing before the american military court that he was tortured whether the court should exercise its discretion not to order disclosure can only be determined at a full hearing

1053106 did not press the us to tell them where mohamed was being held after he was transferred from pakistan and in what conditions
1053107 must have known the treatment mohamed was likely to face in pakistan given the history of the pakistan authorities
1053108 did not dispute that mohamed was held incommunicado for three months in pakistan but did not accept the conditions in which he was held there were unlawful
1053109 it now conceded that he was in a location unknown
1053110 refused to say whether mohamed was ever taken to morocco

1053118 i was eating the nuts and asked him if he wanted one he had one but then said his mouth and throat were itchy i gave him a tablet and we called 999 he was panicking and wanted to walk to the ambulance
1053119 we went to the hospital and they did everything they could we are care assistants so we were allowed inside when they tried to save him
1053120 he was booked in and then minutes later he was gone
1053121 there are so many ifs buts and maybes i gave him the nut and i cant forget that
1053122 im supposed to be his mum the one who looks out for him
1053123 he always said you should support the team from where you are from and i know you hear people say it all the time but he really was perfect
1053124 he was an altar boy at church and a friend to all young and old
1053125 he wanted to be cardiothoracic surgeon and that was typical of him always wanting to help others he was perfect his smile would light up a room

1053132 i think it was the least bad choice we had saddam used wmd invaded kuwait and then violated 17 straight un resolutions and the cease fire what other choice did we have in a post 9 11 world
1053133 he himself is reinforcing that this campaign is all about obama
1053134 his ads and his message are all negatives the problem with that is it is driving his own negatives up as well
1053135 as some have stated this election is not mccain versus obama its obama versus himself and john mccain needs to point out the dangers of electing someone who fancies himself a god
1053136 over the past six months have federal authorities altered their working theory of last falls anthrax murders no not much on november 9 last year even before the anthrax outbreaks fifth and final fatality had been recorded the fbi called a press conference to unveil its linguistic and behavioral assessment of the person purportedly responsible it was highly probable bordering on certainty the bureau announced that a single adult male had prepared and mailed all the contaminated letters at issue

1053142 seems to me house republicans should be holding a public event every day in washington from now until the end of the democrats vacation to call attention to nancys anti drilling intransigence and her refusal to hold votes on the issue

1053373 these firms had gone to a lot of trouble to establish really interesting and quite stimulating settings but because in a virtual setting you can see who is in there unlike the internet they knew these spaces were empty of avatars
1053374 commercial firms to date have dipped in and it appears they have dipped out because most of those sites have been shut down
1053375 the actual second life setting is going to require either an adaptation or a new commercial virtual marketplace controlled by commercial parameters that you need for safe and secure business activity to happen on the internet

1053379 customers already pay us to filter the web for them
1053380 if larger service providers dont offer customised service or adopt a set and forget approach wed have a fair amount of business

1053385 in their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of christ who is the image of god
1053386 this site works toward resolving that tension by enabling bible students at all levels to make good informed decisions about which commentaries they should purchase and use by collecting reviews ratings and prices of commentaries scores and ratings alone cannot determine the best choices for an individual pastor or student but we hope this site points them in the right direction
1053387 the main drivers were the financial aspects of reducing air travel and the environmental aspects of reducing carbon emissions which are important
1053388 also theres the improvement in staff time when you take out the extra costs of hanging around airports and going to and from there its the usual videoconferencing drivers
1053389 the department of human services has three lead portfolio agencies which are centrelink medicare and the child support agency
1053390 human services itself is looking at the opportunity to use the capabilities within each agency and across the other agencies which can work more closely this initiative will contribute to that
1053391 procurement and customer service departments right across the board are looking at all sorts of opportunities to get improve their capabilities
1053392 from time to time government departments and agencies may take advantage of contractual arrangements with suppliers that have been negotiated by other departments and agencies if those arrangements meet their business needs
1053393 in the case of centrelinks contract for videoconferencing services medicare australia has engaged the same services under centrelinks existing contract under these piggybacking provisions
1053394 after hearing nothing after about 21 days i went back to the store and was told not to call again until september
1053395 i was happy with this arrangement as i believed it would only be a matter of days before the situation was resolved
1053396 now in only a week and a half my first bill will arrive and i will be paying for a service that ive been unable to use
1053397 i was about to walk away after finding out there was no stock left only to be told by staff that signing up would result in a phone within a matter of days
1053398 in fact i was told i would have my iphone in the next shipment
1053399 im annoyed because i dont know what is going on if they cant deliver a service they should be the ones contacting me
1053400 the exact way weve done ae will suit this process
1053401 thats why were saying its a good springboard for the new gtld process
1053402 when we talk about the new gtld space were different from our competition because we have the versatility to offer a set licence fee for our software
1053403 were a small australian company at the moment but wed like to think we can take on the big guys out of the us in the process and hopefully come out the other side as a leader

1053405 back out itis in my upper torso difficulty breathing and big time burning pain in between the shoulder blades after about 34 hours of trying to tough it out usually it repairs itself i finally went to the emergency room
1053406 we put way too much emphasis on treating disease rather than protecting health in the first place
1053407 people are talking about health care reform but theyre not really talking about health
1053408 many countries have put more emphasis on health promotion than the united states
1053409 typically what theyre talking about is lets invest in screening for early detection of disease thats secondary prevention were not really talking about the things we need to do before we get to the doctors office
1053410 if christians cannot communicate as thinking beings they are reduced to encountering one another only at the shallow level of gossip and small talk hence the perhaps peculiarly modern problem the loneliness of the thinking christian
1053411 no its all personal if youre going to win people to christ you just have to be authentic you have to just reach out to them personally you cant do the rational
1053412 we should restore our position in cuba and other countries
1053413 we agreed on the priority for the direction of cooperation energy mining agriculture transport health care and communications
1053414 it is not a secret that the west is creating a buffer zone around russia involving countries in central europe the caucasus the baltic states and ukraine

1053426 nunca se ha defendido una lengua en nuestro pa s atacando a otras lenguas espa olas intentando aplicar un modelo de uniling smo como el que pretende el pp que a la postre revela una visi n uniformizadora del estado
1053427 lo nico que est en peligro en la comunitat es el valenciano que con 12 a os de gobiernos del psoe y 15 del pp continua marginado y con peligro de desaparici n
1053428 a un pol tico valenciano como gonz lez pons deber a importarle un poco mas nuestra lengua

1053436 he was not deluded ever by utopian fantasy he saw through the delusions of the right and the left and so angered ideologues who thought that old russia could easily be restored or that a new secular man either in the soviet or western style would be anything but old man made even more miserable

1053438 the new dispute process was a gift from heaven for canadas big business groups because it gives them a powerful new weapon for deregulation across the country
1053439 if a business doesnt like a certain environmental or public health measure that curbs their profits they can claim it represents a barrier to trade or investment and have their home province challenge local democracy and decision making through the ait dispute process as an added insult governments can now be punished for simply doing their jobs with fines as high as 5 million

1053442 weve started two wars that arent going particularly well nearly bankrupted the country and left a huge economic mess here at home this is unacceptable and its time that we as good citizens of the country tell the republican party that enough is enough
1053443 i wanted him to be vp in 2004 because despite the fact that he is a republican hes a moderate we have a lot of common ground on the issues and hes always worked to bridge the gap between the two parties hes changed his positions drastically in order to become the republican nominee which is kind of pathetic but thats politics its not like obama isnt doing the same thing although not to the same shameful degree that john has but back to the point john knows that his party is a big mess and hes right to call them out on it
1053444 the gop is a big fucking mess its disgusting we as good americans should rise up and obliterate the republican party from the face of the earth and never let its evil return i will lead this fight i will tear the gop down unless the skin cancer gets me first man if that happens romneys in charge and he will just make it even worse than it already is scary thought no
1053445 my dear children for whom i am again in the pains of childbirth until christ is formed in you

1053453 is not this the kind of fasting i have chosen to loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of the yoke to set the oppressed free and break every yoke is it not to share your food with the hungry and to provide the poor wanderer with shelter when you see the naked to clothe him and not to turn away from your own flesh and blood do away with the yoke of oppression with the pointing finger and malicious talk spend yourselves in behalf of the hungry and satisfy the needs of the oppressed
1053454 then your light will break forth like the dawn and your healing will quickly appear then your righteousness will go before you and the glory of the lord will be your rear guard then you will call and the lord will answer you will cry for help and he will say here am i then your light will rise in the darkness and your night will become like the noonday the lord will guide you always he will satisfy your needs in a sun scorched land and will strengthen your frame you will be like a well watered garden like a spring whose waters never fail

1053456 seek the lord while he may be found call on him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the evil man his thoughts let him turn to the lord and he will have mercy on him and to our god for he will freely pardon

1053466 ha accedido al gobierno de denia arrebat ndole la alcald a al pspv con el apoyo de un concejal tr nsfuga

1053477 se sigue avanzando en el compromiso del equipo de gobierno de dotar de este tipo de infraestructuras educativas tan importantes para la conciliaci n de la vida laboral y familiar de los padres y madres castellonenses una apuesta que permite mejorar la calidad de vida de muchas familias en nuestra ciudad
1053478 a pesar de que la puesta en marcha de este servicio no es directamente una competencia municipal s que hemos agilizado tanto los tr mites como la cesi n de las parcelas para que las empresas adjudicatarias lleven los trabajos lo m s r pidamente posible

1053501 enough religion just buy into the american dream youll get every
1053502 if you love them youll spend a lot of money on them
1053503 it may be that the lord will hear the words sent to ridicule the living god and rebuke him
1053504 deliver us from his hand so that all kingdoms on earth may know that you alone o lord are god
1053505 a voice of one calling in the desert prepare the way for the lord make straight in the wilderness a highway for our god every valley shall be raised up every mountain and hill made low the rough ground shall become level the rugged places a plain and the glory of the lord will be revealed and all mankind together will see it for the mouth of the lord has spoken see the sovereign lord comes with power and his arm rules for him see his reward is with him and his recompense accompanies him

1053507 he gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak even youths grow tired and weary and young men stumble and fall but those who hope in the lord will renew their strength they will soar on wings like eagles they will run and not grow weary they will walk and not be faint
1053508 for in this hope we were saved but hope that is seen is no hope at all who hopes for what he already has but if we hope for what we do not yet have we wait for it patiently
1053509 o lord almighty god of israel enthroned between the cherubim you alone are god over all the kingdoms of the earth you have made heaven and earth give ear o lord and hear open your eyes o lord and see listen to all the words sennacherib has sent to insult the living god it is true o lord that the assyrian kings have laid waste all these peoples and their lands they have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them for they were not gods but only wood and stone fashioned by human hands now o lord our god deliver us from his hand so that all kingdoms on earth may know that you alone o lord are god
1053510 the is what the lord the god of israel says

1053513 your kingdom come your will be done on earth as it is in heaven
1053514 immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine according to his power that is at work within us
1053515 the desert and the parched land will be glad the wilderness will rejoice and blossom they will see the glory of the lord the splendor of our god
1053516 these are the days that remind us why we live here
1053517 strengthen the feeble hands steady the knees that give way say to those with fearful hearts be strong do not fear your god will come he will come to save you
1053518 there will be a highway called the holy road no one rude or rebellious is permitted on this road its for gods people exclusively impossible to get lost on this road not even fools can get lost on it no lions on this road no dangerous wild animals nothing and no one dangerous or threatening only the redeemed will walk on it the people god has ransomed will come back on this road theyll sing as they make their way home to zion unfading halos of joy encircling their heads welcomed home with gifts of joy and gladness as all sorrows and sighs scurry into the night

1053528 es mucho m s preocupante para la comunitat valenciana que sigue liderando el crecimiento anual del desempleo
1053529 el resultado de la crisis de la construcci n residencial
1053530 los valencianos pagamos tambi n las consecuencias de las pol ticas inadecuadas que ha adoptado el presidente de la generalitat francisco camps durante muchos a os
1053531 no haber aplicado adecuadas pol ticas de diversificaci n productiva
1053532 la dependencia excesiva del sector inmobiliario han hecho que la crisis y el desempleo se dejen sentir con m s intensidad en nuestra comunitat
1053533 presente un paquete real de medidas de impacto inmediato para hacer frente a la crisis y a la situaci n del desempleo
1053534 no puede seguir dependiendo de medidas virtuales como las que anuncia el consell
1053535 s lo intentan ocultar la incapacidad de la generalitat para hacer frente a situaciones complicadas como esta
1053536 das ist verfassungsrechtlich abgesichert wird in diesem fall aber durch die privaten ermittlungen bei siemens unterlaufen die auf initiative der us beh rden zustande kamen
1053537 in konzernkreisen bef rchtet man eine strafe in h he von mehr als einer milliarde euro
1053538 es necesario un cambio de modelo productivo hasta ahora basado en la construcci n

1053541 die m glichkeit das gel nde zu verlassen wird durch neugierige erschwert
1053542 v lliger unfug diese diskussion in einen zusammenhang zu bringen mit einer angeblichen inhaltlichen zerrissenheit
1053543 die reformen die wir gemeinsam mit wolfgang clement durchgesetzt haben haben in der spd viele wunden gerissen die werden aber nicht rascher verheilen wenn clement die spd verlassen muss
1053544 diese diskussion ist abgeschlossen und hat mit dem verfahren nichts zu tun
1053545 weite teile unserer mitglieder emp rt da sie als aufruf verstanden wurden in hessen die spitzenkandidatin zur landtagswahl nicht zu w hlen
1053546 viel leidenschaft zu sp ren was die partei jetzt braucht ist augenma
1053547 politische streitkultur und die von der spd mit erfochtene meinungsfreiheit und die solidarit t die unsere partei pr gen d rfen nicht gegeneinander gesetzt werden
1053548 sich diesbez glich verantwortlich zu verhalten muss erwartet werden und ist von existenziellem interesse f r unsere partei
1053549 wir alle kennen auch die verdienste und das ausgepr gte temperament von wolfgang clement
1053550 dass wir alle daf r ffentlich eintreten anstatt diskussionen um details zu richtungsentscheidungen hoch zu reden
1053551 es geht darum dass wir br cken bauen wollen in diesem konflikt ich weise aber auch darauf hin dass diese br cken von beiden seiten betreten werden m ssen
1053552 ich werde mich nicht auf irgendwelche vergleichsvorschl ge einlassen ich lasse mich nicht festlegen wann wie und wo ich zuk nftig meine meinung u ern werde
1053553 es gibt aber weder f r dieses noch f r n chstes jahr einen grund die prognose zu ndern
1053554 w re das nicht der untergang des abendlands und auch nicht des maschinenbaus
1053555 zwischen dem 1 und 8 august kurz vor den olympischen spielen in peking geplant
1053556 wir haben die sicherheitsvorkehrungen in allen olympischen anlagen und im olympischen dorf verst rkt wir sind gut darauf vorbereitet mit jeder art von bedrohung fertigzuwerden
1053557 tats chlich erlebe ich bei uns in der beratung immer mehr dass der wille bei jungen menschen sehr wohl da ist geld f rs alter zur ckzulegen
1053558 wobei man nat rlich schon sagen muss dass diese 200 euro auf die gesamte sparzeit von vielleicht 30 oder 40 jahren gesehen den kohl nicht wirklich fett machen
1053559 das ist mehr ein symbolischer anreiz f r die jungen leute
1053560 viele junge riester sparer wissen allerdings nicht genau in welches produkt sie ihr geld stecken sollen
1053561 gerade f r junge leute sind aber riester fondsparpl ne besser
1053562 in der regel die eink nfte nicht erkl rt haben
1053563 es l sst sich aber gleichwohl damit eine menge anfangen
1053564 ahhhh se eu tivesse essa oportunidade que voc est tendo eu ia me acabar de tanto aproveitar meu tempo livre
1053565 assim muito prov vel que cada um dos ap stolos tivesse um grupo pr prio de seguidores afinal apesar de falarem em nome de jesus eram eles que entravam em contato direto com as pessoas comuns davam conselhos pregavam supostamente operavam milagres e obviamente faziam isso a seu modo quem ouvia pedro tinha uma vis o diferente da dos seguidores de jo o ou tom sobre os ensinamentos de cristo mais tarde essas peregrina es individuais serviriam como a semente que germinaria diversos cristianismos diferentes nos s culos 1 e 2 d c isso mesmo que voc leu diversos cristianismos antes por m a nova religi o precisaria assistir a seu epis dio mais emblem tico
1053566 em 26 p ginas o documento narra os epis dios ocorridos durante a semana que antecede a p scoa judaica no ano de 33 d
1053567 come aram a blasfemar contra jesus em seus cora es
1053568 se afaste dos outros e eu lhe contarei os mist rios do reino voc pode entend los mas vai sofrer por isso
1053569 se enquanto jesus estava vivo cada disc pulo j contava a hist ria ao seu modo depois da crucifica o as vers es se multiplicaram
1053570 a maior import ncia na descoberta desse novo manuscrito comprovar a exist ncia de uma diversidade de opini es no cristianismo primitivo
1053571 o evangelho de judas foi redigido em alguma comunidade gn stica um desses galhos do cristianismo primitivo
1053572 eles diziam que o mundo foi criado por um outro deus mau e que o corpo material era uma pris o do esp rito
1053573 esse evangelho mostra um modo completamente diferente de entender deus o mundo cristo a salva o e a exist ncia humana
1053574 a d vida que fica como um grupo de gn sticos concluiu que o suposto vil o o verdadeiro mocinho da hist ria
1053575 tombando para a frente arrebentou se pelo meio e todas as entranhas se derramaram
1053576 as vers es da morte de judas narradas na b blia s o inconcili veis mas s o os nicos relatos que temos
1053577 mas se judas foi culpado pela trai o e morreu t o cedo como reuniu seguidores para escreverem seu evangelho
1053578 quem escreveu o texto de judas pensava que ele era um disc pulo muito importante
1053579 acreditava que alguns ensinamentos especiais foram transmitidos por cristo a judas e apenas a ele
1053580 no 1 s culo do cristianismo o excesso de vers es para as palavras de jesus n o era um problema
1053581 4 ventos e 4 dire es norte sul leste e oeste
1053582 claro a hist ria relatada no evangelho tamb m foi levada em conta
1053583 os gn sticos diziam que a salva o vinha pelo autoconhecimento assim acreditavam que n o precisavam freq entar cultos e igrejas ou ter um padre como intermedi rio tamb m afirmavam que a morte de cristo na cruz serviu para libert lo da pris o que era seu corpo mas seu sofrimento n o poderia salvar os homens que aderissem igreja cat lica
1053584 ao fazer suas escolhas irineu selou o destino de judas
1053585 pedro chefe da igreja em roma tinha de ser o her i a igreja elegeu judas como vil o j que um dos 12 deveria trair
1053586 judas serve como exemplo para amedrontar os crist os que n o seguirem o evangelho
1053587 o cristianismo precisa desses arqu tipos destru los mexer nas bases que o sustentam
1053588 a igreja nunca vai aceitar a vers o que absolve judas da trai o na vis o dela o pecado de judas existiu e se deve ao mau uso de sua liberdade afinal ele tinha livre arb trio para escolher n o entregar cristo n o foi um ato inevit vel nem um fatalismo
1053589 judas somos todos n s quando tra mos o projeto do evangelho o recado claro na d vida melhor n o trair

1053592 i suppose he wont find it so strange to find a society that has gone through 40 years of dictatorship and that has been governed for nearly two decades by the same group that accumulated wealth under the shadow of tyranny to not have moved its economy towards something more equitable but instead seeing the divide has grown it is natural for the wealthy to see their status as something as an obtained right i dont think he would be surprised to see the business class having opted for speculation instead of investment and its preference for triangulation commerce instead of the industrialization of raw materials for example
1053593 hopefully he is seriously interested in our case and that he can give us a hand to organize things in the country not only because the guy understands things but because the influence he has amongst the progressives that flutter around fernando armindo lugo the only thing that i hope for is that when the guy tells them the reality that the criticisms are against certain global power structures and not against capitalism itself and that in the end a free market economy is the solution that the crows that only knew him stiglitz by name by seeing him in rebeli n an alternative website that they dont become frightened saying that the guy sold out to the system

1053641 i explained i was with the state press but the secret service man said that didnt matter and that i would have to go
1053642 i would first express regret that your reporter was moved and i can tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt that race had nothing to do with it

1053649 de eerste dag was ik moe van de jetlag maar sindsdien voel ik me goed
1053650 uit de tests is gebleken dat ik heel goed tegen de warmte en de vochtigheid kan
1053651 iedereen moet hier constant drinken maar ik heb zelfs al te veel gedronken
1053652 de andere wielrenners waren na de training 2 kg afgevallen maar ik kwam 1 kg bij
1053653 het is wel jammer dat ik alleen ben want zo is de voorbereiding een pak moeilijker
1053654 je moet alleen trainen soms train ik wel mee met de mannen maar dat gaat ook niet altijd
1053655 ik voel me goed ik ben blij dat ik zo ver ben geraakt en kijk ernaar uit om op 17 augustus aan de start van de marathon te staan
1053656 ik weet dat ik er alles voor gedaan heb dat is de olympische spirit ik zal lopen tot mijn benen knakken
1053657 ik sta te popelen om naar china te vliegen ik voel me als een kind met een nieuw speelgoedje
1053658 ik heb weinig mountainbikewedstrijden gereden ik vroeg me dan ook af of mijn conditie goed genoeg was
1053659 maar de ronde van het waalse gewest stelde me gerust die werd in heel warm weer gereden
1053660 tot de olympische race zal ik af en toe eens prikkelen om mijn hartslag omhoog te duwen in china is het vooral recuperatie aanpassen aan het weer en de jetlag ik voel me heel goed
1053661 het telt een heuvel zoals er in leuven en omgeving veel van zijn korte snokken afgewisseld met technische afdalingen
1053662 als sven met de hitte wegkan is zeker iets mogelijk in peking we brachten enorm veel tijd door in de klimaatkamer van leuven
1053663 sven vertoonde veel ups en downs elke training was een aanslag op zijn conditie

1053692 oh becky im so glad youre in this afternoon i really need to talk to someone
1053693 im telling you this is the one come on itll only take a few minutes to look at it after supper
1053694 can we make a deal wait dylan stop poking your sister okay im back if this one doesnt work out can we take a break from house hunting
1053695 leftovers and well need to eat fast dad wants us to see another house tonight
1053696 both eyes are on the same side of his head
1053697 thats because he lies on the bottom of the sea hiding in the sand waiting to surprise his prey
1053698 were invited to vadeems and svetas place for dinner we just have to clean it
1053699 youre a good wife to let him drag you out here
1053700 thanks were headed stateside after this he needed one last adventure
1053701 what is the fourth world im only aware of one
1053702 the fourth world refers to the ldc or least developed countries usually within first or third world nations namely the indigenous groups who have been largely obliterated by the country in power currently were working with the russian ministry of indigenous people out of moscow to study their various people groups like the nanaiss of siberia there are over thirty different indigenous groups in russia and the government is starting to realize they need to figure out ways to help preserve them rather than assimilate them
1053703 its not unlike what we did to our first americans in canada making them speak english sending their children to boarding schools obliterating their culture
1053704 i cant finish these are you sure you wont have one
1053705 spotted them in a kiosk in simferopol bought all eight cans
1053706 im with a group of other researchers taking a few days off before we head to an international conference in kazakhstan
1053707 i came over to invite chase to join us in a game of volleyball at our camp tomorrow
1053708 i would have to say that one of the largest areas of difference comes in the realm where threats to
1053709 obviously the economy is a question mark for everybody but sports doesnt have much a of dvr issue around it people want to watch it as soon as they can not later olympics is still a safe harbor for ad dollars as are most sports
1053710 maybe its just that im being driven through enemy territory feeling the creaking of this truck as it carries priceless gold
1053711 yes there is danger but perhaps the sensation is due to something more
1053712 what do you mean all that im worried about isnt enough is there more danger i should know about
1053713 people have always felt small in comparison to the great universe
1053714 they made up legends and myths to make sense of the world the greeks with their myths the jews with their stories about god the aztec nations paid a lot of attention to omens if the moon was red before a battle they believed the blood of their enemies would flow they looked for signs of danger ahead and worried their actions would be displeasing to the gods i imagine when they saw this gold they felt the same as we do
1053715 i can imagine them shuddering with each step wondering if they were making the right moves
1053716 and if theyd be struck down with lightning if they werent
1053717 but if i did then surely the fact that we outsmarted our enemy is a good sign
1053718 if we are caught the only reason will be our foolish haste i cant believe you didnt think ahead have a plan for where wed go with the gold once we got it back
1053719 i thought youd at least thank me for saving your life youd be dead you know if it werent for me
1053720 im only one man and my connections only go so far be thankful i was able to figure out which airfield the shipment would leave from the fact that everything fell into place surprised even me
1053721 i see a creek ahead you ready for a rest stop
1053722 yes fine then we need to talk about a plan
1053723 i want to know the whole story i want to know when you met sophie tell me how close you are
1053724 it seems we love the same woman and that is no fault of ours the problem is that i hurt her and im afraid shell never be able to forgive me
1053725 im sure that if youve been with her you know what i did
1053726 you betrayed her you staged your own death you abandoned her and you hoped shed leave spain
1053727 yes i did and now i regret it i would kill you but ive hurt her enough
1053728 im so sorry you got involved in all this i dont even want to think about the things that must be going through your mind
1053729 well i was praying that id get to see you again i guess my dad was better watch what you pray for
1053730 i suppose god is in control its just that at times like this its hard to see how
1053731 i cant go back now sophie fighting with the brigade
1053732 its not as if i ever planned on being here or planned on not being able to leave i thought id done the right thing by volunteering to fight with the international brigades but every time i try i fail i didnt sign up for this and now now id just rather be on the first ship out of here
1053733 youre right you came to spain for one thing and got another
1053734 more than you imagined im sure yet i think theres a reason youre here philip why our paths crossed near madrid i need you
1053735 walt needs you too even though he might not act like it
1053736 maybe god knew our hearts and how tender they would be for the people here
1053737 its an honor if you think of it to be trusted with so much it kind of reminds me of how jesus mother must have felt overwhelmed with the responsibility of such treasure given to her yet in a way thankful that god would put her in his plan not that this gold can in any way be compared with gods son or our cause as worthy as his but you know what i mean i dont think its any accident that we ended up in spain or that we are now in control of this treasure
1053738 i see i should accept everything thats happened and be grateful
1053739 just accept it as gods will im still getting used to the idea but youve had a lot more time to think about it
1053740 i went back because walt asked me to he told me that finding the gold could help the people of spain i didnt realize how long it would take more than that i never expected to see you at the train station never expected you to see michael and me together i never wanted to hurt you like that
1053741 i have thought a lot about it the gold that is
1053742 and i think that its worth it if my actions can make a difference for the people of spain it will be worth all the hardship i have to face but i never intended to hurt you
1053743 we dont know how long it will take michael and his friends to figure out theyve been duped the farther we can get from the airfield the better
1053744 not exactly but i believe were heading in the right direction this back road is working for now it has little traffic and plenty of tree cover to hide us from the sky
1053745 do you think theyll send out a plane to find us
1053746 im sure theyll use whatever resources they have its not like theyll just shrug their shoulders and let us get away with this
1053747 im not sure how quickly they can pull together people to search for us our advantage is that michael trusts very few people
1053748 everyone who did michaels bidding did so by his trickery even the men who drove the trucks carrying the stolen gold knew nothing of the cargo they were paid off and are living handsomely somewhere far away from the front lines
1053749 well its not the most direct route but its taking us away from the seat of nationalist control and toward our best option i think our best chance is to try to make it to barcelona i have good contacts there i know we can get the gold out through their ports but in any town closer im uncertain what type of help we can get
1053750 how was your christmas the parts you didnt tell me about on e mail
1053751 the usual too many family parties mom and nai nai made way too much food two of my brothers fought over the remote like they were ten years old my dad and oldest brother bailed to go back to work early and oh nai nai wanted to know at least twice a day why i didnt have a boyfriend
1053752 the typical chang holiday what about you did scotland improve after the first couple of days
1053753 and i dont just mean rainy freezing i mean sleet and icicles freezing the first time i wore my high heeled louboutin boots i nearly broke my ankle as it was i landed flat on my butt in the middle of the royal mile totally embarrassing
1053754 this big broad avenue that goes through the old part of edinburgh toward the queens castle good shopping restaurants tourists ice
1053755 dad was away a lot at the locations for this movie sometimes i went with him and sometimes i hung out with this really adorable guy who was supposed to be somebodys production assistant but who wound up being my guide the whole time
1053756 i just walked in myself a few minutes ago you probably passed the limo leaving but if what you really want to know is whether the webcam incident is over and done with i dont know yet
1053757 i never prayed so hard in my life especially during finals week remember when those two idiots seriously thought they could force me into that storage closet and get away with it
1053758 before we left i heard the short one was going to be on crutches for six weeks
1053759 maybe it should be what doesnt kill you makes your relationship with god stronger
1053760 that ill agree with do you know if carlys here yet
1053761 her dad was driving her up in time for supper so she should be calling any second
1053762 dad had to go straighten out some computer chip thing in singapore so antony and i got shipped off to veracruz it was great to see my mom and the grandparents but you know
1053763 i always kind of hoped my mom and dad would figure it out you know and get back together but it looks like thats not going to happen
1053764 so do you have something going with this scottish guy
1053765 i could just sit there and listen to him talk all day in fact i did what he doesnt know about murders and wars and edinburgh castle and lord this and earl that would probably fit in my lip gloss tube
1053766 can you imagine walking through a castle with your own private tour guide especially if hes cute it doesnt get better than that
1053767 i like history i like knowing what happened where and who it happened to and what they were wearing not that ive ever been anywhere very much except texas and mexico
1053768 he knows all about what happened to whom but the worst was having to go for tea at some freezing old stone castle that dad was using for a set i thought id lose my toes from frostbite
1053769 very forty degrees tops he said he had a daughter about our age but i never met her she heard we were coming and took off on her horse
1053770 alasdair knew the family he said lady lindsay does what she wants and clearly she didnt want to meet us not that i cared i was too busy having hypothermia ive never been so glad to see the inside of a hotel room in my life id have put my feet in my mug of tea if i could have
1053771 well cold or not i still think its cool that you met an earl
1053772 filming starts in february so dad wont be around much but moms big charity gig for the babies of somalia went off just before christmas and was a huge success so shell be around a bit more
1053773 yes i met her she apologized for flaking on me for the benefactors day ball not that i blame her it all turned out okay in the end
1053774 love the salmon pink paper but school hasnt officially started yet we probably wont get a very good turnout if the first ones tonight
1053775 but even if its just the three of us i cant think of a better way to start off the term can you
1053776 im dying to see him i hear he spent christmas skiing at their place in vail with his sisters and his new girlfriend no parents
1053777 to see all his friends of course i guess thats why you havent seen him
1053778 i love your outfit lissa im sure callum would too that is if he were still speaking to you
1053779 you mean you havent told him yet that you made that video
1053780 that could change why dont you come and sit with us
1053781 were much more fun we dont sing hymns and save souls
1053782 come on lucas hold our table for us while brett and i get our food i want to talk to you about something anyway
1053783 im gillian chang why dont the newbies introduce themselves and then well get started
1053784 if it is my mission to go in at exits and come out at entrances so be it
1053785 olivia layton from the national antiquities society is here to see you dr plate
1053786 im dr sanderson plate chief curator well meet in here
1053787 what did my office tell you about the purpose of my visit
1053788 you question the authenticity of our most recent acquisition evidently the society esteems your opinion more than that of our conservators
1053789 i agreed to your examination of the piece to silence any doubts i am confident your suspicion will prove unfounded
1053790 as soon as you sign this affidavit assuming responsibility for any damage caused by your testing
1053791 may we get started now i dont wish to take up any more of your time than necessary
1053792 if you dont mind my saying so you seem young for such a level of expertise
1053793 i need to see what caused the security breach once i leave you will be locked in here until i return or unless the fire alarm sounds and releases the door automatically is that acceptable to you
1053794 just following policy if you cant trust a representative of the national antiquities society whom can you trust
1053795 very good allow me to escort you to the door
1053796 you almost made me spill my cappuccino wheres the fire did you get caught or something
1053797 the operation went smooth as glass but i can tell you right now that they need a surveillance camera in that workroom of theirs
1053798 great timing on the alarm by the way hope you got a few ideas for security measures while everyone scurried around
1053799 tall dark and intense musta been hangin around again and he missed you what a hoot
1053800 im soooo glad ten years of east coast havent messed with your west texas sense of humor i needed your perspective
1053801 id better change for phase ii the museum director expects me in less than half an hour
1053802 i never get used to the way you do that take off this put on that and here you are no trace of the woman who just robbed a museum
1053803 better get this back where it belongs do you have the contract
1053804 this isnt my favorite part of the operation you know
1053805 best go back in as myself do you think that grumpy guard will notice hes admitted me before
1053806 thats the least of your problems girlfriend what are you gonna say if agent pacino stops you on the way back in
1053807 yeah but doesnt he just remind you so much of al in serpico
1053808 mr clean cut gentlemans quarterly and a seventies hippie cop hardly
1053809 thats window dressing its in the eyes des they could x ray lead
1053810 the x ray eyes must have malfunctioned this afternoon i got clean away right under his nose
1053811 this is edgar graham our security manager and dr plate youve met gentlemen this is desiree jacobs of hj securities company
1053812 please allow me a moment im reviewing the contract once more
1053813 we were introduced under rather odd circumstances i would be surprised if you knew me as you see me now
1053814 you have a sharp eye ive fooled my best friend a time or two
1053815 but the painting was on the table when you left
1053816 a copy made in the nineteenth century worth a few hundred dollars on the open market
1053817 you were informed several weeks ago that the board had authorized hiring a security consultant i challenged hj securities to prove that our museum needs them we signed a provisional agreement pending the outcome of todays contrived heist i was aware of every detail in advance
1053818 i was surprised that you proposed such a simple plan and that it worked
1053819 master criminals dropping from skylights and slipping through laser detectors are the exceptions in the art theft world low tech heists such as what happened today are far more common the patrons streaming through your doors as well as people who appear to be on legitimate business are potential threats but thats not the worst employees are the most frequent culprits and the most difficult threat to guard against
1053820 yes i know that suspecting your coworkers is a bitter pill to swallow hj securities helps museums and private collectors develop methods to protect against all types of theft as well as establish fire and disaster plans were not here to cost anyone their jobs but to enhance their ability to do them
1053821 you mentioned disaster plans does that mean you can help me update that pesky plan that never seems to get off my desk
1053822 in fact i have a sample manual in my case ill give it to you before i leave today you can study the material and our firms experts will work with you to fit the specifics to boston publics needs
1053823 i assume youre referring to the nonsense that got started when a federal agent began making careless and unfounded inquiries i assure you ms taylor our firm has filed a protest with the mans superiors this is a prime example of overzealous investigation harming a legitimate business
1053824 good then lets execute that contract everyone at boston public will feel much safer when we have a tight rein on security
1053825 im sorry to bring bad news but i thought it should come from me since i took the call
1053826 oh its his health then the doctor warned him his heart could be a problem
1053827 miss jacobs your father was murdered in his hotel room in italy im sorry but hes dead
1053828 when i saw you i thought you had somehow managed to capture the sunlight and shine it through your eyes
1053829 i could hardly believe it when mother and father showed me the letter
1053830 slow down you spoke so fast i only caught half of what you said now what letter did you receive and who sent it who is here
1053831 do forgive me i told you how excited i was
1053832 yes that much i gathered will i ever get to hear who is visiting or is that going to remain a surprise until i meet him
1053833 his name is madison scott and he is visiting from massachusetts there are reports that the war is spreading and he wanted to spend some time with us before things get too bad
1053834 so your cousin is visiting is he somehow connected to the boston assembly or to some influential person
1053835 he is not a councilman no but he does wield a certain amount of influence among the soldiers in his regiment
1053836 he managed to get enough time away from his regiment to travel this far south he must be more than a common soldier
1053837 he is the eldest son of my uncle after spending several years serving in england in his majestys royal army and risking his life for his commanding officer during an attack by the french he returned to boston and has recently attained the appointment of major
1053838 are you singing my praises again chelcy i must confess the stories you tell make my accomplishments sound larger than life
1053839 madison scott milady might i have the pleasure of an introduction
1053840 oh madison cease with your frivolous social graces this is elanna hanssen my best friend
1053841 one must always adhere to the social customs in order to guarantee a good first impression
1053842 i would say major scott that your observation is correct regardless of the circumstances when in mixed company one must always adhere to the social rules that govern polite society
1053843 and i gather that your family has raised you according to those same customs
1053844 indeed after all papa is a member of the assembly and mama is quite influential with the wives of the assembly members
1053845 it appears new castle benefits greatly from the contributions of your family from what my dear cousin tells me it will not be long before these counties break off to become a colony in their own right
1053846 but of course do you doubt my interest in local politics you reside in a town that is situated close enough to philadelphia to be a significant source of information
1053847 from what papa has told us at home many members of the assembly wish to separate these counties from pennsylvania so we can fully govern ourselves without their interference
1053848 my family owns a farm a few miles southwest of town along the christina river
1053849 perhaps i shall be able to call upon you there someday
1053850 if you two insist upon this formal address i believe i will return home and leave you both here to determine who will win the social skirmish
1053851 will you be attending the town meeting with your father next week
1053852 yes of course with edric learning whats necessary to take his position come his eighteenth birthday i would sooner miss my own birthday celebration than the opening of the assembly
1053853 is it any wonder why i find you a pure delight
1053854 just think how utterly dull your life would be without me in it
1053855 perish the thought i refuse to even think of such misery
1053856 and you accuse both miss hanssen and me of frivolous speech
1053857 i do believe that is my cue to withdraw from this fine company
1053858 my dear cousin has a reputation with the ladies i fear from your expression that you have already succumbed to his charm promise me you will keep your wits about you
1053859 i assure you that my wits will remain firmly intact your cousin has done nothing more than behave as any gentleman would
1053860 be that as it may you have no need to be bothered about me i vow to remain in clear view of passersby edric and papa and my three uncles would lock me in my room and teach your cousin a lesson with their fists should i do anything to cause tongues to wag
1053861 very well i shall leave you alone together as long as you promise to tell me all that transpired when you come to town again for the meeting next week
1053862 i would like to know more about your life as a soldier i have overheard bits of conversation between papa and several assembly members that have piqued my interest but they tell me their affairs are not for a young ladys ears
1053863 i do not wish to pry but i am fascinated by what little i do hear and long to know more
1053864 tell me first how much you already know about the recent events in the north
1053865 do forgive me i must apologize for causing you discomfort please share with me what you know and i will endeavor to supply the necessary facts to satisfy your curiosity
1053866 over the past two years papa has often shared details of reports made to the assembly of the developments in the ohio valley and as far north as the st lawrence valley i understand the dispute over who owns the land beyond the mountains that has led to the war with the french but i am unclear about how all of these recent events interconnect
1053867 basically both the french and the english claim all the lands from the alleghenies west to the mississippi river while the area along the st lawrence river has also been under dispute the ohio valley has recently become the main focus of this conflict
1053868 papa says the ohio territory is beautiful from his description i can almost see it majestic rolling hills and valleys with glimmering crystal streams how the rising and setting sun casts color and shadow across the landscape and all of it stretching as far as the eye can see
1053869 the problem is that the french claim they discovered this land while we english claim it is ours by charter and by our alliance with the iroquois
1053870 if this land is as valuable as it is beautiful any man would be foolish not to want it for his own
1053871 this land here west of the delaware river and east of the chesapeake has a beauty all its own i would gladly fight for it if someone challenged me to its ownership
1053872 if the french have their way we english will be confined to this narrow space between the atlantic and the crest of the alleghenies on the other hand if the english have theirs the french will be hemmed within a small portion north of the st lawrence
1053873 why cannot england and france simply come to an accord on this issue
1053874 in my opinion greed is the driving force that blinds them to any compromise
1053875 hostilities have risen to an alarming level the colonies are continuing to wage war against the french but they are suffering more loss than gain
1053876 other than knowing of the disputes we had no inclination here of how critical the situation had become
1053877 not even our trade has been affected as of yet
1053878 colonel washingtons journal published in the maryland gazette where he shared the details of his encounter with the french near the great meadows was our first indication
1053879 the french commander and nine of his men were killed which led to the colonies rallying in fear of the french threat hopefully we will receive support soon from england
1053880 none of the bloodshed has trickled this far south which is why i wanted to pay a visit to my family here while i still had the opportunity
1053881 forgive me miss hanssen now that england has formally declared war on france i must return to my post in boston
1053882 i have enjoyed every moment of our conversation and i do not wish for things to end here
1053883 i keep one of my journals with me at all times
1053884 and i shall eagerly await the return of your letter in response
1053885 appear to be different than a normal presidential candidate visit
1053886 well the weather is supposed to be good i have the house sounds like pimms oclock er i mean sounds like bbq party
1053887 internal revenue service the worlds most successful mail order business
1053888 if you are truly serious about preparing your child for the future dont teach him to subtract teach him to deduct
1053889 the united states has a system of taxation by confession

1053891 payment cards both credit cards and debit cards are an increasingly common form of payment to merchants for property and services rendered
1053892 some merchants fail to report accurately their gross income including income derived from payment card transactions generally compliance increases significantly for amounts that a third party reports to the irs
1053893 its a weird thing to say to an athlete rocco would sprint after balls 110 percent no matter what the scoreboard said
1053894 thats how he played the game or plays the game were trying to get him to pick situations and understand situations on the scoreboard different things to conserve his bullets for lack of a better word
1053895 es war bei den vorg ngerz gen auch blich dass zun chst nur kurze strecken mit niedriger geschwindigkeit absolviert wurden
1053896 but after the long walk from paris i want to stop and rest before going home mama and henri will want to hear all about our journey and i would like to get some sleep before i start telling our little brother tales of our adventures
1053897 sleep if you want i intend to pay rachels parents a visit before going home i plan to ask their permission to marry her
1053898 is it not a bit late to be making such a request we sail in two weeks and you said you would marry rachel aboard ship yet you barely know her parents they might resent the fact that you failed to step forward with your proposal sooner
1053899 i will ask their forgiveness for the delay of course and i will also encourage them to sail to england with us i fear rachel will refuse to go at the last minute if we leave her mother and father behind
1053900 and she is always jumping to conclusions however she is also a good and faithful daughter were i wearing your shoes louis i would have fears as well
1053901 i will wait for you under that tree it will be cool and shady there
1053902 this is a menorah and can only belong to a jew it proves the people who lived in that house were jews
1053903 two huguenots from this village conspired against the government of france we only found one we must find the other man and the rest of the jews and kill them
1053904 i shall not rest until the deed is done now gather up all the papers and anything else you think i might want later
1053905 but you have such beautiful auburn hair so long and thick and wavy and green eyes we seldom see women who look like you here in benoit
1053906 louis dupre i am afraid he he is not here
1053907 monsieur louis dupre is not here but his older brother is shall i take you to pierre dupre
1053908 i saw you on the street near the bakery earlier
1053909 but when i called out you continued on you should have stopped
1053910 forgive me i was leaving an important meeting and in a hurry to get here i neither saw nor heard you
1053911 gone where by now he would have returned from paris and he promised to meet me here we were to talk to pastor picon about our marriage ceremony on the ship
1053912 dear sweet rachel our louis has gone to be with the lord
1053913 they were searching for two young men suspected of conspiring against the french government i managed to get away before anyone saw me but louis
1053914 what is the matter with me i cannot even cry
1053915 why are you telling me this it is untrue you know it is
1053916 but i am here i will always be here for you
1053917 its always something if its not one thing its another

1053928 you girls return to your seats please and thank you for your help
1053929 its all right beth ive put this off too long as it is and thank you again
1053930 school is dismissed except for abraham isaac mark luke and john reeves
1053931 microsoft has to think about some radical changes within the organisation to not just fix the online business but start innovating in some of the other ones
1053932 microsoft just hasnt come up with anything all that innovative
1053933 its been buying up companies left and right for years but it has not come up with anything internally
1053934 when i was 19 i caught sight of the future and based my career on what i saw i turned out to have been right
1053935 of course in those days we were just goofing around or so we thought
1053936 his legacy has to be as one of the shrewdest businessmen and technologist of the 20th century
1053937 add more than a single unimportant fact to the total of human knowledge
1053938 we must not forget that the explorer is not expected merely to travel from one point to another but that we must expect him also to see and to observe things worth seeing
1053939 so even though this is a pretty weird airplane we all expect it to fly very well
1053940 the program on this will be very similar to any other research and development aircraft
1053941 as we do flight tests we can then have more confidence in what our product is more confidence in what our schedule will be
1053942 thats not really true but the success of the planes flying qualities tells you a lot about whether youll have to do a lot more flight testing or whether you can march through opening up the envelope very quickly
1053943 we know that we have risks that there will need to be tweaks and modifications for it to fly optimally the program will involve operating initially with a relatively small envelope but very soon in the program it will be up to very very high altitudes and later in the program we will be opening up to higher speeds and higher g levels
1053944 so even though this is a pretty weird airplane we all expect it to fly very well
1053945 there are always things that you bookkeep as this is how wed do it the next time around
1053946 weve created quite a laundry list for the production vehicle a lot of times its done to facilitate cost and schedule and isnt required to demonstrate performance of the airplane or to meet mission goals
1053947 so far this plane is looking so good we should be able to put it into service eventually as well as using it for the test program
1053948 we also hope that in the future this vehicle will be developed and certified for conventional payload work within the atmosphere but that will be another story for another day
1053949 we set burt a challenge the challenge of trying to design a system coming out of spaceshipone of producing a launch system for us that could allow thousands of people to fulfill their dream
1053950 but we also quietly asked burt to do something else our vision of whiteknighttwo and his was of a launch system that could be part of a longer term development program a whiteknighttwo with an open architecture which would allow other people to develop other vehicles capable of doing other things
1053951 we also hope that in the future this vehicle will be developed and certified for conventional payload work within the atmosphere but that will be another story for another day
1053952 with our new owner northrop grumman and with the constraints were under its difficult to get things released but were in the process of doing that
1053953 because theres a possibility that the propulsion system would be markedly different and wed be building things that we would have to scrap
1053954 government spaceflight does not have a reputation for safety after 50 years
1053955 if we can create a reputation for safety in the private commercial sector and regularize spaceflight it will be the most important single signal one can send to allow a much greater level of investment in private sector space in the future
1053956 because theres a possibility that the propulsion system would be markedly different and wed be building things that we would have to scrap
1053957 lower rents and livable wages lower rents and livable wages
1053958 down with george pullman down with george pullman and his cruel treatment
1053959 yes i understand but i didnt think the women would ever agree to it
1053960 we cant go on like this the women took a vote this morning and decided theyd support the strike personally i didnt vote to strike but im going to support the majority maybe mr pullman will come to his senses and lower our rent
1053961 im scared well lose our housing but our pleas to mr pullman and the managers have gone unheeded what else can we do i pray this will get their attention and well return to work in a few days
1053962 you dont understand the strike has begun at least a thousand workers have walked out of the car works and more continue to follow i saw them with my own eyes please come
1053963 i hope your fred is not making a mistake with his union participation
1053964 my fred as you call him made his decision to stand with the union long ago i think hes prepared to go to almost any length to help the workers succeed
1053965 have i not aided you in helping the workers through these past months unlike your fred one can lend assistance in a discreet manner
1053966 this chaos is not a good thing i am better suited to the order i require in my kitchen
1053967 each of us is different ive had to accept that fred can no longer hide his union affiliation when the men decided to join the american railway union in march he prayed over his decision just as i prayed over mine last november
1053968 oui but your decision permitted you to remain at my side in the kitchen i fear that if your fred is forced out of pullman he will take you along with him
1053969 i think youre safe awhile longer hes not yet declared his love
1053970 stay and see if you can locate fred and find out exactly what is happening
1053971 i am going back to the kitchen dont be gone too long i may need your help
1053972 isnt this a magnificent sight except for a smattering of unskilled laborers the men at the brickyards and the members of management all of the workers have pledged support
1053973 nearly three thousand of us have walked out more than enough proof to the company that we are serious about our need for higher wages and lower rents
1053974 youve surely met with success has mr pullman arrived to negotiate with you and the other local union delegates
1053975 i dont expect it will go as easily as that but were hopeful hell come and declare his intentions we pray that he will agree to negotiate but i doubt hell do so
1053976 then i shall pray also we need to see an end to the inhumane conditions the workers and their families have been forced to endure
1053977 i must return to the kitchen or chef ren will regret having allowed me to visit with you please say youll come by this evening and tell me all that happens
1053978 our local union is holding meetings this afternoon if all goes well ill see you later
1053979 theres not going to be any violence all union members have taken a pledge
1053980 i can build some pull down stairs into the attic well clean it up and you can have a place to get away once in awhile
1053981 i guess it would be nice to have a space off limits to the kids i could write in my journal and not find it doodled on with gel pens the next time i opened it
1053982 it means a lot that you wanted to do this for me
1053983 wait a minute were going to have a family meeting

1053992 the rhusican is dead she saw it ran into a transport trying to get away i dont think shes one of them
1053993 and you risk bringing her here have you lost what little mind you have why didnt you just leave her
1053994 kieran find out what you can about her i need to clean up just find out ive been wrong before
1053995 no ones batteries can run forever without a recharge take a couple hours and veg out today so you can tackle your tasks tomorrow

1054014 a very cute little girl grabbed my leg and asked where are my parents where are my brothers
1054015 i saw her parents and brothers were on a plane that was set to take off in three minutes
1054016 i ran quickly because i knew that every minute mattered at the same time the police tried to contact the flight attendants to get them to stop the plane when i reached the gate the plane was no longer there
1054017 were in shock theyre very responsible and organized top notch people apparently one relied on the other and this is what happened
1054018 my plea was that the decision is best left to the parents who will take care of the child
1054019 we sought the opinion of many doctors and we were worried about the quality of life the child would have
1054020 schools havent had a con sistent number of years to work on what the state is ex pecting
1054021 as a staff we are certain that things were doing are helping
1054022 teachers can basically tell you by the student what they need to work on
1054023 we just have a very aca demic goal oriented build ing the students performed better because they wanted to
1054024 not all of this has been retained over the years as my path went in other directions but my love of language remains and as latin is known and sung by choirs all over the world i felt it would be appropriate to use at times during the piece
1054025 while i was waiting to do my bit i was looking around the church and i saw a statue and underneath it was written ecce cor meum i had done some latin at school and i always had a fondness for it so i worked it out i believe it means behold my heart
1054026 eventually i made it all come together through correcting a lot of misapprehensions a lot was learned before the sheldonian performance but a lot of it was learned afterwards an experienced choral composer knows that children cant be given huge sustained passages they dont have the energy and the stamina at the sheldonian there was some quite hard stuff that i didnt realise because id done it on the synthesiser which has endless stamina but during that first performance the solo treble couldnt come on for the second half i think id used him up in the first half these are things that people either learn because they are taught them immediately at the first lesson or you learn through the years so it was good to go through the piece a lot of times and we took out huge choral sections and gave them to the orchestra if it had been a beatles song i would have known how to do it but this was a completely different ball game

1054028 we hope that colleagues will have heard from their constituents that something has to be done and done before congress finishes its business this year
1054029 can begin to break the current legislative stalemate on the senate floor
1054030 would bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term
1054031 we would need to see a bill that would increase the supply here in our own country across the board in a comprehensive way
1054032 the fact that theyre uncomfortable means were doing the right thing
1054033 most everybody i run into in the mornings when im coming in they love it theyre happy energetic enthused we just see a difference in the employees attitudes
1054034 we asked them to look towards mondays and fridays to take off but we have some situations where people are taking off tuesdays wednesdays and thursdays
1054035 when im driving in in the morning the traffic is not as bad so thats a really good thing
1054036 even when i come into work at 7 theres not a whole lot of people here and the phones are not just constantly ringing
1054037 a large part of our fuel savings comes from the public works department
1054038 we will realize by the end of the year a direct savings in fuel
1054039 in a place like birmingham where there is no mass transit coming up with a solution to get more cars off the road and less emissions is better for the entire region
1054040 i now have mamas and daddies back in their homes to spend time with their own children
1054041 the more mamas and daddies i can have at home acting like mamas and daddies i dont have to hire a cop
1054042 throughout the world we have abused what god has given us to the point that natures now fighting back we dont get the message that you cant keep taking taking taking until you reach a point where the whole system earth itself is going to rebel against us
1054043 well mrs jones we are very sorry that your son got ate up my the lion but we did get it on film and its going to make for a great show in a couple weeks what sue us sorry mrs jones but you signed a waiver that said we can throw your kid into the lions den all we want and we are not responsible for what happens

1054049 we bottomed out at ninety eight percent the pattern failed to cohere again
1054050 im isolating a resonance cascade at positive t two two six four eight
1054051 well boil the data until weve nailed the source sir
1054052 beats me dr felix sir inspecting the apparatus i suppose
1054053 theres not a damn thing he can tell just by looking at it
1054054 you know dr zoran sir he has his own way
1054055 lets clear the floor drago and give the crew a chance to reset the system
1054056 you must answer a question for me an important question
1054057 you dont breathe through your eyes john close them listen to me
1054058 what colour is the painting on the primary containment tank
1054059 what what does that have to do with anything my boy
1054060 the tank is green of course now can we stop playing this intolerable game
1054061 just go look tell me what you see ill do my waiting here
1054062 so what the tank is orange the same as its always been now do you want to explain to me what all this is about my boy
1054063 uh we spool it out to the archive servers while we encode to keep the array defragged
1054064 hello zoran christina christina yes you see the data dump from this trial
1054065 i want you to look at a frame any frame im not care the uncompressed stream yes
1054066 she says she made a mistake she says the tank is clearly orange she doesnt know why she said green before
1054067 uh dr felix dont take this the wrong way but is dr zoran losing his shit
1054068 mitchell painted the tank green hes showed me the cans cans of only green paint
1054069 theres nothing on the shelf but three cans of orange paint
1054070 that makes sense dr zoran you told me yourself i could paint that thing any colour that suited and there was a special on orange so thats what i bought off jenny at the depot
1054071 how was it that it seemed to you we had green paint my boy
1054072 green green green dragana says green the tank is green
1054073 with all respect dr zoran im the one that did the painting and i painted the whole kit kaboodle orange from the get go like i been saying there wasnt any other colour underneath its never been no other colour but the orange from the depot
1054074 you simply must learn to drive one of these days
1054075 cover your eyes dont look at her dont touch her
1054076 i got overshipped on green i got lots of green if thatll do ya professor
1054077 you still want me to go round back and scare up some of that orange paint
1054078 couldnt be doc sorry i havent got no green right yet but i got a buttload of orange if youre not fussy i got too much matter of fact its on special sold six gallons to your mitch just a few days ago
1054079 what the devil is going on here honestly my boy
1054080 the objective was to create a proper electron from scratch that objective wasnt realized
1054081 three days ago mitchell painted the containment tank green it was green right up until the trial and then it was orange it didnt turn orange it became always orange it was as if it had never even been green
1054082 i dont know how to break it to you drago but it never was green
1054083 i remembered it as green until a moment after i saw it with my own eyes and it was orange my memories it was changed
1054084 how would one know ones memory had been changed what other reference have you
1054085 there was a lag john i remembered it green until i saw it orange and then i remembered it orange you told me yourself it was green until you went to look
1054086 you did and now your memories is changed too christina checked the frame john she said it was green
1054087 no the change caught up with her we interacted with her we propelled it along to her the processed video showed orange but the raw datas showed green until christina interacted with it the further we got from the apparatus the longer the delay before the old reality and new reality reconciled jenny had green paint on the special until she touches me and then some connection to the apparatus is made and suddenly its orange paint on the special you were there john you heard her
1054088 she was just confused flustered by your mania id wager
1054089 youre worrying me drago how could you pretend to know what you remembered before your memories themselves were altered
1054090 dragana she is somehow insulated draganas mind never changed even now looking through her eyes i can see the remembered tank is green
1054091 memory is notoriously unreliable my boy and it should go without saying the memories of an imaginary dead sister living inside your fantasies are geometrically more so
1054092 john you miss it we may not have knitten the electron but our attempt did have an effect and that effect rippled backward in time at a finite pace in less than twenty minutes it changed which colour of paint jenny had too much of and who knows this very moment the change is spreading from there touching the man who flies in her supplies changing his inventory bleeding all the way back to the paint factory
1054093 the moment we call we build a more direct connection between ourselves and them accelerating the change we confirm the new reality the more we are interacting with it
1054094 then our wondrous discovery will remain forever unprovable lost even to those who perform the experiment you have to ask yourself my boy if this effect were to be considered real in any meaningful sense how much reality is there to an effect that leaves no record in the world
1054095 i think things would be better for everyone if you were able to sort some things out ive ive spoken with your mother about it
1054096 i didnt know where else to turn she knows you she loves you were both of the opinion that this obsession over your sister is hindering your career and your life
1054097 id like you to think very seriously about seeing a professional
1054098 this is a day when for the first time mens have touched the fabric of the universe and seen it react this is a day in history
1054099 and yet all your concern is because you think im crazy
1054100 delusional yes disconnected from the world yes obsessive compulsive irrational yes
1054101 why do you work with me if you think im mad john why
1054102 my father he believed in me thats whose boy i am john not yours
1054103 its never something i would force on you but the people who care about you are worried just promise me youll give the matter some thought wont you
1054104 ill do it if it means restoring your confidence john ill do it make your arrangements book me a flying
1054105 when the doctor says i am not crazy you have to believe it and never doubt dragana again are we agreed
1054106 that you were having troubles your john is a very good man drago hes concerned for you he wants nothing more than for you to be well thats what we all want
1054107 youve travelled all the way here from paris just to escort me to the doctors office
1054108 ive met a gentleman drago his name is vassily and he truly does love our family ill tell you just how much hes been working with me to establish a memorial for our dragana
1054109 and a garden its to be built in les bois de boulogne dedicated to victims of cancer vassily has made it his personal mission to make it happen hes made all the arrangements contacted the charities coordinated the funding
1054110 we should go ill tell you the rest when youve finished your appointment
1054111 its already happened drago when the memorial is done well be moving in together at his estate outside petersburg youll visit of course its wonderful
1054112 he understands how to frame an issue to get the desired results its an art and hes a master
1054113 oh he does all sorts of things to win the memorial funding hes taught me how to present myself he says its the story that sells not the person in our story i have had a very tragic life my husband a drunk fool my home destroyed by war my talented daughter taken from me do you understand drago
1054114 the perfect finish of course is that my poor son is in the care of canadian doctors you can see how for the danica in the story this very sad it is just one more thing that hasnt gone according to her prayers
1054115 burdened by the emotional scars suffered when his beloved sister was torn away from their lives
1054116 i think spending some time with the doctors will be very good for you drago and the best part is that it could be very good for our dragana too it completes the story and the timing couldnt be better the committee in paris meets next week to decide it all
1054117 you want you want me to stay with the doctors until next week
1054118 yes drago you will do this for dragana wont you stay on a few extra days allow the doctors to send a letter to paris telling them so
1054119 i understand youre going to be staying with us for a spell
1054120 yes i dont need much the night is sometimes a good time for figuring a thing out when everyone else is quiet
1054121 why dont you tell me a little bit about your work what do you do drago
1054122 arent you a mathematician that sounds like physics to me
1054123 in my field the line between the two is blurry
1054124 it doesnt have a name yet when my work is complete it will have one the world will name it
1054125 to me it is everything to the world i believe it may be too thats why i am so closely watched
1054126 the blue pants people i dont know what theyre called they can control the streetlights
1054127 im a jew drago do you think ive been watching you
1054128 i dont think you watch me your job is to be the doctor im talking about the jews whose job is to steal my science they have long coats long beards curly hairs from their ears they stand on the streetcorners and watch me go by they whisper about me
1054129 no shes too soft to hold anything i do the possessing she has only her thoughts and her feelings
1054130 patterns are independent of medium dr gershwin they are of the information not substance
1054131 fundamental patterns the patterns at the heart of all patterns the weave of the world the geometry of events the kind of counting the universe itself counts with the kind that makes the laws of physics inevitable
1054132 well she is now she never used to be she was a photograph model
1054133 for one thing her sense of privacy is a matter of the past while your own is a matter in the present in the here and now
1054134 youre making her feel funny she wants you to stop asking about that
1054135 no it makes dragana uncomfortable she says the past is the present and if you cant understand that neither us should bother saying another word
1054136 drago are you hearing this right now in your head are you hearing dragana
1054137 youll have to excuse dragana always gives me the hard penis she is very beautiful
1054138 i think i have enough for now drago to put together a preliminary assessment thank you very much
1054139 ill consult with my colleagues to decide how best to work with your issues well start first thing tomorrow in the meantime a nurse will be along to bring you some pajamas and show you to your room
1054140 all you have to do is relax and try to bear in mind that youre going to leave us feeling a lot more settled than when you came in that sounds good doesnt it
1054141 dont let the size of your budget limit the size of your dreams
1054142 we should restore our position in cuba and other countries
1054143 we agreed on the priority for the direction of cooperation energy mining agriculture transport health care and communications
1054144 it is not a secret that the west is creating a buffer zone around russia involving countries in

1054171 the historical record is sparse but snack foods in biblical times were limited to beef jerky and an early form of potato chip
1054172 cheetos didnt come along until sometime after martin luther nailed his theses on the church door in wittenberg germany then opened up a lunch box sized bag of cheetos twisted snacks

1054185 he found company in the characters of books he loved
1054186 something else raised him above the others as well he had an open book on his table no one had ever opened a book in that restaurant before in terezas eyes books were the emblems of secret brotherhood
1054187 the scale of the banks financial prejudice can be explained by the fraudulent manoeuvres of a trader who abused the trust of his hierarchy by taking advantage of its deficiencies and of the faults in the internal control system

1054189 i think were faced with such an enormous problem that we need to do all the research we can to see if there are any geo engineering proposals which work through to the marketplace
1054190 we wont have anything that we can bring into place in 2030 say when suddenly the world is at a crisis point
1054191 they could buy the aircraft and buy the rockets and just start doing some geo engineering off their own island

1054220 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
1054221 this news about bentonite as the additive being a trademark of the iraqi biological weapons program is very significant partly because theres been a lot of pressure on the bush administration inside and out to go after saddam hussein and some are going to be quick to pick up on this as a smoking gun
1054222 there is purely circumstantial though highly suggestive evidence that might seem to link iraq with last falls anthrax terrorism
1054223 there is also tremendous evidence that subsequent anthrax attacks are connected to iraq

1054381 centrica confirms that it is in discussions with a third party with a view to centrica taking a minority ownership position in british energy subject to various conditions including this third party successfully acquiring british energy
1054382 in the event that the third party does not proceed with an offer for british energy or centricas discussions with the third party do not result in an agreement centrica might consider a number of other alternatives with respect to british energy
1054383 these alternatives may include a possible merger of centrica with british energy only if terms could be agreed and if all parties are fully supportive
1054384 thirst aid may not be the first ethical water and we dont claim that were going to be able to solve ethiopias drinking water problems on our own but we do believe that recognition of save the children as the worlds foremost independent childrens charity will be hugely important in attracting consumers and generating funds
1054385 each year an estimated 472 000 ethiopian children under the age of five die 20 of them from diarrhoea which can often be the result of drinking dirty water so this is an initiative that really will save young lives
1054386 save the children will work closely with the communities of sayint on the thirst aid water project
1054387 we want the people of sayint to get involved by contributing local materials and their own labour so the 14 new water systems and 4 new wells can be set up maintained and repaired within the community this way the benefits of healthy drinking water should be felt for generations to come and more childrens lives will be saved
1054388 by that time the child had been trapped in the sand for approximately 20 minutes
1054389 because weve had a lot of rainfall over the last couple of days the sand becomes quite compact and obviously it becomes very dense as well
1054390 i believe the tunnel was a huge tunnel they were able to walk through and it became unsteady and unfortunately collapsed around the young boy
1054391 then the team set about digging out as much we we could to expose the chest so that the paramedic could give heart massage
1054392 while that was going on we were trying to dig the body out and that carried on for about 10 15 minutes
1054393 the family was panicking the friends were panicking there was a lot of screaming and crying
1054394 the young man was some five feet below the surface and although rescue crews had managed to clear the sand from his head and shoulders the youth was compressed under a considerable weight of sand
1054395 although many children and adults may play safely in sand at the sea shore or in sand dunes deep excavations and tunnels are extremely dangerous and should not be attempted
1054396 its just a tragic accident that could have been prevented but unfortunately children dont see danger
1054397 sand is always very unstable and heavy and can collapse at any time
1054398 they are perfectly safe if people dont take unnecessary risks
1054399 every time it begins to dry up another storm comes and it starts all over again

1054418 i dont think the city understands how difficult it is to do a project like this without their support
1054419 if they view their responsibility to work this hard to pull this project rather than helping expedite it then it will never be done

1054430 we are disappointed that we have not yet received a response from iran
1054431 we agreed in the absence of a clear positive response from iran that we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran
1054432 the incentives package contained everything iran needed to pursue a modern civil nuclear power program which irans leaders claim is their aim the pressure on iran to comply with the demands of the international community and its u n security council obligations will only grow

1054444 the only time greensboro gets enough tourists and patrons is when there are tournaments in town
1054445 ed wolverton president and ceo of downtown greensboro inc said theres a need for more hotel rooms downtown he said the center city has more than 900 businesses more than 20 000 workers and nearly 1 000 residential units plus the downtown has the lowest vacancy rate of the six office markets in guilford county including green valley
1054446 right now i envision something along the lines of a grandover
1054447 its going to be a very nice hotel we continue to be moving the project forward
1054448 i think it shows that downtown is continuing to emerge as a business and visitor center as downtown has grown so have the needs of travelers and people wanting to stay downtown

1054452 its just not the best way for us to spend our money
1054453 the crux of the issue is how we encourage people to use less energy and motor manufacturers to produce more efficient cars
1054454 i also believe that it is essential to replace our fleet of nuclear power stations
1054455 one of the biggest threats that our economy and as i said earlier just about every other economy in the world faces is the high price of oil i believe that that should act as an encouragement a spur to us to do more to generate our own electricity and to get our energy from non carbon sources that is important in terms not only of the environment but of security of supply
1054456 we can buy up to 120 percent of what we contracted for in this years budget

1054473 we found that soy food intake was associated with lower sperm count compared to that of men who did not consume any soy foods but no other semen quality parameters motility morphology total ejaculate volume were affected what does it mean we really dont know ours is the third study to evaluate whether intake of soy foods or soy supplementation during adult life has any impact on sperm quality and the results are very inconsistent the first a very small study showed absolutely no relationship the second focused mostly on men who were known to have fertility problems found that those who consumed more soy foods had better se men quality than those who did not and now weve found the exact oppo site you dont have to be a scientist to know that if this is the information you have you really know nothing
1054474 problems with the hypothalamus or the pituitary can affect the normal hormones that drive sperm production estrogens soy contains phytoestrogens and steroids can affect sperm count marijuana may have a similar effect in the testicle itself genetic problems and a number of chemicals can interfere with sperm production mumps can infect the testicles and damage them one of the most common conditions is a varicocele varicose veins around the testicle anything causing heat around the testicle is bad tight underwear can reduce sperm quality very drama tically laptops are an issue if you put them on your lap because they get hot chefs can be exposed to high levels of heat around the groin
1054475 herbalists have a long history of treating low sperm count epimedium multiflorum horny goat weed is another chinese medicine practicitioners noticed their goats were more aggressive and had more kids after eating the plant so they started taking it and found it did the same for them the south american plant ptychopetalum olacoides fertility wood is an endocrine stimulant panax ginseng works as an endocrine stimulant so theres more activity in the pituitary hypothalamus and adrenals and testes foods high in zinc are good also saving yourself if you want to have children dont expend seminal fluid all the time get the mans cycle in sync with the womans
1054476 on average it looks like sperm counts have been declining at least in western countries sperm counts also differ regionally for example in central missouri an agricultural area the men had only half as many moving sperm as men in minneapolis which is a huge difference i found a significant difference in the level of pesticides in the urine of men with good and bad semen quality its known that mothers who smoke have sons with lower sperm counts we found that those whose mothers ate more than one beef meal a day when pregnant had significantly lower sperm counts phthalates which are ubiquitous in our homes lower testosterone in the fetus which later affects the ability to produce sperm things that might help include reducing exposure to pesticides eating organic food drinking properly filtered water avoiding the use of certain chemicals in the home as well as limiting lifestyle factors like alcohol consumption being very overweight or very stressed

1054485 the name of my constituency is haltemprice and howden haltemprice is derived from a medieval proverb meaning noble endeavour up until yesterday i took a view that what we did in the house of commons representing our constituents was a noble endeavour because for centuries of forebears we defended the freedom of people well we did up until yesterday this sunday is the anniversary of magna carta a document that guarantees the fundamental element of british freedom habeas corpus the right not to be imprisoned by the state without charge or reason but yesterday this house allowed the state to lock up potentially innocent citizens for up to six weeks without charge the counter terrorism bill will in all probability be rejected by the house of lords very firmly after all what should they be there for if not to protect magna carta but because this is defined as political not security the government will be tempted to use the parliament act to overrule the lords it has no democratic mandate to do this since 42 days was not in its manifesto its legal basis is uncertain to say the least but purely for political reasons this government is going to do that because the generic security argument relied on will never go away technology development complexity and so on we ll next see 56 days 70 days then 90 days but in truth perhaps 42 days is the one most salient example of the insidious surreptitious and relentless erosion of fundamental british freedom and we will have shortly the most intrusive identity card system in the world a cctv camera for every 14 citizens a dna database bigger than any dictatorship has with thousands of innocent children and millions of innocent citizens on it we have witnessed an assault on jury trials a bolt against bad law and its arbitrary use by the state and shortcuts with our justice system which will make our system neither firmer nor fairer and a creation of a database state opening up our private lives to the prying eyes of official snoopers and exposing our personal data to careless civil servants and criminal hackers the state has security powers to clamp down on peaceful protest and so called hate laws to stifle legitimate debate whilst those who incite violence get off scot free this cannot go on it must be stopped and for that reason today i feel it is incumbent on me to take a stand i will be resigning my membership of this house and i intend to force a by election in haltemprice and howden now i will not fight it on the government s general record there s no point repeating crewe and nantwich i won t fight it on my personal record i am just a piece in this great chess game i will fight it i will argue this by election against the slow strangulation of fundamental british freedoms by this government now that may mean i have made my last speech to the house it s possible and of course that would be a cause of deep regret to me but at least my electorate and the nation as a whole would have had the opportunity to debate and consider one of the most fundamental issues of our day the ever intrusive power of the state on our lives the loss of privacy the loss of freedom and a steady attrition undermining the rule of law and if they do send me back here it will be with a single simple message that the monstrosity of a law that we passed yesterday will not stand
1054486 the compactrio embedded system and labview graphical tools from national instruments gave us the power to design prototype and deploy the control system within our visica2 medical device quickly and beat our time to market goals while saving money by eliminating the need for building custom hardware the rio architecture and new low cost hardware help us even further by allowing us to quickly move to lower cost hardware when deploying our machines at high volume without having to redesign software or start over from scratch with a new design
1054487 we were able to rapidly prototype our system for fedex using labview and compactrio and create a final deployed solution with ni single board rio all in under a year the fact that ni provides hardware and software to quickly prototype and deploy embedded systems was crucial for us were quite sure we wouldnt have been able to hit our aggressive deadlines without ni tools

1054527 the steelers really made a huge impression on me particularly in their early years
1054528 when i was first interrogated and really had to give some information because of the physical pressures that were on me i named the starting lineup defensive line of the pittsburgh steelers as my squadron mates
1054529 further coerced to give future targets he named cities that had already been bombed and responding to demands for the names of his squadrons members he supplied instead the names of the green bay packers offensive line

1054553 an open call to this congress to form a church committee to conduct an investigation into any of the encroachments upon the constitution
1054554 where did they get the guts to do this the incredible audacity to take the all important conclusion out they had the guts because no one gives a damn and the weak liberal media will let them get by with murder
1054555 all intelligence experts agree that iraq is seeking nuclear weapons
1054556 what could possibly be worse and more criminal than the bush administration keeping all these important conclusions from congress and the american people the terrible reality is that the bush administration has gotten away with thousands of murders
1054557 all americans should be absolutely outraged over what the bush administration has done how dare they do what theyve done how dare they
1054558 some of this constitutionally unsound conduct has taken place very much in the open as when the administration ignores the plain language of a statute that when the congress finds someone in contempt of congress that matter shall be brought before the grand jury not may not might but shall
1054559 with every other murder ive prosecuted including charles manson it was not personal
1054560 ill tell you why its personal with this guy george bush its not personal against rice or cheney but again id seek the death penalty against both of them they deserve to die its personal because to sum it up as young american kids 18 19 year old kids who never had a chance to live out their dreams are being blown to pieces by roadside bombs in iraq george bush the evidence is overwhelming is having a lot of fun enjoying life to the very utmost with all the death horror and suffering he has caused what type of a monstrous individual could be happy with his life
1054561 motive is not synonymous with criminal intent but whatever his motive was it was not good
1054562 when a president takes the nation to war hes supposed to get the informed consent of the american people because its the blood of their children thats being shed if you stipulate that really was his motive you also stipulate the he lied to the american people
1054563 since bush is a conservative republican and so are they anything he does anything at all including murder is fine with them just fine with them they dont care these people dont love america they say they do but they love the republican party more than they love america
1054564 bush has committed an incalculable crime of incredible magnitude and everyones trying to protect him
1054565 if this were not something very real i would not have done it theres probably not a high probability but theres a substantial possibility that bush is going to end up in an american courtroom
1054566 theres no statute of limitations on murder gen augusto pinochet down in chile 33 years later they brought murder charges for bush it could be some law student right now
1054567 if thousands of american people will have nightmares for the rest of their lives over the horrible deaths suffered by their young son the least i can do in return is put the thought in bushs mind for the rest of his life that he may someday be held accountable in a criminal courtroom
1054568 we saw literally 80 to 90 percent of our customer responses saying thank you for making a game that leaves me feeling less stressed that leads me feeling more mentally sharp
1054569 so we decided to invest in it to see if it was scientifically true
1054570 much more needs to be done before video games can be prescribed to treat medical conditions
1054571 causal video games bring relief and enjoyment to children with adhd
1054572 any reasonable type of treatment that would enhance the adhd childs attention span focusing concentration skills and self confidence would be a welcome asset to parents and teachers alike
1054573 at the end of the day casual games have transient effects
1054574 its like exercise in that your cognitive ability improves for about an hour or two but returns to normal soon after
1054575 we still have to apply for the licenses but it wont cost us a dime
1054576 i thought this was going to be a real uphill battle but they took care of it in two days i was amazed
1054577 this is just more proof to me that this really is a blessed project
1054578 we heard some noise outside and then the door literally burst in and the dea came in in full combat gear told everybody to get on the floor and put their hands behind their heads
1054579 a patient to periodically renew a doctors recommendation regarding medical marijuana use
1054580 that sounds like a fun trip to go on i hope to go someday
1054581 you should come with us next year we leave feburary 9th
1054582 are you sure thea it sure looks like you did use mommys camera
1054583 it helps you so much as far as the defenses now having a hard time of focusing in and honing in on your personnel groupings
1054584 if we have two tight ends that can play at the same time they dont know if were going to be in two tights or two wides or they dont know if were going to be in a pro set with a tight end and two backs in the backfield
1054585 we can also line up with one back with a tight end and three wides especially with a who gives us a lot of flexibility we can put him in space and we can also make a running back out of him
1054586 hes an athletic long guy who is just a young kid but i think hes got great potential
1054587 we have more bodies at that position but until we can put the pads on when it counts and see them step up and make plays we will feel a lot better
1054588 i think defensively in probably the last eight or 10 years we started matching offenses as far as personnel groupings are concerned in terms of who we run out onto the field
1054589 if youve got an extra receiver in the game then you bring in an extra db etcetera normally in the old days if you had two wides a tight end and two backs which was the old 21 personnel then you would have a base defense which was four dbs three linebackers and four down guys
1054590 well now what is happening is we have a lot more flexibility with our formations
1054591 instead now we run our 21 personnel into the game and then all of the sudden will is flexed out and we have different formations which create match up problems for them
1054592 they look good in shorts if they play in shorts i think well be all right
1054593 for the second day we didnt have any substitution issues i thought they played with a better tempo and i think they are getting a better understanding of what we want to do offensively we had very few mas i think we put the ball on the ground once and threw one interception for the entire day which was positive
1054594 no 1 the first three or four days prior to pads you try to get everything installed
1054595 you try to get your stuff in and once you put your pads on they have the entire offense installed they understand what youre trying to do and like i say coming out of spring ball i thought there were a few things they didnt totally understand but for even the young kids for the first two days out there i thought they ran around pretty well
1054596 until you get into an actual game will we know how it will affect you because we dont huddle
1054597 when we are in indy which is a hurry up tempo i think it can help us the thing is i think defenses are still going to try and match up with you if we run an extra tight end into the game
1054598 if were in one tight end a tailback and three wides and then all of the sudden we run a wide receiver out of the game in what is called our yo yo personnel and is running into the game we cant run in there as fast as we can and get set and snap the ball
1054599 we have to give the defense time to substitute that hasnt changed they are going to stand over the ball and give them time its no different than when there was the 25 second clock

1054661 however we see a lot of association between asthma and acid reflux in the 15 million americans who have asthma as many as 50 to 80 percent also have acid reflux
1054662 we do know that reflux can cause asthma if the reflux is aspirated into the lungs or the acid in the esophagus can cause chest tightness also if acid gets into the bottom of the esophagus it can reflux up against the bronchial nerve which causes the airways to narrow and a shortness of breath
1054663 my patients will say oh that tightness in the middle of my chest isnt there anymore
1054664 when a patient thinks of reflux they think of heartburn or regurgitation and they arent aware of the other atypical signs
1054665 its not uncommon anymore to get referrals from allergists and pulmonologists
1054666 sometimes surgery is needed to tighten up the esophageal sphincter which prevents the reflux of acid
1054667 this is the first experimental evidence in a controlled laboratory setting linking these two very common conditions in humans
1054668 these data suggest that chronic micro aspiration of gastric fluid can drive the immune system toward an asthmatic response
1054669 this does not mean that everyone with gerd is going to develop asthma by any means
1054670 but it may mean that people with gerd may be more likely to develop asthma if there is an upside to this it is that developing gerd is something we can pretty much treat and control

1054698 this is not an honest view of our countrys budget deficit and the administration knows it their failure to include a realistic assessment for war spending and refusal to make accurate assumptions about the alternative minimum tax is disappointing and does not set the right tone for having a serious discussion about our countrys dire fiscal situation
1054699 once they asked me to do the film i kinda felt responsible whatever happened to the movie would ultimately be my fault

1054705 this is the first time ive ever actually done this before to find something my first time digging makes it real
1054706 its a lot more interesting than reading about it in a book
1054707 we even found an unbroken light bulb so there are pockets of air down there
1054708 the interesting part about this is what we are finding confirms the history of what we know about the house
1054709 were finding childrens toys so we know children were here also the expensive bottles and china we found indicate that the people who lived on the property were of very high status

1054718 the accusation would be almost laughable were it not for justice department antics like those in the report
1054719 political hacks who treated the justice department like another wing of the republican party did a terrible disservice to the american taxpayers but a big favor to siegelman

1054793 the value of alonso in the market will be really high we are really pleased with him and we dont want him to go unless we get a very good price
1054794 he felt that people had questioned his commitment a little bit and the best answer is always to play well on the pitch
1054795 you play well and show that you are ready to fight for the shirt and for your team you know how it is if you score goals people forget the frustration quickly
1054796 i decided to launch a 100 town tour of the state we needed cash so while we waited for movie theaters to clear their schedules we started playing town halls granges and old opera houses you can rent most of them for 50 and set up the show in less than an hour and you take home all the cash at the end of the night
1054797 you dont find as much originality in sundance films these days and for a simple reason in the beginning the festival was a home for the homeless for a rambunctious outlaw take on filmmaking there was no need to be cautious since indie films were rarely hits but as sundance became the showcase for a form of movie gaining marketplace pull young directors naturally made films to fit the new mold trying to get your intellectual fill with sundance films is like choosing homemade popcorn over the concession stand variety higher quality little nourishment
1054798 a police force entered jaba village to confiscate machines a few hours before the eruption of clashes
1054799 two hours after the police force had finished its mission we received information that a number of casualties were admitted into hospitals in ramallah so we went for investigation but we were not able to conclude the investigation as the wounded were in a serious condition
1054800 results of the investigation will be declared once the investigation is concluded

1054807 the usb stack implementation in the kernel refuses to allow mass storage devices to be mounted writable unless they have a valid security chip
1054808 we feel that it is consistent with the governments approach that it wants to listen and learn from the experiences of people in this country
1054809 gordon brown doesnt have a single original idea in his head any more
1054810 this really is a government that has run out of steam britain needs change with an early general election
1054811 we will continue to work with the energy companies and others to make sure that we provide help including social tariffs for those groups
1054812 protecting those who struggle to heat their homes is an absolute priority for the government
1054813 i am very pleased to hear that an alternative to this very silly windfall tax is now being considered
1054814 it needs to be very cautious to make sure that we dont have unintended consequences out of this
1054815 the prime minister is on holiday i am not going to get into speculation on the leadership in any way
1054816 its vital that tenants are involved in shaping three oaks homes not just from day one but in the planning stages too
1054817 if the council votes in october for the transfer to go ahead these policies will determine how the new organisation provides its services to tenants it is therefore important that tenants have a real input into their creation so that they receive the service they want
1054818 were not going to stand for this violence thats taking our young people
1054819 when prices have fallen in the past we have seen house building slow quite rapidly but take a lot longer to come back which leads to demand outstripping supply
1054820 with the fundamentals of the housing market still relatively tight the credit crunch might already have sown the seeds of the next house price boom
1054821 in response to a single punch with a clenched fist towards his friend the defendant produced a knife without a word and punctured a blow to the victims chest
1054822 even if the defendant perceived an imminent attack upon him or his friend his reaction was wholly disproportionate and excessive
1054823 this was a fight in which the defendant was prepared to use a knife in such a way to kill or in the very least cause serious harm
1054824 he was carrying a knife intending to use it offensively should the situation arise and that is what he did
1054825 heikki antes de tudo algu m honesto e se lhe perguntarem ele dir que esta uma equipe comprometida com a igualdade e assim sempre ser as pessoas dizem que kovalainen agiu porque recebeu ordens de equipe para deixar lewis passar mas n o pedimos nada a ele ele era sete d cimos e un segundo por volta mais lento e ele sabia disso quando seu companhero de equipe pode ganhar e voc n o deve deix lo passar para que ganhe a corrida foi isso que ele fez

1054827 ms macia contacted us because she had received a summons for her council tax
1054828 ms macia believed that she had made all of the payments that were due but unfortunately had quoted the wrong reference number when she paid junes instalment
1054829 because of this we were unable to identify the account to which the payment belonged
1054830 a reminder then a summons was issued as part of the recovery process and it was not until ms macia contacted us in july when she received the summons that we were able to link the payment to her account
1054831 the amount of the summons which was issued on july 15 was for 1 053 87 plus an amount of 50 court costs
1054832 the court hearing date was scheduled for august 21 but the summons and associated costs have been withdrawn
1054833 the reminder notice for 151 83 that preceded the summons was issued on june 10 because the instalment due on june 1 was overdue
1054834 a payment of 149 79 was received on june 11 but because ms macia had quoted a walksort reference rather than her billing reference the payment was allocated to the councils suspense account
1054835 as a result of this as soon as it was brought to our attention the summons was dropped and the matter resolved
1054836 it is unfortunate ms macia didnt contact the council at this time so that the matter could have been resolved earlier
1054837 i have told them i am disgusted by the farce and i want some compensation it is the principle
1054838 the money has not just been used to live the high life not gambling or anything of the sort
1054839 she is sorry for what occurred and she knows it is now over
1054840 quite who was doing that is not a matter i can lay at the foot of this lady
1054841 it does appear that the defendant has a troubled family and she has been paying money to drug dealers on behalf of members of her family who owe them money
1054842 she had to keep filling in forms and administering the fraud to keep it running and it was only stopped when the department investigated and arrested her in november 2007
1054843 i fail to see how i can fail to impose a custodial sentence today
1054844 i think it sends a message to all would be fraudsters be careful because we are watching them
1054845 at the time of the eviction the family had 236 convictions between them including burglary disorder and theft
1054846 there were a lot more people in that room than some of us thought there would be

1054849 the co founder of id software is considered one of the creators of the first person shooter genre and his technical influence has kept hardware companies rushing to keep up so its a bit surprising that he hasnt yet taken advantage of the most powerful mobile device on the market

1054903 were advising residents to take care of their possessions that are susceptible when the tide comes over the bulkheads
1054904 huh unhappy but they laugh all the time how can they be unhappy people
1054905 presenters do not have to be funny but they do need to evoke and to engage something stand up comedians know very well
1054906 look at their eyes if their eyes are shining you know youre doing it
1054907 if the eyes are not shining you have to ask yourself a question who am i being that my players eyes are not shining
1054908 by that time the child had been trapped in the sand for approximately 20 minutes
1054909 because weve had a lot of rainfall over the last couple of days the sand becomes quite compact and obviously it becomes very dense as well
1054910 i believe the tunnel was a huge tunnel they were able to walk through and it became unsteady and unfortunately collapsed around the young boy
1054911 then the team set about digging out as much we we could to expose the chest so that the paramedic could give heart massage
1054912 while that was going on we were trying to dig the body out and that carried on for about 10 15 minutes
1054913 the family was panicking the friends were panicking there was a lot of screaming and crying
1054914 the young man was some five feet below the surface and although rescue crews had managed to clear the sand from his head and shoulders the youth was compressed under a considerable weight of sand
1054915 although many children and adults may play safely in sand at the sea shore or in sand dunes deep excavations and tunnels are extremely dangerous and should not be attempted
1054916 its just a tragic accident that could have been prevented but unfortunately children dont see danger
1054917 sand is always very unstable and heavy and can collapse at any time
1054918 they are perfectly safe if people dont take unnecessary risks
1054919 comedian is the movie that aligns perfectly with this blog post
1054920 to watch seinfeld grapple with new material work it out in front of an audience refine the flow and the stories rehearse plus on top of it the isolation that all speakers feel was scary and brilliant i highly recommend it i think all people passionate about presenting should rent buy and devour the documentary comedian starring jerry seinfeld
1054921 this ends up being less a documentary about comedy and more a character study of a mature and an immature craftsman
1054922 the craft here is comedy but it really could be anything especially any type of art a friend and i watched this and afterwards talked about how well orny adams illustrate the principles of leadership
1054923 seinfelds objective like those of a serial entrepreneur was to create a new act from scratch we watch him start out and he is strangely fumbling and awkward we see a lot of backstage offstage conversations i speak a lot normally to smaller crowds than seinfeld does but it was interesting to see him get the same pre game jitters i do in the few minutes before a presentation is slated to start i guess thats a sign that he is still taking risks to improve his act if he didnt care he wouldnt be nervous
1054924 imagination is more important than knowledge for knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand while imagination embraces the entire world and all there ever will be to know and understand
1054925 sleep is not just a waste of time it is a very active time and we need it for things like memory and learning during the day we acquire information but at night we sort that information people complain about sleep deprivation but now with the 24 7 society and information overload we need our sleep more than ever
1054926 our results revealed that a period of sleep following a new experience can consolidate and improve subsequent effects of learning from the experience
1054927 honor the moment as if it were a once in a lifetime gathering
1054928 but if you understand the principles of storytelling you probably have a good understanding of yourself and of human nature and that tilts the odds in your favor
1054929 a big part of a ceos job is to motivate people to reach certain goals to do that she must engage their emotions and the key to their hearts is story
1054930 in a story you not only weave a lot of information into the telling but you also arouse your listeners emotion and energy
1054931 calling on the protagonist to dig deeper work with scarce resources make difficult decisions and ultimately discover the truth
1054932 statistics are used to tell lies while accounting reports are often bs in a ball gown witness enron and worldcom
1054933 but as a storyteller you want to position the problems in the foreground and then show how youve overcome them
1054934 if you write a screenplay without conflict or crisis youll bore your audience to tears
1054935 the universe is not made up of atoms but of stories
1054936 but passengers will adjust because of the need for air travel
1054937 yeah there was a lot of burgundy in the audience

1054946 the transportation department of the wake county public school system is committed to the safe transportation of students to and from schools every day
1054947 the fact that the recent unacceptable student transportation incidents occurred despite the focus on student safety and continuous reinforcement of practices and procedures has triggered the need to again review those practices and procedures
1054948 by hollywood standards maybe one would say that the first one wasnt as successful as other films in truth
1054949 if you go by the actual business side of things i think nine times out of 10 there wouldnt have been a sequel from that movie
1054950 while it had a nice core audience it wasnt a huge success at the box office so i was a little surprised when we came back to do the second one
1054951 instead of sitting down with us and saying what can i do to listen to teachers more they disparage it
1054952 we believe in accountability but we believe in 360 degree accountability

1054963 for some chinese companies you could argue they need only five to 15 years to develop a global brand

1054972 el problema entre los egipcios y los beduinos es la falta de respeto respeto a nuestras tradiciones ellos quieren que seamos egipcios pues que nos acepten como somos que no nos quieran cambiar

1054988 we respond with warmth to puppies and kittens and they have some of those same cues they have large heads they have large eyes they have rounded facial features just like human infants do this natural warmth we have toward infants is biologically deeply rooted in us
1054989 i was reading a story in the post this weekend by john berry the former fed head that pretty much stated what ive been telling people especially the crowd in vancouver the fed wont raise interest rates this week and in my mind they probably wont this year yes inflation is rising but its not wage spiraling inflation that usually pushed the fed heads to raise rates and with the housing credit liquidity and financial institutions problems running rampant the fed heads just cant raise rates as raising them would make all those problems balloon yes i know the fed heads have been great at creating bubbles but this would be worse than a bubble it would be a hindenburg

1055003 how much would you like to bet on what a cars worth three years from now given the circumstances
1055004 at a time when people are reconsidering their basic car buying decisions our business has been very strong
1055005 we dont feel the effects as much as a dealer or a bank or a manufacturer because people need transportation

1055018 do you believe that indian people in the uk follow the caste system
1055019 caste relationships between caste groups seem to be upheld to a great extent the rules of endogamy marrying within the caste group are still strictly followed

1055024 we might see an ice free arctic ocean by the year 2030 within some of our lifetimes
1055025 there are some scientists out there who think that even might be optimistic
1055026 as near as we can tell looking at the historical record theres been ice in the arctic in the summer for at least 16 million years
1055027 theres a group that makes a very strong case that in 2012 or 2013 well have an ice free summer arctic as soon as that its astounding whats happened
1055028 as the ice recedes its opening up not only the arctic passage but all the resources in the arctic ocean
1055029 we could think of the arctic as the refrigerator of the northern hemisphere climate system
1055030 what were doing by getting rid of that sea ice is radically changing the nature of that refrigerator were making it much less efficient but everything is connected together so what happens up there eventually influences what happens in other parts of the globe
1055031 the arctic really can feed back into the global climate system
1055032 you know what happens when you get feedbacks you get surprises and we dont like surprises
1055033 a race has developed between the waning sunlight and the weakened ice
1055034 a combination of these two forces led to what we observe now and we should not ignore either forces
1055035 there have been numerous models run that have looked at that and basically they cant reproduce the ice loss weve had with natural variability
1055036 you have to add a carbon dioxide warming component to it
1055037 we should care in the sense that what happens here is coming to us and sometimes you know a warning is a helpful thing to mobilise people

1055051 we are grateful to the washington post the new york times time magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years it would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the light of publicity during those years but now the world is more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government the supra national sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto determination practiced in past centuries

1055096 weve got two things in mind win gold and get softball in peoples minds
1055097 there are 128 countries that play the sport it is important the ioc sees that
1055098 we can prove softball should remain in the olympics if we just go out and play to the best of our ability and win
1055099 the biggest thing we can do is show them the best softball they have ever seen
1055100 to me thats disrespectful that they would remove a sport without knowing about it
1055101 thats where i think the ioc needs to do us right we dont take steroids were not turning down the olympics to make millions of dollars
1055102 my challenge is to get the ioc to come and watch a game look these girls in the eye and tell me this sport should be taken from the olympics
1055103 interest in the game is at an all time high
1055104 more for outside the us its important for dreams of girls in places like beijing as a world class stage to prove we belong
1055105 we are surprised by what has happened these players have been asked to play for their national teams
1055106 twenty years ago we made the decision that the olympic games should be for players under 23 we have never had a complaint or put into question the automatic qualification of under 23 players
1055107 let the players play the players are the actors without the players there is no spectacle
1055108 its not only a question of solidarity but of respect for the olympic spirit and to let such young players have the experience
1055109 after this all teams are the same so i think we will be ok
1055110 were both low key and keep to ourselves i think were both level headed and i think thats huge because guys get fired up and then they try to pound the ball into the sand

1055151 while women continue to close the gap in achieving parity with men in the areas of labor force participation and tertiary education womens self perception regarding the subjective factors of the index managerial positions and above median income have continued to dip for the second year in a row this appears to indicate that women are feeling less confident about their current status and whether on account of the economic political or social landscape the direct result is that mens confidence and resulting advancement is increasing to fill the gaps
1055152 as women continue to enter the labor force and seek tertiary education new avenues are opened up for their employment and their careers however in 2008 it appears that women continue to perceive themselves as not receiving the same opportunities as men this combined with the shifting economic climate has negatively affected the scores pertaining to the self perception of women resulting in a lower mastercard worldwide index of womens advancement score

1055172 we have used mediware products for close to 15 years

1055181 while it is important to provide children the necessities in clothing and materials if families step back and analyze their childrens wants and what they actually need they can make financially sound decisions instead of pushing themselves further into debt
1055182 it is natural for parents to want to provide everything their child asks for
1055183 however children also appreciate a home where their parents are happy healthy and unburdened by the worries of excessive debt they can learn to appreciate the long term benefits of fiscal responsibility versus instant gratification

1055259 en otra parte admirar an el trabajo de un equipo al que le sacan a su figura mosquera a punta de patadas y luego te expulsan un jugador importante en dos jugadas normales me parece el colmo que digan que santa fe tuvo un partido gris cuando un rbitro nos termina el trabajo a los 15 minutos ac hace mucha falta de cultura futbol stica
1055260 si se fijan contra am rica sin restarle m ritos a ese equipo a los cuatro minutos no me pitan un penal claro entonces parece que aqu en colombia hay que hablar como habla el pecoso y como habla pimentel hoy me robaron

1055303 dick snyder was running s and s back then and he really did believe in the free market of ideas
1055304 i was pretty much free to acquire anyone i wanted
1055305 i brought them books by bill buckley and charles kessler
1055306 and also sidney hook who was hardly a conservative but felt like one to the lefties at harper but of course they were names every time i brought up someone they hadnt heard of they would say no brad we want to do conservative books just not this one there really was no conception of the size of the potential market or what the country was like it was like the famous steinberg drawing with new york as the center of the world that odd liberal version of reality
1055307 youd think the industry would have learned something from the success of so many free press authors and the closing of the american mind
1055308 but no they resisted trying to seriously get into this market for another 15 years
1055309 been taking on fewer books and become a lot more selective this year well publish only five or six including mike huckabees book down from ten a few years ago we want to keep the imprint as robust as possible but the way to do that is not simply to keep our output up and pretend the market is what it was three years ago
1055310 the lesson weve learned or actually relearned is that there are no hard and fast rules in this business aside from the fact youve got to be smart creative and persistent
1055311 theres a conservative market out there and its not going away
1055312 it became an anthropological question for them who are these people there followed a whole cottage industry of books and articles trying to prove that conservatives are a product of bad parenting psychological syndromes or genetic defects as well as generally stupid and evil
1055313 and report so and so passed then read me the note from the editor
1055314 a conservative publisher i felt a little funny about that
1055315 this idea that a regnery book is somehow illegitimate is just incredible bs why is it that were supposed to be concerned about regnery being a conservative house but nobody worries about all the publishers in manhattan being liberal houses it scares me even thinking about what wouldve happened if id gone with one of those houses the book wouldve come and gone in a minute and sold exactly no copies
1055316 they initially printed only 13 000 copies and as far as i know gave it no advertising
1055317 amazon sold out the third day and we got hundreds of e mails from all over the country from people that couldnt find it in the stores which just killed it commercially the truth is the house just never seemed very excited about the book
1055318 but jonah was an internet star and in the first week the demand from his troops was so intense that it jumped onto the timess list with 12 000 copies in print even then doubleday just eked the book out into the marketplace reprinting in quantities of 5 000 or 10 000 if this had been a book by a major liberal journalist they would have gone out with 30 000 copies and reprinted in increments of 20 000 and we would have been up to 150 000 in no time with huge stacks in barnes and noble even when jonahs book hit number one it still wasnt easily obtainable youd walk into a barnes and noble and if they had it at all it would be tucked away on the second floor in the back in the sociology section eventually they pushed the book up to 198 000 copies i would like to have seen 300 000 in print
1055319 everybody reads the new york times every day and takes it as orthodoxy signing books on that basis it was evident very quickly how insular the whole system is they could all name three four five chefs but couldnt name a single clergyman
1055320 im sitting there in my office and a young editorial assistant walks in
1055321 all i can say is im very sorry for your loss which is what you say at a funeral right
1055322 each of these companies has its own ann coulter pat buchanan or bill oreilly
1055323 too many people even in the industry buy into the caricature that conservative publishing is all about polemics weve published memoirs like bob novaks the prince of darkness and michael medveds right turns serious works of history investigative journalists like bill gertz and ken timmerman not to mention the george wills and michael barones of the world
1055324 reasoned thoughtful and made an enormous contribution to the debate in the public arena
1055325 if we could have had a generalized debate in the culture if cnn had been willing to cover the subject the way fox did the impact could have been so much greater
1055326 fox was all over this like a cheap suit but fox is behind a firewall
1055327 you have to prepare them for whats going to going to get the bad review in pw followed by the indignant column by paul krugman but you have to let them know that in this case bad is good we need our enemies we cherish them we use the new york times to energize conservative media i send every book i publish to times columnist frank rich with a nice note saying i hope you hate this one unfortunately theyve gotten a little more savvy about being used that way and tend not to respond thats why i miss anthony lewis he could never restrain himself
1055328 oprah is not one of the places we go for our books
1055329 were much more interested in fox and friends than the traditional network morning shows
1055330 the approach has paid off though regnery produces only 20 to 25 titles annually of the 72 conservative books that have been on the new york times bestseller list in the past six years 23 were from regnery and more than half of the rest were by authors who got their start with it
1055331 my own feeling is that these imprints are designed to fail
1055332 management would be happy to see them succeed for financial reasons yet because they basically see this type of publishing as deeply distasteful an alien organism within the publishing body theyd be just as happy if they fail then they could say see we tried this kind of publishing is not a good business and move on
1055333 the large publishing houses have always held their noses when it comes to conservative imprints
1055334 my guess is that if they survive at all theyll transition from conservative politics to just politics and current events
1055335 the truth is theres never been real commitment to the ideas in those books or for that matter to genuine intellectual pluralism once its clear the winds shifted and theyre less profitable its a good bet theyll be gone
1055336 mainstream publishers to stop seeing conservatives as a market to be ghettoized and exploited but as a vital part of the american tapestry but
1055337 i also think conservatives are also going to have to adjust get smarter argue better and write more with an intention to persuade rather than just mock belittle and demonize
1055338 there will be room for a lot of different voices
1055339 you have to prepare them for whats going to going to get the bad review in pw followed by the indignant column by paul krugman but you have to let them know that in this case bad is good we need our enemies we cherish them we use the new york times to energize conservative media i send every book i publish to times columnist frank rich with a nice note saying i hope you hate this one unfortunately theyve gotten a little more savvy about being used that way and tend not to respond thats why i miss anthony lewis he could never restrain himself

1055411 kohale tuli ainult fotograaf kes ka ise tunnistas et temal p devus auto seisukorda hinnata puudub
1055412 mingil juhul ei saa selle auto eest tema praeguses olukorras 180 000 krooni mina ei suuda m ista kuidas saab hinnata piltide j rgi auto seisukorda see on sama kui arst paneks selgroo kohta diagnoosi inimese lasteaiapilti vaadates

1055417 kui on suuremad kahjustused arvutatakse taastamisv rtus tasemeni millega on lubatud teedel liigelda ning lahutatakse see tehniliselt korras s iduki turuhinnast
1055418 et hinnangust s ltuvad maksud siis pole autokaubandusega tegelevatel isikutel reeglina huvi n idata s iduki tehnilist seisukorda reaalsena

1055468 his most direct contribution lies in his delegitimizing of communist power and especially in the eyes of his surreptitious soviet readers
1055469 by law we have every basis for putting him in jail he has tried to undermine all we hold sacred lenin the soviet system soviet power everything dear to us this hooligan solzhenitsyn is out of control
1055470 given the widespread and unrestrained lawlessness that has reigned in our country for many years and an eight year campaign of slander and persecution against me i refuse to recognize the legality of your summons
1055471 before asking that citizens obey the law learn how to observe it yourselves
1055472 free the innocent and punish those guilty of mass murder
1055473 the greatest and most powerful single indictment of a political regime ever to be leveled in modern times
1055474 could only understand what happened to russia in terms of good and evil those who engineered and imposed the bolshevik and soviet nightmare were not merely ideologues they were evildoers
1055475 solzhenitsyn was the most eloquent scourge of ideology in the twentieth century
1055476 there was no greater or more effective foe of communism or of totalitarianism in general
1055477 we are proud that alexandr solzhenitsyn was our compatriot and contemporary

1055492 would it be impolite of me to ask for a cup of tea so we could sit down and talk properly

1055496 we have created this program to address a specific need in national security which is cultural and linguistic fluency among u s military officers
1055497 texas a amp ms unique role in forging leadership for the armed services makes us a natural choice for creating a program to train future leaders with linguistic and cultural competence
1055498 the arabian and asian language office was established in 1997 to answer to the campus and national need for fluency in arabic chinese and japanese
1055499 and as interest in these languages continues to expand we will be able to offer advanced classes in each language
1055500 i am pleased to see a steady increase in the number of applications and the awards received by our students
1055501 this is a strong indication of our students growing interest in gaining international education experiences
1055502 as a result of observing the china archive survey project with dr bob harmel i was invited by the research center for contemporary china at peking university to pursue advanced training on asian economic and policy reforms
1055503 not only will i participate in a valuable intellectual exchange i will take an intensive mandarin course and begin researching for my senior thesis
1055504 because i come from a low income single parent family i immediately shot down the possibility of leaving the country for three and half months
1055505 it wasnt until i sat in on a study abroad presentation that i learned about opportunities like the gilman scholarship
1055506 receiving this scholarship will help me reach my goals of visiting historic landmarks of italy turkey and greece
1055507 and help expand my cultural knowledge which will further my business career and add rich detail to my architectural designs
1055508 if you make a list of the top 100 universities abroad that young indians go to why arent they acceptable counterparties to come here and make a direct and larger contribution
1055509 i would say there is a wave of interest building
1055510 that says it is extraordinary that we dont open we should open to the outside world
1055511 certainly were not very favorable to complying with our regulations
1055512 without breaking or violating any laws at the federal level
1055513 theres a lot a lot you can do to establish relationships
1055514 there seems to be a trade imbalance in the education field that is even more severe than in the proj ects and services field
1055515 ensure timely responses and assist in tracking and record keeping obligations
1055516 consistency and coordination among those responding to the ig and gao reports
1055517 this is a tremendous day for renewable energy in oregon
1055518 lets see now we need to be saved from the wrath to come from a holy god
1055519 well then we need to go to the new testament to see what jesus said
1055520 miracle after miracle jesus does no one can resist his words never man spake like this man he turns water into wine to save a wedding party he raises the dead he calls herod a fox and completely ignores tiberius
1055521 all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth
1055522 go ye therefore teaching all nations baptizing them in the name of the father in the name of the son and in the name of the holy ghost
1055523 therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god has made that same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ
1055524 should i just believe it accept it and say it exactly as the apostles did

1055530 it is very important to encourage the students to use the computer as educational tool
1055531 life is what happens while you are busy making other plans
1055532 the nature of our economy is that almost anyone in a business career is going to be involved in global business
1055533 internationalism is important to all of our students whatever your major youre going to be interacting with people from other countries you may not live abroad as part of your job but youre certainly going to be traveling abroad thats part of almost all business careers
1055534 i got to experience several different countries i now have a much better idea of what is going on in europe
1055535 deloitte has a program that after youve been there two years you can do an exchange for two years in another country which i definitely want to do
1055536 the most important part for our students is that when they graduate theyve been exposed to global business and theyve learned the importance of being able to build relationships with people from different countries and different cultures
1055537 all the students that have done a reciprocal exchange have had a phenomenal experience we have never had one that wasnt satisfied
1055538 im willing to say that for any mays student that wants to be a reciprocal exchange student we will find the financial means for him or her to do it
1055539 we dont arrange their internships but we do provide scholarship support for internships as well as for study abroad
1055540 international business research is often more expensive in regard to gathering data and other costs so being able to provide support is important
1055541 our biggest challenge really is getting the word out to people
1055542 a lot of our students arrive on campus knowing little about international business not realizing how important it is and believing things that arent true they often think that international business means you must master multiple foreign languages and live abroad for long periods of time so we have to disabuse them of the things they believe that arent true and then teach them what is true
1055543 and the parents are very interested in them gaining experience in international business and thats a change
1055544 without focusing on measures to address global warming and energy issues there can be no future for our auto business
1055545 our view is that oil production will peak in the near future we need to develop power train s for alternative energy sources
1055546 people often ask us whether the vehicles of the future will be hybrid vehicles or clean diesel cars or electric vehicles
1055547 our answer is that it will not be one technology because energy situations vary from one market to another
1055548 be geared toward fleet customers in japan the united states and europe
1055549 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car

1055552 i cant say i managed to avoid plastic for a week but the experience of trying to do so made me much more aware of what passes through my hands and how much of it i can and cant control
1055553 you just play them normal like and clear off the others if either of us call
1055554 theres that awful man who stiffed me out of a potpourri box and a king sized milky way
1055555 now you know id lay down in traffic for you but youve put me in a hard spot what if i get popped for running bogus bingo cards why in the world would you need to do such a thing anyway
1055556 a perfect example of why the american notion of a free public education is a bad idea hes nothing more than a wad of protoplasm a deadhead that one i should have failed him but that would have meant another semester reading his bloated prolixity so i promoted him im so ashamed
1055557 i told him there would come a time when those wronged would ask for restitution i never thought you could actually pay in flesh from the buttocks region i thought he made that one up
1055558 we think it was a marionette show when he was perhaps six years old a little horse puppet called him fat can you imagine an explanation of what actually precipitated his later behavior would be pure speculation
1055559 would you please stop calling and for the last time i am not your therapist
1055560 an extraordinary leader of men he was a devoted public servant who led our nation out of one of its darkest hours with grace and bipartisanship no wait that was gerald ford
1055561 i tell my students the bad news first the fact they get an
1055562 certainly evokes sympathy it is not a legal basis for his release from prison
1055563 nothing more than wild speculation and innuendo unsupported by the evidence
1055564 de vooruitzichten dat ze erdoor komt zien er niet goed uit
1055565 i want to help young people improve their lives through the industry that has been so good to me
1055566 by giving them valuable new skills they can be proud productive members of society
1055567 we are iraqis and you shouldnt say such a thing
1055568 the situation is better but how much better and is it real
1055569 my maternal uncle is shiite and before they were unable to visit us at all now they do visit us regularly but at the same time they have to be careful not to make themselves conspicuous just in case
1055570 we used to be terrified of the forces manning checkpoints because they had the authority to question us and we just didnt know which way to lie
1055571 they could be anything now we fear only about 25 percent of them which we can call a development
1055572 return the hearts of the fathers through the hearts of the sons
1055573 its what you go through to get where youre going
1055574 if obama jumped off a bridge would you do it too
1055575 why should he be immune to being called a nigger because hes black
1055576 they use a lot of visual aid and exercises to teach and the most important thing is that everything is linked to
1055577 consistent with this states strong policy against any form of discrimination in the workplace we hold that the threshold for demonstrating a religion based discriminatory hostile work environment cannot be higher or more stringent than the threshold that applies to sexually or racially hostile workplace environment claims
1055578 chicks will be in one spot there will be laughter joy and the promise of new life
1055579 sono cos triste che ho bisogno di stare da sola
1055580 he was standing in the living room of his old house listening to his parents fighting they had gone out onto the porch to avoid him overhearing but he did anyways he wanted to know he had to know
1055581 this shouldnt surprise you if you know him its quite obvious but you dont know him you barely see your son at all
1055582 stop talking like a laywer and start talking like a father damnit how can you act like this towards him this is important to him and you treat it like like he has a disease that can be cured
1055583 all i suggested is that we take him to a shrink its not out of the question theres obviously something wrong with him hes deluded or or something theres no way any son of mine could really be a fairy
1055584 is for calling our son a name like that how old are you hes your child take some responsibility what ever happened to unconditional love
1055585 godamnit is it to much to ask that my wife and son be normal like taylors or james or allens they have nice ordinary wives who keep the house nice and host parties and bring the kids to baseball games and dont make strange sculptures or paint the sky on the walls of the house their children are normal too the boys play baseball or soccer and the girls take gymnastics or ballet and they all go to school and get good grades they arent failing english and doing college level mathematics and have no friends other than strangers who they talk to on the internet my colleagues children arent gay
1055586 if thats how you feel about it then leave go find that normal wife and those normal children you want so dearly because they certainly arent here and you know what if you dont find them its because they dont exist normality is an illusion and if you want to go chasing illusions thats fine by me but i dont want to see your sorry face here ever again
1055587 fine you most certainly wont you and that little queer can just survive on your goddamn own and lets see how long you can support him selling your so called art goodbye adele
1055588 the clouds that had been threatening all day opened up just then and the windshield was covered in dancing droplets of water which nicely matched the waterworks occurring inside the car
1055589 yknow when you were a baby and you threw tantrums in the car all i had to do was to turn on the windshield wipers you would quiet right down and just watch them they fascinated you to no end
1055590 it would be nice if you liked me but thats not what i was asking i was planning on groveling before your feet then apologizing some more then maybe inviting you to my house for thanksgiving
1055591 i cant believe youre asking me this for years not a word not a letter not a call then mom dies and suddenly you want us to be all lovey dovey like nothing ever happened like you never left
1055592 and whose fault is that tell me do i still disgust you or have you worked past the i hate all faggots stage
1055593 yes i do believe i have worked past the i hate all f faggots stage as you so charmingly put it and to set the record strai i mean to get things strai um to clear the matter up i never hated you ever i could never hate you please remember that
1055594 he he its just im not allergic to the word faggot or straight you dont have to dance around the issue you could though its funny
1055595 just dont say anything at all and maybe i can forgive you eventually
1055596 well we should curse him but hes just so adorable
1055597 the coolest fucking thing ever to exist holy fuck have you seen it it is bat shit insane awesome pun intended
1055598 juzgar entre las naciones las llenar de cad veres quebrantar cabezas sobre la ancha tierra 7 el beber del arroyo en el camino por tanto levantar la cabeza

1055604 it is for freedom that christ has set us free
1055605 each of the three photographers will manage their own photo blog editing and uploading their best images along with i hope some very personal anecdotes about what its like to be there experiencing it i hope this creates a form of photo survivor between them where they are in a kind of creative competition then ill go in to their blogs each day and edit what i deem to be the best of which will be up on a showcased newsweek com gallery around noon each day
1055606 kebebasan berarti bahwa si hamba bebas dari belenggu sesama makhluk kekuasaaan makhluk tidak berlaku atas dirinya tanda absahnya kebebasan adalah bahwa tersingkirnya pembedaan tentang segala hal dalam hatinya sehingga semua gejala duniawi sama di hadapannya
1055607 jangalah engkau berjuang memaksa diri terhadap hal hal yang sudah dijamin allah dan janganlah engkau meremehkan hal hal yang diwajibkan allah kepadamu
1055608 education within a pluralistic society should affirm and help students understand their home and community cultures
1055609 white students usually attend schools where less than 20 percent of the student body is drawn from races other than their own while african american and latino students attend schools composed of 53 to 55 percent of their own race in some cases the percentage is much higher as more than a third of them attend schools with a 90 to 100 percent minority population
1055610 the education of the negroes then the most important thing in the uplift of the negroes is almost entirely in the hands of those who have enslaved them and now segregate them
1055611 if you can control a mans thinking you do not have to worry about his action when you determine what a man shall think you do not have to concern yourself about what he will do if you may a man feel he is inferior you do not have to compel him to accept an inferior status for to compel him to accept an inferior status for he will seek it himself if you make a man think that he is justly an outcast you do not have to order him to the back door
1055612 history shows then that as a result of these unusual forces in education of the negro he easily learns to follow the line of least resistance rather than battle against odds for what real history has shown to be the right course
1055613 you cannot serve people by giving them orders as to what to do the real servant of the people must live among them think with them feel for them and die for them
1055614 with age acquired knowledge and lived experiences i never know how to react to stories like the one told in jena louisiana
1055615 with one stroke of my pen i can make your life disappear
1055616 i jokingly said to another teacher ones for you ones for me
1055617 white students can do things and receive a slap on the hand
1055618 with one stroke of my pen i can make your life disappear
1055619 but i dont think he was directing it to anyone in particular i think he just wanted people to calm it down
1055620 weve understood that it has been that way since ive lived here
1055621 i think its safe to say some punishment has not been passed out fairly and evenly
1055622 i think probably blacks may have gotten a little tougher discipline through the years

1055630 if its too much trouble i still have time to find someone else
1055631 no estoy tratando de pensar demasiado lo nico que hago es salir al terreno de juego y tratar de pegarle a la pelota por el medio del campo no soy de esos jugadores a los que les gusta ponerse presi n ellos mismos
1055632 hicimos lo que ten amos que hacer batear y hacer carreras aunque la gente no lo crea nuestro objetivo no es conectar vuelacercas tenemos poder en la toleter a pero la meta principal es ganar como sea afortunadamente a m me han salido los batazos pero eso no lo es todo
1055633 we have been given the job to provide an effective opposition by the electorate and the fact is this is an incoherent and incompetent executive and my party will play no part in that
1055634 they the dup and sinn f in really ought to consult with us before they spin about us
1055635 i think there is this idea that they can rely on us to ride to the rescue well they cant expect that when they havent spoken to us on the issue for the last 16 months
1055636 the reality is the executive in place has failed to tackle a range of problems from education to rural planning to the irish language and the proposed maze stadium
1055637 and the thought that they need us to take on a department they cant deal with on top of all the others theyve been unable to deal with properly is just bonkers
1055638 to be fair to nicky he has made it clear from this time last year that he would prefer to leave and ply his trade elsewhere
1055639 but we have no need to sell anyone and im not going to give anyone away
1055640 i dont want to sell him ive no intention this is a player who can be absolutely massive for us
1055641 i think niko got fitter last season and hell be back this year fitter again
1055642 i feel he can get better as well hes a real class act hes still only young and improving all the time
1055643 he can keep going on and become one of the best players in the premier league if he keeps improving i really really think he can

1055646 and that deep and irreplaceable knowledge of my capacity for joy comes to demand from all of my life that it be lived within the knowledge that such satisfaction is possible and does not have to be called marriage nor god nor an afterlife

1055673 kalau sampai tanggal 5 bulan ini gbs belum menerima gaji berarti sudah lima bulan tidak gajian
1055674 kami pernah pertanyakan hal ini sebanyak dua kali tapi alasannya yang diberikan selalu sama mereka selalu mengatakan bahwa lpmp tengah memverifikasi data para gbs
1055675 kalau dihitung dari bulan april para cpns itu tidak menerima gaji bahkan saat ditanya ke lpmp mereka tidak tahu tentang itu ini kan aneh
1055676 saya sendiri bingung mereka bilang semuanya tidak tahu dan tidak ada kepastian pembayarannya
1055677 untuk memenuhi kebutuhan sehari hari kami selalu meminjam uang kepada teman yang punya uang
1055678 kami sudah ketemu dengan kepala lpmp dan mengaku gaji para gbs itu sudah bisa dicairkan dalam waktu satu dua hari kedepan

1055682 i feel that we can perfectly fit into the new system
1055683 in fact our true enemy at the beijing olympics is not the new competition system but ourselves
1055684 germany and south korea are the strongest opponents of our team at the olympics especially in the mens singles
1055685 i am confident of defending my gold medal but winning an olympic gold requires more than just confidence or your abilities
1055686 obviously china is the nation to beat at table tennis and i am trying to challenge them
1055687 the situation has not changed tottenham offered us 15 8m for andrei but that does not work for us we are waiting for a new proposal
1055688 theres another couple of targets we are looking at and we hope to bring them through the door in the next couple of weeks
1055689 runs great and drives excellently gas saver you will be able to enjoy this vehicle for many miles to come call today to schedule a test drive
1055690 at the same time i have also taken on a lot of experience since then i have taken things from four years ago and taken them into fights into other major events world championships europeans and it has helped me out a lot
1055691 i try not to dwell on what happened and now i have got another chance i am a stronger fighter much more experienced the mistakes i used to make i dont make that often now
1055692 i have been in world finals since then and european finals and i have managed to hold on
1055693 every time i have been in a final when i am in a break situation i think back to the games and how i put it right
1055694 the worst person in the weight could catch the best person in the weight if the guy makes a mistake thats all that happened last time i made a mistake
1055695 i would have preferred to have lost the fight more cleanly all the way through than to get have thrown it away things like that happen it was sickening
1055696 i was a bit gutted about how id done it was just the feeling that i knew on the day i couldve done better
1055697 its one of those where you just wish you could go back i felt low for a bit but when i got back into the judo the following year i had a fantastic year i was fighting the best id ever fought
1055698 i was going to a tournament events and winning every fight easily i got back into it and it was like athens had never happened i was gutted but what can you do
1055699 an olympic medal and athens would be totally out of my mind to get an olympic medal would complete the set
1055700 the main thing was just getting back into the judo with it its such a physical sport and it takes such a long time to develop the fitness for judo because youve got to totally support the shoulder with the muscles
1055701 after the operation everything had totally worn away from having it in the sling so it took me a while just to build up my arm to get back on the mat to get fit it took over a year
1055702 it was just down to constant training i felt my shoulder was slipping
1055703 that used to be our local tv station you did this to us
1055704 pop a balloon and win a prize two bucks gets you three tries
1055705 kami mengumpulkan mereka untuk persiapan dan informasi teknis tentang tata cara pencalegan
1055706 teknisnya dalam pemberkasan yang akan di serahkan kepada kpu urutannya adalah setiap 3 nama calon laki laki diseling oleh 1 nama calon perempuan hingga 30 persen tersebut terpenuhi
1055707 kita sudah paparkan semua dan jika ada kekurang pahaman bisa ditanyakan langsung kepada kpu namun saya berharap semuanya jelas dalam sekali pertemuan ini
1055708 they are phenomenal they are doing extremely hard skill levels and they are very well prepared
1055709 i dont want to jinx them but they are stronger than ever
1055710 the chinese showed us they are going out there to win and they like a good fight
1055711 we want to keep the title of being top of the world weve been working really hard and were going to give the chinese a run for their money
1055712 we have high expectations ourselves of gold and we want nothing less
1055713 the chinese are strong technically but mentally the u s own the competition
1055714 being able to win the team gold at last years worlds is like everyone is out to get us this year
1055715 the chinese are our top competitors and it being in china it could help them tremendously or it could hurt them
1055716 the security in beijing for the olympics may be over the top
1055717 but its hard to blame them for wanting safety at all costs
1055718 we have strengthened security work in all olympic venues and in the olympic village we are well prepared in security for the upcoming games
1055719 you can see there are windows that are broken in a nearby building and a pole has been ripped out of the ground
1055720 you can see some wires hanging from another pole nearby
1055721 we do not wish to see such events nor would we want a repeat
1055722 but we cannot prevent beijings systematic suppression of the uighur people nor are we able to control such acts as these the chinese authorities policies and behaviour force uighurs down the road towards millitary action and attack
1055723 ficamos assim porque somos seres humanos comuns n o super herois como fantasiamos para n s mesmos
1055724 aquela n o ningu m n o s minha namorada
1055725 barbosa tem comprometidos gays feios e suicidas agora homens realmente dispon veis os ind ces s o baixos
1055726 kevins a great player a strong character in the dressing room
1055727 kevin has a lot of qualities that people want in a captain he is a good lad hes a very motivated person
1055728 i think the side have got to move forward and by appointing me as captain i dont think that would be a good option there are other people out there that could do a better job
1055729 it is a brave decision because kp hasnt done much captaincy before but i think he has matured a lot in the last couple of years
1055730 i think he does play for the team i think that selfish aspect is overplayed he would probably admit in his youth he was a bit like that but i dont think he is like that so much now
1055731 it is going to be a massive job he will have an abundance of confidence to believe he can do it and he will have the full support of all the players around him
1055732 its the best honour in the game to captain your country its obviously hard off the field but if it came my way id love the challenge
1055733 but at the moment its all about kp and fingers crossed we can get behind him and help him do a really good job
1055734 his batting is aggressive and his captaincy will be similar
1055735 he likes to work very hard and likes to think about all aspects of his game he has the backing of his team
1055736 its a very brave selection in the past they have gone for tried and tested citizens pietersen might just take us somewhere weve never been before
1055737 lets see where its going to take us itll be a good ride
1055738 hes young but im telling you hes going to surprise some foreigners and hes going to be exciting to watch
1055739 is it a surprise to tell you the truth no it isnt
1055740 i think its cool but for me to do this i needed to believe in myself and believe that it could happen
1055741 i could sit for hours in the olympic village watching the athletes this is only the third time ive ever been overseas
1055742 but at the same time im on a mission now im not satisfied by just making the team
1055743 but i can control my performance i can control wrestling hard to score points
1055744 last night everything came together and i am now moving to real madrid
1055745 as everybody might know i have always wanted to move to spain because i have a strong bond with that country
1055746 now im going to play for real madrid its a dream comes true
1055747 i like gareth barry and i like two or three other players it is better i dont speak about names it is better i leave things to your imagination and creation
1055748 scolari said nothing to me when i was with portugal but this is significant as it means the work i have been doing at atletico is positive
1055749 i was hoping to have added to the squad by now and brought a few in to give the players a lift
1055750 its not just a new face we need its new faces my big concern is that anybody we bring in now probably wont be ready to start the premier league season
1055751 were not looking to lose players but looking to strengthen a little but more
1055752 ive beaten novak twice in the last couple of weeks now and hes obviously played great all week
1055753 it gives me a lot of confidence going into the olympics and us open
1055754 its huge masters series titles are so huge to win
1055755 i played five matches in five days in this sort of heat against guys like novak carlos moya and ivo karlovic theyre all tough matches
1055756 its a great test physically and all the work off the court is paying off
1055757 weve got two things in mind win gold and get softball in peoples minds
1055758 there are 128 countries that play the sport it is important the ioc sees that
1055759 we can prove softball should remain in the olympics if we just go out and play to the best of our ability and win
1055760 the biggest thing we can do is show them the best softball they have ever seen
1055761 to me thats disrespectful that they would remove a sport without knowing about it
1055762 thats where i think the ioc needs to do us right we dont take steroids were not turning down the olympics to make millions of dollars
1055763 my challenge is to get the ioc to come and watch a game look these girls in the eye and tell me this sport should be taken from the olympics
1055764 interest in the game is at an all time high
1055765 more for outside the us its important for dreams of girls in places like croatia and japan we look at beijing as a world class stage to prove we belong
1055766 the chinese womens team have received good practice especially the young players
1055767 the veterans like zhao and feng have also built up their confidence but the team must improve on teamwork skills and cooperation
1055768 we must learn the lessons of this defeat continue to work and think about the olympic games
1055769 for the time trial theres no hiding and every day that i miss training is seconds and therefore places in the result
1055770 i wouldnt want to deprive mick of an opportunity to do what is our best chance to get a result for the team
1055771 shayne bannan called me with the news and i was on the table getting treatment with my knee all bandaged up in ice and an electro stimulator attached and he said weve got that second place
1055772 i looked at my swollen knee and thought oh good for you
1055773 but lets see how it goes and first concentrate on getting my knee better and see if im worthy of going for the road race and seeing if i can be good enough for the road race
1055774 then beyond that for me to go and start the time trial id have to have a pretty stellar ride in the road race
1055775 every day im doing the physio and treatment on my knee and every day getting better but well decide on monday morning whether i go or adam hansen goes in my place
1055776 i dont want to go unless i can do a good result for myself and the team or contribute to a good result for the team so if i dont recover from my injury and am not close to my best i dont mind staying at home
1055777 cadel will ride in the road race on saturday and then reassess where hes at
1055778 but yes he has been entered in the time trial
1055779 in choosing a new captain we were keen to identify a player who could lead the team in all three forms of cricket and bring fresh enthusiasm and ideas to the role of captain
1055780 kevin is a world class player who will command the respect of the dressing room and i am sure that he will be looking to lead from the front and work closely with both the players and the coaching staff to bring england success in the future
1055781 i am very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain england
1055782 its a huge honour for me and a terrific challenge for me at this stage of my international career
1055783 i have learned a great deal about leadership from playing under both michael and paul and fully appreciate the level of responsibility that comes with the job of captaining your country
1055784 kevins a great player a strong character in the dressing room
1055785 hes a very fine player in both forms of the game hes a very determined and single minded man who knows what he wants
1055786 kevin has a lot of qualities that people want in a captain he is a good lad
1055787 i realised that i needed to train much more ahead of beijing i definitely want to triumph at the beijing olympics
1055788 there are people who say that in an olympic team sport you can only win a gold medal once
1055789 id say if there is a team that can win gold twice or even three times then it is croatia
1055790 but if we really win gold again it would be a miracle
1055791 our major problem is that we play at nine oclock in the morning 0100gmt we are from the south of europe and my players like to sleep in the morning
1055792 spain is a team we respect weve played them a lot of times and many matches were very close
1055793 we came here to win the gold medal and we are thinking of nothing else
1055794 denmark are european champions and germany is the world champion every match is going to be difficult

1055852 this means we can quickly respond to incidents affecting the active duty and reserve wings
1055853 if one of our controllers needs some flexibility another one steps in regardless of whether its an active duty or reserve airman
1055854 we are almost identical in structure and this allows members to swap out with other shift controllers
1055855 we run 24 7 with a high ops tempo so its critical we have seamless integration
1055856 its easier to coordinate joint operations with aircrews brief them on any plan and ensure airborne operations run smoothly

1055871 we are surprised by what has happened these players have been asked to play for their national teams
1055872 twenty years ago we made the decision that the olympic games should be for players under 23 we have never had a complaint or put into question the automatic qualification of under 23 players
1055873 i ask the teams in germany and spain if the ruling is in their favour to let the players play because they are already here
1055874 let the players play the players are the actors without the players there is no spectacle
1055875 its not only a question of solidarity but of respect for the olympic spirit and to let such young players have the experience

1055892 i know certain english clubs are following me like manchester united who are very interested in me
1055893 there is absolutely no chance of him leaving and i hope that we do not receive any bids

1055900 in the last two years hes started to look like a great player he is the first of the really big guys who could really play

1056059 if you open up the olympic arena to settling scores and making political statements this is the end of the spirit of the games
1056060 athletes will have absolutely every chance to express their views but we ask them not to do that in the olympic venues especially not on the podium and in the olympic village if you start having people on the podium with t shirts with regional causes and conflicts or religious ones or racial ones we cant allow that
1056061 that is something that is to be considered as a political demonstration or propaganda and falls beyond what we call the freedom of expression
1056062 then we will talk with the athlete and we will ask them what the motives are and then well see what he or she has to say
1056063 let me speak very clearly we asked for a new media law we approved the new media law weve asked the chinese authorities to implement it in full if we are advised that there are aspects of the media law that are not respected well make representations to the organisers and the chinese government

1056087 their actions recognize that hydropower is and will remain the keystone of the countrys energy mix
1056088 by demonstrating their commitment to hydropower these leaders are also showing their dedication to a clean affordable energy future
1056089 their work also underscores the fact that new technologies and advancements are making hydropower one of the most exciting new energy options available today
1056090 as an industry were on the vanguard of renewable energy development and were also an established proven part of the energy mix i cant think of any other energy resource that has both a future filled with new technologies and a history of achievement
1056091 this consultation is intended to set out and gather views on a proposal for a coregulatory approach that could be adopted in order to facilitate and ensure co operation between internet service providers isps and rights holders to address the problem of illicit use of peer to peer p2p file sharing technology to exchange unlawful copies of copyright material
1056092 the consultation also identifies and seeks views on other potential options and calls for evidence on issues related to illicit use of p2p
1056093 industry solution in this area provided it is not anti competitive is effective and is fair to all parties particularly citizens
1056094 while the co regulatory approach is the governments preferred approach at this stage we have also identified a number of other possible regulatory solutions and are seeking views on all of these options and on any other options that people might identify

1056097 comcast has unduly interfered with internet users right to access the lawful internet content and to use the applications of their choice
1056098 consumers have come to expect and will continue to demand the open and neutral character that has always been the hallmark of the internet
1056099 the internet can restore decentralized and entrepreneurial voices to the media landscape that are reflective of the best aspects of the american tradition this order is a vital step towards maintaining the potential and promise that the internet holds for enriching our economic cultural and social well being
1056100 would you be ok with the post office opening your mail deciding they didnt want to bother delivering it and hiding that fact by sending it back to you stamped address unknown return to sender
1056101 or if they opened letters mailed to you decided that because the mail truck is full sometimes letters to you could wait and then hid both that they read your letters and delayed them unfortunately that is exactly what comcast was doing with their subscribers internet traffic
1056102 in short we have no rules to enforce this matter would have had a better chance on appeal if we had put the horse before the cart and conducted a rulemaking issued rules and then enforced them
1056103 the truth is the fcc does not know what comcast did or did not do the evidence in the record is thin and conflicting all we have to rely on are the apparently unsigned declarations of three individuals representing the complainants view some press reports and the conflicting declaration of a comcast employee the rest of the record consists purely of differing opinions and conjecture
1056104 basically in order to create a successful blog the time spent on marketing is expected to be at least the same as time creating the blog
1056105 the current incentive system even for professional bloggers is not so much about the quality of the content but instead about the ability of the blogger to play the rules of the game and make their blog more known than others
1056106 privacy generally guarantees that personal information which is not in the public domain is not released without authorisation
1056107 instead of stripping digital goods of their distinctive positive features rms using drm should instead increase the value of protected digital goods so far law abiding consumers are punished for their honesty the digital goods they pay for have less features than pirated digital goods such consumers should on the contrary be rewarded it is clear when examining the current drm policies used by the rms that they do not use drm to its full potential but merely as a way to capture additional surplus from honest consumers who end up paying for pirating consumers drm is a very powerful tool and it could enable rms to achieve near first degree price discrimination i e charging individual consumers differently selling at a higher price to someone whos willing to pay more but this would certainly require a complete rethinking of rms marketing and pricing strategies
1056108 for example consumers who listen to a certain group artist on a regular basis could be charged a standard price when a new album is released whereas those who are not familiar with this group artist could be offered a discount to encourage the purchase
1056109 keep existing drm but pay consumers to disclose more personal information
1056110 unfortunately this means that low social value content is very likely to be over produced while high social value content is probably produced in insufficient quantity thereby leading to an inefficient outcome

1056112 in the keys first phase school leaders phone or e mail questions to researchers who find the best possible answer from official sources experts and published res earch the researchers some of whom are former school leaders compile a full answer with references sources and suggestions for further reading and tag it for future reference at first sight the model looks econ omic nonsense paying for hum an beings to research answers to tricky questions from potentially 20 000 school leaders one by one would be expensive but they are all facing similar problems and the more times a question comes up the lower the cost per answer the aim is to manage the resulting information so that each ans wer adds to an ever expanding knowledge base in the first four weeks half the questions required new research at three months nearly 90 per cent could be answer ed using existing content nine out of 10 users saying it has saved an average of five hours per question in addition most say it has improved the way the school works because better decisions are made more quickly

1056122 habitat destruction is a major threat to biodiversity throughout the world
1056123 the caribbean is particularly vulnerable because it contains an unusually high percentage of endangered species and because these animals live on islands they have nowhere to go when they lose their habitat

1056131 these kinds of situations cry out for reexamination of our standards

1056173 fraizer did not do himself any harm against espanyol on saturday and i would not expect sir alex to say anything else at this stage
1056174 all we can do is respect manchester uniteds wishes but make sure sir alex is not in any doubt as to our interest in fraizer we will just have to bide our team and be patient
1056175 kevin davies is someone we put a bid in for but bolton have made it quite clear he is not for sale
1056176 theres another couple of targets we are looking at and we hope to bring them through the door in the next couple of weeks
1056177 the selectors had a decision to make they spoke long and hard yesterday about which direction they wanted to go in
1056178 if they wanted a captain for all three formats including twenty20 the list would have been short
1056179 im not involved in two of the formats and alastair cook hasnt been in the twenty20 side recently
1056180 i would have liked to have done the test job and to that degree i am disappointed i have not been given the opportunity
1056181 i enjoyed it when i had a go a couple of years ago but the selectors have opted to go another way and youve got to take that on the chin
1056182 what is important is that we all get behind kevin and give 100 support because if you dont have the players behind you that is a very tough starting position
1056183 by making one captain in all forms it looks like the selectors are trying to consolidate and will give someone a good run at leading the side
1056184 both of us were in pretty good shape for these matches but i had the mental belief that i could win and once you win against someone for the first time you have the feeling that you can do it again and again
1056185 i think it also gets into their heads if they beat you five or six times and you come back to win against them
1056186 winning a masters series event is tough and it will be hard to follow that up but it gives you a lot of confidence knowing that you can do it
1056187 they were really key wins for me especially the win against him in the masters final
1056188 the first three times i played him djokovic i wasnt in such good physical shape he killed me in monte carlo but this time i was in good shape
1056189 if you put the work in off the court then you can eliminate all the possible excuses and just go into the match not thinking about physical shape and how much practice you have put in
1056190 i have been feeling much better physically which makes you more relaxed on the court because you know you have done everything you can do to get yourself into the best possible shape
1056191 id rather be in the position im in now than going over there having been knocked out in the first round at cincinnati
1056192 now i feel absolutely fine both physically and mentally im not fatigued at all i have just got to try and store that over the next few days
1056193 ive been impressed with him i like him very much and im pleased weve got him here
1056194 hes a good kid and has the potential to become a very good player he was recommended to me and we got him here straight away because there is a big gulf at the club between senior players and young kids
1056195 weve got nothing in between really but he can bridge that gap
1056196 raf has been an immense captain for france throughout his international career and one of the great players among the wasps squad throughout the last three seasons
1056197 the decision to appoint him as club captain was an easy one what raf has achieved his character and the way he operates is first class and there is no more deserving a man for the job
1056198 with the departure of lawrence dallaglio there are of course some big boots to fill
1056199 but raf is one of the most highly regarded players in the professional game who so easily commands the respect of all those around him
1056200 2008 09 looks set to be a season of challenge for the premiership clubs with the introduction of the elvs experimental law variations and the new rugby football union agreement which will see us without so many of our key players
1056201 working with ian mcgeechan and shaun edwards and all of the coaching staff at wasps has been a fantastic experience for me
1056202 when ian spoke to me about the captaincy my first thought went to lawrence dallaglio
1056203 the one thing we dont want is for kevin to change he averages 50 plus in test and one day cricket and he is an unbelievable talent
1056204 everyone will ask will his batting be affected but knowing kevin he will probably average 70 as captain
1056205 you know what he is like as soon as he is put under the pump and people start saying things about him he comes back and gets a big score i would imagine he will do that this time
1056206 the first innings against south africa in the first test at lords earlier this summer was the one for me a lot was said going into that series and the finger has been pointed at him by a lot of people
1056207 he is a bit nervous at first but gets his head down and blazes a hundred that is a measure of the man when you see things like that i am sure he will take to captaincy in the same way he will take it in his stride
1056208 it is a tough job it is not just about being on the field moving the field about and changing the bowlers around
1056209 the thing is trying to leave it on the cricket field there is a lot off the field as well and i took it home with me from time to time that is what i found a bit hard about the job
1056210 michael said it affected him at home and he took the work home and i did that as well it is hard not to it is a hard job but it can be very rewarding as well if you get the results
1056211 you also need help from the rest of the side you also need a few people to lean on when i was doing the captaincy i took too much on myself and didnt have too many sounding boards or people to speak to about the job
1056212 kevin will be fine he is confident single minded and will have a definite approach to how he is going to do it the team have got to perform as well and there is no reason why we cant all be successful together
1056213 if you see when michael took over it was in similar circumstances to kevin now against south africa michael quickly stamped his authority on things and the overriding thing was he wanted people to express themselves and enjoy playing cricket
1056214 that is how the england side played through his reign and we were successful michael helped me as a cricketer and tried to take away the fear of failure and let the players go out there and play
1056215 it is inevitable i suppose when a captain resigns or goes it is under poor circumstances i think vaughany deserved more than the circumstances he is going in now
1056216 it would have been nice to go after a series win or go out on a high which i think he definitely deserves and i just hope we havent seen the last of him
1056217 he is a fine batsman and has shown that on numerous occasions and i know he will be fighting to play for england again
1056218 it was idiotic if not suicidal to attempt to go down there in shorts and sandals
1056219 man its a good thing craig wasnt here for that one he wouldve had a field day hes soooo funny
1056220 yknow you couldve just stopped at its a good thing craig wasnt here
1056221 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country

1056250 the most striking thing about the new batman movie is its emphasis on sado masochism as the animating element in american culture these days

1056315 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
1056316 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem

1056319 in short and simple terms we would be plunged into a depression that would make the great depression of the 1930s in which i spent my childhood look like boom times
1056320 industries would fail banks would collapse government revenues would dry up universities would have to close health care even as limited as it now is for roughly 75 million americans would virtually cease in short something like what the south suffered at the end of the civil war would plague the country
1056321 even at todays price as you know 14 airlines have gone out of business while others are hovering on the brink of bankruptcy and most have curtailed service and laid off personnel
1056322 at double or triple todays price none could fly unless nationalized a whole range of other industries would be quickly drawn into the quicksand ironically war would push america into a form of socialist economy
1056323 so the lights are on late in washingtons federal reserve sec and treasury department trying to figure out how socialism your tax dollars and credits can once again bail out these big time gamblers with our money reckless self enriching capitalists get on your knees and thank the rescuing washington socialists for without them you would surely be in chains

1056333 consumers were being deceived into believing suvs have car like handling and performance capabilities when in fact they are more like a truck
1056334 feel particularly loathsome towards the drivers of larger gas guzzling trucks and sport utility vehicles suvs
1056335 societys views on smoking have changed over the years smoking was once the norm people smoked in open places and did not think twice about the health or environmental ramifications today smoking is proven deadly i wonder if peoples feelings towards driving large ostentatious cars are changing do we now or will we later see suvs in the same way as we see smoking today will we look back and see large cars being deadly to the environment and to our health are cars the new smoking
1056336 the conspiracy between the big three to drive other forms of transit into oblivion
1056337 a chicago federal jury convicted gm of having criminally conspired with standard oil of california firestone tire and others to replace electric transportation with gas or diesel powered buses and to monopolize the sale of buses and related products to local transportation companies throughout the country the court imposed a sanction of 5 000 on gm

1056348 im sure theyre all lovely but ive got a very close knit group of girlfriends who i went to school with and we all hang out together im aware of the rubbish that comes with celebrity and i try not to get too hyped up in it if we go and watch marcus play we sit in the stands have a pie at half time put the kit on i dont really do the whole box thing with heels and stuff i kind of like to get stuck in
1056349 id go insane if i just went shopping all day and didnt work

1056351 we camped out in the local villages and it was a real eye opener compared to how we live here they have nothing there were no showers so you just have to use a few wipes here and there and get on with it it was basic but really good all singing round the camp fire at night
1056352 when i started on hollyoaks i was only 15 and was going through the puppy fat stage of my body changing

1056354 so i looked into augmentation they said they could fill in the skin that was left and get them back to what they were and i said great lets do it i think if i hadnt have needed or wanted to lose the weight i probably wouldnt have touched them really because they were in proportion it was just to give myself more confidence
1056355 its my first live theatre so its a bit nerve wracking when i did soapstar superstar that was a live audience and was petrifying but i think this will be more fun its not like im exposing myself im playing a character and my family are all going to come and watch i think once i see their faces ill be fine

1056462 i think weve done alright but the game got spoiled a little bit
1056463 it was an entertaining game we had them pinned in the second half there and we had a great chance we felt we were going to score then certain things happen and it wrecks the game and thats what happened today
1056464 its always good to come back and play in front of family and friends and get a result that we needed badly you know its a great atmosphere and im sure the fans were behind their team but when certain players on your team arent disciplined as they were tonight its costly and thats what happened to them
1056465 we only had 5 on the bench theres a reason for that theyve got to prove to me that theyre good enough to play and get on the bench i think we might have to get academy coach and former canadian international nick dasovic to put his boots on

1056514 there is a huge concern that election officials who are responsible for getting everyone onto the rolls wont have the resources or the systems to be able to put that into place
1056515 it could lead to really long lines and it can lead to confusion at the polling places
1056516 there was a huge problem with the technology in the last election in north carolina and florida
1056517 machines stopped working and there were thousands of people whose votes were never counted
1056518 in 2004 we found tricks like in baltimore where they said that if you had a parking ticket you would be arrested so dont come and vote
1056519 in the black districts the lines would be longer and people would be more apt to leave and not vote
1056520 youre going to have worse problems when it comes to the actual election because youve got the book of dirty tricks that comes into play
1056521 call your local election official and say am i on the rolls if youre on the rolls great then find out where your polling place is so you can be prepared to vote on election day if youre not on the rolls they have to tell you why youre not

1056524 the actual law is not the problem it is the manipulation of the law and the justice system which is dominated by the patriarchal mindset that is the problem the structure of our social system remains patriarchal and we grow up believing that it is perfectly normal to be afraid of parents and that we need to always obey the authority figure within the family
1056525 it starts with the family ideally the smallest unit of democracy in society but which has been reduced to a totalitarian prison due to the violence and abuse practiced by the patriarch
1056526 marriage and giving birth are important moments ive experienced both and good days always follow

1056531 the blog allows me to give vent to my emotions it is also a way to talk to myself and gain the strength to move on
1056532 the government has committed a big mistake by transferring the land to sri amarnath shrine board and then revoking the same later in the face of protests but recourse to violence is a bigger mistake
1056533 if the government does not address the issue with a sense of urgency it would cause a great loss to the fruit growers who have no cold storage to keep their fruit preserved
1056534 if the blockade on highway continued it would have serious ramifications and kashmiris would have no choice but to seek alternate channels for their trade
1056535 if the fascist elements continue to run their writ kashmiris cant be left at their mercy and alternative links of communication and transportation to the valley shall have to be restored sooner the better
1056536 i may be pretty off base with this idea but who would really want to join a huge site like start exchange or ts25
1056537 we use our size to influence all kinds of politicians
1056538 we dont want to pay our employees a dime more than we have to
1056539 i think it is going to backfire not only will it backfire politically in the way you state but whats so sort of delicious about the whole thing is that it shows exactly why the employee free choice act is so needed because the mechanisms of intimidation an employer has over an employee are so powerful that running a union election in that context has become incredibly difficult almost impossible when your employer can have a mandatory meeting and sit you down in a room for hours on end showing you anti union propaganda or telling you who they think you should vote for and you have to listen to them because you cant walk out of that room and not get fired those are exactly the conditions that create a system in which its harder and harder for workers to unionize and have a voice in the workplace and those are precisely the conditions the employee free choice act is designed to remedy so i think the most ironic part of all this is that theyve shown exactly why the law that theyre fighting is so necessary

1056587 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been 30 years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country

1056589 tapping the strategic oil reserve is not a substitute for a real plan to increase supply through additional drilling and nuclear power
1056590 the strategic oil reserve exists for americas national security strategy not barack obamas election strategy the last release of oil from the strategic reserve came in response to hurricane katrina but the only crisis that has developed since barack obama last rejected this idea two months ago is a slide in his poll numbers

1056595 when children consume a high fat high sugar meal their bodies will crash and they will be come very tired and lethargic which is not going to help them perform at their best level in school
1056596 when you are grocery shopping keep in mind that if a snack is in the home your children will likely eat it so keep healthy food in the house at all times to ensure that they will always have healthy snack options if you keep candy bars and fruit in the home most children would pick the candy bar so just keep it out of the house
1056597 a smart dinner will help your childs brain function if they are satisfied after dinnertime then they will sleep through the night and a child needs at least eight to nine hours of sleep a night in order to function while in school the next day

1056602 of those women we were able to follow 418 women who gave birth vaginally had a second child or more were tested for gbs during their first and second pregnancies and were not excluded from the study due to various factors we found that of the 418 the risk of testing positive for gbs during a second pregnancy was 53 percent
1056603 our study did not tackle this issue but the results could help experts decide whether it is cost effective to keep testing women in subsequent pregnancies if their risk of testing positive remains so high
1056604 the test involves a swab of the vaginal rectal area if a woman tests positive and is therefore considered colonized she will most likely be treated with intravenous iv antibiotic therapy during labor the antibiotics will help protect the infant

1056667 the failure of the plutonium fuel experiment is another major setback for the mox program and will further increase the already considerable cost overruns delays and risks
1056668 congress needs to pull the plug before even more taxpayer money is wasted
1056669 to go forward with mox now areva would have to redesign the mox fuel and duke would have to repeat the entire experiment delaying the testing program by at least eight years doe should instead dispose of the plutonium directly by mixing it with radioactive waste and encasing it in glass which would be safer and cheaper than continuing the mox program

1056688 we showed that the patients who got the real drug rather than placebo were less likely to relapse to drinking or if they relapsed it was later
1056689 in other words gabapentin prevented and delayed relapse meanwhile patients reported sleeping better in both the treatment and placebo groups which may be due to the gabapentin in the first group and the resumption of drinking in the other
1056690 there may be some underlying chemical changes in the brain that prompt alcoholics to report more insomnia as a co existing condition than non alcoholics
1056691 a possible explanation of these new findings is that the gabapentin might decrease the insomnia initially and the patient may not need or crave alcohol as a treatment for the insomnia were also looking into other factors that may have an effect on the neurochemistry of the brain and see how they could impact recovery and sleep
1056692 these results raise more questions for us to explore including the potential impact of gabapentin on people who are in recovery from alcohol dependence but do not report insomnia

1056747 original documents are not only interesting but also provide a way to verify historical facts that may have been previously considered conspiracy theories
1056748 its important to have records like these available so people can understand and appreciate our nations history as well as the circumstances that lead to the actions taken
1056749 were more than just an online repository of historical records

1056753 eastman was not the first jewish criminal in new york but by most accounts the first jewish gangster in new york
1056754 but regardless of his true religion eastman remains the father or godfather of all jewish gangsters in new york a leader who trained many to follow in his footsteps not just as foot soldiers but as leaders themselves

1056774 the athletes village is really nice the gyms are great
1056775 we are working out the little details making sure the athletes are comfortable

1056781 you try not to get out in the sun too much so you dont get tired from sweating all day
1056782 every athlete that we have talked to is very impressed and amazed by the quality of this village
1056783 personally i have never seen such a nice village in nine games
1056784 after being here a week you get the same kind of things
1056785 they were taking every question seriously and making sure they will solve every problem
1056786 of course we will have a couple of problems along the way
1056787 every where you go there are not two or three people trying to help you there are 10 or 15 people that want to help you and make it easier for you

1056797 listening to records used to be a time to be enjoy with a few friends hang out listen to the music and read the liner notes on the back
1056798 maybe you enjoyed the gatefold sleeves in a personal way maybe you just enjoyed slipping the sealing material off the cover on your pants by rubbing the corner of the record on your knee taking the record out getting that little
1056799 all formats have their points i just like handling vinyl i was a dj for years and used to use records to entertain in the philadelphia and new york area i didnt just play records we made a night of entertainment as for the digital sound i prefer the warmer sounds i get from vinyl
1056800 i do have a music collection and my favorite items are not necessarily rare
1056801 forever vinyl gets more than twenty calls a day for customers looking for appraisals for estates and charity donations
1056802 as far as the elements of an appraisal it depends on the needs of the customer for donations we draw a number of different elements to get the correct market value for your collection we neither under nor over appraise your collection
1056803 what makes a house value location location location when it comes to records demand demand demand age is not a determining factor in record collection demand is
1056804 there really arent any obstacles per say other then finding a non profit entity to accept them the irs is very picky about fair retail market value as they should be we should all pay our fair share of the tax burden its important to understand that the irs considers the value of a collection to be based on the value and use of the entity you are donating the collection to if you donate the collection to a university and they hold on to it for three years possibly put it in their library and make the collection available to the students to learn from the appraisal will normally stand if you donate the collection to a thrift shop the irs will normally look at what the thrift shop sold the collection for and adjust any appraisal value over that amount needless to say we highly recommend finding a charity that would value and use the collection rather then just dump the collection for pennies on the dollar
1056805 as you know many records are now valued in the hundreds and thousands of dollars because of the amount of appraisals that are requested per day weve instituted a reasonable fee to cover our cost time and expertise for these appraisals our current fee is 20 00 for the first item of the appraisal and 5 00 for each additional item for collections with over 200 pieces please call us 732 505 5337 for adjusted rates
1056806 all information must contain the following information artist title type of item condition 1 10 is fine with 10 looking like its brand new label and label number
1056807 two went in saturday and so there was no more rehearsals and today sunday all the rehearsals were called off

1056809 the other two dancers could not rehearse as well and so hopefully everybody is going to be in the same boat hopefully everybody will be refreshed by having a full day off
1056810 so they keep pushing themselves and pushing themselves and not letting anybody know that hey im running on empty and then it catches up on them and then they collapse
1056811 conspiracy theories are rife as to who is behind the tunes with producers norman cook and aphex twin in the frame

1056833 we try to serve the barilla plus pasta its made with whole grain and has omega 3 acids if its served plain they dont want it because its the wrong color but if its in a buffalo chicken pasta dish they have no clue
1056834 my role is to link performance services with food services
1056835 we counsel the athletes on what fuel they want to choose a triathlete whos exercising aerobically will eat more carbs than a bobsled athlete whose work is more about strength more anaerobic

1056841 but more important athletes are creatures of habit if they won a race after eating a chicken sandwich theyre going to make sure they have a chicken sandwich before their next race thats why we went with the western menu
1056842 i tried to pick out their favorites mexican food like burritos fajitas taco salad were making tamales there

1056846 i dont want to stay here and watch the destruction of what i have worked my whole life to get
1056847 i dont feel safe drinking the water from my well
1056848 from my observation the water quality is not consistent it changes
1056849 it is very easy to make a statement that streams are drying erosion or stream siltification is happening and then it becomes a statement of fact
1056850 we are seeing the effects on our surface water and i just worry that next it will be our groundwater
1056851 without water nothing else counts we cant live without it
1056852 if we have real data to work with we are better off to solve problems
1056853 people should have adequate water supply but we dont have control to do anything about that
1056854 i am speaking on behalf of the north fork ranch where i live as well as for the thousands of people living in rural las animas county whose concerns and problems have not been represented by their local elected officials
1056855 i live in the heart of the raton basin and have been living with coal bed methane development for several years now
1056856 despite industry assurances to the contrary numerous problems exist and unless there is meaningful reform it is likely to get far worse
1056857 we do have new rules addressing coal bed methane drilling
1056858 i know the drilling incident was not on purpose it was just a problem
1056859 but i am the one that has to deal with it that one night destroyed my dream
1056860 we provided ms ross with fresh water for over a year we tried to negotiate a solution offered to put purification equipment on her well and re drill a water well at a better location
1056861 earlier this year we quit supplying her fresh water when we saw the negotiations were going nowhere if she wants to take us to court we will be ready with our facts to stand in court
1056862 now i can see the scars on the hills from drilling
1056863 stand back and compare it with the other buildings in the landscape
1056864 what youll see are a lot of subdivisions and single family homes that are very generic they could be in lafayette colo they could be in a suburb of omaha they could be anywhere
1056865 in other words this was farm and barn country in lafayette before it got taken over by sprawl what we wanted to do was help restore and respect the indigenous character of the area
1056866 we have people walking by on the sidewalk but even though its high density we feel like we have quiet and privacy
1056867 anywhere else ive lived i havent known them i came here and everyone was so friendly
1056868 i like to cook and entertain so the kitchen was a huge draw
1056869 its great to be in the same room and not be separated from everyone
1056870 interior layouts are based on an open floor plan and reflect the more informal lifestyle of modern living kitchens are open to a dining area that is also open to the living area
1056871 outdoor spaces integral to contemporary living are provided off the living rooms as well as the master bedrooms
1056872 we love that we can go out on the weekends come home and relax and not be working in the yard
1056873 everything is being developed these days and here is something that is staying true to the land
1056874 our year to date ongoing earnings are 5 cents per share ahead of last year and we are on track to deliver earnings from continuing operations within our guidance range of 1 45 to 1 55 per share
1056875 all in all theres some good stuff on the wall youll have your opinion you know mine
1056876 fall is the most wonderful time to plant salad greens and vegetables the only real effort is changing your mind set
1056877 you have to think ahead things are so hot and dry right now but as you pull up those worn out tomato plants in a little while put in some short season stuff
1056878 short season varieties are perfect for when you only have a little time to grow something lots of vegetables that mature quickly are ideal to plant now
1056879 as of right now i effectively dont have a job either but im doing this out of loyalty to my staff
1056880 typically at that point management sees no way to improve the business within a reasonable period of time to allow it to go forward
1056881 im guilty of it myself thinking that auctions are for fire sale or garage sale prices and theyre for bank owned homes in the 150 000 to 200 000 price range
1056882 as best we can tell were the only ones in the country auctioning new fractional ownership properties
1056883 you have a chance to get 12 weeks a year in a ski in and ski out with bidding starting in the mid 100 000s this is the kind of vacation place a regular person can afford
1056884 in a strong housing market were not so busy in a down market were really busy were getting busier every month
1056885 if you thought you were going to sell 10 homes a month and youre selling one home a month the advantage of an auction is is you can sell all of your homes in one afternoon even though you get less than you expected you can save an entire yearss worth of carrying costs
1056886 if someone offers me 500 000 ill just say no thanks
1056887 the bulk of them are designed to be at lunchtime so that people who work at these dmv locations can come out and join
1056888 small fruits let you look at beauty and taste it too
1056889 when you grow your own its exciting to watch them get riper every day you wait for the moment when theyre ready
1056890 small fruits are perennials and come back every year so they benefit from compost worked into the soil it makes for happy healthy plants
1056891 that its as nice in winter as it is in summer and the different levels
1056892 the other thing thats great is its pretty low maintenance
1056893 blast works has been well received by the gaming community as one of the most innovative and creative games for wii
1056894 with the lower price point the game is among the best values available this summer and a must own for hardcore gamers budding game designers and action fans alike
1056895 give me a man anyone man who feels not all is right with himself and i can correct him by defining his masculinity and conforming him to that definition
1056896 its too small for the typical grass yard where you can play
1056897 we amended the soil for rhododendrons and a lot of the other eastern plants and ground covers i just wanted to see if i could grow those things here
1056898 in spring its pretty spectacular because there are a lot of blooms on the perennials and the woody landscape plants
1056899 if you want to keep asking me over and over again youre welcome to
1056900 hed love to be back on the bus driving around with eight or 10 of you and just riffing in new hampshire if hed say something that wasnt artfully phrased there was more of a flow he could revise something or say lets talk about baseball hed get a pass but in the age of blogs theres always someone who makes a big deal out of it

1056904 the cool thing about sherlock holmes was hes actually a very skilled martial artist
1056905 so its going to have elements of that its not just his deduction and all that stuff its going to be a very action packed version of that to me its really exciting
1056906 simply put we did not receive the needed majority vote from the nine sitting judges at least five votes for a rehearing were necessary
1056907 judge ambro said that the core guarantee of equal protection ensuring citizens that their state will not discriminate on account of race would be meaningless were we to approve the exclusion of jurors on the basis of race i respectfully dissent
1056908 mumia and i had a legal conference this afternoon july 22
1056909 the indisputable facts are that the prosecutor engaged in racism in selecting the jury in this case and that bigotry lingers today in philadelphia it would be naive not to realize that this case continues to reek of politics and injustice
1056910 the love guru didnt work well because mike myers addresses a teenage audience and he was trying to mix it up with metaphysics
1056911 humor mixed with spirituality can work if its done well but frankly speaking this was not a good attempt
1056912 why is god laughing the path to joy and spiritual optimism
1056913 i told mike that since he was doing a spoof on me i was going to do one on him
1056914 it helps address paradox contradictions and ambiguity as well as themes of mortality and transcendence
1056915 it was actually better than the movie to be honest
1056916 i think as they went along they kept revising it
1056917 i think what he could have done was have been a little less gross about some of the jokes which were added later
1056918 and some of the spiritual themes they could have shown more the lighter side he was almost too serious in his deprecation he needed more humor
1056919 the community is in shock not so long ago there was this very happy event with two lovely people and two lovely families and then out of the blue comes this sad news
1056920 its very difficult for people to handle the word sad is all that you hear
1056921 ben mullany was a hard working conscientious physiotherapy student who was expected to graduate in july 2009
1056922 he was professional at all times he showed commitment to the university and the physiotherapy programme during his time here by taking on responsibilities beyond those required of him
1056923 he was valued by all he came into contact with both at university and in the clinical setting
1056924 ben was caring articulate and dedicated to his chosen profession he will be greatly missed
1056925 if we can get hsbc to help wrapits employees get your gifts to you then we will at least have made the best of a bad job
1056926 we fully appreciate that the company moving into administration has caused great stress among wrapits customers and couples
1056927 however we are confident that hsbc has at all times acted appropriately given the circumstances
1056928 i dont care whose fault this is i just wish they had told us there was a problem when we opened our list in january
1056929 two thirds of our guests bought presents on our list and we will lose about 1 000 worth of gifts wrapit say 80 per cent of customers pay on credit card but i would like to know who is doing their statistics as for us this is totally untrue
1056930 this was meant to be the fun bit when the presents arrive but instead were facing having to do it all again assuming our guests can get refunds
1056931 even those customers who did not use a credit card should contact their banks because some have an indemnity policy that could be helpful

1056938 pound for pound your common house cat can bite down harder
1056939 but the sheer size of the animal means that in absolute terms it tops the scales
1056940 the sharks upper jaws can be dislocated the whole upper and lower jaw pull out and forward as the shark twists and shakes its head from side to side to bite a chunk out of its prey
1056941 sharks ambush their prey and immobilise them with a bite then wait for them die
1056942 they are actually delicate feeders and take care not to damage their teeth by biting down too hard on the large bones of their prey
1056943 they had to use the jaws of life hydraulic cutters to extract him from the vehicle
1056944 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point

1056948 up there it was hell during the descent beyond 8 000 meters 26 000 feet due to the altitude and the exhaustion i even fell asleep in the snow and when i woke up i could not figure out where i was

1056956 there can be no certainty that any offer will ultimately be made for the company or as to the terms on which any such offer might be made
1056957 in our view a bid for imperial is readily affordable by either ongc or effectively the chinese government
1056958 if sinopec has indeed entered the due diligence process late this ironically may give ongc more time to clear its bid assuaging investor concerns that ongc needs more time than most to clear domestic red tape it may also encourage other noc bidders to enter the fray eg knoc of south korea
1056959 in my life i have never been afraid of anything
1056960 those who know me will know that i am not a coward i have never been afraid of anything i was willing to die for this country and i am prepared to die for it

1056976 eighty percent of marine debris comes from urban litter plastic washes down the streets down the storm drains and floats out into the ocean
1056977 if we expand the program to include more containers that can be recycled and redeemed well have more overall recycling
1056978 glass and bi metal non beverage containers should likewise be included in the proposed expansion
1056979 i dont think we can fix everything so im wondering what are the priorities
1056980 it had been there for many years and probably would be there for many more
1056981 now i guess there might be more people making a pilgrimage to these glaciers before they go
1056982 ice is almost like a species that is going extinct
1056983 its the far north and the higher elevations that are seeing the impacts first
1056984 and when it comes to california it doesnt get any higher than the sierra
1056985 weve changed so much especially in terms of transportation and water
1056986 one of the biggest things weve learned is that its not that hard to make a difference
1056987 as i rode my bike more i realized that i really like riding my bike
1056988 the no 1 thing we learned is how inexpensive it is to really change the world
1056989 for less than 500 we can save 30 to 40 percent of the energy in our home ive gotten in better shape just from riding my bike and walking more
1056990 its good for the planet that you brought your own bag
1056991 they get a group of them together circle an area then go to work
1056992 yes you may be able to save some trout but there are subtle things that can go on that im not sure that fishermen think about
1056993 from the data we have 80 to 90 percent of their diet is trash fish
1056994 it kind of boils down between a fight between whats most important managing a species of greatest conservation need and appeasing the sportsmen that pay for managing the sport fish
1056995 the pelicans have really lined up on the banks and rocks of the blackfoot river
1056996 a lot of the tactics they used were designed to isolate him from his support the fbi just continued to push his buttons
1056997 what we learn will not change the fact that this has been a poorly handled investigation that has lasted 6 years and already has resulted in a trail of embarrassment and personal tragedy
1056998 its curious if hardly surprising that none of the major outlets reporting the news bothered to note that the attacks were all made on perceived
1056999 no i didnt i didnt know what his affiliations where and thats a good question
1057000 i dont think he ever intended to kill anybody he just wanted to prove look this is possible he probably had no clue that it would aerosolize through those envelopes and kill those postal workers
1057001 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
1057002 the work became even more intense in the aftermath of the 2001 anthrax attack as the field grew tremendously with billions my caps in new federal support for research on anthrax and other potential biological weapons my caps and to buy new drugs or vaccines to handle a possible future attack
1057003 and to create new weapons for use in a possible future attack by the us military
1057004 has the unprecedented boom in biodefense research made the country less secure by multiplying the places and people with access to dangerous germs
1057005 we are putting america at more risk not less risk
1057006 adherence to institute safety procedures by laboratory personnel is lax
1057007 apart from the threat from insiders some public health experts believe money being used to study obscure pathogens that are not a major disease problem could be better directed to study known killers like influenza or aids
1057008 by this time next week it should be back to normal its almost normal today

1057011 with the traditional u s driving season a bust so far the earnings outlook for the rest of the year remains weak
1057012 looking forward we expect near term credit metrics across the sector to decline relative to last year
1057013 you broke your leg to fix that just liberalize your market
1057014 we see political instability first because we go down as far as we can into the market
1057015 i like the fact that every two years you get a new car and you dont have to pay anything to return it
1057016 i cant drive a car for six or seven years i just cant do that
1057017 it was idiotic if not suicidal to attempt to go down there in shorts and sandals
1057018 it always amazes me how many of our engineers are hidden musicians
1057019 the story is a long complicated one winding its way from china to france by way of the first world war the oil cartel the pharmaceutical cartel and iraq to its final destination a syringe full of something claiming to be a vaccine against the newly deadly avian flu
1057020 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering in the united states fusing the deadly genome of the 1918 pandemic misnamed the spanish flu with the dna of the innocuous h5n1 virus in a growth medium of human kidney cells according to the national institutes of health and the vaccines manufacturer some virologists believe that this would insure that the man made mutant virus recognizes human cells and knows how to invade them
1057021 a basic virological fact that the public has not been told is that it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist public relations efforts to the contrary if a vaccine is being made against the avian flu virus in its pandemic form that means that the pandemic virus must already exist period end of discussion so the fact that the avian flu vaccine is already being manufactured in china by a wholly owned subsidiary of the french arm of the cartel is not only peculiar but at the very least sinister
1057022 we can see that the pharmaceutical industry and us government are actively preparing for an avian flu pandemic through their own promotional literature and propaganda
1057023 the manufacturers website contains a document which clearly illustrates their business model and how the company successfully capitalizes on the immensely profitable worldwide vaccination market
1057024 given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un weaponized h5n1 virus how can we explain the bush administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 states for what it drums into us is the
1057025 summertime water temperatures similar to those of the north carolina sounds by 2050

1057051 regional account manager for clean energy fuels corp the company proposing to build the shared fueling station in jessup the haulers are paying less for fuel the county is getting hit with less surcharge and the people are getting cleaner air and pay less in taxes
1057052 its cleaner its domestic and it reduces our dependency on foreign oil

1057111 i think you ought to consider yourself a remarkably lucky girl
1057112 why i mean my dear that it only rests with yourself to become lady audley and the mistress of audley court
1057113 you know that nobody asks you to marry sir michael unless you wish of course it would be a magnificent match he has a splendid income and is one of the most generous of men your position would be very high and you would be enabled to do a great deal of good but as i said before you must be entirely guided by your own feelings only one thing i must say and that is that if sir michaels attentions are not agreeable to you it is really scarcely honorable to encourage him
1057114 pray pray dont talk to me mrs dawson i had no idea of this it is the last thing that would have occurred to me

1057276 in certain areas internet coverage has long superseded newspaper coverage review coverage of genre books mystery science fiction romance is far superior in range and for the most part quality than what can be found in newspapers
1057277 since the financial crisis began a year ago weve produced a profit before tax of about 4 7 billion after writing off 6 billion
1057278 ill leave that to you to compare to other people but i think its a reasonably strong performance against a very troubled market situation probably the worst ive seen in 28 years of trading markets
1057279 a shift in the current monetary stance is likely to be a story for 2009 rather than 2008

1057282 party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories obama wrote in a letter to credentials committee chairs alexis herman james roosevelt jr
1057283 accordingly i ask that the credentials committee when it meets on august 24 to approve the delegates for the national convention pass a resolution that would entitle each delegate from florida and michigan to cast a full vote
1057284 im here to audition for the next john mccain tv commercial
1057285 all of us are here because we just want barack
1057286 we believe in what he wants to do ending the war in iraq universal health care
1057287 the extraordinary thing about barack obama is that he understands there is no limit to what the american people can do
1057288 weve seen something much more extraordinary than what youd see in a regular presidential campaign
1057289 we could go issue by issue theres so many reasons he inspires me

1057295 why were so many vanguard investors pouring billions of dollars into the index each month i blame a large part of the mess they are in today on the relentless pitches coming from jack bogle vanguards founder and others at vanguard that one should simply set it and forget it buying an index fund and leaving the driving to the markets
1057296 for the first time in this decade we believe the u s stock market is primed to outperform the global stock market in the near term

1057307 it sounds like an oxymoron the rocky mountain sea kayak club
1057308 the beauty and the serenity the animals that we see are just breathtaking
1057309 unlike a recreational kayak or canoe theyre much more seaworthy
1057310 if youve got the skills you can go out in water with a heavy chop and wind and be perfectly safe
1057311 we can throw it in the trunk and away we go
1057312 if you spend enough time on the water the land starts to feel strange
1057313 for being as close as it is its our favorite the solitude and the quiet its just beautiful
1057314 when we take our friends out for the first time theyll get a big smile on their face
1057315 you put in at loma and come out at westwater
1057316 we get to hang out and hike to places where the only way you can get there is by boat
1057317 weight is a big deal for me food is mostly nutrition whats going to get me up the peak im terrible
1057318 certainly people arent starving but food is just fuel to go farther
1057319 for me food is also an important part of the trip
1057320 im not going to say we look at everything in a gourmet fashion but its nice to have a decent meal when you come back from the trail its warm and satisfying and affordable not just something to fill your stomach
1057321 the key thing ive found is try to do as much prep work at home before you leave all the slicing and dicing you dont want to do in camp
1057322 i just put the ingredients in zip top bags and if were out for prolonged periods we even freeze stews and chili
1057323 you can camp for three or four days and its still preserved the cooking really depends on our activity sometimes we like to lounge and then ill spend more time cooking
1057324 but when we go hiking or fishing when we come back we want something easy to make
1057325 if it requires anything more than boiling water i dont eat it
1057326 when i first started backpacking i lived on ramen noodles and anything else i could scrounge from my mothers pantry and probably was not eating very well
1057327 nowadays you dont need to do that the variety of freeze dried food is infinite
1057328 its got to be easy and simple when youre out there you want to enjoy the outdoors and not spend all your time in the kitchen
1057329 it takes getting down on your hands and knees or even your stomach to examine a mini forest at your toes
1057330 theres something about just being here with the gorgeous blue skies and incredible views
1057331 the alpine tundra is a land of contrast and incredible intensity where the sky is the size of forever and the flowers are the size of a millisecond
1057332 there is no in between in the alpine tundra and for humans who live in an in between sized world comprehension takes time
1057333 theyve developed to a point where they are a true separate species
1057334 a lot of times they look really similar to other alpine flowers but they have evolved genetically to be different
1057335 and youll feel its several degrees warmer micro climates make a huge difference here
1057336 there arent any walls you just get in and swim its just kind of relaxing
1057337 you dont have to turn or stop you can just kind of go
1057338 look at it you dont want to swim in there
1057339 it would take a whole lot to clean it up there is too much grass and vegetation and crawfish
1057340 it took everything i could do to keep these two out of there just now
1057341 they used to use it as a swimming hole long long ago
1057342 to make it a swimming hole again its probably time
1057343 with the countys current financial challenges it is doubtful that we will commit any park funds for identified projects until our financial situation improves
1057344 it would be nice but i dont think we can afford it
1057345 if you just shower afterwards you dont have a problem
1057346 its just the idea there was a problem there its just not going to help you when you try to organize an event
1057347 despite the fact our reservoirs are closed we have quite a bit of opportunity here
1057348 nothing is stock everything is custom the only thing i always start with is the customers needs
1057349 my favorite thing in the world is to see dawn coming in the windows and realize ive been working all night
1057350 i love bikes and i love to make stuff it was natural for me
1057351 not driving not doing a lot of things people do even to the point of not really looking for a girlfriend because im afraid of losing all this
1057352 we talked over what i needed he got me all measured then he started scribbling numbers on a scrap of paper you could see the gears turn in his head
1057353 i said to him youre seeing my bike in your head arent you
1057354 its stable forgiving and as responsive as i could imagine
1057355 and you have to have it spotlessly clean you cant even touch it
1057356 ive had these tubes cut for a month but ive been too chicken to try welding them because im afraid i cant make it perfect now i guess ill find out
1057357 everything was going very well until we arrived in maoz esther
1057358 from behind a little hill suddenly emerged some cars and policemen wearing civilian clothes but with police hats and they arrested the one who shot in the air as well as some of our other escorts who were carrying weapons
1057359 apparently the police were waiting and watching the whole time doing nothing until our boy shot in the air
1057360 the fact is that police forces were there we understood that like last week when there was a violent incident when the hikers came to the bedouin with weapons we were ready because we knew that this was a place of confrontation the bedouin set up cameras and therefore the police were there
1057361 if the police were there and watched the confrontation why did the police not just stand openly and prevent the hikers from passing if it was not permitted why did they not just stop them the situation as i see it looks like an ambush hiding out like thieves in the night im not the one who decides there are officers above me who decide what is overt and what is concealed

1057383 i am not going to voice my opinion about anything that fernando has done or said
1057384 what i would say is you cant see any strings leading to heikkis shoulders or you cant see anyones hands up his back
1057385 hes an honest guy and i think he will more than convince anyone who talks to him that this is a team that is absolutely committed to equality
1057386 people will point to the last grand prix and say its absolutely obvious there were team orders in that event because it was clear that heikki moved over and let lewis past
1057387 the simple fact was that throughout that race lewis was nearly seven tenths of a second faster than heikki and he heikki knew that he was told that
1057388 but when youre in a team and you know that your team mate has the opportunity of winning the race if you have the right values and values that are not solely and exclusively lodged in your own motives and objectives and your own selfishness then you take a decision which is to allow the driver past and give him the chance to finish the race which he did
1057389 and if you go back through the entire history of mclaren you can talk to any driver who has driven for mclaren and you will not find anyone save for one who will not verify that this team always runs on the basis of equality and always will

1057428 one of the big mistakes that many meeting planners make is not considering food and beverage when they begin looking at a property theyre so intent on finding space that they dont even ask about it
1057429 if you dont know the food and beverage prices at that point you might get a great room rate but really get hurt on food and beverage taxes and gratuities
1057430 most meeting planners dont meet the catering people during site visits or even before signing the contract
1057431 they may talk to the sales manager but they rarely talk to the food and beverage people im not saying that salespeople cant answer their questions but if they really want to know what we can provide they should talk to the catering manager and chef even if its just for five or 10 minutes
1057432 we cant negotiate something thats not good for both you and me
1057433 i cant for example sell you a bottle of wine for 25 if it cost me 30 but i will find you a bottle of wine thats affordable and is good quality the key to negotiation is a bit of compromise on both sides
1057434 and would probably be widely accepted for the right piece of business
1057435 dont pretend you want a champagne meeting if you have a beer budget
1057436 if cost is very important to you dont make the mistake of picking a printed menu item and asking for it at a lower price the catering manager will likely give you a laundry list of reasons why it cant be done
1057437 say to the hotel heres my food and beverage budget and this is what it has to cover this number of continental breakfasts four course lunches receptions and dinners
1057438 tell them how many people you expect at each function and whether your budget includes tax and gratuity then allow them to play with those numbers it really does make a difference when you ask what they can do for you rather than coming in with preset ideas they will often do things that are much more creative than whats on the printed menus
1057439 if you have something in mind that youre looking for and you give the hotel the flexibility to create it youll get a better package overall than if you come to me and say i want filet mignon and shrimp and caesar salad and i want it at this price
1057440 meeting planners often focus on the price of one meal instead of looking at the entire food and beverage picture
1057441 if we can concentrate on your group we dont have to go out and look for other business to fill that space so theres a lot less effort on our part than if you say youre only going to have one dinner on site and the rest of the time the attendees are going to be on their own
1057442 they might not give you a cocktail party but maybe theyll give you wine and beer
1057443 always ask the worst thing they can do is say no
1057444 about the only time a hotel can live with such a short time period is when the client is ordering standard food and beverage items that are offered on the other hotel restaurant menus
1057445 anything more complex or unique must be implemented at least 48 hours in advance
1057446 we would never negotiate 24 hours because it places an unfair burden on the kitchen
1057447 we dont consider it fair to the facility and we dont think we would get the best service for our clients either forty eight hours is ideal these days but many facilities have gone to 72 hours and whether youll be able to negotiate 48 hours will depend on the individual properties
1057448 first look at whats missing then look at what needs to be added
1057449 its a tough game because you can spend a lot of money on food and labor thats not utilized
1057450 we could go as high as 10 percent on almost any buffet or continental breakfast but if its a very specialized meal and were ordering things that we dont normally have in stock its hard to be flexible
1057451 what used to happen is that if you had a guarantee of 20 the kitchen would plate up 22 dinners but now they really work hard to not overplate
1057452 once they put the food on a plate they cant do anything else with it
1057453 invariably people tend to be under on their guarantees so its a smart decision on the hotels part but were close on our guarantees because we know our clients very well
1057454 thats why its in our contracts but the banquet manager and the kitchen staff dont see the contracts so you still need to remind people on site that they must be prepared to serve
1057455 an attrition clause is good in the sense that it makes meeting planners look at their liability closely it makes them think about what theyre signing
1057456 so if youre promising to bring a food and beverage function to a hotel youd better do it
1057457 if the hotel wants you to guarantee 150 000 and you usually do 200 000 you may feel comfortable but if you usually do 50 000 that would be a stretch
1057458 you have to make sure that the minimum is within your comfort level
1057459 if you low ball and say youre doing a lunch for 150 when you expect 300 the hotel will hold space for only 150 and then you wont have enough room for everyone
1057460 youre the one who will be hurt in the end
1057461 meeting planners for associations dont know how much theyre going to spend on food and beverage five years out the meeting may shrink or expand they dont have a crystal ball and they need a fudge factor because its not an exact science
1057462 the closer the arrival date the smaller the percentage of attrition
1057463 if its a year or two out and you think the numbers arent going to be there let us know and we can make adjustments
1057464 if a function needs to be canceled cancel it and ill try to sell the space to someone else dont wait until 72 hours before the event to tell us that the numbers arent going to be there
1057465 if i cancel a 10 000 banquet a month in advance the hotel hasnt lost 10 000 because the food hasnt been bought and the staff hasnt been scheduled the hotel may have lost 3 000 to 4 000
1057466 local food and beverage functions such as wedding receptions club luncheons and bat mitzvahs are typically booked on shorter notice than major meetings
1057467 the hotel is not entitled to be compensated twice for the same thing
1057468 if attendance is down and youre 10 000 short you could add or upgrade functions do something for the benefit of the members
1057469 do you want to stand here and keep watching them throw fish
1057470 apparently its all you do here lets go back to the hotel and talk about them throwing fish
1057471 holy f cking shit whats up with these f cking hills

1057502 and god said unto moses make thee a brazen serpent and all that look upon it shall live
1057503 it wriggled raised its head up opened and shut its mouth moved its tongue hissed and shook its rattles
1057504 it was operated by a small motor with levers and cams underneath moving it it was something to see

1057508 when we become accustomed to looking at the reflection of the sun in the water we shall turn to gaze upon the sun itself certainly the essential function of a tree is to produce fruit in season still the foliage that its branches also bear serves to adorn it in the same way the primary fruit of the soul is truth itself but the garb of natural culture is a welcome addition just as leaves provide shade for the fruit and add to its beauty thus moses a man of the greatest renown for his wisdom is said to have come to the contemplation of him who is only after being trained in egyptian lore so later the wise daniel is said to have been first schooled in babylon in the wisdom of the chaldeans and only then to have come to know divine revelation

1057540 over the past several centuries people have mistakenly linked democracy and political freedom to christianity thats why many contemporary evangelicals believe the american revolution was completely justified both politically and scripturally they follow the arguments of the declaration of independence which declares that life liberty and the pursuit of happiness are divinely endowed rights therefore those believers say such rights are part of a christian worldview worth attaining and defending at all cost including military insurrection at times but such a position is contrary to the clear teachings and commands of romans 13 1 7 so the united states was actually born out of a violation of new testament principles and any blessings god has bestowed on america have come in spite of that disobedience by the founding fathers
1057541 so i exhort the elders among you as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of christ as well as a partaker in the glory that is going to be revealed shepherd the flock of god that is among you exercising oversight not under compulsion but willingly as god would have you not for shameful gain but eagerly not domineering over those in your charge but being examples to the flock and when the chief shepherd appears you will receive the unfading crown of glory

1057640 government is not a solution to our problem government is the problem
1057641 the expansion of private i e mainly corporate power and the selective abdication of governmental responsibility for the well being of the citizenry
1057642 the privatization of public services and functions manifests the steady evolution of corporate power into a political form into an integral even dominant partner with the state it marks the transformation of american politics and its political culture from a system in which democratic practices and values were if not defining at least major contributory elements to one where the remaining democratic elements of the state and its populist programs are being systematically dismantled
1057643 in 2006 the cost of americas spying and surveillance activities outsourced to contractors reached 42 billion or about 70 percent of the estimated 60 billion the government spends each year on foreign and domestic intelligence the number of contract employees now exceeds the cias full time workforce of 17 500 contractors make up more than half the workforce of the cias national clandestine service formerly the directorate of operations which conducts covert operations and recruits spies abroad
1057644 if theres one generalization to be made about the nsas outsourced it information technology programs it is this they havent worked very well and some have been spectacular failures in 2006 the nsa was unable to analyze much of the information it was collecting as a result more than 90 percent of the information it was gathering was being discarded without being translated into a coherent and understandable format only about 5 percent was translated from its digital form into text and then routed to the right division for analysis
1057645 the key phrase in the new counterterrorism lexicon is public private partnerships in reality partnerships are a convenient cover for the perpetuation of corporate interests
1057646 the separate bookkeeping and accountability devised for blackwater dyncorp triple canopy and similar outfits was part of a careful displacement of oversight from congress to the vice president and the stewards of his policies in various departments and agencies to have much of the work parceled out to private companies who are unaccountable to army rules or military justice meant among its other advantages that the cost of the war could be concealed beyond all detection
1057647 bill clinton picked up the cudgel where the conservative ronald reagan left off and took it deep into services once considered inherently governmental including high risk military operations and intelligence functions once reserved only for government agencies by the end of clintons first term more than 100 000 pentagon jobs had been transferred to companies in the private sector among them thousands of jobs in intelligence by the end of his second term in 2001 the administration had cut 360 000 jobs from the federal payroll and the government was spending 44 percent more on contractors than it had in 1993

1057652 so many former intelligence officers joined the private sector during the 1990s that by the turn of the century the institutional memory of the united states intelligence community now resides in the private sector thats pretty much where things stood on september 11 2001
1057653 whats the one way democrats might possibly blow this election
1057654 in a time of hype telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
1057655 in a free society which relies on the engagement of citizens in debate and protest and political activity to maintain that freedom you should be able to attend a meeting about an issue you care about without having to worry that government spies are entering your name into a database used to track alleged terrorists and drug traffickers
1057656 does not inappropriately curtail the expression or demonstration of the civil liberties of protesters or organizations acting lawfully
1057657 there were about 75 80 protestors at the rally and none participated in any type of civil disobedience or illegal acts
1057658 protesters were even careful to move out of the way for division of correction employees who were going into the parking lot for work

1057668 as todays briefing showed us there are strong reasons to suspect that iran was working covertly and deceitfully at least until recently to build a bomb
1057669 iran has refused to explain or even acknowledge past work on weaponization
1057670 when combined with irans determined effort to master the technology to enrich uranium
1057671 uranium enrichment is not necessary for irans civil program but it is necessary to produce the fissile material that could be weaponized into a bomb
1057672 a blockade is a major military operation too its an act of war
1057673 im as mad as hell and im not going to take this anymore
1057674 generally speaking within 5 years you are about back where you were so my husband and i decided well take the hit and live with it
1057675 this is the kind of conversation thats going on at cocktail parties at swimming pools
1057676 and suddenly this option which was truly unthinkable in the past becomes thinkable
1057677 i think people are taking a more cold hearted look at it
1057678 is the bank going to pay for my retirement because i was a good girl and paid my mortgage even though legally i didnt have to
1057679 if all that is needed is that the house value is less than the mortgage value there is a large number of homeowners in the united states who are in that situation
1057680 i would say its probably 70 of the volume of our foreclosures right now
1057681 its a business decision for their family that the smartest thing they can do is walk away from their home
1057682 the losses for the financial system from people walking away could be of the order of one trillion dollars when the entire capital of the us banking system is only 1 3 trillion
1057683 you could have most of the us banking system wiped out so this is a total disaster
1057684 in a time of hype telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
1057685 social mobility is now less fluid in the united states than in other affluent nations indeed a poor child born in germany france canada or one of the nordic countries has a better chance to join the middle class in adulthood than an american child born into similar circumstances
1057686 the average income of the top fifth of us households in 2006 was almost 15 times that of those in the lowest fifth or 168 170 versus 11 352
1057687 growing inequality in income distribution and wealth raises a profound question for americans can the uniquely middle class nation that emerged in the twentieth century survive into the twenty first century or is it fracturing into a land of great extremes
1057688 the answers to these questions will determine the future of america
1057689 some americans are living anywhere from 30 to 50 years behind others when it comes to issues we all care about health education and standard of living
1057690 woefully behind when it comes to providing opportunity and choices to all americans to build a better life
1057691 in a time of hype telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
1057692 in a time of hype telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
1057693 gave its tacit approval to a series of bomb attacks in italy in the 1960s and 1970s
1057694 following the directives of its government wanted to create an italian nationalism capable of halting what it saw as a slide to the left and for this purpose it may have made use of rightwing terrorism
1057695 i believe this is what happened in other countries as well
1057696 those massacres those bombs those military actions had been organised or promoted or supported by men inside italian state institutions and as has been discovered by men linked to the structures of united states intelligence
1057697 you must abandon your policy of bringing all the political forces in your country into direct collaboration or you will pay dearly for it
1057698 claimed that he played a critical role in the fate of aldo moro
1057699 jolted into action by the fear that moro would reveal state secrets in an attempt to free himself
1057700 prepare the italian public for the worst and to let the red brigades know that the state would not negotiate for moro and considered him already dead
1057701 the decision was made in the fourth week of the kidnapping when moros letters became desperate and he was about to reveal state secrets
1057702 it was an extremely difficult decision but the one who made it in the end was interior minister francesco cossiga and apparently also prime minister giulio andreotti
1057703 other secret services of the west might be implicated in the destabilisation of our country
1057704 containing damaging criticisms of prime minister giulio andreotti by murdered christian democratic leader aldo moro
1057705 francesco pazienza a former financier linked to several criminal cases in italy and licio gelli the former grandmaster of the so called p 2 masonic lodge
1057706 translation maybe in a year or two or three well get up to your area
1057707 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle
1057708 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1057709 the chief of police cannot be required to disclose the video pursuant to a public records request when it pertains to pending criminal litigation until such litigation is finally adjudicated or otherwise settled
1057710 we are not aware of any provisions which grant the mayor of shreveport or the members of the city council of shreveport the right to view records in the custody of the shreveport police department outside of their right to examine records pursuant to a public records request

1057719 well maybe the dogs were making noise in his yard
1057720 well its not your car you didnt pay for it
1057721 i think the us financial system is basically sound i truly do
1057722 since 1951 the budget of the department of defense each year exceeds the net profits of all u s corporations so in finance capital terms that means that the management of that budget controls the largest single block of finance capital resources
1057723 the first panacea for a mismanaged nation is inflation of the currency the second is war both bring a temporary prosperity both bring a permanent ruin but both are the refuge of political and economic opportunists
1057724 foreign dollar investors have been taxed by the american feds policy of benign neglect regarding the dollar
1057725 i know youre disappointed that you couldnt have that brownie
1057726 its not so much learning as freestyle jam making chaos
1057727 to me fallen fruit is the idea of identifying resources which are already there but you didnt know you had them
1057728 inevitably everyones got a personal narrative attached to fruit those when i was a kid stories
1057729 what i like most is that this gets people in l a together who would normally never talk thats the goal more than the jam interaction
1057730 we get bikers from the valley foodies from the westside organic granola types from echo park curiosity seekers from orange county its a great mix
1057731 too good to be true just sold it this morning
1057732 by hiding behind the anonymity of the internet they can make more money with less risk of getting caught than selling to a stranger on a street corner who might turn out to be a police officer this bill would lift that cloak and help law enforcement put on line criminals where they belong behind bars
1057733 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
1057734 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
1057735 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
1057736 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
1057737 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
1057738 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
1057739 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
1057740 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
1057741 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
1057742 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
1057743 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
1057744 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
1057745 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
1057746 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
1057747 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
1057748 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
1057749 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
1057750 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
1057751 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1057752 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
1057753 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
1057754 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
1057755 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
1057756 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
1057757 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
1057758 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
1057759 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
1057760 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
1057761 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
1057762 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
1057763 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
1057764 when you are nervous about everything else you put your money in a toll road
1057765 thats the logic of infrastructure returns are stable and predictable you wont get fabulously rich but youll get stable cash flow
1057766 were just looking at ways to be more efficient and thats why i used the term public private partnerships trying to find some creative solutions
1057767 the reason im avoiding taxes is because i think taxes are addictive
1057768 states are looking for long term solutions in running businesses a public private partnership is a tool in their toolboxes
1057769 were very committed to this space our business activity has increased dramatically even this year
1057770 the argument for a public private partnership is the private sector is a lot smarter about paying attention to costs and because it has skin in the game will be more attentive to maintaining an asset over its life
1057771 elected officials often shortchange funding of maintenance because they dont want to increase user fees or taxes to pay for it
1057772 their election cycle is four years they can pass it on to someone elses watch
1057773 lower and more predictable landing fees and terminal rentals for airlines which certainly arent flush
1057774 warning of a looming economic calamity gov paterson yesterday called an emergency session of the state legislature and raised the specter that new york may have to sell off roads bridges and tunnels to close a massive and still growing budget deficit
1057775 u s economy grows at solid pace in 2nd quarter
1057776 much of the improvement came from the one time bump from economic stimulus payments raising prospects of weaker performance in months ahead
1057777 looking at it from the government point of view theres a strong political motivation to understate the cpi by understating it keeps cola adjustments down on entitlements which are at this point the largest part of the governments budget and by understating cpi the government can minimize the inflationary impact on things such as rents which are indexed to cpi or wages pensions and a whole list of ancillary costs to artificially keep inflation rates down bottom line the published cpi understates the real inflation rate
1057778 while sometimes devastating these global relative price pressures are not the same thing as inflation
1057779 the fed remains skeptical that high commodity prices will ripple through the economy leading to broad price hikes and big wage increases
1057780 as consumers spend more money for higher priced petroleum and agricultural goods they eventually have less money to spend on other goods and services other relative prices must then fall
1057781 products of public policies which deeply affect markets supply and demand consumers producers and speculators
1057782 declining capitalist investment in the productive economy the vast increase of capital flowing in the paper economy the huge increases in profits and the grotesque salaries bonuses and payoffs to senior executives totally unrelated to performance
1057783 in other words in the contemporary economy inflation benefits the wealthy because they pay their workers in deflated currency while they can take advantage of inflation to further jack up prices and then income thus the upper classes have fortified their economic positions to take account of inflation through their power over prices income and other compensations in a way that wage workers and people on fixed income and other vulnerable sectors cannot bankers protect their loans via adjustable interest rates monopoly resource owners jack up prices to retain profits wholesalers mark up prices to compensate for higher commodity prices large scale retailers squeeze final consumers the great majority at the bottom of the production and distribution chain
1057784 in asia particularly pakistan india indonesia south korea philippines nepal mongolia and china hundreds of millions of workers peasants artisans and low paid self employed workers as well as housewives and pensioners have engaged in sustained mass protests as they experience a decline in the quality and quantity of food purchases as prices skyrocket in africa hunger stalks the land and major food riots have occurred from egypt through sub saharan africa to south africa in the caribbean central and south america food riots have led to the overthrow of regimes mass protests road blockages from argentina bolivia through colombia venezuela and haiti
1057785 the global food and fuel crisis has hit haiti harder than perhaps any other country pushing a population mired in extreme poverty towards starvation and revolt hunger burns are called swallowing clorox a brand of bleach the uns food and agriculture organization predicts haiti s food import bill will leap eighty percent this year the fastest in the world food riots toppled the prime minister and left five dead in april emergency subsidies curbed prices and bought calm but the cash strapped government is gradually lifting them fresh unrest is expected
1057786 when i was serving a sentence on robben island during the struggle to end apartheid in south africa i never suspected that the end of white minority rule in my home country would be the beginning of yet another struggle for justice this time against the world bank and the international monetary fund
1057787 as architects of the global economy the world bank and the imf have enormous power and shape the conditions of peoples lives around the world
1057788 i live now in the united states where people so far are relatively unscathed by the reordering of the global economy for the benefit of the very rich
1057789 the imf and world bank with the structural adjustment programs saps they impose on indebted countries and their pro corporate development projects are the leading edge of oppressive globalization the policies they have imposed in africa latin america and asia have condemned people to stagnation poverty and death for twenty years and those policies are now being adopted in the countries of europe and north america too
1057790 although some of them may have tricked themselves into believing that the neo liberal economic model they defend is immutable like a law of nature most of them probably know that they are perpetrating a fraud of global proportions michael camdessus who retired after thirteen years as managing director of the imf told a group of u s religious leaders that he was willing to sacrifice a generation in order to realize the so called benefits of the macroeconomic model
1057791 given the reluctance of india and other developing nations to sacrifice food security measures in the wake of the recent global spike in food prices
1057792 we see many of the essential ingredients for a classic asset bubble said edward morse chief energy economist at lehman brothers morse estimated that 90 billion has flowed into the biggest commodity indices in just more than two years and more money has flowed into other exchanges pushing up prices
1057793 the cftcs economists are saying that supply and demand seem to be driving this but we have clients in the business that have experienced these markets for many many years and what im hearing from them is that they dont see any change in the fundamentals of supply and demand
1057794 is it a matter of institutional investors seeking shelter from the subprime crisis and the credit crunch
1057795 i dont know but i do know that speculators as a class do not agree on anything and yet there is almost unanimity of opinion these days and the money to make the opinions matter the fact that prices have been relentlessly trending up suggests a new type of market participant with a mentality that is traditionally more in line with investing in securities than trading in commodities if enough of these wealthy people or funds or other entities with a lot of capital decide to flip out of securities for a little while and go into commodities and theyre all looking for something that is going up and you get enough billions of dollars thinking that way then their wish comes true
1057796 the situation now is that the cftc is sitting there looking at one screen one piece of the picture which is whatever is happening on the exchanges meanwhile an increasing volume in dollars is taking place in the form of over the counter activity where no one can see it there is still a blind spot with respect to the true over the counter activity that is going on which represents billions and billions of dollars
1057797 in 2000 congress decided that there were certain kinds of high end investors that were big enough and smart enough that they shouldnt be constrained to do all their business on the exchanges
1057798 public safety and preparedness agencies like the vermont state police corrections the national guard and veterans affairs will not be cut neither will debt service which the state must pay
1057799 aimed at getting split cord wood into the sheds of low and moderate income vermonters
1057800 we used to be more reliant on our backyards and forests for fuel i think we have to head back there in the future were kind of going forward into the past

1057804 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
1057805 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
1057806 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1057807 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
1057808 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
1057809 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
1057810 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
1057811 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
1057812 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
1057813 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
1057814 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
1057815 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
1057816 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
1057817 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
1057818 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
1057819 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
1057820 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
1057821 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
1057822 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
1057823 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
1057824 who are open to doing something on the production side
1057825 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
1057826 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
1057827 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
1057828 what do i need to do baby what did i do wrong hey what happened i thought you were getting wild
1057829 what do i have to do to see more buy some french fries pizza
1057830 what do i need to do i want tog et wild
1057831 what you need to do is put on your pants and leave
1057832 but i want to see more do you guys get crazy in there
1057833 she isnt a stripper she is a dancer but she doesnt take off her clothes not now not ever and not in my restaurant now please put on your pants and go about your business somewhere else
1057834 would you just put your damned pants on the lady doesnt want to see your drawers now take them and put them on dumbass
1057835 can i step in so i can put on my pants
1057836 you took them off on the street and so as far as i am concerned you should be able to put them back on in the street but i will be nice this once
1057837 you disappear let mom deal with him she wont let him touch you trust me
1057838 i thought she was getting wild im sorry i didnt oh i uh can i come in for dinner
1057839 not without pants or shoes you cannot come in and eat dinner we have standards here
1057840 you dont have any shoes and you dont even know where your shoes are so why dont you just run along now and find something else to do with yourself
1057841 so long as they keep their pants on and their hands to themselves you are all welcome but if they lose any clothes or touch one our dancers or servers or are verbally abusive i and my kitchen crew will come out and ask you to leave and if you dont leave for us the police will come and take you out do you understand
1057842 yes chef i promise that if i bring my boys in theyll act like theyve got manners
1057843 he must have thought it was a strip club but shit he must never have been in a strip club because if you drop your pants in one the bouncers are on you so fast youre on the curb before you can even think of touching your underwear
1057844 it would really suck to have to get in a brawl dressed like this and then be in the front page of the newspaper with some drunk guy knocked out at my feet
1057845 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
1057846 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
1057847 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
1057848 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
1057849 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
1057850 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
1057851 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
1057852 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
1057853 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
1057854 i consider myself a writer only by default because i am writing this and you are reading it then i guess that makes me a writer
1057855 i think that i have expressed my opinion above as to what i think and i have really enjoyed the writing practice that i have done today
1057856 sure why not all i need to do is to type away anyway
1057857 i was watching carte blanche oprah the news and they explained how there is this new method that will cure you
1057858 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
1057859 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
1057860 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
1057861 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
1057862 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
1057863 christina applegate was diagnosed with an early form of breast cancer benefiting from early detection through a doctor ordered mri the cancer is not life threatening

1057865 in a time of hype telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
1057866 the blogs were a bit out of control were very mindful of the media coverage and blogs in controlling misinformation all i can say is were going to continue to stay on top of it the misinformation that came out over the weekend fed a lot of depositors fears
1057867 i think its going to be months that were working our way through this period clearly months but again its a safe banking system a sound banking system our regulators are on top of it this is a very manageable situation

1057878 we always used to watch the olympics as a family growing up
1057879 my dream was winning a gold medal for the united states
1057880 now even though the dream changed a little bit its been kind of bigger than i expected in a way because this story has caught the world by storm im wondering why this girl from south dakota got caught up in this worldwide story
1057881 i need to learn the language im working on it ive only been over there for a year or two and its a difficult language i know a few words but i need to get a lot more words most of the girls speak english so its fine
1057882 if people really do have a hard time with it they should take it up with the olympic committee or fiba im playing well within the rules and i think its a little strange it happens all the time in the olympics for people to get maybe upset or bent out of shape about me is strange because this is something the united states has done many times
1057883 there have been many foreign athletes that have come and competed for the u s and won medals
1057884 i think everyone wants to see the russia america matchup
1057885 if i have to play the united states obviously im going to go out there and compete to win but thats not what i want i know its what everyone else wants but its not what i want
1057886 once the ball went up it was just another basketball game
1057887 you want to meet the u s as late as possible
1057888 i have been playing against those players for 10 years i think when the ball goes up its just going to be another basketball game you just go out there and compete and enjoy the moment since its not going to happen again
1057889 this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and im really looking forward to it
1057890 im glad im not doing as many interviews now just being able to be here and play basketball i think its been put off in the back of my mind for so long just concentrating on what weve been doing in the wnba and now is the first time ive been able to be over here and enjoy the experience
1057891 id love to go watch even if were not taking part in it i hear its pretty tremendous
1057892 im still learning most of the girls on the team three or four of them ive already played with and i have a history with them they are really a good group of girls they are really sweet they have made me feel very welcome and tried to get me accustomed to them very quickly and build chemistry on and off the court
1057893 maria stepanova came up to me and said i was initially against having an american on our team but now that i know you you can play with us any day
1057894 to me that was like a small bridge that had been built thats what the olympics is about its a small microcosm of what the goal should be on a grander scale
1057895 this museum is a fitting tribute to the role african americans have played in our citys rich history of music and art and theres no better location for it than jefferson street
1057896 i am pleased with the foundations fundraising success to date and i look forward to fulfilling the rest of the citys 10 million commitment in the near future
1057897 has nothing to do with the power of the xbox 360 hardware
1057898 but anybody that looks at it as just a one week phenomenon has missed the real point
1057899 by aggregating pages across a huge number of not well vetted sites advertisers had little or no control over where their messages ran or if they appeared on inappropriate content so advertisers placed minimal value on networks as a whole or were simply unwilling to run messages on them
1057900 as the number of ad networks has increased so too has the degree of specialization in the category
1057901 but the basic concept aggregating impressions across sites so that marketers have an easier way to reach consumers and take advantage of better targeting has remained the same
1057902 the web is fragmenting and to capitalize on that you need a vertical ad network that has expertise in the specific area you want to reach whether its travel an ethnic group say hispanics or sports because they know where and how to reach these people without being intrusive
1057903 lots of up and coming companies can afford ad networks because many work for all scales of businesses
1057904 apa2 atau dapet tapi dikit banget itu berarti kita harus bisa memulai tahap pertama memilih dengan lebih bijaksana penuh perhitungan dan tentunya berdasarkan pada pengalaman yang telah didapat dahulu
1057905 since its come up so quickly and so close to the coast its not going to be like hurricane dolly where we were watching it for a week
1057906 people need to take it seriously and allow the possibility that it could be a low end hurricane
1057907 were staffing it up because things could turn nasty quickly
1057908 our biggest concern is downed trees after the event or floodwaters and people needing to be removed
1057909 were also getting travel trailers off the north end of the island
1057910 storms never do exactly what we expect we always prepare for one level of intensity higher than it is
1057911 we love to be able to watch the weather channel as it comes off the coast of africa and moves to the u s
1057912 but a storm can develop within 24 hours and be right on top of us were prepared for those
1057913 if it looks like its headed toward any of our rigs we would evacuate

1057929 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
1057930 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
1057931 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
1057932 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
1057933 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
1057934 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
1057935 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
1057936 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
1057937 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
1057938 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
1057939 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
1057940 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
1057941 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
1057942 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
1057943 have you even read the bible i have cover to cover
1057944 the lords promise is to be our guard and our guide
1057945 an eager or strong desire to achieve something such as fame or power
1057946 in repentance and rest you will be saved in quietness and trust is your strength
1057947 what areas of my life is jesus seeking to still
1057948 my precious son embrace the quiet find security in silence let rest in me be your greatest desire true greatness is found in a gentle and quiet heart filled with the presence of the prince of peace true greatness comes with the knowledge of whose you are true greatness frees you to serve without the expectation of thanks or recognition true greatness is greatly quiet about is accomplishments true greatness gives all the glory back to god true greatness begins in repentance and rest in quietness and trust
1057949 is this the lord talking to me or the devil
1057950 look at what i learn from the scriptures when i rewrite them myself
1057951 god would need some pretty serious photo id before i would act in a way that i knew to be morally reprehensible
1057952 father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done
1057953 boy the whole issue of god verification is an interesting one god would need some pretty serious photo id before i would act in a way that i knew to be morally reprehensible
1057954 it seems to me that identifying god is more a matter of faithful choice than compelling evidence
1057955 abraham was never meant to kill his son he was meant to learn the similitude of the sacrifice of the only begotten son
1057956 what i really think is that abraham was meant to impart the lesson upon his own only begotten son
1057957 besides if isaac grew up not knowing ishmael as far as isaac is concerned he is the only begotten of his father
1057958 but do not forget this one thing dear friends with the lord a day is like a thousand years and a thousand years are like a day
1057959 sounds to me like you dont think jehovah is jesus christ
1057960 and this have ye done again covering the altar of the lord with tears with weeping and with crying out insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more or receiveth
1057961 there seems to be many in the church who would even sacrifice their own children if they believed god told them to do it
1057962 i will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth in pain you will bring forth children yet your desire will be for your husband and he will rule over you
1057963 we are so pleased that such a diverse group of competitors intends to compete for the progressive automotive x prize
1057964 with the first stage race only 17 months away and the price of crude oil now hovering around 120 a barrel consumer interest in the need for such a competition and a long term solution to fuel prices is rapidly growing
1057965 business is like jam you spread it around then everyone gets a share and everyone benefits
1057966 im not a monster im just ahead of the curve
1057967 prior to any implementation employees will be consulted extensively on an individual and collective basis
1057968 in the event this proposal goes ahead the company will endeavour to minimise the impact of the proposal through voluntary redundancy and by redeployment to alternative positions within the company and the jp group
1057969 we are not playing the ostrich we know that when a company airs its intentions to close the times we get a turnaround is one in a million
1057970 with the state of the market as it is chances are pretty remote you have news international and trinity mirror walking around saying we can print everything because they have so much space
1057971 news international are desperate to fill their 85 000 copies per hour presses until they have virtually cornered the market then watch their prices go up
1057972 with the reduction in advertising revenue and circulation along with the most dramatic increase in newspaper printing capacity we have ever seen in the uk it is inevitable that this will continue to happen
1057973 we will do everything we can to alleviate the affect this has on our members most of who have worked in the industry for many decades

1057979 a soft spoken british designer who is apples deputy guru second to jobs himself in matters of beauty elegance and style
1057980 a humorous genius with a thick french accent who is in charge of apples operating system but he might seem to have too much of the mad scientist about him
1057981 the marketing boss and a familiar face because he usually assists the boss on stage in product demonstrations
1057982 singtel should be launching the 3g iphone in singapore before the end of the month
1057983 when you go to most chain restaurants ordering off the kids menu is a nightmare
1057984 right now kids meals are almost all unhealthy meals when they should be almost all healthy meals
1057985 at the very least restaurants should list calories on the menu so that parents can navigate through this minefield of calories and fat to find the healthy options
1057986 there have been a lot of changes to our restaurant menus especially childrens meals more and more options are available restaurants are offering low fat milk yogurt apples and vegetables as part of the childrens menu they are helping parents help their children make wise choices when they dine out
1057987 kids meals can be outrageously high in calories fat and sodium but its possible to go into just about any restaurant and cobble together a healthy meal for a child if the childrens menu doesnt look healthy you have to look elsewhere
1057988 eating out is no longer a special occasion its a lifestyle now so we have to be more selective about what we eat
1057989 this is a wakeup call that parents need to take advantage of restaurants healthier options especially if kids are going to be eating out three or more times a week
1057990 most kids dont clean their plates so they are probably not eating all these calories
1057991 why yes indeed i am thats why im standing here reading the owners manual trying to figure out how to stop the horn blaring and the lights flashing in the middle of an extremely busy car park at 3pm in the afternoon
1057992 a clearly stated commitment of non discrimination would make clear that the commission is not having a one night stand with net neutrality but an affair of the heart and a commitment for life
1057993 a fifth principle should also in my opinion apply to wireless as well as to wireline networks
1057994 we need to establish the important precedent that we will stop the bad actors
1057995 like it or not no notice of proposed rulemaking with a chance for public comment was ever issued nothing regulating internet network governance has been codified in the code of federal regulations in short we have no rules to enforce

1058000 sesungguhnya hawa nafsu itu selalu menyeruh kepada kejahatan kecuali nafsu yang diberi rahmat oleh rabbku
1058001 kebanyakan hawa nafsu itu menyuruh pengekornya kepada kejahatan yaitu kekejian dan seluruh perbuatan dosa
1058002 barangsiapa menhendaki kehidupan dunia maka kami segerakan baginya di dunia itu apa yang kami kehendaki bagi orang yang kami kehendaki dan kami kehendaki baginya neraka jahannam ia akan memasukinya dalam keadaan tercela dan terusir
1058003 janganlah sekali kali kamu terpedaya oleh kebebasan orang orang kafir bergerak di dalam negeri itu hanyalah kesenangan sementara kemudian tempat tinggal mereka ialah jahannam dan jahannam itulah seburuk buruk tempat kembali
1058004 pernahkah kamu melihat orang yang menjadikan hawa nafsunya sebagai ilah nya dan allah membiarkannya sesat berdasarkan ilmu nya dan allah telah mengunci mati pendengaran dan hatinya dan meletakkan tutupan atas penglihatannya maka siapakah yang memberinya petunjuk sesudah allah membiarkannya sesat maka mengapa kamu tidak mengambil pelajaran
1058005 jika kami hendak membinasakan suatu negeri maka kami perintahkan kepada orang orang yang hidup mewah di negeri itu supaya mentaati allah tetapi mereka melakukan kedurhakaan dalam negeri itu maka sudah sepantasnya berlaku terhadapnya ketentuan kami kemudian kami hancurkan negeri itu sehancur hancurnya
1058006 dan mereka memperturutkan hawa nafsunya maka perumpamaanya seperti anjing jika kamu menghalaunya mengulurkan lidahnya dan jika kamu membiarkannya dia mengulurkan lidahnya juga
1058007 jika kalian berjual beli dengan system ienah kalian tersibukkan dengan ternak dan ladang kalian dan kalian meninggalkan jihad maka allah akan menimpakan kepada kalian kehinaan allah tidak akan mencabut kehinaan tersebut sampai kalian kembali kepada agama kalian
1058008 kemaksiatan akan mewariskan kehinaan karena kemuliaan itu hanya dapat diraih dengan ketaatan kepada allah
1058009 hai orang orang yang beriman masuklah kalian kedalam islam secara keseluruhan dan janganlah kalian turuti langkah langak syaithan sesungguhnya syaithan itu musuh yang nyata bagi kalian
1058010 cegahlah campur baur antara laki laki dan perempuan ikatlah kebebasan wanita kembalikan ke masa hijab hal itu lebih baik bagi kalian dari pada kebebasan ke edanan bangsa eropa dan amerika saya telah menyaksikan banyak hal di amerika ternyata bangsa amerika penuh
1058011 bahwa siapa saja yang taat kepada makhluk yang memerintahkan untuk bermaksiat kepada allah niscaya akan mendapatkan kehinaan dan azab allah inilah keberadaan orang yang maksiat kepada utusan allah dari kalangan orang orang musyrik ahli kitab seperti yahudi dan nasrani dan ahli bidah serta orang yang curang dari kalangan umat ini
1058012 dan alangkah ngerinya jika sekiranya kamu melihat ketika orang orang berdosa itu menundukkan kepalanya dihadapan rabbnya
1058013 wahai rabb kami kami telah melihat dan mendengar maka kembalikan kami kedunia kami akan mengerjakan amal shalih sesungguhnya kami adalah orang orang yang yakin
1058014 sesungguhnya kami adalah pengikut pengikutmu maka dapatkah kamu mengidandarkan kami sebagian api neraka
1058015 orang yang lemah yaitu para pengikut akan berkata kepada orang yang sombong yaitu pembesar dan tokohnya
1058016 allah akan membalas kamu disebabkan perbuatanmu masing masing akan membalas kamu disebabkan perbuatanmu masing masing akan disiksa sesuai dengan kezhalimannya
1058017 dan orang orang yang kufur kepada rabbnya mereka memperoleh azab jahannam dan itulah seburuk buruk tempat kembali apabila mereka mendengar suara neraka yang mengerikan sedang mereka menggelagak hampir hampir neraka itu terpecah pecah
1058018 apakah belum pernah datang kepadamu di dunia seorang pemberi peringatan
1058019 benar ada sesungguhnya telah datang kepada kami seorang pemberi peringatan maka kami mendustakan nya dan kami katakan
1058020 we always remember you tim thank you so much for all your dedicated work in this world r i p

1058026 si tu hermano pecare contra ti ve y redarg yele entre ti y l solo
1058027 porque la ira del hombre no obra la justi cia de dios
1058028 no pude materialmente dejar de hablar de esto a otra persona pues sent a yo un peso que me agobiaba
1058029 en la boca de dos o tres testi gos conste toda palabra
1058030 y si no oyere a ellos dilo a la iglesia
1058031 si no oyere a la iglesia tenle por tnico y publicano

1058040 manufacturers are finding ways to nicely equip their entry level vehicles while still keeping the price reasonably low and consumers are reaping the benefits more and more each year
1058041 dan tetaplah memberi peringatan karena sesungguhnya peringatan itu bermanfaat bagi orang orang yang beriman
1058042 allah azza wa jalla mengkhabarkan bahwa peringatan bermanfaat bagi orang orang yang beriman karena pada diri mereka terdapat keimanan rasa takut taubat dan mengikuti ridha allah yang semua itu mengharuskan peringatan tersebut bermanfaat bagi mereka
1058043 oleh sebab itu berilah peringatan karena peringatan itu bermanfaat orang orang yang takut kepada allah akan mendapat pelajaran orang orang kafir dan celaka akan menjauhinya
1058044 sesungguhnya jawaban atas orang orang yang beriman bila mereka diseru kepada allah dan rasul nya agar menghukumi mengadili diantara mereka ialah ucapakan mereka
1058045 adapun orang orang yang beriman bila mereka diseru kepada allah dan rasul nya agar
1058046 kami mendengar hukum allah dan rasul nya dan siap menyambut siapa saja yang menyeru kami kepadanya dan kami akan mentaatinya dengan ketaatan yang sempurna tanpa ada perasaan berat pada diri kami
1058047 ketundukkan kepada kebenaran dan memasrahkan diri kepadanya serta menerima dari siapapun yang mengucapkannya
1058048 siapapun yang angkuh untuk tunduk kepada kebenaran walaupun datang dari anak kecil atau yang dimarahinya atau yang dimusuhinya maka kesombongan kepada allah azza wa jalla karena allah adalah al haq ucapan nya haq agama nya haq al haq datangnya dari allah dan kepada nya akan kembali barangsiapa menyombongkan diri untuk menerima kebenaran berarti dia menolak segala yang datang dari allah dan menyombongkan diri di hadapan nya
1058049 beberapa hari yang ditentukan itu ialah bulan romadhon bulan yang di dalamnya diturunkan permulaan sebagai petunjuk bagi manusia dan penjelasan mengenai petunjuk itu serta pembeda antara yang haq dengan yang batil
1058050 allah taala memuji bulan puasa romadhon diantara bulan bulan lainnya dengan memilih romadhon diantara bulan bulan itu untuk diturunkan yang agung di dalamnya sebagaimana halnya dia mengkhususkan romadhon dengan hal itu maka sungguh ada sebuah hadits datang menyebutkan bahwa romadhon adalah bulan yang diturunkan di dalamnya kitab kitab allah kepada para nabi
1058051 shuhuf ibrahim diturunkan di malam pertama romadhon taurat diturunkan pada 7 ramadhan injil diturunkan pada 14 ramadhan zabur diturunkan pada tanggal 19 ramadhan diturunkan pada 25 ramadhan
1058052 rasulullah shollallahu alaihi wasallam naik ke atas mimbar seraya bersabda
1058053 barangsiapa yang berpuasa di bulan romadhon karena beriman dan mengharapkan pahala niscaya akan diampuni dosa dosanya yang lalu
1058054 jika bulan romadhon telah sempurna maka sungguh puasa dan sholat malam telah lengkap bagi orang beriman maka terjadilah baginya pengampunan dosanya yang lampau dengan sempurnanya dua sebab tersebut yaitu puasa dan sholat malamnya
1058055 sesungguhnya allah pada setiap hari dan malam di bulan romadhon memiliki hamba hamba yang dibebaskan dari neraka sesungguhnya setiap muslim memiliki doa yang ia berdoa dengannya lantaran itu doanya dikabulkan
1058056 jika malam pertama romadhon datang maka setan setan dan jin jin durhaka dibelenggu pintu pintu neraka ditutup
1058057 makna hadits ini menurut saya cuma allah yang lebih tahu allah melindungi di dalamnya kaum muslimin atau dominannya dari maksiat maksiat jadi setan tidak akan bebas datang kepada mereka sebagaimana mereka bebas datang di sepanjang tahun
1058058 sesungguhnya kami telah menurunkannya pada malam kemuliaan lailatul qodar dan tahukan kamu apa malam kemuliaan itu malam kemuliaan itu lebih baik dibandingkan seribu bulan pada malam itu para malaikat dan jibril turun dengan izin tuhannya untuk mengatur segala urusan malam itu penuh kesejahteraan sampai terbit fajar
1058059 allah memiliki di bulan romadhon suatu malam yang lebih baik dibandingkan 1000 bulan
1058060 barang siapa yang b angun sholat malam karena beriman dan mengharapkan pahala niscaya akan diampuni dosa dosanya yang lalu
1058061 hadits tentang umrah ini adalah hadits shohih itu merupakan keutamaan dan nikmat dari allah umrah dapat mencapai derajat haji karena bersatunya romadhon dengan umrah
1058062 dalam hadits ini terdapat keterangan bahwa pahala amal bertambah karena kelebihan mulianya waktu sebagaimana ia bertambah dengan kehadiran hati khusyu dan kesucian niat

1058147 although i think its important that i pass this blog back to my friend and employer the peerless dick madeley i want to post one more time to thank you all for the support youve given me over the last week it has been as unexpected as it has been a welcome and real source of comfort to both myself and my family as of this afternoon my father remains in intensive care but he is being prepared for a move into a high dependency unit which despite the name is apparently a step down from the ward hes currently on although a nurse told us yesterday that my father has spoke he hasnt yet spoken to any of us during our visits but as they keep reminding us it is still only three days since his operation at the moment i still feel a natural unwillingness to move on the traumatised mind is easy prey for superstition i have been living each day unable to do the things i did before however i now need to get back to my old habits and allow richard to get back to writing his blog i need to spend time on my own helping him to complete his next novel time we have been told is the best thing for my father in the case of a sub arachnoid haemorrhage it is supposedly a matter of months of recovery and therapy before a person can return to anything like the life they previously led there is nothing to say what kind of a recovery a person will make there being a difference between a persons medical condition and that more ambiguous type of healing involved in cognitive skills memory personality all we can do is wait and be there for him not having a blog of my own im just grateful that i had a chance to write about these things here although not a personal blog in the traditional sense it has been enough to help me get through this difficult week i intend to come back and write about any further developments if i think it helps me but for the moment i think it right to allow the appreciation society to return to the job for which it was originally tasked to make people smile occasionally think but ultimately provide a forum a soap box a large crate recently stuffed with satsuma from which the great richard madeley can set forth his vision for this country of ours

1058390 the honour of working with blind guardian was really the crowning of our extremely fruitful cooperation with ascaron after providing almost 500 engine ready 3d assets for sacred 2 including characters armour sets buildings weapons shields amulets and other equipment the fact that ascaron entrusted us with the in game models of the band members clearly shows that modern game development rivals hollywood not only by embracing top talent but by bravely implementing creative processes which are traditional in the world of movie making yet still somewhat emergent in our industry

1058393 they still have expensive gas to feed into the system so theyre reluctant to drop prices
1058394 prices never come down as fast as they go up
1058395 the oil markets main focus right now is on any weakness that signals a slowdown in the economy and this personal spending report is further evidence of that

1058401 bob hagan the vikings director of public relations showed me that article last night
1058402 i was in a personnel meeting with rick spielman and george paton until 11 oclock with the coaches i have a pretty good idea how that article went down but you can shape the environment however you want one way or the other we havent had any contact with them
1058403 my comment would be i think thats the same journalist that wrote that there was a cell phone involved that the packers gave favre

1058411 wall street is the source of the problem you see across the country it rose out of the financial sector which spread into the housing sector
1058412 the thing to keep in mind is that wall street is extraordinarily resilient it will come back the only question is when there will be extraordinary opportunities for some
1058413 we know we dont do a good job of bringing new teachers into the district whether its from traditional routes or alternative routes

1058420 it was supposed to make it to orbit and it did not
1058421 we have a boat out trying to recover it but we havent found it at this stage
1058422 they started from scratch they had no legacy hardware or anything else
1058423 its regrettable but theyve hit the same wall which everyone hits which is that you cant test a throw away vehicle
1058424 the best chance weve learned is with a different city and given that were talking 20 to 30 years before we could do it again i think a lot will come down to how brisbane develops in terms of further infrastructure hotels and whatever by then
1058425 i couldnt and wouldnt say to the queensland government or the brisbane city council to go out and build a new swimming pool but infrastructure is important villages in the past have been around university sites for instance it would be smart to at least have somewhere in mind but certainly i wouldnt be counselling them to go building anything because what you build now would be outdated by then
1058426 my view is that this is something brisbane should throw its hat in the ring for
1058427 it is a 10 15 years thing and something we would have to work through
1058428 there are significant issues with brisbanes infrastructure apart from sporting infrastructure hotel roads public transport and water infrastructure needs would have to be addressed
1058429 im very positive about this and quite pleased that john coates has the confidence that brisbane could stage a future olympics
1058430 it is something i want to know for my own heart

1058433 the complaint is to be resolved the paper has amended some online articles and removed others
1058434 the newspaper wishes to make clear that it wasnt in any way anti polish
1058435 we are pleased that the daily mail could see that some of the wording they had in their headlines was harmful and they have taken far more care
1058436 if you take the balance of articles published by us the polish migrant has not been identified as a hate figure and we have often and continuously drawn attention to the benefits britain has and does derive from the skills that immigrants bring us
1058437 we ran an in depth series the new britons by fiona barton which had a very balanced and fair assessment of the virtues of polish immigrants
1058438 the headline on a major feature by one of our top writers read poles apart hard working reliable honest meet the polish builders plumbers and decorators putting work shy britons to shame

1058516 what he will be calling for in speech today is a swap out of light crude for heavy crude
1058517 the heavy crude will be replaced in the reserve at a later date so that we can get oil into the market
1058518 i do not believe that we should use this strategic oil reserves at this point
1058519 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said that we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency
1058520 senator obama has looked at the issue he recognized that americans are suffering that we have a unique situation with rising gas prices
1058521 this is one occasions where we really need to look at this strategically and he made the decision that we do need to tap the strategic petroleum reserve
1058522 we the citizens of the united states of america have the ultimate responsibility to elect the
1058523 that we shouldnt be tapping the reserve to provide a small short term decrease in gas prices
1058524 agree with the presidents decision to release oil from the strategic petroleum reserve to help replenish supply shortages resulting from hurricane katrina
1058525 that this tragedy makes it very clear that that the reserve should only be used in the event of an emergency and that we shouldnt be tapping the reserve to provide a small short term decrease in gas prices
1058526 if barack obama is serious about trying to fix this problem

1058673 this thoughtful examination of a surprisingly significant biblical theme will richly reward all who read it it offers that rare combination of careful insightful exegesis and perceptive application from which not only biblical scholars but all christians can benefit
1058674 we become what we worship is biblical theology at its best weaving together old and new testament texts into a unified message beales work is original yet traditional profound yet simple exegetical yet hyperexegetical sometimes provocative yet always profitable for the scholar yet for every serious christian his message that we resemble what we revere either for ruin or for restoration is convincing and convicting
1058675 this is an original brilliant and most satisfying treatment of a theme central to biblical understanding but often misunderstood or ignored in the modern church this book requires careful study but it repays far more than it requires
1058676 this stimulating and in depth study on idolatry is vintage greg beale beale argues that we become like the idols we worship and he makes his case through a careful intertextual study of the scriptures insights abound as beale unfolds the biblical text we are reminded afresh that idolatry is the root sin and that it is so heinous because it robs god of the glory and praise and honor that he alone deserves
1058677 nothing else comes even close to this authoritative analysis of the destroying power of idolatry and its comparison to the renewing power of true worship of the one real god beales relentlessly thorough coverage of the biblical material using a purposely maximalist approach gives the reader a close look at every possible reference to relevant passages no matter how obscure or tangential so that no stone is left unturned in demonstrating how idolatry ancient or modern ruins peoples lives any biblical preacher or teacher would benefit from this book
1058678 this profoundly insightful study of idolatry brings into the spotlight a topic of exceptional significance illuminating a wide range of biblical passages professor beale skillfully elucidates the life defining and transforming nature of worship both true and false everyone who reads this book will be deeply challenged to reflect afresh upon the way in which what we revere shapes not only our present lives but also our future destinies

1058697 i think we would have a hard time getting public support for this concept
1058698 we would certainly have some hesitation just based upon tourism and the natural beauty along the coast
1058699 we certainly wouldnt want to do anything that would kill the goose that laid the golden egg

1058746 we think a reasonable approach is to sweep the spill dry during loading and unloading most of the spills occur then
1058747 given the sheer volume of cargo that has been dumped over this time frame and the likelihood that such sweepings would be concentrated in ports and shipping lanes it is presumptuous to state that bottomlands in these areas suffer only minor indirect adverse effects without conclusive evidence to demonstrate such a statement

1058794 in 1999 british dramatist john caird prepared a significant reworking of candide for the royal national theatre songs were reordered characters more fully developed and most importantly caird returned to voltaires novel the ardens production will mark the premiere of the musical in an american regional theatre
1058795 i am extremely excited by this new version of candide it is funny insightful compelling and because john returned to voltaires original novel quite different from all previous versions
1058796 i have a great passion for musical theatre and an ongoing interest in adapting literature for the stage so working with john on this most remarkable musical has been an extraordinary opportunity

1059071 green carbon the role of natural forests in carbon storage
1059072 natural forests are more resilient to climate change and disturbances than plantations
1059073 protecting the carbon in natural forests is preventing an additional emission of carbon from what we get from burning fossil fuel
1059074 the majority of biomass carbon in natural forests resides in the woody biomass of large old trees commercial logging changes the age structure of forests so that the average age of trees is much younger
1059075 the carbon stock of forests subject to commercial logging and of monoculture plantations in particular will therefore always be significantly less on average than the carbon stock of natural undisturbed forests

1059099 this was a humbling experience i am not used to having to toot my own horn and am not always comfortable with it
1059100 i am not a politician of course we will have to wait and see if i have an opponent but this first step is over and i am looking forward to meeting the people out in the counties over the next several months
1059101 each and every year you prepare your body in the off season you think youre bigger you think youre faster you think youre stronger but at the same time its just another year and youre going to set new goals so its going to be a whole new mindset
1059102 last year we didnt do too good on the coverage unit this year were looking forward to doing better special teams is big its possession for the offense and its gaining possession for the defense as well so weve got to try and use that field position as well as we can
1059103 the second you do youre going to be gone its part of what happens and something you have to roll with its friendly competition it all stays on the field but it makes us better
1059104 i knew i was going to have an opportunity to compete for the spot and thats what im doing
1059105 theyve told me its an open competition im going out there and giving it my best and thats all i can do
1059106 its one of those things thats up to the coaches once again guys fit into systems and thats how you see most of your starters in here they fit the offensive coachs system and philosophy well see if i fit into that philosophy and system
1059107 until game one of the season nobodys considered a starter everybodys one play away from being a starter in this league you dont know whats going to happen unforeseen injuries and everything else that happens
1059108 even when i was with detroit they were in the super bowl i was going crazy like i was a number one steelers fan its good to come home im probably going to play as long as possible so hopefully i can end my career here
1059109 im happy i never knew my eyes are going to be 20 20 and ill be back in action
1059110 i came back four years ago had a little fun im here for a week having a little fun its neat to be back in latrobe smell the grass see the hits
1059111 the steelers are a great organization and a great team i was really excited to get the call and know that im coming out here i was a little jetlagged this morning but im ready to go
1059112 im excited especially nowadays with the current roster for training camp its tough to even get into camp as a punter or an extra specialist im just thankful that theyre giving me the opportunity to make this ball club
1059113 i met him last year we played cleveland last year and he was with them for the first game of the season last year hes a nice guy and he did well today i dont know if hes going to be the guy but if he is well be in good hands
1059114 obviously the timings not the way i want it to be the thing that hurts me the most is putting the team in a bind trying to find someone to hold for jeff reed and greg warren and that whole operation gets thrown for a loop thats one of the hardest things for me to deal with i know what the rehab process has in store for me and im excited about that thats the kind of stuff that gets me fired up im not really worried about that just putting the team in a bind hurts
1059115 but ill do whatever coach mike tomlin tells me to do hes been around a long time so has trainer john norwig so ill defer to them on this but i want to practice
1059116 i talked with coach because i dont want to do anything against the team
1059117 theyre very supportive of me and the training i wanted to do id trained like that for seven years but coming off the injury it gave me an opportunity to take more time to rehab and just train
1059118 it was very awesome training out there before the injury
1059119 things were going very well for me and i got in very good shape i wanted to go back there and get back to doing the type of training i did before i had been doing that the past 5 6 years after the spring coaching sessions but this year i wanted to do it as much as possible i wanted to make sure i got the most out of it after being injured last season
1059120 cowher just went about it a different way i showed up and worked it off tomlin just does it in a different way so since its changed everybody says its a big deal
1059121 were not going to be perfect and some of the things we stressed today didnt necessarily have to do with perfection
1059122 it was about hustling it was about communication it was about finish i was pleased from that standpoint
1059123 its just the first day getting out here first time having pads on in a long time
1059124 things that are easily correctable nothing that anyones panicked about when you set high expectations for an offense and it doesnt live up to it on the first day i guess you kind of have to move on itll be all right tomorrow
1059125 its our first day back in camp man i was tossing and turning all night thinking about it
1059126 i was pretty excited about getting the pads back on but its a long way to go and weve got to stay focused
1059127 for ben santonio nate washington and rookie limas sweed thats our job to go out there and make sure were in the right spot
1059128 every year bens getting comfortable and comfortable so my job is easy
1059129 the best thing is being back with the fellas again seeing everyones smiling faces especially you guys in the media
1059130 if he harrison doesnt want to be blocked its very difficult to block him
1059131 many key moral concepts indeed the workhorses of moral theory are the subjects of defeasible moral generalizations take the example of pain we believe it is important to any adequate morality to recognize that defeasibly pain is bad making
1059132 to understand pains nature then is to understand not just that it is sometimes not bad but to understand that there is an explanatory asymmetry between cases in which it is bad and cases in which it is not it is only because pain is paradigmatically bad making that athletic challenges come to have the meaning they do and hence provide a kind of rich backdrop against which instances of pain can emerge as not bad making as not always and everywhere to be avoided
1059133 i think the audience will really enjoy him letting loose like that

1059137 we were like gosh everyones getting to have their cake and eat it too with 40 year old virgin and wedding crashers
1059138 just this little opening seemed to happen with the way the studios were willing to go ok r rated movies seem to be profitable so well maybe open that door a little bit
1059139 you luckily have some hit movies and then you kind of go ok you want us to do another one
1059140 there was no talk of toning it down there was no intention of making a conventional movie in an attempt to reach a mass audience
1059141 we wouldnt have wanted to do something that didnt reflect the show and didnt respect the audiences investment in the show and what made it different and unique

1059212 this parent that came told me shed never seen her son so excited about anything hes done at school he was so excited about having gone to the museum this is very exciting for them they dont forget it either its something that they keep with them
1059213 and its really important for children children who may or may not be traditionally academically gifted may be blowing in the studio kids are in school for eight hours and adults would never put up with feeling unsuccessful in our today every day society and kids if you give them an area even if its once or twice a week they feel happy and excited about their abilities that can really keep their courage up and keep them going through school

1059225 they like me have no attention span and love to oh look
1059226 its more so like cultural issues like how chinese traditional weddings go compared to an indian wedding i think its a cultural barrier because my parents barely speak english and they would want to be able to speak to their son in law
1059227 i dont know i just never had an attraction to asians
1059228 i think it would be hard for parents because they only get to see their child get married once they want to bring back memories of when they were married and they want to have all the traditions of their own culture it is something that our older generation was brought up with and holds very sacred to them
1059229 there are the different cultures and the cultural barriers different values set apart the families and traditions
1059230 but both of them had their own lives when they were 18 or 19 years old so basically they felt they were free from their parents and later just wanted us to be happy i guess they didnt want to restrict me or my sister

1059234 it isnt a sprint its a marathon weve got to have that attitude
1059235 whatever happens one week it cannot affect the following week
1059236 i want them to be organised and disciplined and when we have the ball i want them to be free to play
1059237 i dont want to see us pigeon holed as a footballing team and we end up losing because we play too much football
1059238 i want us to be considered an effective team and if that means kicking it up the park kick it up the park and score
1059239 ive not had one ounce of trouble from anybody they are an honest group of footballers working hard
1059240 they can have as big as a season as they want im the front man but they have to go out perform and believe in what they are doing

1059242 that has taken a lot of pressure off the market it looks like the thinking is that we dodged another bullet
1059243 they still have expensive gas to feed into the system so theyre reluctant to drop prices

1059249 one thing that bothers me as i have mentioned the past 4 months is the lower depth of the 55 week ma bollinger band it is at 295 8 up from last weeks value of 291 6 i would expect that the lower 55 ma bb to be near 350 380 before triggering the next leg up
1059250 both of us were in pretty good shape for these matches but i had the mental belief that i could win and once you win against someone for the first time you have the feeling that you can do it again and again

1059252 winning a masters series event is tough and it will be hard to follow that up but it gives you a lot of confidence knowing that you can do it said murray
1059253 id rather be in the position im in now than going over there having been knocked out in the first round at cincinnati

1059293 we intend to get into the power station to do whatever we can to stop it operating that day we want to send a very strong message to say new coal is absolute madness and we simply wont allow it
1059294 our main concerns are that coal fired powered stations are worse in terms of co2 production even than oil or gas fired power stations
1059295 it would symbolically be very unfortunate if the uk were to approve a coal fired power station without imposing very strict requirements that some technology should be adopted that would allow it to capture the carbon dioxide it emits

1059344 the 29 who were executed were involved in the smuggling of narcotics on a wide scale organised crime murder and armed robbery
1059345 the iranian regimes action of staging these executions and making them the focus of media attention is an affront to human dignity
1059346 the european union remains convinced that capital punishment cannot form the basis of a fair and effective prosecution policy the dissuasive effect of this penalty has never been proved and any judicial error is irreversible
1059347 the european union is deeply concerned by the increasing recourse to the death penalty in iran in recent months
1059348 it urges the iranian authorities to put an end to death sentences and executions to establish a moratorium with a view to abolishing the death penalty in accordance with the resolution adopted by the united nations general assembly and to respect international human rights standards for all iranians

1059357 but until then i am going to keep on using it
1059358 i think we have to make sure that what we do must be dignified and inclusive

1059368 this study provides a fresh alternative for those who have been confused by the mysticism of influencer marketing consultants
1059369 instead marketers need to realize that the majority of their audience not just the well connected few is eager and willing to pass along well designed and relevant messages

1059373 he spends a substantial amount of time providing strategic and policy advice to clients in renewable energy
1059374 that is what has always motivated him on this issue and will continue to determine his policy going forward
1059375 he wants to represent the united states of america and his policies are based on whats best for the country
1059376 with a number of associations and groups to orchestrate and coordinate their activities
1059377 he has a terrific policy staff and relies primarily on those key people to advise him on key issues whether energy or climate change or other things
1059378 we made a series of mistakes by not adopting a sustainable energy policy one of which is the subsidies for corn ethanol which i warned in iowa were going to destroy the market
1059379 if you want to take some of the pressure off this market the obvious thing to do is lower that tariff and let some brazilian ethanol come in
1059380 we want to evaluate all our energy subsidies to make sure that taxpayers are getting their moneys worth
1059381 reduce overall demand through conservation new technology and improved efficiency
1059382 it does not serve our national and economic security to replace imported oil with brazilian ethanol
1059383 would take a broader view of energy security and recognize the important role that ethanol plays
1059384 hey were here with you on this cold street with you and we sorta care
1059385 were going to commit to at least this much cash to supply clean drinking water aids medicine or whatever the world isnt short on maladies and on dec 23rd if you order a coffee well take 100 of that money and use it to help someone out
1059386 then when the customer orders their coffee give them a pass that logs them onto a site where they can track the progress of the project to keep starbucks in check oh and while theyre on the site they can see how their region city is doing compared to others and they can also see related charities in the countrys region that they can give additional support to
1059387 the community managers primary role is to represent the customer
1059388 the community manager will promote events products and upgrades to customers by using traditional marketing tactics and conversational discussions
1059389 the community manager should first be very familiar with the tools of communication from forums to blogs to podcasts to twitter and then understand the language and jargon that is used in the community
1059390 perhaps the most strategic of all tenets community managers are responsible for gathering the requirements of the community in a responsible way and presenting it to product teams

1059398 from the minute the curtain goes up the charismatic lizzy watts kelly has us in her pocket and with the support of a fiercely intelligent script by mike bartlett and james grieves invisible direction never lets us out to bartletts immense credit he does not provide any answers but he does open the conversation in the very best sense of the phrase this is provocative theatre

1059423 i also recognize that in the house and the senate there are republicans who have very clear ideas about what they want and at some point people are going to have to make some decisions do we want to keep on arguing or are we going to get some things done

1059439 branding is corrupting our culture by heralding emotion over reason surface over core substance and packaging over experience
1059440 more than marketing advertising or positioning branding is an all in one ideology a facile reduction malleable enough to govern all facets of modern business
1059441 by abandoning the trusty dusty principles of business innovative products good service solid management for the idealism of branding companies reveal the true escapist appeal of their new religion
1059442 successful enduring brands are either truly innovative and outstanding or a great value they have never needed much advertising they dont have to reinvigorate their employees with brand morale building or rely shamelessly on empty company taglines their products fulfill the legitimate purpose of the brand
1059443 but the effect of obsessive branding has been a steady erosion in the publics trust
1059444 the world is cheapened when everyone sees it with a marketers eye we lose trust for each other and grow skeptical of one another as we try to determine what were being sold we become more isolated and more self conscious more prone to rely on brands for status and to ally ourselves with other brand loyalists for company
1059445 to combat this obsessive branding disorder we must acknowledge that we will always have brands they are an inevitable medium for communication and commerce
1059446 but if we acknowledge that we must rely on brands to some degree and if we keep our focus on the products rather than the promotions we can begin to extricate ourselves from a world of brand churches tribes and religion
1059447 i have never doubted the truth of signs adso they are the only things man has with which to orient himself in the world what i did not understand is the relation among signs i behaved stubbornly pursuing a semblance of order when i should have known well that there is no order in the universe
1059448 but in imagining an erroneous order you still found something
1059449 what you say is very fine adso and i thank you the order that our mind imagines is like a net or like a ladder built to attain something but afterward you must throw the ladder away because you discover that even if it was useful it was meaningless the only truths that are useful are instruments to be thrown away
1059450 branding is corrupting our culture by heralding emotion over reason surface over core substance and packaging over experience
1059451 those of you deep into word of mouth marketing and social media will already know much of what pete shares
1059452 i would argue that today companies dont just need to tell good stories they also need to tell credible ones credibility rules the day and if a companys story doesnt foster trust if it doesnt convey transparency and authenticity if it isnt informed by listening and responding to customers and it isnt positively affirmed by what consumers are saying to one another then its just another phony story and consumers will see right through it
1059453 shopping at sales is just one of the ways i fool myself when it comes to money
1059454 satsifed customers tell three friends angry customers rell 3 000
1059455 credibility may not be on your balance sheet but its the best asset you have
1059456 to make the most out of amping up a companys credibility meter blackshaw says businesses must max out these six drivers trust authenticity transparency listening responsiveness and affirmation
1059457 most of us have two lives the life we live and the unlived life within us between the two stands resistance are you a writer who doesnt write a painter who doesnt paint an entrepreneur who never starts a venture then you know what resistance is
1059458 resistance arises from within it is self generated and self perpetuated resistance is the enemy within
1059459 procrastination is the most common manifestation of resistance because its the easiest to rationalize
1059460 aspiring artists defeated by resistance share one trait they all think like amateurs they have not yet turned pro
1059461 why have i stressed professionalism so heavily in the preceding chapters because the most important thing about art is to work nothing else matters except sitting down every day and trying
1059462 simple things can be more complex than they seem and complex things more simple
1059463 simple things can be more complex than they seem and complex things more simple
1059464 companies that focus on delivering remarkable products and services attract significant attention from customers conditioned to a retail world in which the necessities are bought and sold without fuss or feeling
1059465 companies that put their money behind their brand and not their business fail to realize that the business is the brand
1059466 starbucks learned the most effective way to spend its marketing dollars is not on making funnier television commercials but rather on making better customer experiences
1059467 lasting brand loyalty is built on making the common uncommon
1059468 measuring the reputation of a brand can and should be as simple as measuring the reputation of a company something that is earned through purposeful execution and not merely fabricated to exploit a worthwhile business opportunity
1059469 the challenge for a company that chooses to open its doors and grow its business based on quality products and services and quality customer experiences is that it has only one shot to make a meaningful customer connection customers will overcome their aversion to higher prices if the product or service they are buying is well worth it
1059470 businesses can simplify sales strategies by focusing on acquiring new customers getting current customers to buy more more often and or raising prices it really is that simple
1059471 growth was and is encouraged and made possible by wanting to meet the desires of customers more than wanting to meet sales or profit projections starbucks steadfast drive to become the best coffee retailer has resulted in its being the biggest coffee retailer it can often work out that way but it never seems to work in the reverse
1059472 what is the benefit of the benefit of your best selling product or service think about its most important feature and make it more personal until youve reached the ultimate experience your customers derive from it
1059473 needs are basic needs are rational needs are boring needs have been commoditized every unremarkable business seems to be in the needs fulfilling business wants are emotional wants are aspirational wants are thrilling wants are where the profits are only truly remarkable businesses are in the business of satisfying customer wants by helping customers actualize their aspirations
1059474 delivering on promises is not enough today businesses big or small must find ways to over deliver on their promises implied and expressly stated to customers the most important part of over delivering on promises to customers is having conscientious employees who make over delivering a part of their everyday on the job way of life
1059475 experiences provide customers with rich and compelling stories to share with others while products typically satiate immediate basic needs
1059476 the best internal culture a company could hope for is one where the employees are so loyal they spread word of the company and its product with fierce passion a culture where employees go way beyond being minions to being missionaries
1059477 brands are made possible by people because unlike products and services competitors cannot replicate a brands promise or their passion
1059478 but it is vitally important for a healthy growing business to have more brand credits than debits
1059479 stop thinking like a marketer and start thinking like a customer

1059481 mcdonalds sales data suggest that these specialty coffee drinks now in at least 1 700 locations arent selling well a chart of the six major areas where the company is selling the drinks shows that sales in most markets peaked about three weeks after the drinks launched then declined in the following weeks in some cases sharply according to company documents reviewed by the wall street journal in kansas city mo for instance the average number of specialty coffee drinks sold per restaurant peaked in early december at 359 as of the last week in june that average had fallen to 217

1059484 jetblue is missing the point with its recent ad push what it needs is to get back to what made it a media and consumer darling customer service and good internal and external communication
1059485 convincing more people to fly doesnt seem like a smart move for an airline that has trouble handling the passengers it already has it wont fool new passengers and it will only upset current passengers jetblue achieved its success by being unlike the other airlines its good name spread via word of mouth and smart marketing because great customer service gave it a compelling story to tell
1059486 priority no 1 should be getting back to a place where consumers want to share good stories take the money being wasted on that campaign and plow it into customer service

1059497 i played 20 years ago in seoul when baseball was a demonstration sport i had a great time then
1059498 this will be great because i started my career with the olympics and i feel like this would a great end for it
1059499 ive had five elbow surgeries so its obviously not a new elbow anymore
1059500 but its definitely good enough for one last kick at the can here at the olympics i had seven years in the big leagues and i feel very blessed to have played that long
1059501 this is pretty cool to be able to say i went to the olympics as well
1059502 when i decided to hang them up from professional baseball i was driving home and i wasnt even thinking about the olympics
1059503 then when greg hamilton baseball canadas director of national teams called to ask if i was interested i couldnt resist
1059504 i was actually built up to throw five six seven innings by now
1059505 but i had to take some time off after the injury it set me back a lot and now ill be a one or two inning guy again my body wouldnt allow me to do more
1059506 my whole focus was to get my arm in shape
1059507 i know i can pitch im only a year away from being out of the big leagues my whole thing when i talked to greg was to get my innings where i could get my arm strong and keep it there and i feel its where it was before
1059508 it was great actually more than i thought it was going to end up being
1059509 it was a great experience im glad i did it i got a chance to see a lot of people that i probably hadnt seen in 20 some years plus the fans got a chance to see me live pitching instead of watching me on tv

1059553 how changes to beliefs about climate change occur when consumers read information supplied by the news media
1059554 man too may be somewhat responsible for the cooling trend the university of wisconsins reid a bryson and other climatologists suggest that dust and other particles released into the atmosphere as a result of farming and fuel burning may be blocking more and more sunlight from reaching and heating the surface of the earth

1059619 nipples are my specialty and many of my barbies are bare chested so i can give her a beautiful set of nipples she likes that
1059620 barbie has always been very focused on getting married almost every barbie book ends with her engagement or wedding and im attempting to subvert the idea of marriage as a goal or end in itself for both women and men with these pieces

1059688 christian and conservative students shouldnt fear discrimination or censorship by university officials simply for expressing their beliefs the university is a marketplace of ideas where all viewpoints are welcomed and this significant ruling makes that clear
1059689 universities cannot use vague and overbroad policies to stifle student speech the 3rd circuit was right to conclude as the district court did that the old speech code at temple university is unconstitutional
1059690 speech cannot be prohibited in the absence of a tenable threat of disruption furthermore the policys use of hostile offensive and gender motivated is on its face sufficiently broad and subjective that they could conceivably be applied to cover any speech of a gender motivated nature the content of which offends someone this could include core political and religious speech such as gender politics and sexual morality t he policy provides no shelter for core protected speech
1059691 a proposed state constitutional amendment offers what sounds like a simple and painless remedy for improving public education in florida require every school district to spend at least 65 percent of its money on classroom instruction
1059692 we have a team of over 100 developers who are continually expanding the game any massively multiplayer online game that launches today is not just competing with the content that we launched with back in 2004 they are also competing with a product and a service that has been continuously enhanced expanded and refined for almost four years now as well as our years of experience in running the game
1059693 it costs hundreds of millions of dollars to not only develop a game as robust as world of warcraft but also to create the infrastructure needed in order to support the operation of the game

1059696 it was obviously a big disappointment not to reach orbit on this flight 3 of the falcon 1
1059697 on the plus side the flight of our first stage with the new merlin 1c engine that will be used in falcon 9 was picture perfect unfortunately a problem occurred with stage separation causing the stages to be held together

1059702 you therefore have no excuse you who pass judgment on someone else for at whatever point you judge the other you are condemning yourself because you who pass judgment do the same things now we know that gods judgment against those who do such things is based on truth so when you a mere man pass judgment on them and yet do the same things do you think you will escape gods judgment or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness tolerance and patience not realizing that gods kindness leads you toward repentance
1059703 so when you a mere man pass judgment on them and yet do the same things do you think you will escape gods judgment
1059704 what were seeing suggests there may be a social connectivity constant for humanity

1059707 emerging markets are a major factor in driving worldwide semiconductor sales
1059708 in 2008 developing countries with sales of over 153 million units will account for half of worldwide pc sales the emergence of large middle class populations in china india eastern europe and latin america has more than offset the effects of slower growth in the us economy
1059709 crude futures are down despite a brewing storm and that shows you how momentum has shifted in this market
1059710 the market is focused on falling demand with opec seen producing more oil
1059711 we are relieved that the beijing organizing committee of the olympic games has sourced the jade for the olympic medals and official souvenirs from china
1059712 but there is a growing demand for burmese jade that will only increase due to the olympic promotion of jade
1059713 the generals will keep using their jade profits to buy weapons and crush dissent in burma unless individuals take a stand
1059714 no group has claimed responsibility for the abduction and no ransom demand has been made
1059715 i dont know the statistics on the draw of the crowd
1059716 but i think its good to go outside the country
1059717 the people and cultures being so closely aligned we need to share our entertainment including our heroes and our villains
1059718 i think it only holds around 60 000 seats theres certainly enough interest with the canadians for a cup race americans and canadians have a lot in common and share a similar heritage
1059719 you see the crowd thats all you need to know
1059720 the fans love racing new hampshire is not that far away but these fans would support any kind of racing thats here
1059721 texas day 6 the good the bad and the ugly in no particular order
1059722 it will be the same type of environment we are used to at fifa world cups
1059723 the event gives us more of a world cup feeling than an olympic feeling
1059724 the first few minutes there will be a lot of emotion
1059725 once the game gets going and everyone touches the ball well be fine
1059726 i wasnt sure because its not like my leg is normal i have a higher pain level so i just assumed it would go away
1059727 it didnt and it just got worse i just pushed it beyond the limit that one was capable of doing
1059728 we just have to make sure we keep everything positive and our group tight
1059729 every time you see them they are stronger we have beaten them before and our confident should be right
1059730 given the fact i had multiple fractures in this area and i know what it feels like to have a stress fracture it is something similar

1059735 we will be going into these games doing things different in terms of pre games preparation from those we have in the past
1059736 we started earlier with a number of new olympic preparation programs that really are built on our learning from turin and our learning from otp
1059737 there have been individuals throughout history alex baumann is a great example victor davis is a great example greg joy is a great example lots of people have been that outspoken about wanting to win in the past
1059738 i think the biggest problem if there is a problem with speaking out like that is that canadians think its a strong stance
1059739 often people say yeah i want to win a medal because they think its bad to say i want to win theres nothing wrong with that thats what competition is all about
1059740 we will get the medals that we get and people will prepare with the resources that we have
1059741 we can say i only believe in gold im here for gold none of that matters if you prepared properly and you execute properly and your potential is to win you will win it wont depend on whether you said you were going to do your best or promised gold
1059742 weve had unfortunately a lot of injuries in the last two years

1059848 the center submitted data from eight schools with which we have been working to engage teachers in ongoing job embedded professional development the bottom line is that all the work that we do with administrators and teachers must make a difference in student outcomes thats the reason we do what we do
1059849 to replace the negative image of professional development that meant teachers were in serviced by instead providing enthusiastic relevant engagement in professional learning so many teachers have been subjected to poor one day wonders that failed to make a difference for students

1059875 one of the reasons i created this blog is that i need help even after all these years i dont know how to apportion raises or properly review employees and im tired of reading articles by academics or large company executives who have never had to dig into their own pockets to make certain everyone gets paid on time

1059889 when i come upon a bad assonance or a repetition in my sentences im sure im floundering in the false by searching i find the proper expression which was always the only one and which is also harmonious the word is never lacking when one possesses the idea is there not in this precise fitting of parts something eternal like a principal if not why should there be a relation between the right word and the musical word or why should the greatest compression of thought always result in a line of poetry

1059908 the portuguese attorney general in his recent statement made it very clear indeed that theres absolutely no evidence of any wrongdoing by kate and gerry in any way shape or form and journalists should bear that in mind when they examine the police files
1059909 a lot of this is historical detail drafted by officers who failed to find madeleine and who quite wrongfully were going down inaccurate lines of supposition and assumption
1059910 kate and gerry are no longer arguidos formal suspects the portuguese judicial system has accepted that they were not involved in madeleines disappearance in any way shape or form and these files should be seen in that context
1059911 all that matters is the search for madeleine kate and gerrys lawyers are continuing to examine all of the information in minute detail and where anything that is relevant to finding madeleine needs to be done it will be

1059933 the existence of liquidity facilities at the central bank can undermine normal incentives for maintaining liquidity buffers and the more extensive the access the greater the degree to which market discipline will be loosened and prudential regulation will need to be tightened
1059934 because his framework had to do with the great depression had to do with channels outside money supply and interest rates in this sense he was perfectly suited to do this
1059935 it has worked so well that it does mean that should inflation suddenly jump out of the box the door is open for the fed to raise rates sharply at any given time
1059936 we agreed in the absence of a clear positive response from iran that we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran as part of this strategy
1059937 it is very disturbing for the itf and should be for the ioc when players who do not meet the itf qualification criteria approved by the ioc are entered at the expense of players who qualified and deserved to represent their countries at the 2008 olympic games
1059938 the itf believes that a transparent and consistent system of entry is the only possible way for tennis as an olympic sport to have credibility with players and fans
1059939 every tennis event around the world uses the world ranking as the basis for entry and the itf finds it difficult to accept that criteria can be changed from country to country depending on the views of particular national olympic committees
1059940 the itf deplores the lack of understanding by the german olympic committee about entry to tennis events around the world including the olympic games

1059944 troubles with the financial sector the economy the u s consumer theres no quick fix
1059945 it means there is some inflation leaking into the system and it puts the fed in a difficult position
1059946 but given the weakness of the economy it means theyre going to have to tolerate more inflation than they like
1059947 the possibility of higher energy prices tighter credit conditions and a still deeper contraction in housing markets all represent significant downside risks to the outlook for growth at the same time upside risks to the inflation outlook have intensified lately

1059959 ahead of the olympics it is a very powerful symbolic attack because security in xinjiang is at an all time high
1059960 in the absence of a clear positive response from iran we have no choice but to pursue other measures against iran
1059961 the pressure on iran to comply with the demands of the international community and the u n security council will only grow
1059962 there is one way for the iranians to make clear that they have found common ground its to come and say we accept the proposal this is a good basis for the beginnings for pre negotiations within a six week period and then we can suspend our enrichment and reprocessing and we can begin real negotiations and the united states will be at the table

1059970 end coercive interrogations and secret detentions by the central intelligence agency
1059971 these practices have brought shame to our nation have harmed our ability to fight the war on terror and i believe violate u s law and international treaty obligations
1059972 our nation has paid an enormous price because of these interrogations they cast shadow and doubt over our ideals and our system of justice our enemies have used our practices to recruit more extremists our key global partnerships crucial to winning the war on terror have been strained
