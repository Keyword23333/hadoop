8200001 es st rt mich dass die linke nicht in eine politische haftung genommen werden w rde
8200002 im moment sehe ich in unseren reihen zu viele die auf eine vereinigung mit der linkspartei oskar lafontaines zuzusteuern scheinen

8200004 at uc berkeley ee100 is the introduction to electrical engineering class for non ee majors the goal of this course is to serve as a hands on electronics class we use multisim in the ee100 course because it is easy to use and abstracts the messy details of spice multisim also provides very useful features like the breadboard tool and instruments like the multimeter we can show students how to wire an ammeter without blowing fuses multisim also integrates with labview and this helps our students compare simulation data to experimental data
8200005 the new laws to restrict ministers of religion coming here will affect every religion in the uk
8200006 maybe catholics who disagree too loudly with abortion laws or islamic preachers who oppose uk foreign policies could find their sponsors unable to invite them to the uk
8200007 this would of course be a worrying curtailment of our right to worship and one everybody needs to question
8200008 seeing phil and john as hardened criminals working on the other side of the law will no doubt take devoted life on mars fans by surprise joining them as the other two jewel thieves in their crew are ashley walters and cristian solimeno and the dynamic between all four actors is terrific to watch weve a great ensemble cast with kate magowan and dylan brown along with kevin mcnally kirsty mitchell and linal haft
8200009 abm recognizing the enormous opportunities in todays global marketplace and its members needs is positioning itself to become the global b to b association
8200010 we are delighted to offer media members the opportunity to experience indias b to b community first hand much like we did in china in late 2006 bringing industry leaders together for a collective sharing of information ideas and challenges and we are thrilled to be working with both bpa worldwide and cross border media on this exciting indian venture abms journeys abroad support our strategic initiative to help our members grow globally and become the global business information association
8200011 given the economic vibrancy that is india and with the opening of media to foreign investment
8200012 there are great opportunities for foreign media firms in the b to b sector to collaborate with their counterparts in india we have been in contact with publishers in india interested in best business practices and sharing their experiences with peers in their b to b markets taking a delegation of our publishing members from around the globe who have an interest in doing business in india will result in precisely that as bpa worldwide is the largest global non profit organization tasked with auditing media in more than 30 countries our incoming indian publishers may have an interest in reciprocating and visiting other countries in which they may have an interest in expanding their brands
8200013 i am particularly impressed with the enthusiasm expressed by indian publishers who have pledged full support by way of sponsorships
8200014 in fact i see 2009 as a turning point in indias b to b publishing industry
8200015 companies have been prompted to review travel expenditure along with everything from stationary to staffing levels but a tmc or corporate travel agent is employed to squeeze the most value out of a companys travel spend and that is going to remain a valued service in the current climate
8200016 tmcs and corporate agents have not only made it easier for companies to arrange travel but have streamlined the process they have helped cut costs by securing the best available fares and have used their scale to negotiate better deals they also provide first class reporting systems to their clients these services are even more valuable now than they were a year ago
8200017 a business traveller can now check their email have a working dinner and take a nap while their suit jacket is pressed and all en route to somewhere else
8200018 some airlines are even looking to allow the use of cell phones on board so their passengers dont miss a call even at 30 000 feet
8200019 the managed and corporate travel sector has enjoyed unprecedented rates in growth across most of asia for the past few years however while the long term prospects for the sector are good the current economic climate is going to make it tougher going for a lot of agents in the short term
8200020 for tmcs the imperative is the same as their clients
8200021 they need to analyse their fee models reduce costs and bargain aggressively for the best deals and our abacus connected agents have told us they are investing more in technological solutions to get them there
8200022 investing in technology solutions provides agencies the ability to streamline operations and improve client servicing as well as auditing and reporting will be a major factor in separating the agencies that will simply survive the current squeeze from the agencies that will flourish in it
8200023 following the precedent set in the united states airlines in asia will be keeping a close eye on schedules and routes to ensure acceptable capacity
8200024 it could become hard for some clients to get to some of the more remote parts of the region as they do currently
8200025 these concerns could become a reality in asia too and added to that there is a raft of extra charges such as fuel surcharges and fees for baggage that are starting to creep into the fare structure and often not included in the deals corporate travel agents are negotiating
8200026 our role as a corporate travel management company is to manage our clients business travel programmes reducing the total cost of travel continues to be a primary programme objective for a significant majority of our clients and this is therefore a key focus for our organisation
8200027 the growth in demand will be strongly fuelled by increases in emerging and growth markets for example the survey finds 27 of buyers estimate demand in asia one of business travels rapidly expanding frontiers will grow by more than 10 in 2008
8200028 most businesses will continue to view corporate travel as an investment in sales marketing and business development rather than as a cost what we can expect is for businesses to be more selective on the routes they travel with organisations preferring to focus on selected key target markets such as the middle east rather than europe where they feel they can maximise their roi from such business travel
8200029 as far as the corporate market is concerned holiday tours will be more aggressive in contracting rates and pricing for ground components for our corporate clients to try and alleviate the pressure on airline prices
8200030 in the united states american express has moved beyond simply arranging travel and with the introduction of an online product called axiom their clients have access to travel and business suppliers as well as services including airport parking ground transportation dining event tickets shipping car service and even audio and web conferencing
8200031 corporate travel agents know they will not score points just for turning up any more and we can expect a tighter travel budget and softening demand from corporate clients in the short term however business travel does not just mean high expenditure or business class travel and by being a travel value champion for their clients corporate travel agents will excel regardless of the economic climate

8200076 organisations going for the informal approach can lack structure in their environmental policies and this can affect the level of success that they achieve in reducing both energy costs and co2 emissions
8200077 while computers may drive efficiency the data centres that run businesses are often far from efficient they are at the heart of environmental challenges created by it but the average retailer just does not have the necessary knowledge to bring about change they need specialist help and the actions we offer in our thought leadership initiatives are designed to illustrate how they can improve their carbon footprint and wider environmental position while also reducing operating costs and improving it service delivery

8200096 sputtered strain gauge manufacturers sputter deposit a layer of glass onto the diaphragm sputtered strain gauge sensors actually from a molecular bond
8200097 gauge pressure is measured relative to ambient atmospheric pressure as shown in figure 3 similar to absolute pressure the abbreviations pag pascals gauge or psia pounds per square inch gauge are use to describe gauge pressure
8200098 a classic example of overloading a pressure sensor is known as the water hammer phenomenon this occurs when a fast moving fluid is suddenly stopped by the closing of a valve the fluid has momentum that is suddenly arrested which causes a minute stretching of the vessel in which the fluid is constrained this stretching generates a pressure spike that can damage a pressure sensor

8200163 the buyout is part of our two fold strategy in the short term it will de risk us from the impact of tech slowdown in the us market though it will continue to be a major revenue contributor
8200164 in the long term such inorganic growth will enable us to expand our global footprint in client servicing and revenue generation
8200165 we have been scouting for such a strategic fit in line with our global delivery model gdm apart from increasing our revenue from europe axon will be a new engine for growth worldwide

8200186 haar verscheurdheid is een schrijnend teken van het feit dat ook de kerk tot op het bot geraakt is door alle maatschappelijke ontwikkelingen
8200187 als kerk voelen we pijn en schuld we zijn kennelijk niet in staat geweest om een helder en getrouw getuigenis van de liefde van de hemelse vader over te dragen
8200188 nee want naar mijn aard ben ik erop uit om god en mijn naaste te haten
8200189 wat de kerk werkelijk is komen we uitsluitend te weten door te geloven wat de bijbel daarover onthult zelfs al rijst ze levensgroot voor onze ogen op toch kunnen we buiten de schrift om en zonder geloof niet zeggen wat de kerk is dat is de reden waarom ons artikel artikel 27 van de nederlandse geloofsbelijdenis bdr begint met de woorden wij geloven en belijden een kerk
8200190 aan de kerk vandaag stellen wij de vraag lijden wij er als kerk als gemeente aan dat er zo veel mensen uit ons midden zijn weggetrokken op zoek om elders hun geluk te beproeven willen wij als kerk openstaan voor die verloren zonen en dochters vinden zij een gastvrij huis in onze gemeente
8200191 voorts weest krachtig in de here en in de sterkte zijner macht doet de wapenrusting gods aan om te kunnen standhouden tegen de verleidingen des duivels want wij hebben niet te worstelen tegen bloed en vlees maar tegen de overheden tegen de machten tegen de wereldbeheersers dezer duisternis tegen de boze geesten in de hemelse gewesten
8200192 en de draak stond voor de vrouw die baren zou om zodra zij haar kind gebaard had dit te verslinden en zij baarde een zoon een mannelijk wezen dat alle heidenen zal hoeden met een ijzeren staf en haar kind werd plotseling weggevoerd naar god en zijn troon
8200193 neemt daarom de wapenrusting gods om weerstand te kunnen bieden in de boze dag en om uw taak geheel vervuld hebbende stand te houden

8200200 he was very close to returning but the great part about michael is that he takes his time to think about things and he is very thorough
8200201 you can get excited about coming back and running through the tunnel one more time
8200202 in the end he felt he could not get back to where he was
8200203 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8200204 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8200205 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8200206 we know the parameters of the contract and the giants would have been generous
8200207 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8200208 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8200209 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8200210 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8200211 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8200212 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8200213 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play
8200214 there is nothing new in the party and chiranjeevis speech he wants to continue what congress has been doing for the last four and half years
8200215 yet if people conclude that parting between brothers is inevitable we will assist in their amicable separation
8200216 he should make a promise to carve out a separate state of telangana
8200217 in the name of budgetary support the government is selling away lands this amounts to selling away the future of our children the government should act as a protector of peoples land and not as broker
8200218 there is a need for clarity on several issues we hope that he chiranjeevi will soon announce detailed policies and programmes

8200223 no name in cricket conjures up such widespread awe and respect as that of sir donald bradman
8200224 even people with just a passing knowledge of the game or in countries where he never played will invariably recognise the name bradman as a by word for brilliance
8200225 that name says all that is best about the game and it is synonymous with cricket soccer has pele and cricket has bradman
8200226 even now 60 years after his final test match and with time to put his achievements into context his batting average of 99 94 still seems scarcely believable especially when one compares it to those of the many other players to have graced the game at the highest level
8200227 this centenary offers us an opportunity to reflect upon the role the don played in popularising the game through his attacking style of batting
8200228 but he was a captain too he looked to lead as he played in a positive manner and his 1948 side including the likes of keith miller neil harvey arthur morris and ray lindwall is rightly remembered as one of the greatest line ups of all time
8200229 we should also remember the way he gave back to the game after he finished playing as a selector and as an administrator with the australian cricket board and the imperial cricket conference
8200230 sir donalds life was a lifetime of service to cricket and his legacy is that our strong sport continues to grow stronger
8200231 i am delighted australia is leading the tributes to sir donald with its captain ricky ponting delivering the bradman oration in sydney
8200232 cricket is all about tradition and respecting previous generations and i am sure rickys speech will do just that as well as being a fitting tribute to a truly great cricket person

8200248 i would firstly like to thank allah for providing me with this great family
8200249 this is a very hard decision for me to make as i feel that i could possibly play one more year but out of respect i would only do that if i felt 100 per cent and i wouldnt want to risk that for the family
8200250 i am going to miss playing for the club greatly i am truly honoured to have spent six wonderful years here
8200251 there are not enough words to express my gratitude to the club but i would like to specially thank peter moores mark robinson chris adams all my team mates all the fans and everyone who is part of this magnificent family for all the opportunities and memories that they have provided me with
8200252 my love my feelings and my heart will always be with sussex and i will always pray to allah for continued success at sussex
8200253 mushtaqs legacy at the club is that he leaves us statistically romantically and emotionally the best player to ever pull on a sussex shirt
8200254 in view of the impact hes made its difficult to think of another cricketer who has achieved or done more for one county his legacy extends beyond the playing arena as im sure all that have been graced by his presence will agree he is simply a great man
8200255 i dont think that it will ever be possible to overplay the enormous influence mushtaq has had on sussex in recent years

8200267 since my college days the museum has been a treasure trove of inspiration
8200268 this exhibition will draw on millinery collections worldwide and will be a truly eclectic and exciting anthology of hats
8200269 there will be hats ranging from an egyptian anubis mask dating from 600bc to a fifties
8200270 to show the universal appeal and delight of wearing hats mr jones has included a wide variety of styles including top hats berets and a childs plastic tiara
8200271 this exhibition will show historic and contemporary interpretations of types of hat such as the tricorn bowler baseball cap bonnet skull cap and many more
8200272 it will also look at the common themes explored by milliners such as exoticism modernism and the natural world
8200273 we will have hats worn by royalty as well as singers celebrities actors and actresses of the past and present

8200278 he was brilliant but the thing im trying to tell matty and drum into him and the young players is thats great to be on top of a wave but youve got to try to get to that level where youre cool youre calm and youre responsible and you deliver day in and day out
8200279 i had a long breakfast with matty this morning and hes in a really good place at the moment when he was left out he didnt open his mouth or anything he just went back to the drawing board at sussex and has done a fantastic job there
8200280 hes turned up back here with us as a different bloke and hes been brilliant fair play to the guy because he could have gone away and felt sorry for himself but hes gone away and scored hundred after hundred for sussex
8200281 i was pleased he finished not out with six catches its brilliant because it has been a headache for however long with our wicketkeeper but lets hope it stays good because hes a hell of a batsman

8200285 we are worried about the situation in lebanon particularly tripoli in north lebanon
8200286 although most retired homeowners have seen the value of equity in their homes fall in recent months its important that they dont lose sight of the bigger picture which is that despite current falling property prices in the vast majority of cases retired homeowners have built up a significant amount of equity in their homes over a number of years
8200287 this together with the rising cost of living means that many more people are now looking to release equity from their homes to maintain or improve their standard of living in retirement
8200288 these figures show the shadow of repossession is no longer just cast over homeowners but also thousands of innocent renters who have no idea how close they are to eviction
8200289 sadly the impact of repossession can be even greater for tenants who despite paying rent on time can find themselves with very few rights and the first they even know about it is when the bailiffs start banging on the door
8200290 mortgage lenders must take responsibility and make sure they inform both owners and tenants when taking action to repossess so tenants are aware they are about to lose their home

8200293 this is by far the best squat ive ever lived in
8200294 we have sought to formalise the relationship with the squatters but it hasnt happened we are looking at long term plans for the building
8200295 when we squat a building we wait for the landlords to contact us but once they have we keep calling them and writing to them
8200296 many landlords have a stereotypical view of squatters but if you can give them a letter laying out the advantages to them of a caretaking deal no expensive court costs for eviction and security and repairs carried out for no cost you might get somewhere
8200297 and if you can get the landlord to come to the premises sit down with you and have something to eat and a cup of tea then your chances of securing a deal increase dramatically
8200298 a creative and pragmatic response to the circumstances it allows for the building to be secured while planning for its future is still under way
8200299 it can cost a landlord 5 000 a week to have 24 hour security for an empty building deals like this can save them money and recycle space we do it recycling with cans paper and glass why not buildings
8200300 young people need a place to go to keep them off the streets we offer skateboarding and dj and rapping workshops
8200301 we once squatted a ministry of defence property they were very efficient and took us to court to evict us pretty quickly
8200302 we are hearing a lot about thefts of copper piping if pipe work is torn out it costs a lot to replace it so keeping properties occupied is really important
8200303 when people are in trouble or have something to celebrate they can come here theres a real difference between the council providing a top down space and letting local people take on a space and create something so much love has gone into building this place up the loss of it would be irreversible
8200304 we have a no violence rule here and dont allow the use of class a drugs we want this to be a safe place for children and families for the first two years it was like having glastonbury in your house every day but over the seven years we have worked 80 hour weeks to clean the space up and make it what it is today were proud to be able to give artistic spaces to people who need time to make beautiful things
8200305 please come home terry whatever it is we can sort it out i love you and i miss you and the kids miss you please call me or call the police

8200307 terry has also had a lot of stress running the pub the weather hasnt been kind to business this year
8200308 we are growing increasingly concerned about terry as this sort of behaviour is completely out of character for him
8200309 i would ask for anyone who thinks they know where he is to let us or his family know as soon as possible
8200310 and to terry please get in touch with your family as they are very worried about you and would like to know that you are ok
8200311 ive been ringing around the family and no one has seen or heard from him
8200312 i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world

8200320 caregivers have similar cortisol levels as controls their cells seem to be hearing less of this signal in other words something goes awry in caregivers white blood cells so they are not able to receive the signal from cortisol that tells them to shut down inflammation
8200321 because people have traditionally thought that higher cortisol is the reason that stress contributes to disease but this work shows that at least in caregivers its actually the opposite theres too little cortisol signal being heard by the cells rather than too much
8200322 we dont know how to account for the resilience of some stressed people exposed to severe sustained stress or the vulnerability of some people to relatively mild stress
8200323 the better that we understand the underlying molecular mechanisms that link stress to illness the more likely we are to make progress in answering these important questions
8200324 bioglass is used to help mend broken bones recently researchers working at imperial college discovered a new kind of bioglass which seemed to work better but they could not work out all the details why

8200375 the new laws to restrict ministers of religion coming here will affect every religion in the uk
8200376 maybe catholics who disagree too loudly with abortion laws or islamic preachers who oppose uk foreign policies could find their sponsors unable to invite them to the uk

8200390 modus operandi of the entire blasts in jaipur is a part of investigation and interrogation but this is for sure that shahbaz is the main link in planning conspiring and execution of the bomb blasts
8200391 role of local people of jaipur could not be ruled out but it has to be probed along with other investigations by sit and sog
8200392 shahbaz hussain alias shanu has played a very important role in the blasts that claimed 68 lives in jaipur and he has got strong linkage with abu bashar arrested from azamgarh uttar pradesh and sajid mansoori from gujarat in connection with ahmedabad blasts
8200393 after interrogating and grilling sajid mansoori and mufti abul the police found that the bomb blasts plan was made at a simi meeting in bhopal in april 2008 which was attended by taukeer sajid and shahbaz
8200394 modus operandi of the entire blasts in jaipur is a part of investigation and interrogation but this is for sure that shahbaz is the main link in planning conspiring and execution of the bomb blasts

8200408 puede imaginarse lo que fue para los abjasos ver cerrada su universidad de sujumi por el gobierno de tiflis bajo el argumento de que supuestamente no ten an una lengua adecuada o una historia o cultura por lo que no necesitaban una universidad
8200409 argumentamos constantemente que ser a imposible despu s de esto decirle a los abjasos y osetas y decenas de otros grupos en todo el mundo que lo que era bueno para los albanokosovares no era bueno para ellos en las relaciones internacionales no se puede tener una regla para unos y otra para otros

8200414 we have friends who are married and work from home but they have offices in two separate bedrooms
8200415 luke and i find it more productive to work in the same room because when we need to ask each other a question all we have to do is speak up that way we dont have to keep getting up and walking back and forth
8200416 as a married couple when you move from conventional office jobs to working together in your own business you go from not having much time together to being around each other most of the day everyday
8200417 it can be a challenge to define life as husband and wife and life as business partners because its hard to separate the two still we would rather work together in our own business than go our separate ways in the morning working for someone else
8200418 we reached a point in our careers where we felt that it would be better to invest our knowledge and abilities in our own business than for someone else
8200419 that is a risky step if you want to work for yourself though its a step you must take
8200420 typically one spouse remains at home with the child while the other works long hours and doesnt spend as much time with the family as he or she would like
8200421 i am able to continue working while caring for isabelle and luke is able to spend more time with us
8200422 couples who work traditional office jobs just share a few tidbits about their work day when they get home
8200423 when you work together and out of a home office your business occupies a tremendous part of your life
8200424 its important to take time for yourself and away from each other
8200425 take the dog to the park go to the gym me time is valuable for both the husband and the wife
8200426 it is ideal to set office hours and stick to them sometimes that is difficult especially when you work at home but it is good for your mental well being
8200427 we try to take off weekends and spend them together not talking about work sometimes that is easier said than done
8200428 you have to respect each others feelings and beliefs and feel comfortable with each persons responsibilities
8200429 we get to spend time with each other and our daughter and we are working as a team to build our business

8200433 while our armed forces are doing their best to protect the people other political leaders should prevent the further escalation of violence which leaves mostly civilians including children as victims
8200434 any efforts at autonomy must also be anchored on mutual respect and peaceful co existence with other communities
8200435 this government cannot condone the criminal terror being unleashed by a handful out to sabotage the path to a lasting peace
8200436 the burden of cracking the whip against the milf commanders ameril ombra kato and abdulrahman macapaar alias bravo groups should be on the top leadership of the milf if they really want to proceed with peaceful negotiations

8200594 expansions in biorenewable energy are possible if we are able to combine productivity and sustainability improvements in agriculture and forestry with a variety of biomass feedstocks and the most applicable conversion technologies
8200595 we are hopeful the collaboration of our companies will lead to innovative technologies to improve collection and provisioning of biomass feedstocks such as corn stover

8200597 as the worlds population grows so will demand for food and energy using non food feedstocks for feed and energy is one way that agriculture can apply innovation to create renewable sustainable solutions

8200600 we are hopeful the collaboration of our companies will lead to innovative technologies to improve collection and provisioning of biomass feedstocks such as corn stover
8200601 advanced biotechnologies are protecting plants better than ever helping the plants to achieve their full grain yield potential
8200602 have to admit as democrats we have been wrong on education
8200603 those folks who are giving money for campaigns and you know who im talking about
8200604 you know i think that waters cleared up enough it might be all right now
8200605 by the fall it was clear right or wrong they didnt like him
8200606 i think i have a much higher i q than you do a bizarre videotaped putdown that biden immediately called into question with five 5 boasts about his academic record four 4 of which turned out to be easily disproved b s
8200607 nothing to do with the explosion of high risk lending a few years ago
8200608 i had a strong feeling last weekend when john edwards finally acknowledged having an extramarital affair that we hadnt heard the end of this thing
8200609 just days before the start of the democratic convention in denver which will culminate in the crowning of barack obama are we in fact seeing the early outlines of a first rate political cover up
8200610 based on who i really am not based on some plastic ken doll
8200611 being in love with a still somewhat dysfunctional married man
8200612 edwards hired her as a front to continue their relationship
8200613 he said he said he just couldnt live with the constant pounding from the tabloids
8200614 admitted the national enquirer was correct when it reported he had visited hunter at the beverly hills hilton last month
8200615 keep this mistake i had made two years previously private
8200616 saiid it was possible some of his friends or supporters may have made payments without telling him
8200617 you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
8200618 if there is not an explanation thats satisfactory acceptable and meets high moral standards the answer is no he would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention
8200619 obviously the convention has not been our driving force behind the story
8200620 perel pauses if the convention wasnt part of the timetable before it is now
8200621 praying that tomorrow will not be as cold as today because she doesnt have the coat to keep her warm
8200622 ok were not hiring him because of his sterling private behavior
8200623 disappearing from the national stage unless he finds a way to squelch this story fast
8200624 a super rich pal who was closely involved with the campaign finances
8200625 this isnt something you would normally see in a newspaper more than once we already wrote the one post quoting the national enquirer which slipped out before pierces ban kf and i dont think youd see more than that if there were no blogs and this was just a newspaper
8200626 its a story that were taking a long view of
8200627 weve got a big exclusive coming out this week and we are on the trail of some stuff thats even hotter
8200628 not about the photos but about the rest of the story and the story is just going to get bigger from here
8200629 everythings done incrementally so im not going to tell you exactly what our process is perhaps my time frame is different than your time frame im not worried about the rest of the media im worried about us
8200630 if you had this rumor about bill clinton it probably wouldnt cause a ripple
8200631 but given john edwards and his public relationship with his wife something close to a model of the perfect family and their perfect relationship it would hurt that much more
8200632 opponents of affirmative action are trying to get a referendum on the ballot here that would do away with affirmative action do you support that
8200633 yes i do i do not believe in quotas but i have not seen the details of some of the proposals but ive always opposed quotas
8200634 i do not have a firm enough grasp on the historical and relevant context of mccains remark in 1998 to give you the pushback that this question deserves
8200635 within minutes of posting yesterday i recognized that it was indeed heavyhanded and had it unpublished
8200636 i may be identifying with elizabeth a little too closely as an oversharing cancer survivor and all
8200637 we dont want to get it at all not even just a mention of the allegation not even second
8200638 edwards isnt considered a likely vice presidential candidate by the press
8200639 its so easy to jump to conclusions and i admit this looks bad
8200640 if the account of him being caught in a hotel rendezvous with rielle hunter was false edwards wouldnt be changing the subject hed be suing
8200641 which story gets a bigger audience a story the blogs run with but the mainstream news ignores or a story the news runs with but the blogs ignore im thinking the news comes out ahead but just barely and at this rate not for much longer
8200642 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
8200643 will mccain respect obamas views once obama has studied the issue
8200644 supposed to be about supplying some needed capital to the subprime market
8200645 the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since vietnam
8200646 im a big success and im telling you losers what to do
8200647 you are probably not that good a rapper maybe you are the next lil wayne but probably not in which case you need to stay in school
8200648 i urge you all to stay in school ive seen what happened to friends of mine i know what would have happened to me the odds against people who drop out of high school are not good
8200649 so turn off the tv set put the video game away
8200650 you need to make sure your child can speak spanish
8200651 many americans with good cause didnt believe us when we said we would secure our borders and so we failed in our efforts we must prove to them that we can and will secure our borders first while respecting the dignity and rights of citizens and legal residents of the united states of america
8200652 we resolved that matter of my campaigns structure back in july
8200653 i would bet my firstborn that they will be excluded from the accounting change it would bankrupt them
8200654 unhappy california business won the support of mayor antonio r villaraigosa of los angeles who wrote a letter
8200655 the federal system to check the working papers of new hires
8200656 i find comfort in the fact that the longer im in politics the less nourishing popularity becomes that a striving for rank and fame seems to betray a poverty of ambition and that i am answerable mainly to the steady gaze of my own conscience
8200657 i dont think mccain can afford to do any more major reshuffling without running the risk of key republicans concluding that hes hopeless and abandoning him en masse
8200658 a mid size sports sedan for 60 000 a competitor to the bmw 5 series and jaguar xf
8200659 it would be my top priority yesterday today and tomorrow
8200660 but we also must proceed with a temporary worker program that is verifiable and truly temporary
8200661 in increasingly strident terms his commitment to legalizing all the illegal aliens
8200662 i dont want you to take out of context what i said during the campaign
8200663 s peaking to reporters aboard his campaign plane obama said the actress doesnt have his personal email address
8200664 she sent one email to reggie who forwarded it to me
8200665 i write saying thank you scarlett for doing what you do and suddenly we have this email relationship
8200666 i feel like im supporting someone and having a personal dialogue with them and its amazing
8200667 failed to generate the kind of republican primary turnout typically enjoyed by house incumbents
8200668 keep a more progressive social security program from being seen as welfare
8200669 does a work test keep the eitc from being seen as welfare
8200670 the eitc has fared much better than welfare programs without a work test
8200671 then he said i bet some of you dont know this did you know spanish was spoken in arizona before english
8200672 i didnt call him i called my friend who happened to be with him at the time
8200673 black fathers who arent in the home are much more likely to sustain regular contact with their children than absentee white fathers or for that matter fathers of any other ethnic group
8200674 obama is the greatest nothing this great has happened to us in a long time the only thing we have to worry about is what well have to wear to the inauguration
8200675 hey were contributing all this money but not getting much back in benefits so the hell with this system
8200676 hey this is to help old folks whove worked all their lives
8200677 he stayed for a good almost half hour afterwards shaking hands listening to our concerns talking to us
8200678 pointed out that he supported bill clinton with both ginsberg sic and breyer
8200679 we have seen this before there is dirt and lies that are circulated in e mails and they pump them out long enough until finally you a mainstream reporter asks me about it
8200680 it will only produce an immediate 17 increase in immigration
8200681 editorial staff is about two thirds its size in the late 1990s
8200682 on the board of five companies that granted lavish pay packages to their executives
8200683 dell makes it easy to migrate to vista on your schedule
8200684 lets see how about never that fits my schedule t
8200685 youd imagine that someone like the senator who is constantly traveling and constantly on how can he return these personal e mails
8200686 done a brilliant job of insulating itself for the down cycle
8200687 obama aides also said clinton is in no position to stiffen oversight after taking contributions from mortgage industry lobbyists including funds from representatives of countrywide which has been at the center of the mortgage meltdown
8200688 im glad to report that starbucks is indeed considering some sort of elite status
8200689 we dont comment on campaigns that are utter and complete failures
8200690 you find you can eliminate a fair number of people without eliminating much content
8200691 supported by fed chairman alan greenspan and treasury secretary larry summers
8200692 but we must enact comprehensive immigration reform we must make it a top agenda item if we dont do it before and we probably wont a little straight talk as of january 2009
8200693 mr mccain has made some gains in reassuring conservatives nervous about his views on issues like immigration polls suggest
8200694 there were not all of these pundits and bloggers and everything who were all over it
8200695 you bloggers do a great job digging up stories for us in the msm keep it up
8200696 on a message to balance the crazy left wing things a president obama is sure to try
8200697 what it says is that im not very well known in that part of the country
8200698 sen clinton i think is much better known coming from a nearby state of arkansas so its not surprising that she would have an advantage in some of those states in the middle
8200699 last time i checked illinois was more nearby kentucky than arkansas heck they even touch
8200700 i snt there something a tad condescending in his reference to
8200701 its obviously been a factor playing on the minds of oil markets at the moment
8200702 theres a potential impact on production in the gulf of mexico area
8200703 were getting some pretty powerful data that suggests slower growth and higher gasoline prices have really crimped oil demand in the u s
8200704 heinekens first half results could be described as a relief especially taking into account the all time high 10 outstanding short interest
8200705 the results contain something for the bears and the bulls but we do not believe the market will materially increase full year earnings at this stage with the key summer consuming months nearly completed
8200706 es lamentable tener un presidente tan poco reflexivo tan poco calmado qu pena que se defienda con su rabia y no con su inteligencia
8200707 hay muchos que mantienen mucha ganas de tenerme preso aqu o destituido o preso en la corte penal internacional les va dar mucha lidia porque aqu hemos procedido con toda la honradez con el m s riguroso ce imiento a la constituci n colombiana
8200708 una investigaci n formal practicada por la corte penal internacional a nuestras autoridades por la obstrucci n a las acciones de nuestra justicia por delitos de lesa humanidad
8200709 el senador del partido liberal juan f cristo debe decir con claridad si entreg o no dineros a campa as pol ticas para las elecciones de 1991
8200710 mientras la oposici n no la dejan acercar a las puertas de la casa de nari o los delincuentes entran tranquilamente por el s tano de palacio
8200711 el senador del partido liberal juan fernando cristo debe decir con claridad si entreg o no dineros a campa as pol ticas para las elecciones parlamentarias de 1991 l sabe porque se le pregunta
8200712 no puede eludir ol mpicamente su responsabilidad pol tica en el manejo de la direcci n seccional de fiscal as de medell n con el d bil argumento de que la responsabilidad penal de su hermano es personal para nadie es un secreto que esa oficina estuvo asignada como cuota pol tica al grupo que el ministro ha dirigido en antioquia en los ltimos 20 a os y por lo tanto esa fiscal a infiltrada por la mafia seg n el presidente uribe es la misma que manej su hermano y cuota pol tica guillermo le n valencia
8200713 desde la propia presidencia de la rep blica y desde hace varios meses se teje un siniestro complot contra la corte la intervenci n del presidente uribe sobre este tema lejos de aclarar estos hechos como es su costumbre demuestra su intemperancia agresividad y habilidad para distraer la opini n p blica
8200714 no luce que el ministro del interior y de justicia llame al fiscal a hablarle de su hermano es doloroso pero tiene que deslindarse de ese caso
8200715 el ingreso a la casa de nari o tan f cil y tan frecuentemente de reconocidos delincuentes del paramilitarismo con el fin de realizar maniobras contra la corte suprema de justicia
8200716 the petrochemicals heavyweights will remain in focus so long as hurricane gustav continues to pose a threat to refinery activity along the gulf of mexico coastline
8200717 any shutdown would prove incredibly costly to the companies involved and further rises in fuel prices would end up weighing across the board
8200718 many children are happy making some money from selling the animals to the markets but they keep some for their family
8200719 not only are our poor eating it but there is also demand from vietnamese living on the border with us
8200720 some socially deprived people in bihar have always consumed rat meat if they can eat rats why cant the rest of the people
8200721 this will help in mitigating the global food crisis we are sure that it will work wonders
8200722 zum einen ist unsere w hrung pfund oder euro sehr stark weswegen auch der umsatz in den jeweiligen l ndern h her ausf llt als zuvor
8200723 f r ubisoft ist der umsatz in europa also wichtiger als der in den usa und das mit mehr als f nf prozent f r uns ist es ein sehr starker markt geworden
8200724 ich denke es gibt viele kunden die spielen wollen weil wir in europa das spielen lieben das einzige problem war dass die titel immer schwieriger zu spielen waren jetzt haben wir eine bessere zug nglichkeit und einige accessoires die den leuten dabei helfen spa zu haben ich denke dieser markt hat keine wachstumsgrenze nach oben hin wenn wir sicherstellen dass die hinzugekommenen personen auch bleiben
8200725 ein spiel wie endwar zum beispiel das du mit der stimme kontrollieren kannst es ver ndert die industrie vollst ndig weil es einem die m glichkeit gibt das zu kommandieren was gerade passiert und eine schnelle antwort auf die erteilten befehle zu bekommen
8200726 und mit vielen anderen spielen verh lt es sich hnlich etwa die partyspiele diejenigen mit gitarre helfen auch dabei den spa zu vergr ern und sie beziehen mehr leute mit ein wenn man n mlich spa mit seiner familie hat nimmt man sie gleich zu anderen spielen mit
8200727 es passt total zu unseren pl nen und dar ber hinaus denke ich dass wir so eine noch bessere erfahrung anbieten k nnen
8200728 wenn man ein spiel zockt m chte man mehr ber die geschichte und ber die charaktere wissen man liest also das buch will aber au erdem noch eine linearere erfahrung mit der man etwas ber den feind und die jeweiligen st dte lernt in denen diese dinge passieren und so weiter

8200735 with nearly 1 900 us dollars per annum of disposable income for the urban residents and almost 700 us dollars per annum cash income for farmers chinese people are upgrading their consumption structure they spend more on recreational goods dine out more frequently buy cars and go on more holidays hence the fast rising sales of automobiles garments cosmetics and jewellery

8200745 damage the private health sector and as a consequence inflict significant damage on our public health system
8200746 the government did not cost model or in any way assess the impact on public hospitals on the future costs of private health insurance or on health insurance membership levels after premiums increased as a result of this measure
8200747 the assumptions required to underpin it are inadequate for a rigorous analysis
8200748 1 billion of immediate funding to relieve pressure on public hospitals
8200749 lower income households must be protected from being forced to pay the medicare levy surcharge
8200750 will result in longer waiting lists for public hospitals and higher private health insurance premiums

8200764 because you lied to me thats why and because youve shown yourself to be just a petty criminal and and how many reasons do you want
8200765 actually i found out something very interesting while i was in richards house
8200766 alright youre on it again but only as long as you behave
8200767 thank you well it seems that richard took a lot of clothes with him when he left the house thats a very encouraging sign
8200768 if hed been kidnapped the only clothes missing would be those he was wearing
8200769 yes she admitted looking a little less like strangling me
8200770 why would richard have a harp beside his bed hes not the least musical he cant even sing in tune
8200771 tell me more about richard did i hear jewell say hes an accountant
8200772 definitely everything that passed through hands was confidential he couldnt discuss a word of it
8200773 well the people who wrote the private investigators handbook for a start
8200774 what would they think is the significance of the fact that richard handles classified information
8200775 you just told me that richards missing clothes meant he hadnt been kidnapped
8200776 i hadnt thought of that oh dear poor poor richard
8200777 of course thats only one of many possibilities and anyway in another place the book says that theres usually a perfectly logical explanation for everything which initially seems to us
8200778 maybe a lot of the ideas in the private investigators handbook appear to be contradictory bit i try not to let it bother me
8200779 id love to believe theres some logical explanation for richards disappearance but i cant all i get are the most ghastly images and the police theyre absolutely hopeless matt whenever i ask they assure me that hell turn up safe and sound but what are they doing to find him nothing
8200780 a training course for four weeks thats hardly likely is it anyway they havent sent him on a single course since he started at tolbrook hes not even mentioned the possibility of going on one
8200781 perhaps hes decided to give himself a break without telling anyone
8200782 he used up the last few outstanding days of his annual leave allowance when he went to egypt at easter no i believe that somethings wrong terribly terribly wrong and i want you to do something about it

8200785 members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening
8200786 the timing and extent of any change in policy stance would depend on evolving economic and financial developments and the implications for the outlook for economic growth and inflation
8200787 worried about the possibility that core inflation might fail to moderate next year unless the stance of monetary policy was tightened sooner than currently anticipated by financial markets
8200788 the labor market continued to weaken significantly financial conditions remained unfavorable consumer and business confidence was downbeat and manufacturing activity was contracting
8200789 he saw a greater risk to the economy from upward pressures on inflation
8200790 in his view businesses had become more inclined to raise prices to pass on the higher costs of imported goods and higher energy costs the latter of which were well above their levels of late 2007
8200791 i just signed my contract with victorias secret and when i arrived here this morning and saw all the pictures it was just amazing

8200793 the raise of sequoia capital india growth fund ii demonstrates our belief in the strong growth story in india and builds on the performance of our first growth fund this fund allows us to offer the powerful sequoia capital platform of global networks and local knowledge to growth companies and help them expand into market leaders
8200794 we believe that india has a very high number of promising companies that are poised to take their businesses to the next level and we are committed to investing and partnering with these firms to help them achieve their goals
8200795 the shortage of mortgage funding is creating similar problems for buy to let landlords as it is for other borrowers
8200796 however we expect the rental market to remain underpinned by strong demand partly because some people who would like to buy a home are being forced to carry on renting for now
8200797 sadly the impact of repossession can be even greater for tenants who despite paying rent on time can find themselves with very few rights and the first they even know about it is when the bailiffs start banging on the door
8200798 i would caution you against accepting anything you have as anything other than a work in progress
8200799 we are just not talking about it until it is debuted

8200802 you dont play the game to reach these milestones but it was nice news to receive after the game and to surpass a great player like olivier magne is a fantastic achievement
8200803 ive got plenty of time and plenty of games ahead of me
8200804 the breakdowns an important part of the game so it will definitely be an area that we will take notice of
8200805 it can work in different ways for you you can have faster flankers in terms of reaction time at the breakdown then a bigger physical guy in terms of ball carrying ability
8200806 so it works differently for different teams and i guess it works around the way the team is coached as well
8200807 they think that as soon as they get abroad the law doesnt apply to them
8200808 failure to keep to the speed limit has led to four deaths and 13 injuries on the motorways of the calais region since the start of this year half of the speeding offences detected at more than 200kph 124mph in this area have been committed by british drivers

8200813 academics tend to err on the side of nuance and precision eschewing generalizations and coarse labels this is great for documenting cultural dynamics but not so great for making interventions creating an impression an image in the minds of those who are fearful requires more than accurate data it requires a compelling story and a framework that can replace the boogie monster combatting pre existing images requires more than accuracy more than nuance it requires either a new more sticky image or a reworking of the original image

8200826 mirror on america how the state of gulf coast recovery reflects on us all
8200827 the uneven and inequitable state of recovery of the gulf coast is a national embarrassment
8200828 although the force of the storms was an act of nature the failures of the recovery are an act of our government if we refuse to address this as a nation it will go down in history not only as a failure of leadership but also as a failure to hold our government accountable
8200829 it was the perfect storm of worker exploitation and wage suppression
8200830 we should have found ourselves in a situation where because of the dearth of employees workers could have found wages that equaled or exceeded those of workers in places like new york and new jersey but instead you had people brought in trafficked in through artificial government support
8200831 the transition to a new administration is a critical opportunity to rebuild the gulf coast better and stronger
8200832 not only can we help the gulf coast recover we can take the opportunity of the rebuilding effort to address the long standing root causes of poverty and vulnerability that existed in these two states long before the storms of 2005

8200834 it is good that game makers like topware interactive are following the lead of the business software and music groups in taking a strong stance to protect the intellectual property that they have worked so hard to create
8200835 historically most anti piracy and copy protection applications defend the content but not themselves modern technologies guard the content of software and also work to guard themselves through defending detecting and reacting against all types of attacks even healing themselves calling for help or just shutting the program down
8200836 investing in protection like this offers a far more cost and time effective solution that going to court after the damage is done
8200837 there are many ways that a legal couple status may support a relationship more family understanding acceptance by friends and co workers greater commitment that results from a public declaration and enhanced legal protections in the form of healthcare benefits and community property
8200838 the results of this first study on the topic suggest that same sex partners who legalized their relationships in vermont may have been more committed to each other or functioning better prior to obtaining a civil union or that civil union status itself is helping to preserve their relationships
8200839 in contrast to old myths about same sex couples being deficient or less viable than male female couples this research project shows that same sex partners who seek to legalize their relationships actually may be among the best functioning couples in this society

8200850 domestic workers are dying in lebanon at a rate of more than one per week
8200851 all those involved from the lebanese authorities to the workers embassies to the employment agencies to the employers need to ask themselves what is driving these women to kill themselves or risk their lives trying to escape from high buildings
8200852 sarada was depressed because she had a lot of pressure from her husband to send money her husband was very sick the money she was sending was all spent on medical costs she was very upset about this because she wanted the money for her children to go to school
8200853 these suicides are linked to the isolation and the difficult working conditions these workers face in lebanon
8200854 while the lebanese authorities cannot guarantee these women happiness they should guarantee them the right to move freely to work in decent conditions to communicate with their friends and families and to earn a living wage
8200855 many domestic workers are literally being driven to jump from balconies to escape their forced confinement
8200856 i was locked in for two days and they the employers did not give me food and water then after two days i wanted to run away the apartment was on the fifth floor i tried to go down using cable wires running along the wall of building the cable broke and i do not remember what happened afterwards
8200857 most deaths resulting from a building fall are failed attempts to escape
8200858 dont call this an embassy we have become a funeral parlor people die natural deaths accidents suicide when they try to run away accidents happen
8200859 when employers lock someone up inside a home they are committing a crime and the police should treat it as such

8200875 earthquake hazard mapping is an integral component of preparedness in the event of a damaging earthquake in the new madrid seismic zone
8200876 our partnerships with washington university and the missouri department of natural resources are a reflection of our commitment to this market
8200877 earthquakes are a low frequency hazard with a very high consequence the purpose of the seminar was to better serve our policyholders by bridging the communication gap between the scientific and first responder communities on such hazards
8200878 we are overdue for a magnitude 6 earthquake in missouri if a big enough earthquake hits the ground in some areas will actually liquefy duley said when you have sand saturated with water the ground loses its bearing strength and is susceptible to greater devastating effects predicting an earthquake is nearly impossible but we do know that portions of the st louis region have varying degrees of risk

8200893 being from kansas having played at kansas and getting the opportunity to work at kansas has been great

8200897 im really excited with the opportunity to work with coach self
8200898 he is one of the top coaches in all of basketball and has a great staff with joe dooley kurtis townsend danny manning and brett ballard whom i have had an opportunity to get to know and respect through my years in coaching

8200920 im not a big fan of the prosecutions charges but i think hes got some ethical issues that put a cloud over him
8200921 to the legitimacy of the film are unfounded and that due process has been followed throughout the production
8200922 mr mcgartland was consulted by the filmmakers during the production read the script and watched the film in advance of any public screening he was also given the opportunity to have the name of the lead character replaced with a fictional character name which he declined
8200923 the film although inspired by the contents is not a representation of mr mcgartlands life
8200924 i knew it was coming but i was hoping to be out before it came
8200925 i am real surprised by how well it did to actually see we beat out durham county which is a show i have a lot of admiration for was something but then to see we beat out the tudors wow i mean its really great
8200926 especially when you are in the middle of shooting the second season its such a big jolt for the crew and the cast
8200927 when you set out to do a series set in toronto in 1895 the first things you say is well theres not a lot of 1895 left in toronto and i think our visual effects team pulled it off beautifully
8200928 if you like shows like csi and you want to figure out where something like the lie detector came from well it actually came from the victorian era
8200929 hes way ahead of his time which is a fabulous thing to play as comedy because some people think hes nuts
8200930 tell people that biology and the environment causes obesity and they are offered the one thing we have to avoid an excuse
8200931 as it is people who see more fat people around them may themselves be more likely to gain weight young people who think many of their friends binge drink are likely to do so themselves
8200932 peer pressure and social norms are powerful influences on behaviour and they are classic excuses we have to take away the excuses
8200933 vilifying the extremely fat doesnt make people change their behaviour
8200934 lots of warm words but with very little policy substance

8200940 the leading nations that produce tea are in asia yet you do not have a luxury tea brand from the region

8200942 we felt that it was time for tea to evolve with the times to become not only a drink that is enjoyed by our grandfathers but a fashionable chic upmarket beverage for the young too
8200943 we also want twg tea to be a school of tea for the world a one stop shop where you can know everything there is to know about tea

8200998 i have been in contact with the chief minister of orissa and i have told him that the incident in which the swami was killed has to be condemned but it should not cause damage to others and it is the responsibility of the state government and all of us that different sections of society should not be attacked

8201028 this outstanding programme generates light where others only generate heat it invariably gets beyond the waffle spin doctoring and histrionics which characterise so much debate in this country to uncover real issues explored with real arguments using people who have engaged their brains before opening their mouths
8201029 a good claim to being the most incisive and challenging current affairs strand on radio or tv

8201032 if we hadnt been here we wouldnt have made those connections
8201033 council made its decision based on 100 per cent planning grounds
8201034 council believes its made the right decision on those grounds for the specific site
8201035 it is an important find because we have found over the years several tombs that have been looted but never one that was intact
8201036 a multiple tomb in which three funeral bundles were found one has an impressive mask with the human characteristics of a woman
8201037 it is a woman because in the surrounding area we found offerings and textile items like those of a female weaver
8201038 finally we are starting to see the political will that is so desperately needed to save our storm boy country
8201039 today we moved from talk to action to save a national icon and help australians in need
8201040 cost of living pressures put some older people in increasing financial stress
8201041 it is becoming increasingly clear that the age pension alone is insufficient to meet the expenses needed for a modest living in retirement
8201042 given that in 2030 australia will have more voters over the age of 50 than those below that age action to meet this challenge is now a matter of urgency
8201043 there is an inherent dishonesty in the proposition being put by those opposite which is this has mysteriously emerged in the last few months it hasnt
8201044 its been an emerging problem for a long long time
8201045 i had to leave school at 16 for financial reasons
8201046 and then my attempts to study at night school were interrupted by national service with the portuguese army and then by the indonesian invasion
8201047 but now i put my dreams to the next generation i want the young people of timor leste to have that opportunity to have access to a world class education to have choices that timorese of my generation were denied
8201048 timor leste is an emerging multi billion asian economy with one of the highest growth rates in the region of about eight per cent per year
8201049 we have an accountable and democratic government with a large forward program of state investment and we have some of the lowest taxes in the region
8201050 the two hijackers and the seven crew are still inside we are continuing to negotiate with them
8201051 we are condemning first the hijacking of a civilian aeroplane and we are now in continuous contact and consultation with the libyan authorities in kufra airport
8201052 it is not clear whether there is one or more or whether they belong to abdul wahid were not expecting him to say yes
8201053 the hijackers claim to have coordinated with him nur to join him in paris
8201054 we categorically deny the responsibility of our movement in this hijacking operation
8201055 is a true leader of a rebellion of the resistance in darfur who says that he does not know these people and that he absolutely refuses to use these methods
8201056 no one declared responsibility for the hijacking all the rebels until now denied the operation
8201057 naturally i wanted sharelle out there leading the team but knowing sharelles on court intensity it was not worth taking the risk and playing her at this stage
8201058 we are taking a conservative approach to ensure she gets her body right for next year and beyond
8201059 ultimately while she is disappointed to not be taking part in the international series this is about the long term welfare of sharelle mcmahon in the australia netball team
8201060 this is an important series but we are at the start of an exciting four year cycle that includes the commonwealth games and world championships
8201061 if rushing back now without being fully fit puts these longer term goals in jeopardy then it isnt worth the risk
8201062 this means that the drugs used to relieve arthritis related discomfort accelerate the progression of the disease
8201063 but for us thats not the end game in fact it marks just the beginning
8201064 the argy bargy on this is going to be significant we accept that but we intend to prosecute this and we have some way to go yet in the months ahead
8201065 mr rudd is attempting to distract attention from our declining economy and his inability to deal with it with a big address to the nation which simply imitates the coalitions agenda
8201066 we believe policy reform is necessary if australia is to seize the future
8201067 our long term reform agenda embraces the full canvas of government
8201068 thats why they get such a huge welcome from people lost in the outdoors

8201073 theres only five minutes of lunch left and thats not enough time to savour the flavour of quiche
8201074 we all aspire to become millennium magicians then im going to eat smarties off
8201075 pat sharp quit after finding out quiche was more fun and he could eat it in his own house
8201076 with out thy quiche you are merely a woman in a hair net to me
8201077 im a big fan of the art you teach those little kiddies
8201078 i know i like to see them bleed the little basteds
8201079 she liked watching kids bleed thats not a good thing andy
8201080 so if fred west done a good cheese toasty youd be round in a flash would you
8201081 yer well im surprised people didnt focus more on that during his trial
8201082 they never take catering skills in to consideration like that bloke who cooked his wife
8201083 exactly the only reason he got caught was because mrs polanski started to choke on that wedding ring
8201084 up until then theyd all commented on what a lovely roast hed cooked
8201085 it means youve gotta swing your hips now come on oh yer kylie manogue
8201086 anyway you cant take the piss youve just taken us out of school on a mission to find bernard the quiche man
8201087 its a very import mission andy its quiche for christ sake
8201088 you chaps wouldnt know by any chance the way to the nearest bear fur retailer would you
8201089 i think what he meant to say was we dont have any bear fur retailers in the area youre best looking else where
8201090 oh yes we stayed with many of the local mehicans to learn their culture and ways
8201091 just got back from skiing in apeache thats aspin to you folk
8201092 got shagged up the arse by an apache thats sodomy to you folk
8201093 why do you always take the piss out of posh people andy
8201094 posh he wasnt posh he was a pratt with a berk on top lined in bear fur
8201095 who does he think we are talking down to us like that midgets
8201096 oh yer because hes the one insulting midgets isnt he
8201097 nar he probably hunts them knowing him the sick basted
8201098 enough of this back to the quiche man andy we need to concentrate
8201099 right now if you were a quiche man where would you be on a monday morning
8201100 you wouldnt by any chance be the quiche man would you
8201101 oh no no no hes working out of town this week
8201102 nope just sold the last slice to that young lady
8201103 this is a nightmare what are we going to do
8201104 last year it was held in norwich which was fine but this year theyve chosen to hold it in a place a true norfolk boy would seldom venture
8201105 not that bad its terrible lenard im not going to
8201106 you see theres something ive always wanted to tell you andy but have never had the guts
8201107 you were born on a plane your mum told me
8201108 when was your best move i cant even remember a slightly shit move on your part
8201109 dam good moves they just tend to take place when youre not about
8201110 what are you on about im like a move enhancer i am all the best moves take place when im about
8201111 lets get on the bus then and at least start heading towards
8201112 everyone has a bacon roll in their pocket its like a currency out the parts what were you thinking
8201113 surprisingly not about bacon rolls andy were out of quiche and were about to head out in to the unknown of
8201114 its not done yet and when it is announced it will be announced by the club
8201115 it could be a day or it could be a week
8201116 once i help todd decide where he wants to be well get a deal done relatively quickly but were not at the stage
8201117 hes more unlikely than likely at this stage but theres still a chance that he will play
8201118 hes running pretty strong but ill wait until the end of the week
8201119 weve worked very hard to put ourselves in a position where were playing better football and were not going to flirt with that
8201120 the benchmark team in the competition is geelong theyve clearly got a strong mandate to playing their best football and playing honest football and not falling into any habits they wish to
8201121 so i think if its good enough for geelong its clearly good enough for this group who are still trying to build to their best football
8201122 first 30 minutes the emotion of robert harvey who had his tribute match last weekend didnt mean much
8201123 we were behind by about 24 points at one stage and it could have easily been 30
8201124 this is the first time where weve seen israeli society in general being so open to consider who yeshua is
8201125 this is a real miracle and theres beginning to be grace and favor with us in the land
8201126 i believe with all my heart after we have come back to the land we are seeing the lord the holy spirit is removing the veil from the eyes of the jews and more and more jews are realizing
8201127 when jesus came when yeshua came he came to talk to our people
8201128 he walked on our land he spoke our language he spoke in our synagogues really he came for us
8201129 our kids go with everybody else to school i go to work outside our principle is to go out and be part of society
8201130 my friends started to know im a believer and they ask me if im a believer i tell them im a believer in yeshua and its really good to believe in him and that maybe you can one day believe in him too
8201131 my point is to share my faith with anyone who wants to hear me and i will gladly share the good news of my faith
8201132 i never speak of you should do and you should change
8201133 our current congregation we started almost two years ago with about 20 people today we have over 100
8201134 we see salvations here and there but we feel like theres something yet to come its definitely growing
8201135 i think probably the greatest challenge is that you always feel that the rest of society isnt accepting you
8201136 at least we see that believers are being asked to explain who they are what they believe in why they are here how they can be israeli and believe in jesus and be given an opportunity to tell their story and share their testimony
8201137 it really is ultimately a battle for the return of the lord because jesus will not return until the jewish people say baruch habba bshem adonai blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord
8201138 one of our other banner statements is from romans 11 that all israel will be saved so we are focused not just on growth in the body here and revival but as i said ultimately bringing yeshua back and his kingdom being established on the earth
8201139 if it wasnt for yeshua we would be lost just like the lost sheep of israel we would be its because of him there is that completion in our life and hope for the future
8201140 i think every american that i know was weeping over the next several weeks and devastated and shocked was that an act of pure terror it absolutely was and there are many other acts of terror carried out by our government even recently that that are comparable
8201141 senator obama has repeatedly denounced the detestable crimes committed 40 years and has denounced his deplorable comments
8201142 at the end of five years will we have broken the mold not much seems to be bubbling up that is inspiring or substantive
8201143 depression is a daily struggle and requires a lifestyle change with ongoing treatment i know that every single thing in relation to my body affects my mental health including nutrition exercise laughter hormones sleep alcohol consumption or lack of it prayer sugar and medication to name just a few we are proposing a concert so that we can share new information treatment options hope a new depression brand and famous musicians to share their music
8201144 i am continuously amazed at how few resources we put towards the brain when it is the most complex organ in the human body we are murdering ourselves more than others yet we hide it under the rug shadowed by shame what is happening that is making us turn against ourselves
8201145 we spend billions on wars across the globe and i wonder when we are going to spend that kind of money finding peaceful resolutions to the wars going on in the mind depression has taken the lives of many way too early wasted so many good years for others and it is time we understand why and encourage people to get treatment so they can improve the lives of all
8201146 i was 22 and basically drowning in sadness i hadnt played the piano in at least a year one day in desperation i sat down to play as soon as my fingers touched the keys these songs came pouring out and it helped her healing process
8201147 particularly if as is widely excepted these people are young and healthy
8201148 damage the private health sector and as a consequence inflict significant damage on our public health system
8201149 the government did not cost model or in any way assess the impact on public hospitals on the future costs of private health insurance or on health insurance membership levels after premiums increased as a result of this measure
8201150 the assumptions required to underpin it are inadequate for a rigorous analysis
8201151 1 billion of immediate funding to relieve pressure on public hospitals
8201152 lower income households must be protected from being forced to pay the medicare levy surcharge
8201153 will result in longer waiting lists for public hospitals and higher private health insurance premiums
8201154 well certainly be looking very favourably at extending bretts contract because the club has improved tremendously and we think theres more improvement to come
8201155 i think it would be great if both of them kicked a hundred
8201156 we could play six blokes behind the ball and have this dull affair but at the end of the day it would be fantastic to have this scenario played out
8201157 its rare for two players to achieve 100 goals in the same round let alone at the same venue and it would be great to see not only for our supporters but all footy supporters in general
8201158 i dare say a few of us will have the blinkers on going inside the forward 50
8201159 id be a little bit disappointed if players are out on their own and their going to a real 50 50 contest
8201160 i think we need to get the score on the board and you dont want to deflate other players because youre trying to get fevola that 100th goal
8201161 ryanair confirms that flight fr9336 from bristol to barcelona girona monday evening had a depressurisation problem which caused the deployment of oxygen masks
8201162 as a precautionary measure the captain decided to fly at a lower level and to divert the aircraft to limoges airrport the 168 passengers disembarked after landing sixteen passengers were taken to hospital at their request because they complained of hearing problems
8201163 i think its a bit shocking for all of us because with that ruling it sets a precedent now
8201164 i guess therell be nothing of the sort bringing down lineouts like that even though it wasnt a real bad one it sets a precedent now
8201165 any interference of this kind carries real danger and a sanction is required
8201166 ive lost a couple of kilos so ive just got to get that back on before the weekend
8201167 its like one of the things that could only happen to me
8201168 it could have been picked up from my hands something i picked up food anything so all we know is it was a pretty bad case to keep me out for that game which was real disappointing
8201169 ive had something to eat this morning which was pretty much the first thing in three days which i kept down

8201180 my eldest brother danding said i may carry the name of my father eduardo cojuangco sr but all that i am i owe to my mother
8201181 he loved his vocation as a doctor thats why we call him papa doc he loved being a leader and a peacemaker in the medical field he had always put his god and family at the center of his life
8201182 dad told us alagaan ninyong mabuti ang nanay ninyo please take very good care of your mother dad until the end expressed his infinite love and fidelity to his wife he is the epitome of love
8201183 there are all these thousands of changes all over creation but its not clear to the public what the changes are
8201184 people are used to choices flights timing number of stops and theyre finding that those choices are no longer there
8201185 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he

8201188 every concentration of arsenic you take in will have an associated cancer risk
8201189 with respect to the threat that rice bran products pose to dietary exposure dosage needs to be considered
8201190 the manufacturers recommended daily serving of rice bran solubles is around 20g per day based on either direct weights given on packaging or using the provided scoops a 20g serving equates to 0 014 0 017mg of inorganic arsenic for the 4 products specifically described as rice bran solubles
8201191 i am not concerned about one company in particular what im concerned about is the product in general weve raised problems in the past with rice grain baby rice and rice milk rice bran is just another product that needs to be seriously thought about
8201192 recent articles in the media have called into question the safety of us rice
8201193 assertions that arsenic levels in us rice may be harmful to health are not new it is truly unfortunate that these assertions unsupported by scientific data and analysis continue to confuse the public our message to you is simple us rice and nutracea products derived from it are safe

8201201 she gracefully marked her place as one of americas premiere politicians with a firm commanding gracious argument on behalf of barack obama
8201202 we had special board meeting on this and we deliberated on the complaint of the other party pgmc regarding orientals prospectus the legal cases were disclosed in the prospectus and we found no reason to deny the application
8201203 a reading of the foregoing grounds reveals the intention of the lawmakers to make the registration and issuance of securities dependent to a certain extent on the merits of the securities themselves and of the issuer to be determined by the sec
8201204 this measure was meant to protect the interest of the investing public against fraudulent and worthless securities and the sec is mandated by law to safeguard these interests following the policies and rules therefore provided
8201205 the absolute reliance on the full disclosure method in the registration of securities is therefore untenable
8201206 they cannot really point their fingers to the company the situation right now is beyond the control of oriental public investors are unwarranted victims
8201207 for example they want to invest in other mining claims they can do that as long as they disclose it to the public we dont impose penalties on deviation but on non disclosure
8201208 i dont think the price of the stock would go anywhere until these are resolved
8201209 the public is very trusting maybe thats why they still bought oriental shares despite pending cases its because they trust that regulators examined the risks very well

8201278 there will be no need for the eu to bother trying to reach an amicable solution or discussing the deployment of peacekeepers in the caucasus at its upcoming emergency summit this week after yesterday the subject is closed there is simply no point trying to negotiate with russia and it would be the wrong thing to do even if it there were the eu cannot discuss easing visa restrictions or economic cooperation when the other side is proving that it sees international agreements as mere scraps of paper
8201279 it is unclear how russian and the west will claw their way out of the worst crisis in relations since the collapse of the soviet union
8201280 the russian leadership has referred to the right of nations to self determination it is worth reminding them that the 1989 census in abkhazia revealed that living alongside armenians and russians 48 percent of the population were georgian and only 17 percent abkhaz by 2005 there were 45 percent abkhaz and just 6 5 percent georgians the reason for this development 200 000 of 250 000 georgians either fled during conflicts in the 1990s or were driven out in south ossetia only 29 percent of the population in 1991 were georgian they all fled after russias military strike on georgia so when the abkhaz and south ossetians announce independence based ostensibly on a law of nations russian recognition amounts to sanctioning an expulsion of people that violates the law of nations
8201281 anyone still wondering about the motives for russias war against georgia must have realized what is going on by now
8201282 moscow made its decision long ago protecting the ossetians against massacre was just an excuse to send its tanks into georgias breakaway regions russia is using military might to redraw the map in the caucasus the west is watching this sorry spectacle unfold this strategy of the fait accompli but europe and its allies are obligated to defend georgias integrity the eu must translate its words into action and take a hardliner stance against moscow
8201283 the russian presidents decision to recognize georgias breakaway regions is sheer provocation

8201285 at the maple leaf plant behind the listeria outbreak a single federal inspector was relegated to auditing company paperwork and had to deal with several other plants the manager and the union official said contradicting the impression that officials had left last week that full time watchdogs were on site
8201286 under the old system inspectors had a more hands on role on the plant floor did more of the tests themselves and had more freedom to investigate under the new rules instead of heading to the plant floor to inspect with their own eyes inspectors are sent to the office to confirm that the meat packer has performed the required tests and the results are satisfactory
8201287 we dont swab for listeria any more the industry does all that themselves
8201288 they just document all this stuff we read their reports if their reports say they do everything fine then they do everything fine
8201289 the federal rules require only that inspectors perform three or four random tests annually at a plant richard arsenault a manager at the cfia said in an interview the rest of the time inspectors rely on the company
8201290 i think all of us and obviously i include my own family in this we expect that when we shop that the things we buy or that we eat are going to be safe
8201291 all members of government have been on top of this
8201292 government policy was to hire 200 more inspectors thats what weve done since we achieved power in january 06

8201527 this step by the indian government demonstrates its determination to tackle the vulture crisis and we are very hopeful that other measures will follow
8201528 measures that make veterinary and human diclofenac less easy to use are crucial if we are to save these birds steps to make meloxicam which is safe for vultures and just as effective in treating livestock more widely available are just as important
8201529 vultures are critical to the way of life for millions of people in india and the contribution from boehringer ingelheim is hugely welcome
8201530 vultures need immediate action from across the board to stop vets using diclofenac and to support the captive breeding programmes that are so badly needed to prevent the extinction of these fine birds

8201538 some of them wanted to go out and smash all the cctv cameras they are still very unhappy about the cameras but they are government property and we cant move them
8201539 after this incident i realised that as soon as you step out of your door in this city you are under cctv surveillance
8201540 activists arent only followed by secret police in shenzhen anymore
8201541 they are concerned that they are followed everywhere by cctv cameras as well
8201542 they may not have face recognition technology on these cctv cameras yet
8201543 but they can easily be upgraded when the technology is available and no one will know
8201544 we already use face recognition technology in government offices and in the entrance to shopping malls in shenzhen
8201545 the technology is being upgraded day by day and the connectivity of different parts of the system to a central monitoring desk is also being constantly improved
8201546 it is a nationwide movement in china even small towns are trying to build up their own systems even though they dont have the resources that we have here
8201547 we did mobile surveillance during the olympics for the ministry of state security we have surveillance equipment inside a plain vehicle we park it at olympics venues and it sends data and pictures by satellites to the ministry
8201548 were worried that the government is using the olympics as an excuse to import this technology from western companies now the games are over we are worried they will use that technology to identify and round up dissidents
8201549 we are the national leaders in this type of technology
8201550 why didnt the government disclose the names of the people responsible and reveal the full details of the case
8201551 die motivation ist nach wie vor hoch um gerade bei diesem turnier bei dem wir so gut gesetzt sind f r die eine oder andere top platzierung zu sorgen
8201552 the brand of london has taken a hammering because of northern rock
8201553 i dont think it is terminal but london needs to be absolutely on its toes
8201554 in 2008 through june nearly 25 000bn worth of shares changed hands on the new york stock exchange and nasdaq up a combined 18 per cent on the same period last year trading on the london stock exchange dropped 29 per cent to 4 000bn according to the world federation of exchanges
8201555 more than 13 200 private equity professionals roughly one of every six worldwide are based in new york compared with 7 100 in london according to prequin an intelligence service
8201556 the number of hedge funds worth more than 1bn 682m 544m located in new york rose from 123 last year to 144 this year and their collective assets jumped from 650bn to 973bn according to hedge fund intelligence london remains a distant second it added just two new large funds year on year and now has 75 1bn funds managing 348bn
8201557 i am appealing for anyone who may have seen anything of this incident or may have been passing and seen two men wearing crash helmets running down the road
8201558 plus there are so many people who wanted to help and everyone was going in different directions
8201559 we needed a dog bowl shelf and the kind folks at books amp bookshelves recommended a special foot stool with a lip around the edge which was
8201560 a guy came in a few weeks ago and bought about seven of his books
8201561 i was driving straight out across woodbury and i heard a boom
8201562 we follow the guidelines that the state and the environmental protection agency recommend
8201563 all samples came back clean after we did flushing and chlorinating this is the first problem weve had in 13 years we do not have a history of bad water in rye the water quality is safe and continues to stay that way
8201564 we have a no idling policy this year for the pickups
8201565 it doesnt impact the flow of students in or out of building well give it a trial and see how it goes we might need to tweak it a bit we will definitely be greener
8201566 we have wrestled with this bus issue for some time
8201567 rye as a town is really long some kids are on the bus a half hour even 45 minutes if the child is involved in after school programs or sports and they have a doctors appointment they can get home too late we had a bus committee and surveyed parents the primary reason for the cars is because of the people at the last stops
8201568 last year we had to cut back the amount of assistance we gave each person so we had enough to go around
8201569 the problem were up against is we just have no idea how many people will need fuel assistance
8201570 were getting more corporate help this year than we have in past years
8201571 wenn die rkk das zuk nftig be sser macht und die aufnahme er leichtert dann gibt es
8201572 weve gradually increased activities in the summer as a way for professional development and to have large groups of teachers do collaborative work and build continuity from one year to the next
8201573 we all have blind spots and a colleague can see those for you
8201574 sometimes the trickier a student is to work with the more colleagues you need to help you see your own blind spots
8201575 one of the fundamental beliefs i have is if you get people together to agree what the most important things are and you have a common commitment to work together to see that students learn those things then i think the outside assessments take care of themselves
8201576 i spoke to a lot of people and they were not aware that there was a town fee for doing maintenance work on your house
8201577 with the high cost of heating fuel this year im sure a lot of people are trying to make their homes more energy efficient they shouldnt be charged for doing that
8201578 the permit costs 25 if it is maintenance work valued at between 1 000 and 5 000
8201579 we were charging the higher permitting fees on everything over 1 000
8201580 there is no permit or fee necessary for work under 1 000
8201581 the conservation commission could have properly availed itself of the provisions of rsa 91 a 3 right to know law and discussed the performance of the young man who was the subject of this portion of the meeting in non public session
8201582 power was out to the police department for 5 to 6 hours
8201583 it is a 65 kilowatt broad crown model powered by a john deere engine it will more than service the public safety facility and in the future if we go to a new facility we can install it there
8201584 i was really proud that we could help the town
8201585 we are pleased to loan the town of york police department our generator
8201586 we often feel that its a one way street with the county when it comes to our taxes its great to hear that they took the opportunity to send some of that back to us
8201587 this a place i have been visting for the better part of 20 years or so
8201588 please check this box and send the note back to confirm you still live at this address
8201589 oh when your permit has expired you simply need to move your car every two hours
8201590 hmm but how was i supposed to do that exactly when i was working out of town etc doesnt it seem excessive that they would ticket me literally twice a day two days in a row for something i couldnt rectify because you were closed
8201591 by the way ive already denied your claims on the tickets so you can contest them and show up for a hearing but you cant get the tickets waived
8201592 were the phone company we dont care we dont have to
8201593 gee when i grow up all i want to do is ruin peoples days because i am bitter and mommy didnt love me enough
8201594 thank you for calling dpt blah blah blah press 1 for english

8201596 its a revolution the reason for a customer service revival
8201597 i yelped the yelp out of that girl and she yelped it
8201598 oh weve been so busy lately business really picked up in the past month
8201599 everybody comes in and says they heard about us from yelp
8201600 youre mrs andy s honey honey come here this is mrs andy s
8201601 oh your husband wrote that review bring him in we want to thank him
8201602 hi im from the la times and i read your review about the virgin megastore on yelp and would like to get your opinion on the closing of the store
8201603 i was not completely satisfied with the service that i received at blah blah bah
8201604 right now the team that deploys the buoys isnt even preparing some of the buoys because the funding isnt there
8201605 we have an additional 20 million in state borrowing guarantees we went from 50 million to 70 million
8201606 were already using 5 million of that for the tax exempt borrowing that leaves 15 million available
8201607 if we took 1 million out of the revolving credit line the amount eligible for state guarantee would be 14 million if we paid back the 1 million and then borrowed another 2 million we would have only 12 million left in the state guarantee
8201608 we were not able to determine if the man died as result of the accident or if he had underlying medical condition
8201609 this is a response to a slower traffic period and were giving ourselves some operational flexibility in the winter months
8201610 when you have 30 frequencies a day are you going to miss one or two come on
8201611 i had really a good day last thursday in toronto and then it felt terrible
8201612 its much better today the neck locked up for a couple of days
8201613 the signs are we are going in the right direction thats why we got the mris to see whats going on
8201614 if it continues to progress in the right direction the guys in the trainers room know what to do well just take it a day at a time
8201615 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8201616 proud supporter of barack obama she dismissed republican john mccain with a few choice words
8201617 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8201618 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry
8201619 you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8201620 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8201621 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8201622 its time to bring our jobs back and bring our troops home
8201623 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8201624 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8201625 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8201626 i know were at the democratic national convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it
8201627 real sex education voted against affordable family planning and if elected john mccain has vowed to appoint supreme court justices who will overturn roe v wade
8201628 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever
8201629 placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8201630 john mccain offers four more years of the same bush cheney policies that have failed us
8201631 this is our time to revive the spirit of kennedy
8201632 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8201633 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8201634 i think ill have my staff get to you its condominiums where ill have them get to you
8201635 at some point really really soon those two are going to come crashing together and we wont have enough seats to meet the air travel needs of this market
8201636 if youve got a weather cancellation or mechanical cancellation there are no available seats in this market to rebook passengers so instead of being rebooked the same day it may be the next day or several days
8201637 we are going to work hard to try to tell that story as quickly as possible
8201638 the thing that we care about right now is getting our team better if you watched our first three preseason games theres a lot of work we have to do
8201639 whether its your second year in the league or 12th year in the league its a pretty somber day
8201640 just in the sense of guys that are potentially losing their jobs typically its kind of weird
8201641 i dont think that the players at the same position are necessarily in competition with each other
8201642 we want to keep the best players and that may be a balanced roster or not it may include a few more players at one position and a few less at another
8201643 i know the backfield is crowded but ive also said i know what im capable of doing
8201644 unfortunately i had this setback with the injury this past couple of weeks but once they make their decision what theyre going to do if im here its just up to me to make sure that come sunday im at my best
8201645 i guess especially in preseason we actually get more reps or more carries than we do in the actual game i think it puts the onus a little more individually to go out and execute with the limited amount of actual game reps
8201646 we probably have one of the deepest backfields in the league
8201647 the thing about us is that we all bring something different to the table which gives the defense a different look
8201648 if you are running a race with a guy and he is a lap ahead of you and you have a strong finish you are still going to finish behind him
8201649 if you are neck and neck with the guy and you have a strong finish then you beat him and it makes a lot of difference
8201650 so it would depend on what the relationship of the competition is at this point for how much the last game means
8201651 i buy my lunch at school im too lazy to make it at home ive taken it from home a few times but its too much work
8201652 i take my lunch from home and sometimes i will buy the school lunch i make a roast beef sandwich with celery and an apple i make it myself most of the time
8201653 i never make my own lunch at home no time i sleep in as long as i can before i have to take the bus i have to get up before 6 a m
8201654 sometimes i buy lunch at school but mostly i bring my own my dad makes it for me i love peanut butter and jelly and peanut butter and butter actually i always have a peanut butter pop which is a spoon of peanut butter
8201655 sun butter and jelly sandwiches are my favorite york doesnt allow peanut butter i also like turkey and cheese sometimes but not so much

8201663 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8201664 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8201665 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8201666 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8201667 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8201668 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8201669 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8201670 peter wellenberger was an advocate for the great bay estuary while still in college and he has grown into a national leader for research and stewardship of estuaries

8201683 i had really a good day last thursday in toronto and then it felt terrible
8201684 its much better today the neck locked up for a couple of days
8201685 the signs are we are going in the right direction thats why we got the mris to see whats going on
8201686 if it continues to progress in the right direction the guys in the trainers room know what to do well just take it a day at a time
8201687 my first organized tasting was in 1990 just for the local consumers and they didnt like wine at all
8201688 people started to talk about red wine being good for health
8201689 it doesnt have the focus or the body of a general bordeaux but its grape wall of china joining the bunch frankie zhao pro wine training amp consultancy
8201690 i have handed over a letter withdrawing my support to the government to the speaker kishore mohanty
8201691 we have sought the central leaderships permission to withdraw support the government has admitted its failure to provide security to the vhp leader saraswati
8201692 there is no sign of violence subsiding in kandhmal even though three days have passed since the killing of swami laxmananda saraswati
8201693 ive had a chance to play and be healthy so im excited to be here
8201694 im motivated to do very well here and for the rest of the season
8201695 i wish i could play normal matches and enjoy tennis sometimes
8201696 the thing that we care about right now is getting our team better if you watched our first three preseason games theres a lot of work we have to do
8201697 whether its your second year in the league or 12th year in the league its a pretty somber day
8201698 just in the sense of guys that are potentially losing their jobs typically its kind of weird
8201699 i dont think that the players at the same position are necessarily in competition with each other
8201700 we want to keep the best players and that may be a balanced roster or not it may include a few more players at one position and a few less at another
8201701 i know the backfield is crowded but ive also said i know what im capable of doing
8201702 unfortunately i had this setback with the injury this past couple of weeks but once they make their decision what theyre going to do if im here its just up to me to make sure that come sunday im at my best
8201703 i guess especially in preseason we actually get more reps or more carries than we do in the actual game i think it puts the onus a little more individually to go out and execute with the limited amount of actual game reps
8201704 we probably have one of the deepest backfields in the league
8201705 the thing about us is that we all bring something different to the table which gives the defense a different look
8201706 if you are running a race with a guy and he is a lap ahead of you and you have a strong finish you are still going to finish behind him
8201707 if you are neck and neck with the guy and you have a strong finish then you beat him and it makes a lot of difference
8201708 so it would depend on what the relationship of the competition is at this point for how much the last game means
8201709 of human being is not the spirit as the synthesis of body and soul but existence
8201710 an act is never also an object for it is the nature of the being of acts only to be experienced in the process itself and given in reflection
8201711 a higher endowment whose kind of being remains just as obscure as that of the being so pieced together
8201712 neither may daseins spatiality be interpreted as an imperfection which adheres to existence by reason of the fatal

8201717 mr rudd is attempting to distract attention from our declining economy and his inability to deal with it with a big address to the nation which simply imitates the coalitions agenda

8201730 it is the cadillac of generators it is a 65 kilowatt broad crown model powered by a john deere engine it will more than service the public safety facility and in the future if we go to a new facility we can install it there
8201731 i was really proud that we could help the town
8201732 we are pleased to loan the town of york police department our generator
8201733 we often feel that its a one way street with the county when it comes to our taxes its great to hear that they took the opportunity to send some of that back to us

8201782 one of the smaller cultured nations of ancient mexico occupying at the time of the spanish conquest the coast province of totonicapan comprehending all except the northern border of the present state of vera cruz together with the zacatlan district in puebla within this territory they had some fifty towns with a total population of perhaps a quarter of a million their capital cempoala about five miles inland from the present city of vera cruz had a population of about 25 000 in spite of wars epidemics and oppressions they still number about 100 000
8201783 the totonac were the first natives whom cort s met on landing in mexico in 1519 according to their own traditions they had come from the north west nearly eight centuries earlier and had maintained an independent kingdom of which the names of the successive kings are on record until subjugated by the aztec only about twenty five years before the arrival of the spaniards being compelled by their conquerors to the payment of a heavy tribute and to other exactions including the frequent seizure of their people for slaves or for sacrifice in the bloody aztec rites they were ripe for revolt and their king chicomacatt eagerly welcomed cort s and promised the support of his fifty thousand warriors against montezuma it was largely due to their support that cortez was able to conquer the aztecs a totonaca myth tells of a time in the 13th century when there was a great drought causing food and water grew scarce throughout the land five young men decided that they must send a message to xipe totec god of fertility so that the rains would return and nurture the soil and their crops would again flourish so they went into the forest and searched for the tallest straightest tree they could find when they came upon the perfect tree they spent the night fasting and praying for the trees spirit to help them in their quest the next day they blessed the tree cut it down and carried it back to their village never allowing it to touch the ground only when they decided upon the perfect place for their ritual did they set the tree down the men stripped the tree of its leaves and branches dug a hole to stand it upright then blessed the site with ritual offerings the men adorned their bodies with feathers so that they would appear like birds to xipe totec in hope of attracting the gods attention to their important request with vines wrapped around their waists they secured themselves to the pole and made their plea through their flight and the haunting sound of the flute and drum in mesoamerican times the ritual of the volador was performed throughout much of mexico it was performed once every 52 years at the change of the century and the brotherhood of the voladores was passed from father to son at the time of the conquest the church fought strongly against what it considered heathen practices and indigenous worship and rituals were silenced or held in secret later the catholic church combined native beliefs with religious dogma creating a syncretization of faith the flight of the volador was considered an interesting game by colonial new spain and special plazas were constructed where the voladores performed for a curious public over time the ritual slowly died out until finally the totonaca and a few otomi were the only groups performing this ancient practice today the totonaca people perform the flight of the voladores for several reasons first it keeps a part of their traditional culture alive for everyone to see second it provides additional income for the voladores and their families and it provides a sense of group pride the voladores were among the first cultivators of vanilla and many of them continue to grow it today the voladores comprised an elite segment of the totonaca society vanilla continues to have a sacred place in the lives of the totonaca in the same way as the flight of the volador and the two have remained integrally connected the voladores are a source of great pride to everyone in totonocapan the region of the totonaca in papantla the hub of the vanilla industry there is even a large stone volador that looks down on the city from one of the highest points in town like many legends there is another story which we think is interlinked into the story we have just told the totonaco nation of papantlas began this spiritual ritual after their beloved king flatchutanechi died during his rule the nation became stronger and more prosperous than ever before after his death the nation faltered and became weak in this spiritual ceremony the dancers are praying to the creator for another king with the wisdom and strength of king flatchutanechi flatchutanechi ruled for 52 years and to honor that each year of his reign the voladores circle the pole 13 times multiplied by the four voladores it equals 52 spins which represents the number of years the king ruled and the number of weeks in each year the dancer on top of the 100 foot high pole is praying to the four directions with his music and dance the top of the pole is approximately 10

8201791 elano has great mobility and the ability and willingness to receive the ball in tight positions and it makes him a dangerous proposition
8201792 i sensed he would cause west ham problems in that role and i know that it is one that he likes
8201793 he has played slightly deeper in a number of games last season but he likes that no 10 role and it is made to measure for him he enjoys being pushed further forward
8201794 we will have a look at him and see what shape he is in but i think we can tap into the high that he is on after he finished the olympic tournament on a great note winning a medal and scoring twice
8201795 it is a big challenge for us tomorrow but we will be a different side with the two competitive premier league games under our belts the manner of the performance against west ham on sunday showed real determination and a desire not to be denied and we will need more of that tomorrow
8201796 i got the feeling they underestimated us as we were standing in the tunnel before the match
8201797 the win was fantastic though before the first leg our chances of progressing might have been 20 per cent now we think that they are 50 50
8201798 to win at city was the greatest moment of my midtjylland career we fought as hard as we could and ran and ran
8201799 the win left us in a good position ahead of the second leg but we will have to remember that we are playing against a premier league team so nothing is decided yet
8201800 power was out to the police department for 5 to 6 hours

8201805 the card was lying in the bottom of a postal bin
8201806 i spoke to a lot of people and they were not aware that there was a town fee for doing maintenance work on your house
8201807 with the high cost of heating fuel this year im sure a lot of people are trying to make their homes more energy efficient they shouldnt be charged for doing that
8201808 the permit costs 25 if it is maintenance work valued at between 1 000 and 5 000
8201809 we were charging the higher permitting fees on everything over 1 000
8201810 there is no permit or fee necessary for work under 1 000
8201811 last year we had to cut back the amount of assistance we gave each person so we had enough to go around
8201812 the problem were up against is we just have no idea how many people will need fuel assistance

8201814 there is still a lot of uncertainty on the political front people just want to get out of the market

8201819 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002

8201821 i fell in love with him because he wasnt afraid of me

8201837 now citizens are reporting criminal intelligence to the ip telling them where improvised explosive devices are being placed by criminals the difference now is that the citizens see the ip are truly out there to help them
8201838 violence in tarmiyah has increased over the past few months
8201839 by opening more ip stations in tarmiyah and increasing the numbers of ip in those stations things can only get better for the citizens
8201840 the new potential ip will enable the ia to move into more military based operations along the countrys borders to deter criminals coming in from other countries

8201861 we are extremely encouraged by the results of the aza 001 trial which for the first time showed that survival could be extended for patients with higher risk mds

8201863 the time has come to research and quantify the benefits of radiation therapy and make clearer the role the radiation oncologist plays in curing cancer and improving the quality of life for people living with cancer
8201864 we believe that open objective research will demonstrate the value that radiation oncology brings to cancer care throughout the world
8201865 the radiation oncology institute has been established to develop innovative ways of enhancing the profile of radiation oncology in the world cancer community and to help prepare the specialty for the future
8201866 our plan is for roi to conduct objective research on the specialty to document the value safety efficacy and cost effectiveness of radiation therapy with the goal of stepping up the profile of radiation therapy within the medical community to ensure that cancer patients have access to the treatments that are best for them their lifestyle and their cancer
8201867 astro turns 50 this year in our first half century radiation therapy has made remarkable strides and has become a mainstay in the treatment of cancer indeed the majority of cancer patients receive radiation therapy either as their definitive treatment or along with other treatments like surgery and chemotherapy
8201868 with the roi we begin our journey into the next 50 years and our mission to gather critical data fund important research and educational initiatives in radiation oncology with the ultimate goal of ensuring that cancer patients have access to the life saving treatments required to maximize cure and optimize quality of life
8201869 further studies should target underlying biologic and socioeconomic factors to explain these differences

8201872 the francis trial was designed with input from global regulatory agencies and industry experts and represents the next key component of our international cardiovascular development program the multiple therapeutic impact of varespladibs mechanism of action provides us with a unique opportunity to develop a first in class product targeting a life threatening coronary event for which there are limited therapeutic options
8201873 based upon the success of varespladib in two previous phase ii clinical trials in patients with cardiovascular disease in which it demonstrated lipid lowering and anti inflammatory benefits we look forward to further evaluating the impact of varespladib on the hyper inflammatory state presented by acs patients
8201874 nicollette sheridan and michael bolton have amicably ended their engagement
8201875 they appreciate your respect for their privacy in this matter
8201876 theres a tragic sensibility at the root of hair a deep awareness of the gap between our vision and our achievement that makes this piece as relevant today as it was 40 years ago trapped once again in a war that we were tricked into by politicians a war the nation has totally lost faith in with no clear exit strategy and ineffectual resistance hair resonates in 2008 more than we might wish

8201880 caregivers have similar cortisol levels as controls their cells seem to be hearing less of this signal in other words something goes awry in caregivers white blood cells so they are not able to receive the signal from cortisol that tells them to shut down inflammation
8201881 because people have traditionally thought that higher cortisol is the reason that stress contributes to disease but this work shows that at least in caregivers its actually the opposite theres too little cortisol signal being heard by the cells rather than too much
8201882 we dont know how to account for the resilience of some stressed people exposed to severe sustained stress or the vulnerability of some people to relatively mild stress
8201883 the better that we understand the underlying molecular mechanisms that link stress to illness the more likely we are to make progress in answering these important questions
8201884 we now report evidence that restoration of the functioning of the stress axis may be the key to how these new antidepressant approaches might work
8201885 these findings lend weight to the hope that crf1 antagonists might play a role in the treatment of antidepressant resistant symptoms of depression or posttraumatic stress disorder if so crf1 antagonists could fulfill an important unmet need
8201886 we do not need another prozac but we urgently need to find ways to help the large number of patients who fail to respond adequately to our available treatments
8201887 there was a tiny pore on aug 22nd 2008 bill livingston measured its magnetic field and tells me today that it was 1931 gauss you may verify for yourself that that falls straight on his projected line btw he has many other data points now between the last data shown on the plot and this latest one and they also confirm the trend
8201888 we never considered that interferon alpha could be a major player in early type 1 diabetes
8201889 a normal process programmed cell death causes a normal response
8201890 but it does this in such a way that in a small subset of the population it starts them on the road to type 1 diabetes

8201893 the cult of the great mother meter presents a complex picture insofar as indigenous minoan mycenean tradition is here intertwined with a cult taken over directly from the phrygian kingdom of asia minor
8201894 o n the basis of inscriptional and iconographical evidence it is possible to trace the diffusion of her cult in the early iron age the cult reached the phrygians in inner anatolia where it took on special significance
8201895 just as in all other respects the athenians continue to be hospitable to things foreign so also in their worship of the gods for they welcomed so many of the foreign rites the phrygian rites of rhea cybele are mentioned by demosthenes when he casts the reproach upon aeskhines mother and aeskhines himself that he was with her when she conducted initiations that he joined her in leading the dionysiac march and that many a time he cried out evoe saboe and hyes attes attes hyes for these words are in the ritual of sabazios and the mother rhea
8201896 the mother of the gods the savior who hears our prayers
8201897 together come and follow to the phrygian home of cybele to the phrygian forests of the goddess where the clash of cymbals ring where tambourines resound where the phrygian flute player blows deeply on his curved reed where ivy crowned maenads toss their heads wildly

8201921 you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8201922 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8201923 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8201924 its time to bring our jobs back and bring our troops home
8201925 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8201926 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8201927 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground

8201934 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8201935 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8201936 last year we had to cut back the amount of assistance we gave each person so we had enough to go around
8201937 the problem were up against is we just have no idea how many people will need fuel assistance
8201938 were getting more corporate help this year than we have in past years
8201939 everyone that their music touches is amazed by the beautiful harmony we are honored that they are returning to the seacoast for their only new england appearance and to help the pease greeters
8201940 growing up traditional country music was always where my heart was at
8201941 because those songs were speaking about the life that i was living in rural south carolina it was all about love and work and life and just the everyday stuff that people go through it has always made me feel good the melodies the lyrics so thats what im trying to carry on
8201942 and this year is no exception as more venues around town offer unique events and performances sept 1 through 14
8201943 what started out as a few days of special events has expanded to two weeks to accommodate all of the activities offered
8201944 im just honored to have a chance to address the convention

8201953 they all laughed when i said i was going to be a comedian theyre not laughing now
8201954 weve gradually increased activities in the summer as a way for professional development and to have large groups of teachers do collaborative work and build continuity from one year to the next
8201955 we all have blind spots and a colleague can see those for you
8201956 sometimes the trickier a student is to work with the more colleagues you need to help you see your own blind spots
8201957 one of the fundamental beliefs i have is if you get people together to agree what the most important things are and you have a common commitment to work together to see that students learn those things then i think the outside assessments take care of themselves

8201959 i was delivering a dvd player to a young boy he must have been about 10 and his mother had received a list of dvds

8201961 samanthas efforts to make sure that the needs of each and every one of our patients are met are a credit to her empathy and perseverance and surely shows that york hospital volunteers regardless of age are in a class by themselves
8201962 im learning more about harry potter than i ever wanted to know in these past two weeks
8201963 once we started decorating the room we knew it was going to be magical
8201964 it was a success from the kids standpoint they had so much fun
8201965 what time does the hogwarts express leave platform nine and three quarters
8201966 teachers have been engaged in a number of professional development programs our buildings have been and are continuing to be upgraded
8201967 the children have the opportunity to have a more enriched program
8201968 were creating a family environment here where every teacher knows every student
8201969 whats a change from last year is that in all the grades during lunch and recess were going to be mixing classes
8201970 for continuitys sake having students take that music class is really going to help them out
8201971 the parents really liked it because it was one stop shopping
8201972 and they like the idea that profits go back to school activities
8201973 a support course for regular math classes so all kids who will be coming in as freshmen will be taking algebra or better
8201974 our counselors will get to know our kids and parents and who they are
8201975 you hate to add any other burden to people when theyre feeling it at the grocery store and pump but i dont really see any other choice here
8201976 were gearing up with the start of school right around the corner
8201977 plus there are so many people who wanted to help and everyone was going in different directions
8201978 power was out to the police department for 5 1 2 6 hours
8201979 we came across a generator recently acquired by york county
8201980 it is the cadillac of generators it is a 65 kilowatt broad crown model powered by a john deere engine it will more than service the public safety facility and in the future if we go to a new facility we can install it there
8201981 i was really proud that we could help the town
8201982 we are pleased to loan the town of york police department our generator
8201983 we often feel that its a one way street with the county when it comes to our taxes its great to hear that they took the opportunity to send some of that back to us
8201984 we follow the guidelines that the state and the environmental protection agency recommend
8201985 all samples came back clean after we did flushing and chlorinating this is the first problem weve had in 13 years we do not have a history of bad water in rye the water quality is safe and continues to stay that way

8201992 i thank god who has been with me through this gruelling election process i thank the voters
8201993 the message is clear we have made a demand for change for freedom and for justice
8201994 the people do not want to be exploited we want an economic order that protects all the people
8201995 this is a clear indication that people of all races have rejected the communal politics of barisan nasional it is a clear endorsement of our reform agenda we are on track to take over the government
8201996 at one point we didnt know what we were going to do we were going to get arrested or maced i havent been able to vote for a president yet but this was an epiphany my freedom of speech was suppressed
8201997 this is not america this is what a police state looks like youre worried about beijing this is repression
8201998 hes sort of like us he comes from a middle class background went to school on scholarships he and his wife had to figure out child care and how to start a college fund for their kids
8201999 first convention since 1960 when president john f kennedy moved his acceptance speech to the los angeles memorial coliseum to open its doors to more than 75 000 people from across the country as barack obama accepts the democratic nomination for president of the united states at invesco field at mile high in the first 48 hours after the invitation was issued more than 80 000 coloradans requested community credentials for senator obamas speech
8202000 most supporters will be sitting under the open night sky but a group of lobbyists and corporate executives will watch the event from plush skyboxes with catered food and a flowing bar and a price tag of up to 1 million
8202001 if obama loses and the party thinks shes a saboteur her path to the nomination in 2012 will be tougher
8202002 last year we had to cut back the amount of assistance we gave each person so we had enough to go around
8202003 the problem were up against is we just have no idea how many people will need fuel assistance
8202004 what really inspired us was years ago we used to have bonfires on york beach
8202005 and we can all remember hanging out with our parents and friends and having fun at the bonfire
8202006 were getting more corporate help this year than we have in past years
8202007 he gets fuel for his car and its great for us because we are able to recycle it and put it to good use
8202008 there is a display inside that teaches kids the proper body mechanics when riding a four wheeler
8202009 there is also a ride inside for the kids thats fun but also educational
8202010 when i had a gas vehicle i had to get reimbursed for mileage
8202011 with gas prices being the way they are we couldnt do as many events as we would have liked to do
8202012 now its easier and more cost effective to bring the safety trailer to different events
8202013 if i can get the oil for free it costs only 20 cents per gallon to heat it up and filter it
8202014 once you get the oil you have to filter out all the particles before you can use it
8202015 last year we attended the seafood festival and saw all the used vegetable oil and i thought wow i can use that
8202016 its great because its someone who is local using cooking oil to fuel his car for a good cause
8202017 i spoke to a lot of people and they were not aware that there was a town fee for doing maintenance work on your house
8202018 with the high cost of heating fuel this year im sure a lot of people are trying to make their homes more energy efficient they shouldnt be charged for doing that
8202019 the permit costs 25 if it is maintenance work valued at between 1 000 and 5 000
8202020 we were charging the higher permitting fees on everything over 1 000
8202021 there is no permit or fee necessary for work under 1 000
8202022 we were not able to determine if the man died as result of the accident or if he had underlying medical condition

8202027 we have a no idling policy this year for the pickups
8202028 it doesnt impact the flow of students in or out of building well give it a trial and see how it goes we might need to tweak it a bit we will definitely be greener
8202029 we have wrestled with this bus issue for some time
8202030 rye as a town is really long some kids are on the bus a half hour even 45 minutes if the child is involved in after school programs or sports and they have a doctors appointment they can get home too late we had a bus committee and surveyed parents the primary reason for the cars is because of the people at the last stops
8202031 the card was lying in the bottom of a postal bin
8202032 i was driving straight out across woodbury and i heard a boom
8202033 right now the team that deploys the buoys isnt even preparing some of the buoys because the funding isnt there
8202034 we took the critter skimmer to our first show in atlantic city and we were mobbed for three days and had the same reaction at the orlando pool show
8202035 we also received a call from popular science magazine last week and theyve entered us in the contest whats new for 2008
8202036 the association of zoos and aquariums has deemed 2008 the year of the frog because of the declining frog population worldwide
8202037 with 10 million pools in the u s alone if even half of them have the same problems we had with frogs we might be able to save 10 million frogs a year and each frog eats about 3 000 bugs a month the impact could be huge
8202038 distributors wont pick it up until customers start asking for it
8202039 it looks like 2009 will be the year things will start moving
8202040 i just wanted the frogs out of my pool but this has a greater far reaching impact than i had imagined really its so simple it works
8202041 council made its decision based on 100 per cent planning grounds
8202042 council believes its made the right decision on those grounds for the specific site
8202043 employers need to take some responsibility for the impact that overwork can have on their employees health alex farrell managing director at www theitjobboard co uk with our research showing that a significant amount of it workers find it difficult to maintain relationships or suffer ill health the uks culture of working long hours needs to be addressed as businesses look to derive as much value from their people assets as possible during lean times it is going to be imperative that we dont drive employees to burnout
8202044 the discerning on the go defecator who is brave enough to use a public bathroom but still demands a hygienic and private bathroom experience
8202045 it surprises us that mattel chose to direct facebook to take down scrabulous without waiting for indias court to rule on the matter jayant agarwalla co creator of scrabulous said in an e mail
8202046 mattels action speaks volumes about their business practices and respect for the judiciary it is even more astonishing that facebook which claims to be a fair and neutral party took this step
8202047 finally we are starting to see the political will that is so desperately needed to save our storm boy country
8202048 today we moved from talk to action to save a national icon and help australians in need
8202049 naturally i wanted sharelle out there leading the team but knowing sharelles on court intensity it was not worth taking the risk and playing her at this stage
8202050 we are taking a conservative approach to ensure she gets her body right for next year and beyond
8202051 ultimately while she is disappointed to not be taking part in the international series this is about the long term welfare of sharelle mcmahon in the australia netball team
8202052 this is an important series but we are at the start of an exciting four year cycle that includes the commonwealth games and world championships
8202053 if rushing back now without being fully fit puts these longer term goals in jeopardy then it isnt worth the risk
8202054 without the expectation of playing this series i can just focus now on my rehabilitation i would love to be out there leading the team but i will be in the stands supporting the players and assisting wherever possible
8202055 hes more unlikely than likely at this stage but theres still a chance that he will play
8202056 hes running pretty strong but ill wait until the end of the week
8202057 weve worked very hard to put ourselves in a position where were playing better football and were not going to flirt with that
8202058 the benchmark team in the competition is geelong theyve clearly got a strong mandate to playing their best football and playing honest football and not falling into any habits they wish to
8202059 so i think if its good enough for geelong its clearly good enough for this group who are still trying to build to their best football
8202060 first 30 minutes the emotion of robert harvey who had his tribute match last weekend didnt mean much
8202061 we were behind by about 24 points at one stage and it could have easily been 30
8202062 well take what comes in a perfect scenario youd get the regulation break but those things are out of your control
8202063 i think every american that i know was weeping over the next several weeks and devastated and shocked was that an act of pure terror it absolutely was and there are many other acts of terror carried out by our government even recently that that are comparable
8202064 senator obama has repeatedly denounced the detestable crimes committed 40 years and has denounced his deplorable comments
8202065 at the end of five years will we have broken the mold not much seems to be bubbling up that is inspiring or substantive
8202066 i had to leave school at 16 for financial reasons
8202067 and then my attempts to study at night school were interrupted by national service with the portuguese army and then by the indonesian invasion
8202068 but now i put my dreams to the next generation i want the young people of timor leste to have that opportunity to have access to a world class education to have choices that timorese of my generation were denied
8202069 timor leste is an emerging multi billion asian economy with one of the highest growth rates in the region of about eight per cent per year
8202070 we have an accountable and democratic government with a large forward program of state investment and we have some of the lowest taxes in the region
8202071 it is an important find because we have found over the years several tombs that have been looted but never one that was intact
8202072 a multiple tomb in which three funeral bundles were found one has an impressive mask with the human characteristics of a woman
8202073 it is a woman because in the surrounding area we found offerings and textile items like those of a female weaver
8202074 the two hijackers and the seven crew are still inside we are continuing to negotiate with them
8202075 we are condemning first the hijacking of a civilian aeroplane and we are now in continuous contact and consultation with the libyan authorities in kufra airport
8202076 it is not clear whether there is one or more or whether they belong to abdul wahid were not expecting him to say yes
8202077 the hijackers claim to have coordinated with him nur to join him in paris
8202078 we categorically deny the responsibility of our movement in this hijacking operation
8202079 is a true leader of a rebellion of the resistance in darfur who says that he does not know these people and that he absolutely refuses to use these methods
8202080 no one declared responsibility for the hijacking all the rebels until now denied the operation
8202081 particularly if as is widely excepted these people are young and healthy
8202082 damage the private health sector and as a consequence inflict significant damage on our public health system
8202083 the government did not cost model or in any way assess the impact on public hospitals on the future costs of private health insurance or on health insurance membership levels after premiums increased as a result of this measure
8202084 the assumptions required to underpin it are inadequate for a rigorous analysis
8202085 1 billion of immediate funding to relieve pressure on public hospitals
8202086 lower income households must be protected from being forced to pay the medicare levy surcharge
8202087 will result in longer waiting lists for public hospitals and higher private health insurance premiums
8202088 only six of our police were wounded in the taliban attack
8202089 two hundred and sixty million people in the us have health insurance
8202090 keep going keep going dont ever stop were americans were not big on quitting
8202091 it wasnt unexpected every time we go to the olympics we do the post mortem and we say that we need to invest more in sports but nothing is ever done
8202092 the swimmers did extremely well most of them broke their personal best times
8202093 because the experienced swimmers didnt win any medals people have lost sight of the performances of the new generation the second line who came through
8202094 they did very well and if they are carefully looked after they should deliver at the next olympics in london
8202095 one needs to put the african records and personal bests into perspective
8202096 the new technology in swimming has driven the sport forward by 5 in the last few months whereas we only progressed by 1
8202097 the challenge is to figure out how best to invest the limited resources particularly financial resources and then figure out which sports are going to deliver the biggest return without compromising the other sports which may be neglected
8202098 theres a fine line between specialising and becoming elitist as opposed to encouraging mass participation and activity among the population
8202099 all the political leaders especially tony blair and gordan sic brown

8202194 we are very excited to have the opportunity to work with such a leading brand and were inspired by the success and ambition of entrepreneur roustam tariko russian brands are quickly capturing the attention of western consumers and i have no doubt that russian standard vodka will soon be recognized as the most exquisite expression of modern russian taste
8202195 this was a forum to bring the brand spirit to life and share its culture tradition savoir faire and values online we trust that the internet will play an ever expanding role in russian standard vodkas marketing strategy this is definitely the most appropriate media to accompany a brand with such a strong international presence and fast expansion

8202202 i can assure you we take all precautions all rules of engagement are followed we have tremendous confidence and faith in our leadership here in afghanistan
8202203 the enemy which is trying to do things to make a propaganda campaign out of such incidents so nobody benefits
8202204 definitely we ourselves and the international community will exercise maximum caution to prevent such incidents which go against all of our wishes and all of the ideals which we are here fighting for
8202205 prevent the repetition of such incidents which are so unfortunate
8202206 having these eyes in the sky that allow us to locate the taliban to see in some instances where they are making these ieds improvised explosive devices that are having such a horrific effect on the troops and the civilian population
8202207 there is no question that this has been a tough season very difficult sledding for our forces as well as our allies
8202208 it is also our intention that we should not be a burden on our canadian friends and allies or the rest of the international community forever

8202224 i should help milan to win the trophies were up for this season the club have made some great signings and sheva will fit in without any problems
8202225 i cant say if ive been included in the shevchenko deal because if someone has promised me to chelsea owner roman abramovich it wasnt me
8202226 ive always said im happy at milan and as long as my aims remain the same as milans ill stay here until now its always been that way
8202227 my goal is to win milans is too as long as we are like that ill remain at milan
8202228 in the issue of shevchenko kaka was never ever talked about and so the fans have to stay calm weve been saying the same thing for two years
8202229 getting there will take the best minds on the planet working together lead by the best and brightest to achieve a goal never before attempted

8202239 of course we dont need that everything depends on the stance of our partners and the world community
8202240 we fully support georgias independence and territorial integrity which cannot be changed by decree from moscow

8202244 the court has approved the arrest warrants as requested by the police
8202245 we looked organised in the first half but it all went out of the window in the second half we lost our shape and discipline and goalkeeper matt duke kept us in it
8202246 as a collective the team was far too disorganised and dishevelled in the second half and we lost the game
8202247 i just want to go from strength to strength with manchester city i cant see myself playing anywhere else
8202248 i have to admit in the past i havent always liked playing on the right wing but i wasnt in the team last week and i was determined to make sure i took my chance when it came
8202249 it was up to me to make sure i took my chance now i hope to make that role my own with a few more performances like that
8202250 there is no doubt that this is a big season for me because i feel i am over that promising level and now an established player
8202251 thaksin is happy to sell off a chunk but wants to retain the majority

8202254 some of them have phoned the supporters club because they couldnt find the club number so i get the supporters club asking me if the club is for sale so ive got to deal with all that
8202255 track position on these big tracks plays an important role during the event we
8202256 our first goal of the weekend is a strong qualifying effort on friday
8202257 the level of intensity has certainly risen the past few weeks and theres definitely more pressure
8202258 we have to be sure were on top of our game we cant make mistakes and we have to be sure were doing everything right
8202259 were racing the guys in 10th 11th 12th 13th and 14th if they take a big risk it
8202260 but thats not our focus our focus is number one to make our car go fast
8202261 we shouldnt have to base our decisions on what other teams are doing
8202262 james has a three year contract i do not even want to talk about losing him
8202263 we learned a lot in michigan and going into california there is definitely a little bit of a difference in racetracks but for the most part the set up is close to the same i think we made a lot of headway the second day at michigan for what we needed at an oval track with marcos
8202264 my last start in the 21 was not the best with the early engine failure at michigan so im keen to get in the race in california and give the wood brothers the little debbie people and all the ford fans that love the 21 car a good showing
8202265 our focus is to qualify the car and i think for the most part it will be just cut and dry on friday as far as the balance of the car goes then saturday well go into it and make some good laps and make some long runs and see where marcos needs to be and adjust on it
8202266 its the same car that we had at pocono and michigan its not one of our newest version cars we dont have one of those done yet but its the next step down from that and its what weve got to race with now and its plenty good enough to make the race and run good with on sunday
8202267 at fontana you have a tendency of being loose in and tight in the middle and youre always searching to have enough grip off of the corners as long as we make the car consistent getting into the middle of the corner and free it up so it wont be loose off well be fine
8202268 its a horsepower track so definitely our motor program will show up there i like going there just for the fact of that but theres a lot of room and you can race there when it comes race time theres not going to be a lot of grip so there will be race cars sliding all around its going to make for a good race
8202269 es una gran oportunidad tanto para ella como para m ya que somos dos chavas que vamos empezando y tenemos la intenci n de entrar a la m sica para m es un gran honor estar con ella
8202270 a m me encanta la idea de que se d una nueva generaci n de la academia ojal que no sea la ltima como se est anunciando porque la verdad es una gran plataforma para los j venes que comparten el mismo sue o que nosotras
8202271 el show de los sue os sangre de mi sangre
8202272 its just a fun place to race its wide open racing and you can run from top to bottom i didnt run the nationwide series race at michigan so this will be my first race since the rule change that i get to run where we could see the horsepower difference at michigan both tony and joey ran well and toward the front so i still expect the z line designs toyota to be up there like we always are
8202273 that place is tough its really a hard race track to get hold of now especially when its hot and the sun is out there are two completely different types of racing when you run the top versus the bottom groove you can run from the top to the bottom but when you run the bottom you really feel like youre puttering around the race track you feel like you arent making up any time on the bottom but when you are running the top groove you feel like youre getting the job done the guys who run the bottom have a little bit more patience and handle it better than the guys who are on the gas on top
8202274 everybody hates the time change i use that to my advantage since i think im usually on west coast time anyway i still havent gotten east coast time down yet its fun for me its a cool atmosphere and the weather is great without the humidity if its hot out its nice and warm so the heat at fontana doesnt bother me as much as other places and if its cold its a crisp cold its still home and i love being out west and i really feel at home any time we race out there
8202275 we ran in the top five all day long but we really didnt think we had a winning car when we got the lead a few times throughout the race we just pulled away and led by quite a bit it was really cool to have a really dominant race car i remember having to drive the car really loose that was the loosest i think ive ever driven a race car that was still moving forward it was crazy because i came over the radio and told the guys i couldnt believe how loose i have to drive the car but it was fast
8202276 i feel that we didnt perform well at hull we repaired that in a way against arsenal and it was a big three points but really it is all about consistency
8202277 we face a cup tie now and it is no good getting carried away
8202278 ich habe deinen mund gek sst jokanaan ah ich habe ihn gek sst deinen mund es war ein bitterer geschmack auf deinen lippen hat es nach blut geschmeckt nein doch es schmeckte vielleicht nach liebe
8202279 this take a little bit of pressure off me because i know a little more about where my game is at i have to play more aggressively on hardcourt
8202280 fue un milagro el ltimo ni o sali del club h pico cinco minutos antes
8202281 que fund mi abuelo el mayor de caballer a v ctor manuel saucedo carrillo
8202282 pues cuando lo montas l se convierte en una extensi n de tu cuerpo
8202283 if theres wrong decisions made like that it takes our livelihood away which is an absolute catastrophe for us
8202284 now we are out of the cup its a joke
8202285 i was very disappointed to lose the fourth goal because of what happened before that
8202286 i took a towel and threw it on the floor and the referee puts me in the stand because of that
8202287 following the departure of nicky shorey we have been looking to supplement the left hand side of our squad the signing of chris armstrong has given the opportunity to do that
8202288 chris is an experienced player who has made more than 200 senior appearances and competed in the top flight

8202291 so many things were happening so fast i was just getting acclimated to cup racing and my association with dei the confidence level is definitely a lot higher right now
8202292 we have a great team chemistry and we all work well together
8202293 tony gibson crew chief has done an outstanding job in making this team competitive week in and week out i just want to go out there and run as hard as i can and make our brave soldiers proud of their car

8202295 this kid knows how to drive a racecar and he has a great future

8202299 you always want to win races but its even more important to us now
8202300 when you dont make the chase people tend to forget about you i refuse to let that happen to this team people are going to be seeing a lot of us up front in these last 14 races
8202301 its a fast track probably faster than most people think youre really flying when you enter turn one much like michigan it is really wide and it has a number of racing grooves so you can run low or high
8202302 ive always felt comfortable at california and this weekend should be no different
8202303 were bringing the car we call the workhorse weve used it a bunch this year and it usually runs well for us
8202304 we really want to finish strong the rest of this season and california would be a good place to start that run
8202305 the truth will set you free but first it will piss you off

8202308 the budweiser shootout is one of the most anticipated events on the racing calendar for both drivers and fans and we feel the new format will certainly retain the fast paced excitement and competitive spirit of the race
8202309 the shootout marks the start of a new nascar season and provides a benchmark for teams as they gear up for the annual daytona 500
8202310 i met j d gibbs first at one of the conference rooms at jgr we started talking and we had this little video that we showed j d about everything i had done before that he said i have to go get my dad and then joe gibbs came walking in and i thought wow thats joe gibbs right there hes a cool guy and hes just a normal guy and thats whats pretty neat about him i have no problem going up to him and seeking advice since he has so much experience with people from coaching football its a big family at jgr and thats what really attracted me to the organization and why im excited to be a part of jgr for years to come
8202311 i learned a lot about aero stuff at michigan i had been there before for an arca test but you really cant simulate what it feels like to be racing with 42 other cars and how much the air really affects the handling of your car i learned a lot at michigan about what to do and where to run the draft is really big at places like michigan and california you haul the mail and then you get right next to another car and its like hitting the brakes
8202312 i think id feel weird without the pressure because ive kind of gotten used to it and if i didnt have the pressure id think something would be wrong im 100 percent cool with it i go out there expecting to win i go out there expecting my team to expect to win i think thats what everyone is here for and that is what i want my team to be here for
8202313 a lot of the guys start so young now i started when i was five or six years old back then people didnt start racing until they were 16 im 18 and ive been racing for 12 years now i feel thats where its different but if you look at all sports theyre getting younger and younger i dont want to say that it probably wouldnt hurt but i feel im ready and i think when the team feels youre ready theyre not going to put you out there not ready because thats not helping me and its not helping the team and its just not the right thing to do ive got a lot of confidence in everyone at joe gibbs racing since there are so many good people who have won races and championships there but at least for the rest of this season im obviously focused on running well and winning races with my gamestop car here in the nationwide series
8202314 while argyria occurred more commonly before the development of antibiotics it is now a rare occurrence
8202315 the jimmie johnson foundation we have an annual golf tournament thats taking place tomorrow wednesday out here today tuesday is a special day for us we are heading out to the build site where we are building four homes with habitat for humanity through the jimmie johnson foundation
8202316 its an exciting day my wife and i are all dressed up and ready to have a good day today and then we have dinner tonight with some auction stuff thats going on a lot of people are participating and i want to thank them for that and that helmet will be auctioned off tonight and i will be wearing that on sunday afternoon
8202317 i dont see it being a problem for us all of the tracks are good for the 48 when i heard of the changes i understood with the weather and things like that how they would make the change so i dont see any big impact on myself i think that its going to be nice for the california fans to have a race a few months later so the climate is better and things like that and the atlanta race it will certainly be hotter and hopefully we wont have any weather
8202318 basically you win championships you take it for granted and you race every day and you think that youre invincible you cant be hurt and then we lost eric medlen in march of last year and it was a wake up call to all of us
8202319 of course now weve continued that car working with ford to build the new car that is now an
8202320 its really funny you know that you can win or lose and luck is a big part of this game but i believe in making your luck
8202321 last year ive got to be honest i was at a point after eric we fought to get back months later i crash and it was like i cant take any more and my kid is out there driving and my son in law and weve got a grandbaby and ford motor company came in and said we have the technicians
8202322 i really believe that john force racing not only me physically as a driver but my whole team the attitude is back to 100 percent
8202323 and it was at reading pennsylvania that we pulled it off and ill tell you there was a lot of luck involved a lot of praying we did our job and we delivered four cars in the race for the championship following indy and we delivered three cars into the shootout i needed three of the guys to not make it two of them didnt qualify the rest were in the cellar there were like six people involved that couldve passed us and we just made it it was like in just one weekend it all wound up i was living on the edge and i survived it so i think it was the weekend at reading is when i felt that john force racing that we had finally put this team back together all of em as a unit because we had been ripped apart i think were back on track to race
8202324 major huge in my whole career and we havent won the championship but in my career this is the most successful season of my career all the championships all the awards this is the most important
8202325 i believe in teamwork theres a thing called destiny but you make your own destiny you make your own fate when you have heart and you believe it just happens and were going for this championship four of us as a team all of the pain that weve had and what weve fought to do and the fact that we believed in ourselves because what we knew how to do was win and we were failing we pulled it back together in the last year and a half
8202326 there is we were talking about that a couple of weeks ago it was nice how it happened that we were all able to clinch in the countdown that we dont have to go into indy thinking about that were in it we can go there and do what we do to win that race and that be the only thing on our minds because after indy is over the whole new stress comes into play because now youre trying to win races but you also have got the championship in mind and every round is going to count so for indy maybe this is our one final hurrah before the countdown that we can have some fun and to win indy would be awesome
8202327 ive always said the greatest thing about my job is spending time with kids
8202328 talking with these kids puts into perspective certainly the challenges that these young children have to cope with this very serious illness and being around them and seeing how theyve matured at such a remarkably young age its just a real testament to the character that these kids have that battle this disease and certainly the hope for a cure and thats what makes this thing special for me it isnt about treating juvenile diabetes this is about curing it and there is no better feeling that you can have than to say one day that we can cure this disease and then to have a fan come up to me at the ropes of the pit in reading pennsylvania last race that was a 30 year survivor of type 1 diabetes that wanted to thank us for what we were doing it just reassures just how valuable this is and just how special it is to be a part of it
8202329 its a little bit of a difference starting out right away because nobody knows that the grip level of the track is like or what the layout is or what kind of handling requirements there are or what the gearing should be so at first its a little bit of an unknown for everybody but all the teams that are in the grand am series are very good at what they do and theyll figure it out very quickly
8202330 well i think we just have to unload and be pretty fast and hopefully be ahead of the game as far as everybody else on this track im never really worried about us making improvements to the car that we unload with kevin doran has a lot of experience and the team does a good job we always seem to make the car better but if you start with a better car right when you unload then youre going to end up with a better car than most people so if we can get a car thats one of the faster cars out on the race track like the car that we had a watkins glen or at some other tracks and we get some good pit stops a little bit of luck not running into anything and if i can get in the car and be somewhere around the top five then for sure weve got a good opportunity to win or get on the podium weve been super consistent for the last part of the season weve been very consistent which to me is good we had a bad day and finished seventh we were disappointed in finishing seventh i would have expected a podium to come sooner but weve got two more races left and you can only try hard and hopefully it works out
8202331 ive stepped up and weve gotten some professional level co drivers
8202332 we can move further up theres a bunch of good drivers they kind of refer to it as a street stock series and i suppose technically it is but these cars are all very well developed and theyre all very fast done a great job of keeping them all very equal but we can definitely move up with consistent finishes the mustangs one thing about them is that they arent always suitable to the tracks that we go to and often youll get another car in front of us in qualifying but these things run like locomotives and if you can keep them out of contact because were a little vulnerable to damage in our steering rack and our tie rod ends but if you can avoid that the engine the gearbox and the rear axle will get you to the finish line

8202338 if you had asked me a week and a half ago i wouldve said we had a slight chance of keeping up with the points leaders
8202339 but theyve pulled away and we have to face that fact and try and keep the drivers behind us in the points from catching us basically we just want to solidify our spot in the standings and go out there and qualify well and win the race thats our objective
8202340 last year i missed getting into the countdown and it was a big letdown for me
8202341 its a very cool feeling to know that were in and were in solidly and we dont have to worry about it
8202342 i had a long talk with crew chief mike green and he feels that there are some areas with the car where we can be more aggressive and it sounds like hes going to go that route and im excited about that
8202343 if i go out and do my job everything is going to fall into place im not looking for any luck and i certainly want to earn whatever position we end up in having a good race car at this point and time in the season is definitely a good thing for this fram team
8202344 its been a good season for us and im glad that were in a position to still make the chase and have a really good shot at it weve ran into some problems the last two weeks that set us back i was looking at sixth in points and being able to get there into the chase now were a little further behind im just excited to be in the position that were in i have a real legitimate shot at making the chase and a great shot at running well this weekend california is a good track for us and so is richmond im just looking forward to the challenge and seeing how it all works out
8202345 its really important to me that we finish on a strong note with this kodak dodge team we are still battling for that last spot in the chase and even though we have quite a bit of ground to make up were not giving up if we dont get that spot then our goal will be to finish 13th in points whatever the situation im here to win and so are the guys on this team last weekend the guys did a great job we didnt have a great car in practice but they hustled and really battled and we ended up finishing sixth i was really proud of them because that is a good day at bristol were going into california with momentum and the mentality that we are going to do whatever we can to get a solid finish just like we were able to do last weekend at bristol
8202346 we just have to come in there california with a positive mental attitude to start with and knowing how consistent weve been is a definite boost not worrying about the points or focusing on the chase this time around we know we can afford to try some things that we couldnt do if we were in a conservative mode like many of the teams will be in well try to get the car handling as well as we can and we may use the race to do some experimenting for the future but as the race nears the end we can afford to gamble if it comes down to it we can look at the fuel mileage angle the tire strategy or whatever it calls for during the final 100 miles we have nothing to lose and everything to gain
8202347 everyone says california and michigan are very similar racetracks but they do have their subtle differences im not sure if its the track temperature or difference in humidity but for some reason they race just a little bit different they also have similarities both are huge multi groove tracks where you can race pretty much anywhere you want the trick is to find which line the car takes to and adjust as the track and car change throughout the race
8202348 ive definitely had a lot of success at auto club speedway in the indycar series i have two wins there and have always finished well there in the indy cars the track in fontana is a very similar to michigan international speedway mis its like being at home a little bit since i was raised around mis although weve finished 22nd at michigan twice this year in the sprint cup car we have raced much better than that since both tracks are so similar i am expecting this to be a good weekend for myself and the penske truck rental team
8202349 i cant believe its already time to go back to fontana
8202350 were taking a new generation petty enterprises chassis to fontana this weekend and were excited about its potential chad mccumbee tested it for us at kentucky a couple of weeks ago and everyone left pleased with the way it handled california is a downforce and motor track this new car has less downforce than the other car so handling is even more important every team is trying something and this is one of our latest pieces to try to get the car to turn a little better without being so loose off the corners
8202351 its important for nascar to keep a large presence in southern california because we have been there for so long a lot of the new fans dont remember when we raced at ontario and riverside im one of the few that have raced at all three tracks including fontana ontario was a track way before its time it was a replica of indianapolis but it had a ton of fan friendly amenities that most of the tracks have today that was a cool place riverside used to be the first race on the schedule not daytona there is a lot of history for us in southern california
8202352 are rivalries good for our sport for any sport absolutely it draws a line in the sand youre either over here or over there in carl edwards and kyle busch you have the makings of a rivalry that could last for awhile both are young and on top of the sport this could be the best rivalry since earnhardt gordon out of the car they are two different people so they appeal to two totally different groups in the car they are aggressive and will probably get together a few more times on the track i hope this doesnt go away but if it does we are going to be treated to one heck of a championship fight this year at least

8202402 the discussions with iraqi leaders will be on bilateral relations and particularly trade and oil
8202403 the actual number was close to 400 million some even go so far as saying it exceeded 1 billion a huge figure considering that lebanons public debt amounts to around 30 billion
8202404 hundreds of other lebanese companies could suffer as a result of the war on iraq
8202405 the growth is very interesting and the potential is huge so we take the risk
8202406 lebanon and syria were iraqis most important trading partners hundreds of contracts had to be cancelled or postponed due to the current violence in lebanon
8202407 it is the nature of capital to favour markets in which a single clear comprehensive law is applied regarding investment and where a single authority is responsible for this law
8202408 therefore stability clear principles and rules that govern investment operations and modernizing laws to simplify regulations are considered the main means for providing a suitable investment climate
8202409 of course it is good to be back on the podium this was the fifth time already this year for robert following a strong qualifying session and race this gives us confidence going into the remaining races
8202410 its fair to say we predicted more drama from a track lined with concrete walls and had factored the appearance of at least one safety car period into our pre race calculations
8202411 i dont know whether thats down to us misinterpreting the level of risk involved in racing around this track or whether it was just a testament to the good driving standards of modern formula 1 drivers nonetheless we came away from valencia having made gains in both championships which was very encouraging
8202412 at 8am on saturday i received a phone call from the teams doctor aki hintsa telling me that lewis was in some difficulties hed woken up with a severe migraine and with his neck in spasm
8202413 as a precaution we readied pedro to take over but despite delaying his start to saturday practice lewis was able to continue with his full race programme his physical problems are unlikely to disturb his fitness programme and we expect him to make a full recovery for both the monza test and next weeks belgian gp
8202414 lewis felt a lot better on sunday but was still slightly sore and tender we are delighted he was able to sustain the performance of a full race in hot conditions we did not have the package to beat felipe massa but we feel we did a first rate job and secured a very useful haul of world championship points lewis extended his lead in the drivers championship and in the constructors we extended our lead over bmw sauber and closed down the gap to ferrari
8202415 most definitely the reality is that heikkis particularly strong when hes got the car in front in his sights when he homes in on another competitor then his natural competitive instincts really come alive heikkis much more adept at switching effortlessly between engine saving brake saving and tyre saving modes and knows exactly when to push so the situation he encountered at the start of the year when he was dealing with slightly more tyre degradation is no longer a concern

8202417 with the combination of football and motorsport we wanted to create a race weekend format that was truly unique
8202418 our key focus is on providing excellent entertainment for the fans we didnt just want to copy what every other motor racing championship had to offer our championship will attract many fans who are completely new to motorsport and we wanted to ensure we provide a unique entertainment package
8202419 that is also why we have also placed a considerable emphasis on off track activities to provide great entertainment for all the family

8202431 this was a horrifying experience that no woman should ever have to go through while we like to reassure women that incidents like this are relatively few and far between nonetheless a woman has been raped and the man responsible is still at large so women should be very careful when getting into taxis and make sure they are legitimate
8202432 our lads are on the ball for spotting rogue drivers and we are going to be even more vigilant now we are outraged that something like this can happen in stockport and the public and taxi drivers alike need to be vigilant before this cancer spreads
8202433 some people are doing it bogus cab driving to make money and theres sexual predators that do it and give taxi drivers a bad name they are opportunists it is absolutely disgusting you get a predator like this who is looking for women who are out on their own and vulnerable late at night
8202434 we are extremely concerned to hear of this serious incident we regularly carry out enforcement activities to ensure that only licensed drivers operate in stockport we would welcome any evidence from the public if they suspect that either a driver or vehicle is not licensed
8202435 we need to catch him and catch him quickly he will strike again it wont be a one off if he knows he can get away with it
8202436 he is a big guy he is very powerful and he is very direct you need direct players i think sometimes we were not direct enough last season
8202437 he needs to improve his fitness because he only arrived this week but we were short of centres because lee thomas is banned until september 4 and rudi keil and chris bell are still not fit

8202449 kaden was always in a lot of pain he used to vomit all the time and then get diarrhoea watching him try and force a bowel movement was like watching someone give birth kaden used to bang his head against the wall and i have since been told it was because he was in so much pain and could not express it kaden should have been referred to a bowel specialist i will never go back to stepping hill the treatment was disgusting
8202450 if the surgery is not successful he will have to have a stoma for the rest of his life but i am relieved kaden is now getting the right treatment

8202452 it was an integral part of the plans but we are not finished and will try to find a different way we are quite interested in the environment and want to make our contribution the issue is balancing the need for renewable energy with the need for having a nice green belt and we want to keep our neighbours happy we knew it wouldnt be plain sailing as it is controversial but we would argue the wind turbine would not have a big visual impact
8202453 we informed mr unwin that the wind turbine he hoped to erect fell outside the planning application site area and could not constitute part of the application if a planning application for a wind turbine is to be submitted the energy benefits arising from it must be balanced against national and local planning policies protecting the green belt

8202460 she has a very high level of skill and the challenge for her now is to raise her game
8202461 you need experience to cope with the pressure at the olympics and london will be charlottes second games shell be able to cope with the situation much better after another four years
8202462 i think charlotte will definitely get an individual medal in 2012 the colour is up to her
8202463 its taken cycling ten years of meticulous planning to achieve the success that it has
8202464 archery is a few years away from being in that position but charlotte is going to have a very big role in helping it get there
8202465 korea have set the standard that we have to follow
8202466 with my age and funding situation the decision might be taken for me and they might look to develop younger talent but if i have the ability and skill then i will go for it
8202467 viele kommunen und freien tr ger haben bereits in der j ngeren vergangenheit hervorragendes geleistet gerade bei dem ausbau von pl tzen f r kinder unter drei jahren ich w nsche mir dass die bisherigen vorreiter durch die zusch sse neue gestaltungsspielr ume bekommen f r die sicherung ihrer pl tze und f r p dagogische verbesserungen ihrer angebote und nat rlich profitieren vor allem die kinder wenn die rahmenbedingungen qualitativ besser ausgestaltet werden k nnen und damit eine professionell hochwertigere betreuung m glich wird
8202468 die verbesserung der bildungs und betreuungsangebote f r kinder im vorschulalter ist schon lange ein zentrales vorhaben der landesregierung ganz besonders gilt dies f r den ausbau des angebots f r kinder unter drei jahren das seit ende 2002 von damals 2 900 pl tzen in kindertagesst tten auf knapp 13 300 pl tze gestiegen ist
8202469 mit der jetzt erfolgten aufteilung von 1 5 millionen euro die die jugend mter erhalten um damit ausstattungsverbesserungen von bereits genehmigten pl tzen f r kinder unter drei jahren bei kommunalen und freien tr gern zu unterst tzen wird dieser vorsatz mit einem ersten schritt in die tat umgesetzt

8202471 many of our facilities as in many towns are old and in need of extensive refurbishment even with this type of improvement they will continue to fall below the modern expectation levels of customers
8202472 a vision document for the next five to 10 years has been produced and agreed between the trust and our partnering authority this vision will help to shape the nature of sport and leisure investment over the next five years the council has agreed to provide the trust with a three year funding arrangement to enable the company to plan beyond the end of the year
8202473 being in beijing id forgotten about my gcse results until someone else mentioned them id done all the work i could for them so i was more nervous being in the olympics its scary waiting to start but once you get into your routine you block everything else out and concentrate on what you know you can do because youve done it in training it was great being part of such a successful great britain team everyone kept coming back with medals and the atmosphere was fantastic i was very happy with my results and finishing ninth which is our best performance ever
8202474 watching her walk out into the olympic arena was the most amazing thing im proud of both that and her gcse results which were the icing on the cake for a very successful year the whole olympic experience was terrific for hannah and has left her hungry for 2012
8202475 he couldnt understand a word when he first arrived but has done really well he is also a very personable young man who had no problem making friends and settling in
8202476 i cant believe how much the sport has changed and improved in the last eight years
8202477 the talent in this team and in the riders coming up through the academy ranks is scary we believe we should medal in every event the whole world is watching us to see what we do
8202478 this is the end of a long journey for brad and me
8202479 we were chuffed when we won bronze in sydney and devastated when we won silver in athens
8202480 weve been through a lot but having someone like that to push you on and drive you on its hard to fail
8202481 hes a fantastic competitor and a inspiring influence on this team im very privileged to have spent the last eight years riding with him
8202482 i cant believe its taken eight years to actually win it
8202483 youve seen the progression in that time but there was an awful lot of disappointment in the early years when australia were a dominant force and try as we did we couldnt match them
8202484 ive ridden a lot of miles learned a lot and got used to quite a bit of failure but the last three or four years as weve built towards beijing have been the most enjoyable of my life
8202485 its hard to believe we could go as fast as we did we didnt expect to lower our record by seconds especially when weve worked so hard in recent months just to shave hundredths off our times
8202486 the problem we have is that the damage and decay have been a long time in the making but we only have a short period five months to bring things up to scratch
8202487 we know that there are other third parties manoeuvring to try and get hold of the training ground so the only thing we can do is get the work done
8202488 with our budgets committed we find ourselves looking to anybody who can help us because jim gannon and the players rely on their base at timperley for the kind of quality of work that has brought the recent success if we can improve things then we can be secure there for the next 25 years but if we dont we could have a real problem
8202489 this is vital and its a chance to show how the trust can positively contribute in times of need
8202490 we are organising a working party and weve recruited professionals but we need offers of help people materials and time
8202491 we cant have too many volunteers because its a huge task and were calling upon all county fans to get involved if they can whether by donation of time or money
8202492 we need to raise 75 000 as soon as possible to get this secured
8202493 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8202494 we had a huddle at the end and said that as a team it has been a long 12 months
8202495 we have come together as a squad and it has been a long journey
8202496 we came to the tournament with a mindset of wanting to finish in the top six and qualify for the champions trophy
8202497 to get in the top six of the world is a great achievement and we have come a long way from four years ago where we failed to qualify for athens
8202498 we have still got work to do but we have a long time to do it now
8202499 playing in champions trophy year after year means we can play against top opposition each year
8202500 the project is going ahead the first building which is six units should be completed by the end of the year

8202561 but you know what kind of disturbs me sometimes because a lot of people ask me about this ps3 360 question is that its not about the hardware i want people to look at the game itself sometimes i even feel like it should be on a pc so that people dont ask me about hardware and platforms
8202562 if were talking about the future not mgs4 but my future titles if were referring to that if the hardware technology rises then obviously you know it wont be based on the hardware anymore probably i will first create the software and then um its a strange word to say but port to other hardware if that technological ability rises in all areas

8202637 we recognise that many of our loyal customers are going through a difficult period of cost pressure and we have developed this new initiative to ensure they remain competitive at a much reduced cost than investing in new kilns
8202638 afos kilns are famous for their longevity with life spans well in excess of 25 years now we are offering to extend their working lives by providing cost effective upgrades so that the kilns have all the latest technology to increase efficiency and reduce energy costs
8202639 the company is celebrating 60 years of manufacturing high quality equipment for the fish and food industry around the world one of the factors behind our success is that we stay in tune with the demands of the market and we respond to the needs of our customers
8202640 we have experienced tremendous loyalty from our customers and as we celebrate our 60th year this seem an appropriate way of demonstrating our gratitude
8202641 the fact is that the system used in afos kilns pre dates 1950 and is therefore officially classed as a traditional method for smoking fish
8202642 afos kilns use natural smoke and have the advantage for the producer of being able to control temperature and humidity through using microprocessor technology our kilns continue to provide consistently high quality time after time and the upgrades make the kilns more energy and time efficient

8202650 i thought you should know that people are really unhappy
8202651 and its starting to make it so that people just complain all day instead of doing their work and thats not good
8202652 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8202653 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
8202654 nothing to improve the prospects of peace in the caucasus
8202655 i want to remind you that cold war was a completely different beast when we were really at each others throats in a big way internationally and this is not going to happen under any circumstances
8202656 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation
8202657 short of losing our dignity as a nation we couldnt act otherwise
8202658 but russian leaders are guilty too because they kept this conflict warm for many years and tried to use it as a political instrument

8202676 bioglass is used to help mend broken bones recently researchers working at imperial college discovered a new kind of bioglass which seemed to work better but they could not work out all the details why

8202678 we now report evidence that restoration of the functioning of the stress axis may be the key to how these new antidepressant approaches might work
8202679 these findings lend weight to the hope that crf1 antagonists might play a role in the treatment of antidepressant resistant symptoms of depression or posttraumatic stress disorder if so crf1 antagonists could fulfill an important unmet need
8202680 we do not need another prozac but we urgently need to find ways to help the large number of patients who fail to respond adequately to our available treatments

8202683 we dont know how to account for the resilience of some stressed people exposed to severe sustained stress or the vulnerability of some people to relatively mild stress
8202684 the better that we understand the underlying molecular mechanisms that link stress to illness the more likely we are to make progress in answering these important questions

8202689 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8202690 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8202691 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away

8202695 the biggest mistake luxury brands make is in not sticking with their core value system and core customer

8202872 were concerned the government has not been releasing this information publicly but the prime minister seems to be the main decision maker regardless
8202873 we cannot stop the development projects in these areas but we can only ask the government and companies to reduce the environmental impact

8202900 we also received a call from popular science magazine last week and theyve entered us in the contest whats new for 2008
8202901 the association of zoos and aquariums has deemed 2008 the year of the frog because of the declining frog population worldwide
8202902 with 10 million pools in the u s alone if even half of them have the same problems we had with frogs we might be able to save 10 million frogs a year and each frog eats about 3 000 bugs a month the impact could be huge
8202903 distributors wont pick it up until customers start asking for it
8202904 it looks like 2009 will be the year things will start moving
8202905 i just wanted the frogs out of my pool but this has a greater far reaching impact than i had imagined really its so simple it works
8202906 we have an additional 20 million in state borrowing guarantees we went from 50 million to 70 million
8202907 were already using 5 million of that for the tax exempt borrowing that leaves 15 million available
8202908 if we took 1 million out of the revolving credit line the amount eligible for state guarantee would be 14 million if we paid back the 1 million and then borrowed another 2 million we would have only 12 million left in the state guarantee
8202909 at some point really really soon those two are going to come crashing together and we wont have enough seats to meet the air travel needs of this market
8202910 if youve got a weather cancellation or mechanical cancellation there are no available seats in this market to rebook passengers so instead of being rebooked the same day it may be the next day or several days
8202911 we are going to work hard to try to tell that story as quickly as possible
8202912 this is a response to a slower traffic period and were giving ourselves some operational flexibility in the winter months
8202913 when you have 30 frequencies a day are you going to miss one or two come on

8202922 there is still a lot of uncertainty on the political front people just want to get out of the market

8202924 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8202925 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8202926 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8202927 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8202928 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away

8202933 we are condemning first the hijacking of a civilian aeroplane and we are now in continuous contact and consultation with the libyan authorities in kufra airport
8202934 it is not clear whether there is one or more or whether they belong to abdul wahid were not expecting him to say yes
8202935 the hijackers claim to have coordinated with him nur to join him in paris
8202936 we categorically deny the responsibility of our movement in this hijacking operation
8202937 is a true leader of a rebellion of the resistance in darfur who says that he does not know these people and that he absolutely refuses to use these methods
8202938 no one declared responsibility for the hijacking all the rebels until now denied the operation
8202939 all the canadian government did all they said was a brief visit by public safety minister stockwell day who briefly saw some authorities involved
8202940 he is very ambitious and knows exactly how many beans make four when it comes to banking

8202957 certain writers have a style that can be best likened to body odor irresistible to some obnoxious to many and apparently imperceptible to the writer himself therouxs lack of self awareness his failure to observe the basic hygiene of modesty is compelling in its way how can anyone be this narcissistic you wonder in disbelief in appalled fascination after reading the auto hagiography of the turkmen leader niyazov theroux summarizes it as pages and pages most of it self reverential he could be writing a press release for his own book

8202976 dr king did not embrace the type of secularist agenda promoted by obama and the democratic party of today which includes fostering dependency on welfare that breaks up families supporting same sex marriage and partial birth abortion and banning god from the public square
8202977 there are a lot of teams that succeed by spreading the goals around but if you havent got a 20 goal striker you need four players to be getting in double figures
8202978 akos buzsaky got that last year rowly can get a few goals and so can cookie and emmanuel ledesma but we want one of our strikers to end up with 20 goals this year thats the ideal scenario
8202979 theres no question that its the one area where we feel were a little bit light but it has to be the right one who pops up someone whos better than what weve got and thats not easy
8202980 clearly as we get to the end of the window some of the premier league clubs will be looking to loan out players and well see how that situation manifests itself
8202981 maybe if the right one becomes available well do something
8202982 kevins a very good player but theres a certain structure in terms of wages and because birmingham have the parachute payments they can fund a two year deal
8202983 our wage structures fairly sensible and thats the proper way to do it but a team like birmingham have got that guaranteed payment and they can take a punt on it it was probably a bit outside our remit
8202984 we wouldnt mind an opportunity to look at a young left back and if a good one comes up great

8202990 with the crowd behind us at loftus road we can sometimes not play so well and still get results
8202991 but away from home if you try and play nice attacking football without earning the right teams can be all over you we learned that at sheffield united
8202992 you need players who are going to do the horrible work so to speak and if we can get that balance right well be a successful team

8203020 we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft there was absolutely no communication from the flight crew and that added to peoples extreme fear we really didnt see them during the main situation at all they didnt say anything they werent visible
8203021 it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
8203022 i was scared i think everyone was scared ive got three kids and my wife on the flight and i just sat there helplessly thinking it might be the end
8203023 i would say the crew didnt know what to do they didnt inform us for about 20 minutes which i think was wrong a little information would have calmed everyone down
8203024 my wifes oxygen bag inflated and so did my sons mine stayed flat all around me people kept tugging and saying its not working properly
8203025 the first thing we do in these situations is take the safety first option we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew also deploy their oxygen masks they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
8203026 they usually inflate when passengers exhale its a trickle of pure oxygen you dont feel a rush of gas all its doing is enriching the low pressure air
8203027 the pilot is having to navigate having to communicate with air traffic control and having to avoid hitting other aeroplanes his priority is to keep the aeroplane safe
8203028 they satisfy every single safety level but it is the minimum
8203029 pull down on the mask to start the flow of oxygen
8203030 my highest priority was to get a mask on to my son
8203031 the pilot act will first to get the plane to a safe height and explain later

8203053 scholars generally agree that the first relativist was the ancient greek philosopher protagoras approximately 490 421 bc what is true and false is determined not by things outside of a person but simply by a persons own perspective plato 428 348 bc provided a devastating critique of protagoras idea that man is the measure of all things if everything is relative to mans perspective argued plato that must also apply to protagoras own idea that truth is relative if protagoras really thinks it is true that things are only true according to a persons perspective then that would mean protagoras idea is actually false because at least one truth protagoras idea would then not be relative

8203055 ive visited north korea in 1999 2004 2005 and then the last time in october 2007 so i can see the dynamic of this change
8203056 in 1999 even in pyongyang people were exhausted malnourished feeble in 2004 the situation was very different the whole city looked like one big market
8203057 there was activity everywhere on streets under the bridges from the windows of apartments
8203058 that heat wave was such a big historical event for the state of california
8203059 it really did give us a chance to evaluate the scope of what a heat wave of that magnitude means for health care resources hospital and e r staff and the population of the state
8203060 typically people in a cooler area arent used to heat
8203061 secondly in the bay area far fewer people have air conditioning
8203062 now we understand more clearly that kidneys tend to be more at risk from heat waves
8203063 these body systems really help regulate the bodys normal temperature and the body is working pretty hard already the heat wave is an additional challenge from the ambient heat from outdoors
8203064 im very much in favor of us preparing for climate change but i dont want to oversell the point
8203065 all you need is the word climate and excess morbidity and people jump to the conclusion that we are already seeing climate change this study doesnt do that
8203066 if we can understand more about illness hopefully we can prevent heat wave deaths which should be entirely preventable deaths
8203067 this our last warm up game before we travel to newcastle in the opening round of the guinness premiership we will decide on who starts at scrum half tomorrow but both wiggy and dwayne will play in the game there are places up for grabs for the opening game and the players know this

8203101 the yonaguni site is fairly near the shore so there was heavy surge the up and down motion of waves as well as swift currents and sharks
8203102 one the up side the area has the third clearest water in the world with visibility to 200 feet and the corals were gorgeous
8203103 the two sites are very different though both are at a comparable depth 60 to 100 feet beneath the oceans surface the yonaguni site might be ceremonial platforms and the okinawa site seems similar to a castle wall a conjecture that is supported by nearby castles on the island with a similar architectural style
8203104 the case for the sites being artificial or modified by man requires supporting evidence
8203105 we found very precise rectilinear stone features that seem to be indicative of either artificial tooling or modifying the natural geology
8203106 what we were able to observe was fascinating and warrants additional research
8203107 there is some false information on the sites out there we want to bring clarity to the situation and intend to mount a full scale scientific expedition to do further investigation
8203108 its basic geology and classic stratigraphy for sandstones which tend to break along planes and give you these very straight edges particularly in an area with lots of faults and tectonic activity

8203111 sorry dude dawkins hates christians and his whole point in evolution is scewered to that point get the point plus ive probably seen them how about explaining the coelacanth fish no one else will you really need to post text
8203112 im sorry i thought you new something of evolution in fact from that statement alone tells me youve never read darwins book diviation of the kinds or micro evolution works piss of bj with this but i dont care you have big dogs and little dogs their still dogs a pug cannot mate with a bull mastiff but there still dogs
8203113 for all there is no such thing as a simple celled organisim or for that mattter a simple cell i predict that now that we have soft dino tissue well soon find living single cell organisims from millions of years ago lol you guys are the ones that think we come from a rock
8203114 1 40 x 1070 different genetic codes to hit upon the universal genetic code found in nature yockey estimates the maximum time available for the code to originate as 6 3 x 1015 seconds put simply natural selection lacks adequate time to find the universal genetic code it would have to evaluate about 1054 codes per second 1 4 x 10 70 6 3 x 10 15 10 54

8203119 why do we see organisms that are perfectly suited to their ecological niche
8203120 if it does turn out that cairnsian mutations are common we will face the challenge of trying to estimate how much adaptive variation in natural populations derives from random mutations and how much from selectively driven mutations
8203121 we should be cautious about rejecting the notion of directed mutations simply because it makes us more comfortable to do so
8203122 mutations kill the host or atleast make em sick and do not get passed down to offspring so how did both male and female evolve

8203152 egs is critical to the clean electricity revolution we need to solve the climate crisis but egs hasnt received the attention it merits thats why were pressing for expanded support from government and increased investment from the private sector
8203153 were big believers in egs and were looking for more opportunities

8203182 kemenangan anwar dalam semalam dengan majoriti yang lebih besar membuktikan rakyat menolak pembohongan yang dibuat oleh pemimpin umno bn
8203183 walaupun selama hampir sebulan rakyat dihidangkan dengan pelbagai isu seperti tuduhan liwat sumpah laknat dan sebagainya tapi semua itu tidak memberikan sebarang kesan kepada para pengundi
8203184 bn akan terus menerima menerima nasib yang sama jika dalam masa terdekat ini diadakan pilihan raya kecil di mana manapun ini ditambah lagi dengan dengan pelbagai pembohongan yang pernah dibuat sebelum ini di seluruh negara rakyat sudah hilang kepercayaan kepada umno bn
8203185 umno bn kena melihat keadaan yang ada sekarang berdasarkan realiti dan bukannya membuat propaganda kosong dan pelbagai bentuk pembohongan yang dilakukan selama ini

8203199 sorry dude dawkins hates christians and his whole point in evolution is scewered to that point get the point plus ive probably seen them how about explaining the coelacanth fish no one else will you really need to post text
8203200 im sorry i thought you new something of evolution in fact from that statement alone tells me youve never read darwins book diviation of the kinds or micro evolution works piss of bj with this but i dont care you have big dogs and little dogs their still dogs a pug cannot mate with a bull mastiff but there still dogs
8203201 for all there is no such thing as a simple celled organisim or for that mattter a simple cell i predict that now that we have soft dino tissue well soon find living single cell organisims from millions of years ago lol you guys are the ones that think we come from a rock
8203202 1 40 x 1070 different genetic codes to hit upon the universal genetic code found in nature yockey estimates the maximum time available for the code to originate as 6 3 x 1015 seconds put simply natural selection lacks adequate time to find the universal genetic code it would have to evaluate about 1054 codes per second 1 4 x 10 70 6 3 x 10 15 10 54
8203203 the laotian rock rat laonastes aenigmamus described last year by the wildlife conservation society scientists in laos is certainly new to science and a genetically distinct species while also representing the lone survivor of an ancient family
8203204 however it may not be that rare on a recent visit to a hunters market in laos wcs conservationist peter clyne found the rats to be quite common photographing several specimens
8203205 no finale can be specified at the start none would ever occur a second time in the same way because any pathway proceeds through thousands of improbable stages
8203206 it seems that as the tape of life has been replayed in separate islands there has been a remarkable amount of convergent evolution
8203207 why do we see organisms that are perfectly suited to their ecological niche
8203208 if it does turn out that cairnsian mutations are common we will face the challenge of trying to estimate how much adaptive variation in natural populations derives from random mutations and how much from selectively driven mutations
8203209 we should be cautious about rejecting the notion of directed mutations simply because it makes us more comfortable to do so
8203210 mutations kill the host or atleast make em sick and do not get passed down to offspring so how did both male and female evolve
8203211 1 40 x 1070 different genetic codes to hit upon the universal genetic code found in nature yockey estimates the maximum time available for the code to originate as 6 3 x 1015 seconds put simply natural selection lacks adequate time to find the universal genetic code it would have to evaluate about 1054 codes per second 1 4 x 10 70 6 3 x 10 15 10 54
8203212 johnny what questions did i over look lets go back and see are you taliking about here 894 where you agree with my statements on the lovely little lizards
8203213 how does the discovery of a species that has never been observed before prove to be a problem to evolution
8203214 please no one here is lying or making stuff up like i told ak if you dont agree with the results rerun the test yourself shut up or put up there are other labs out there johnny you can use anything you want you just have to know the date of the event if you get a rock from a volcano that erupted 100 years ago thats fine you just need to know the date lets see how far you get dirty tricks bag put up or shut up
8203215 ahh thanx for agreeing on speciazation again or variations in the kinds lol
8203216 oh sorry i believe i made a prediction i didnt mention her
8203217 lets see millions and millions of years ago the earth cooled and it started to rain on the rocks and an ooze formed hunh rain on rocks an ooze formed i dont know where that thought came from bj
8203218 property values are rather higher than they should be and as we know there is an adjustment underway called the credit crunch which is having an effect on property values

8203220 the bbfc online is talking to apple about using its classification system but so far it has not signed up the online rating system however is not a legal requirement
8203221 the apple movie store is an aggregator site and these are a lot more complex to sort out classification for what apple seems to be doing is adding ratings to films that it knows the bbfc rating for and not the rest
8203222 apple uses its own rating system for all movies so if there are any missing they will be rated as soon as possible
8203223 the understanding is that the bbfc doesnt yet have all the studios on board and we only want to use one ratings system

8203234 atau yang bisa itu bedol desa atau relokasi pabrik itu boleh paling kurang list nya akan dikurangi sekarang ini ratusan kalau bisa dikurangi 50 tapi kita belum detail
8203235 istilahnya pak menteri kita jangan jadi tempat pembuangan mesin bekas itu bisa menjadi disinsentif bagi investasi serapan energinya boros mesin bekas kualitas produk tidak bisa bersaing walaupun dari segi harga murah

8203242 he was very close to returning but the great part about michael is that he takes his time to think about things and he is very thorough
8203243 you can get excited about coming back and running through the tunnel one more time
8203244 in the end he felt he could not get back to where he was
8203245 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8203246 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8203247 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8203248 we know the parameters of the contract and the giants would have been generous
8203249 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8203250 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8203251 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8203252 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8203253 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8203254 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8203255 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play

8203295 as pol ticas do minist rio da sa de de modo geral respondem necessidade da cidade mas a atual gest o n o enviou ao minist rio os projetos para que porto alegre pudesse receber recursos que outras cidades receberam perdemos recursos para o nosso hospital de pronto socorro mantemos uma baixa cobertura na equipe de sa de da fam lia e vamos aumentar isso como nossa meta
8203296 a sa de vive uma dificuldade muito grande na nossa cidade pela perda de recursos que deixaram de ser acessados no minist rio na medida em que o atual prefeito n o enviou os projetos e pela necessidade portanto de mais investimentos municipais e uma gest o mais qualificada o que eu quero dizer que a popula o merece um atendimento melhor e vou trabalhar para isso

8203308 wir setzen mit unserer kampagne in erster linie auf chancengleichheit f r alle jugendlichen deswegen fordern wir die gemeinsame schule f r alle 6 bis 15 j hrigen eine deutliche anhebung der lehrlingsentsch digung gleichen lohn f r gleiche arbeit kostenlose deutschkurse um integration auch leistbar zu machen und eine umverteilung von oben nach unten daf r muss auch eine wiedereinf hrung der verm genssteuer angedacht werden

8203310 die macht der bilder die kraft des wortes und die zugkraft j rg haiders
8203311 die macht der bilder die kraft des wortes und die zugkraft j rg haiders das sind die drei elemente auf die wir in dieser wahlkampagne setzen
8203312 ab 1 september werden die plakate in ganz sterreich zu sehen sein zu tausenden
8203313 wie schon bei der k rntner sommerkampagne 2007 habe ich mit astrid obert aus m nchen eine international angesehene fotografin engagiert
8203314 um die macht der bilder durch ausdrucksstarke fotos zu nutzen
8203315 ich habe die kraft des wortes gesucht und mit dem wort deinetwegen gefunden das in seiner bedeutung klangfarbe und sprachmelodie so stark und positiv ist dass es die macht der bilder und die zugkraft des spitzenkandidaten optimal erg nzt
8203316 damit werden die themenfelder des bz f r diesen wahlkampf abgesteckt n mlich soziales und teuerung sicherheit ausl nder und heimat und der politische bereich mit der aufforderung es anders und besser zu machen abgerundet wird das ganze mit einem grafischen stempel und der botschaft liste j rg haider das original
8203317 j rg haider steht im mittelpunkt der kampagne er ist es der deinetwegen sterreich noch einmal in den ring steigt um mitzuhelfen sterreich wieder nach vorne zu bringen und von rot und schwarz und befreien
8203318 wir haben angek ndigt einen positiven wahlkampf zu f hren der aufbruch hoffnung und zuversicht gibt und genau das tun wir auch mit dieser kampagne
8203319 dann k ndigte herr bachler an dass er zum ende seiner direktion selbst faust unter j rgen gosch herausbringen werde das hat mich sehr traurig gemacht auch weil ich mir gew nscht hatte das burgtheater mit einem so angemessenen stoff zu er ffnen
8203320 die situation von ihm ein solches projekt gewisserma en zu erben ist f r mich prek r deshalb bin ich nach berlin gefahren und habe ihn getroffen wie man das unter freunden macht haben wir einander in die augen geschaut und ich habe gefragt wie es ihm denn gehe und was er davon hielte wenn ich den faust mache es war eine sehr besondere kostbare und freundschaftliche situation in der er den stoff an mich freigegeben hat
8203321 ich kann ich mir nicht vorstellen dass herr bachler diese absicht hat er hat bestimmt andere sorgen als solche ehrgeizigen spielchen
8203322 ich werde mich nicht davon abhalten lassen einige st cke shakespeares nochmals zu machen es gibt da werke die kann man als theatermacher nicht aus seinem innersten begehren verbannen
8203323 seit jahren investieren wir in die bauliche infrastruktur und in pflege und bereuungsqualit t unserer pflegeheime wo wir den uns anvertrauten bewohnern einen vollwertigen ersatz f r ihr zuhause anbieten k nnen unsere heime sind aber auch orte der begegnungen wo menschen mit gro em herz au ergew hnlichen engagement und professioneller gesinnung arbeiten
8203324 nachdem ru land die unabh ngigkeit abchasiens und s dossetiens anerkannt hat spielt sich die eu unter federf hrung von ratspr sident nicolas sarkozy als gralsh terin der territorialen integrit t georgiens auf aber noch vor wenigen monaten als es um die unabh ngigkeit des kosovo ging spielte f r br ssel weder die territoriale unversehrtheit serbiens noch die uno resolution 1244 welche den kosovo zu einem bestandteil serbiens erkl rte eine rolle
8203325 denn im fall des kosovo wollten die usa serbien einen alten verb ndeten ru lands schw chen und im falle georgiens soll alles unternommen werden um dem georgischen pr sidenten saakaschwili einem sch tzling washingtons zu hilfe zu eilen dabei st rt das eu polit establishment nicht einmal da saakaschwili bei fernsehansprachen immer wieder vor der eu fahne auftritt ganz so als w re sein land mitglied der europ ischen union
8203326 es ist nicht im interesse europas da die eu die handlangerin der usa spielt und damit die beziehungen zu moskau vergiftet und genauso wenig ist es im interesse europas da der konflikt im kaukasus weiter eskaliert daher ist br ssel gut beraten auf beide seiten m igend einzuwirken
8203327 es ist schon erstaunlich wie der ehemalige pr sident des k rntner arb pleitevereines sp labg rudolf schober das finanz und konkursdesaster des arb f r den er jahrelang die verantwortung getragen hat nun anderen in die schuhe schieben will

8203367 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8203368 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8203369 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8203370 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8203371 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8203372 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8203373 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8203374 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8203375 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8203376 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8203377 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8203378 who are open to doing something on the production side
8203379 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8203380 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8203381 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8203382 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8203383 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8203384 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8203385 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8203386 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8203387 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8203388 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8203389 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8203390 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8203391 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8203392 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8203393 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8203394 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8203395 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8203396 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8203397 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

8203399 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8203400 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8203401 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8203402 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8203403 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8203404 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8203405 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8203406 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8203407 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8203408 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8203409 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8203410 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8203411 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8203412 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8203413 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8203414 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8203415 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8203416 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8203417 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8203418 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8203419 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8203420 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8203421 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8203422 these missiles are close to our borders and constitute a threat to us
8203423 this will create additional tension and we will have to respond to it in some way naturally using military means
8203424 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war but we dont want one and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
8203425 according to our information nato ships are in the black sea and their numbers are increasing
8203426 we are not planning to increase the number of our ships there but everything depends on regional stability menyailo said
8203427 we are controlling territorial waters and the adjacent area ensuring shipping safety and preventing the smuggling of arms and military vehicles
8203428 it is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement which russia recently agreed and to recent russian statements

8203465 there was no reason for her to fall it was a beautiful sunny day it was dry underfoot and ideal for a walk it is a walk 70 year olds and children can do and these girls were perfectly fit and healthy
8203466 there was nothing to explain it we considered everything could someone have pushed her but that would have been impossible there was no one out there we even considered if they had been attacked by a bear or a wolf but there was no trace of human or animal attack on the body there wasnt even an obvious insect bite that could have caused her to lose balance

8203472 and in lane 4 we have suns javafx used by web properties such as well its still in development
8203473 this isnt the type of market where only one technology is going to win
8203474 i think sun has the opportunity to catch up very quickly in that space
8203475 i would say that the javafx platform looks very good it has a lot of potential
8203476 it probably should have been announced three four five years ago
8203477 technically javafx enables me to leverage the java skill set and java technology that i am more comfortable with to deliver a compelling ria solution because synergy between javafx and java is excellent and the fact that javafx is built on the java platform means that i can ensure that i have one of the best and supportive platforms to work in in addition javafx will enable me to be more productive in making it easier and quicker to create ria solutions

8203479 russias de facto incorporation of parts of another state is brutal but it is also unambiguous
8203480 there will be no need for the eu to bother trying to reach an amicable solution or discussing the deployment of peacekeepers in the caucasus at its upcoming emergency summit this week after yesterday the subject is closed there is simply no point trying to negotiate with russia and it would be the wrong thing to do even if it there were the eu cannot discuss easing visa restrictions or economic cooperation when the other side is proving that it sees international agreements as mere scraps of paper
8203481 it is unclear how russian and the west will claw their way out of the worst crisis in relations since the collapse of the soviet union
8203482 the russian leadership has referred to the right of nations to self determination it is worth reminding them that the 1989 census in abkhazia revealed that living alongside armenians and russians 48 percent of the population were georgian and only 17 percent abkhaz by 2005 there were 45 percent abkhaz and just 6 5 percent georgians the reason for this development 200 000 of 250 000 georgians either fled during conflicts in the 1990s or were driven out in south ossetia only 29 percent of the population in 1991 were georgian they all fled after russias military strike on georgia so when the abkhaz and south ossetians announce independence based ostensibly on a law of nations russian recognition amounts to sanctioning an expulsion of people that violates the law of nations
8203483 anyone still wondering about the motives for russias war against georgia must have realized what is going on by now
8203484 moscow made its decision long ago protecting the ossetians against massacre was just an excuse to send its tanks into georgias breakaway regions russia is using military might to redraw the map in the caucasus the west is watching this sorry spectacle unfold this strategy of the fait accompli but europe and its allies are obligated to defend georgias integrity the eu must translate its words into action and take a hardliner stance against moscow
8203485 the russian presidents decision to recognize georgias breakaway regions is sheer provocation
8203486 im here tonight because i know the change we need requires a leader with a steely resolve a powerful vision for our future and a passion for helping working people
8203487 in the end it came down to whether or not my endorsement was for real or if it was just something that was said off the cuff it wasnt said off the cuff it is real i think obamas the better person for the job
8203488 the death was not witnessed basically the guy was drinking with some guys and went missing on them then he turns up in the creek
8203489 it appears more natural or exposure death rather than foul play
8203490 but maggots in the wounds is not necessarily a bad thing they are used as treatment in other parts of the world
8203491 that doesnt mean i dont think you created a series of misdemeanors

8203495 the trouble with too much control is too much control
8203496 i knew it was coming but i was hoping to be out before it came

8203513 for two hours our officers came under attack from bottles bricks and any debris that was on the ground

8203522 die argumentation mit fehlenden empfangsger ten ist absurd zum start des farbfernsehens gab es auch kaum entsprechende fernsehger te und in den 90er jahren sind viele sender ins digitale fernsehen eingestiegen obwohl es nur wenige digitalreceiver gab

8203526 it is totally unfair that many of the poorest households across somerset end up paying more for their energy and water bills because they do not have bank accounts and cannot pay by direct debit under labour it is the poor who suffer most

8203550 i have been involved with the show for years and i have never seen crowds like this before
8203551 i think today was perfect show weather warm but not too hot and slightly overcast meaning that more people than ever have come here rather than heading to the beach for their bank holiday
8203552 this years show really has had something for everyone and all of the visitors seem to be having a good time
8203553 hopefully this years excellent turnout will mean that even more visitors and exhibitors will want to come along next year

8203642 we thought it might be appropriate to paint just a birch tree but this birch tree exploded into a fabulous wall it is something amazing

8203646 the association of zoos and aquariums has deemed 2008 the year of the frog because of the declining frog population worldwide
8203647 with 10 million pools in the u s alone if even half of them have the same problems we had with frogs we might be able to save 10 million frogs a year and each frog eats about 3 000 bugs a month the impact could be huge
8203648 distributors wont pick it up until customers start asking for it
8203649 it looks like 2009 will be the year things will start moving
8203650 i just wanted the frogs out of my pool but this has a greater far reaching impact than i had imagined really its so simple it works

8203657 the most important thing to me is getting us ready as a group and getting ready for miami
8203658 i really look at the last preseason game as being able to evaluate individuals as opposed to the team and its really important from that perspective
8203659 he went in there and was really put behind the eight ball with that first drive
8203660 he somehow got a first down there drove them down the field and converted two fourth downs what im seeing more out of kellen is the patience in the pocket the ability to assess the defense knowing what to get to offensively the poise ive liked that

8203672 my parents and i talked about it and they said they would prefer for me to stay at home for now

8203674 once you turn pro it just adds all this pressure which isnt necessary right now
8203675 everybody ive talked to says that college is the best four years of your life
8203676 ive always played well in team events and it would be unbelievable to be around that atmosphere even if the level isnt that high i can always travel and play pro events during the summer
8203677 i think rather than worrying about turning pro right away you should appreciate being one of the top juniors in the country

8203722 now would be a good time however for families to review their evacuation plans
8203723 at the moment there seems to be a culture of letting anyone download anything onto a memory stick this simply isnt sensible there are things you can do to stop people being able to download anything from your it systems
8203724 policies and procedures should be put in place as well as technology controls that either stop people being able to download sensitive information onto these devices or ensure the data is encrypted if you start from this premise and then implement a policy of allowing people to download things to a memory stick or other removable media once they have demonstrated the data will be secured data security will be vastly improved
8203725 the key to lasting cultural change must lie in the role of the information commissioner and in particular the effective roll out expected by the end of this year of his new power to fine for deliberate or reckless serious breaches of data protection legislation he will also be acquiring the power to audit and inspect the data security arrangements of all data controllers public and private
8203726 this latest loss means that sensitive data on over half the uks population has been lost over the last 12 months youve got to take human error out of the loop and encrypt data automatically on disks or when its copied onto memory sticks or cds
8203727 despite this less than half of uk public and private companies have any data encryption deployed our november 2007 of uk public and private companies showed that only 48 per cent had any data encryption software in use and evidently things havent changed much since that time
8203728 this simple error could have been avoided if there was a security mandate in place to ensure best practices were in place and adhered to
8203729 similar controls aimed at personal data held by public bodies should be introduced and enforced especially if they were linked to immediate disclosure requirements like those originating in california in recent years this would bring about a dramatic reduction in the incidence of data loss
8203730 this latest data loss incident clearly highlights the challenge for businesses when sharing sensitive information with third parties whether that data is being transferred electronically by email or carried around on storage devices such as usb sticks
8203731 it seems that a number of businesses are still catching up with their security procedures in order to bring themselves in line with data protection legislation recent amendments to data loss law stating that anyone who intentionally or recklessly discloses information can face legal action makes this even more pressing for uk businesses this latest loss of information illustrates again that these issues need to be addressed sooner rather than later in order to avoid any further embarrassments and to protect those people whose details may be at risk had the data on the memory stick been encrypted its loss would have posed no risk as a result of insufficient security procedures this information could provide valuable information to those who may misuse it
8203732 whilst human error or malicious intent is always a possibility the only way to prevent data loss from removable devices is to take control of inbound and outbound data from all endpoints and encrypt all data during transmission
8203733 where extremely sensitive data is at stake the government needs to put in place procedures to ensure a comprehensive audit trail of all data is implemented regardless of whether data is being moved by internal or external staff it is imperative that device control policies are established that enforce assigned permissions to individuals and devices

8203762 the shortage of mortgage funding is creating similar problems for buy to let landlords as it is for other borrowers
8203763 however we expect the rental market to remain underpinned by strong demand partly because some people who would like to buy a home are being forced to carry on renting for now
8203764 sadly the impact of repossession can be even greater for tenants who despite paying rent on time can find themselves with very few rights and the first they even know about it is when the bailiffs start banging on the door

8203781 i would not rule out the possibility that at some point we may need to tap into short term lines of credit with the treasury for working capital not to cover our losses but just for short term liquidity purposes
8203782 more banks will come on the list as credit problems worsen
8203783 the results were pretty dismal and we dont see a return to the high earnings levels of previous years any time soon

8203794 kakek aku coba membaca sepertimu tapi aku tak bisa memahaminya dan walaupun ada sedikit yang aku pahami segera aku lupa begitu aku selesai membaca dan menutupnya jadi apa gunanya membaca al quran jika tak memahami artinya

8203812 aiba president ching kuo wu said beware the indian boxers are coming he met our boxers lauded their performance and said if we continue this way we will storm the world
8203813 i think it augurs well for indian boxing and we can look forward to having more of our boys qualifying for the 2012 olympics in london and certainly more medals
8203814 we have done a lot of hard work these boys put their heart and soul into preparing for these games and the results are there for everyone to see we may have won just one bronze medal but the overall impact of our performance would be far reaching

8203826 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8203827 the united states condemns the decision by the russian president to recognize as independent states the georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia
8203828 the territorial integrity and borders of georgia must be respected just as those of russia or any other country russias action only exacerbates tensions and complicates diplomatic negotiations
8203829 it will also not work it is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement which russia recently agreed it further inflames an already tense situation in the region
8203830 direct violation of numerous u n security council resolutions regarding georgias territorial integrity
8203831 it is internationally recognized that if a people based on all these u n provisions express their will to have an independent existence any other state in the world has the right to recognize this independence whether you like it or not
8203832 my appeal to the free world is to condemn and reject russias dangerous and irrational decision not only for georgias sake but for the sake of preserving the fundamental basis of international law and order
8203833 should be a matter of peaceful negotiations and discussions among the parties

8203854 having failed in its attempts to get our legal factual and fully supported ad off the air barack obamas campaign now wants to put our donors in prison for exercising their right to free speech
8203855 these over the top bullying tactics are reminiscent of the kind of censorship one would see in a stalinist dictatorship with the only difference being that those guys generally had to wait until they were in power to throw people who disagreed with them into jail
8203856 after covering the basic tenets of transhumanism i discuss what i take to be the most important philosophical element of the transhumanist picture its unique perspective on the nature and development of persons examining the enhancement issue through the vantage point of the metaphysical problem of personal identity shall thereby present a serious challenge to transhumanism indeed this is a pressing issue for any argument made for or against enhancement
8203857 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8203858 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8203859 i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander the promise of our country and the hopes of our people
8203860 and you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership no way no how no mccain
8203861 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days its awfully hard to tell them apart
8203862 we need all those who knocked on doors and made phone calls or me and got into arguments from time to time to work as hard for barack obama as you worked for me
8203863 china which has own separatists will be the biggest problem
8203864 the recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia is unacceptable for beijing
8203865 during the summit the leaders of different countries can enunciate shared positions on issues of interest to them including south ossetia
8203866 this slows down decision cycles constricts the passage of information in an age of email and blackberries and the sharing of lessons learned so we need to address this situation
8203867 training and structuring for high level combined arms warfighting provides a crucible for the growth of highly developed leadership skills and adaptation mechanisms
8203868 no other form of training hones these essential components of land forces for contemporary operations to such high levels
8203869 these skills provide the essential foundation for all types of operations that we may undertake

8203874 tell people that biology and the environment causes obesity and they are offered the one thing we have to avoid an excuse
8203875 as it is people who see more fat people around them may themselves be more likely to gain weight young people who think many of their friends binge drink are likely to do so themselves
8203876 peer pressure and social norms are powerful influences on behaviour and they are classic excuses we have to take away the excuses
8203877 vilifying the extremely fat doesnt make people change their behaviour
8203878 lots of warm words but with very little policy substance

8203928 did you know that we have the big issue here in japan too you did an exclusive interview with them before
8203929 i managed to regain myself though communicating with the customers
8203930 it is pretty obvious that the release of these documents would add to the pressure on gunns in their dealings with stakeholders and the public and i am disappointed that labor and the coalition have determined not to allow the public to see this document
8203931 under the freedom of information act section 23 the minister has the power to make a decision himself i think it is cowardice on behalf of the government to blame a departmental officer when the minister is clearly making a decision to prevent the public having this document in the public interest
8203932 ultimately it is the houses of parliament that determine what can and cannot be release and i will be asking the minister to release these documents
8203933 australias 1 2 million pensioners are doing it tough a weekly income of 273 is not enough to cover the increasing costs of groceries transport housing and dental and medical bills and the prime minister should immediately raise the single aged pension by 30 a week to give pensioners a bit of relief
8203934 pensioners cannot afford to wait months for another review to say what we already know the aged pension is not enough to provide a decent standard of living
8203935 the greens will continue to put the plight of pensioners on the governments agenda until action is taken
8203936 however we will be pressing treasurer swan for an additional across the board rise in pensions before or in the 2009 10 budget
8203937 the queensland government has agreed to the project however the one person with the power to stand up for the environment is minister garrett who is on record in 1992 as saying shoalwater bay is one of the last opportunities that we have in australia and probably on the planet to actually hold onto an entire coastal ecosystem
8203938 the question for minister garrett now is he has the power does he still have the passion
8203939 minister garrett cannot duck this one he has the power to halt the assessment approval process now
8203940 clearly this gargantuan project which locks in a massive carbon pollution contribution for the world is also against the federal governments climate change intentions and minister garrett has the power and must act
8203941 urgently inquire into the availability of water for the murray rivers lower lakes and coorong regions to save our storm boy country
8203942 today we moved from talk to action to save a national icon and help australians in need theres nothing australians cant achieve when all sides of politics work together
8203943 the multi party support indicates the scope of this environmental crisis it shows acceptance by all sides of politics that we have to act
8203944 there is an opportunity for water holders throughout the entire system to provide the water needed to address this crisis with compensation systems to be investigated to ensure their water needs are met in the future
8203945 now all the states must also get behind this initiative
8203946 now that the inquiry can get underway the focus will turn to how the senate can assist the government to locate purchase and transmit water to the coorong before christmas
8203947 finally we are starting to see the political will that is so desperately needed to save our storm boy country
8203948 prof pamela hannigan is here to study the city and explore the opportunity of bangalore as a location we feel the need for more professionalism in the real estate business here and a real estate school would help achieve this

8203956 with that two year degree students will learn how to work with networks how to respond to help desk calls and support and they also will learn computer technician skills like taking apart a computer analyzing whats wrong with it and fixing the problem
8203957 that gives students the technical skills needed to work in a desktop support environment
8203958 the contest is open to any homeowner to decorate their home and yard with hokie gear logos and colors in the wildest most outlandish craziest way possible this might include a maroon front yard lets go hokies in giant letters on the roof or even a colossal hokie bird painted on the driveway
8203959 were asking hokie fans to go all out and have fun with this but you cannot just put them up for a few hours and take them down the decorations have to be up for at least three days and they have to be witnessed by a neighbor or ex neighbor
8203960 were proud to sponsor this years crazy for the hokies contest this year
8203961 we see the most faithful of hokie fans come into our stores every day so we know there must be some homes across virginia that glow orange and maroon i cant wait to see the entries

8204024 we believe that heinekens first half results are not as bad as feared given a strong top line the outlook for 2008 is very cautious though but provides room to over deliver
8204025 these results are more or less in line with expectations although i think the outlook for volumes is somewhat disappointing
8204026 this is a good first half performance demonstrating our competitiveness against a background of weaker economies and increased input costs
8204027 we have maintained the momentum of our top line growth and again ensured that the heineken brand outperforms the market and increases its share of the international premium segment
8204028 this is a highly interesting market with a potential for nil equipment in the range of 100 million over the next five years
8204029 we are very well positioned to capture a significant part of that

8204063 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8204064 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8204065 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato

8204172 we would like to feature you in one of our vegetarian ads
8204173 our campaigns are known for featuring attention getting images and the muscularity you displayed in winning your victory would certainly attract attention and make it clear that a vegetarian diet can lead to a body built for olympian feats
8204174 your well honed physique could also help young and not so young men understand that when it is time for a real workout they should avoid meat if they want to achieve maximum performance
8204175 we havent received any response yet but people mostly agree to be a part of our campaigns and i am sure sushil will do the same
8204176 there will be a lot of body showing and that is primarily because we want to send across a message that one can have his kind of muscles even with vegetarian food

8204186 most of the deaths had occurred due to the collapsing of houses largely in the rural areas where houses are built with simply mud and mortar
8204187 even though there has been some respite in the rainfall over the past four days most of the major rivers are continuing to flow above the danger level
8204188 flooding of some 3 691 villages had occurred either due to the absence of embankments or on account of breaches in the existing embankments as many as 674 villages continued to be marooned in flood waters
8204189 but this is bound to go up over the next few days
8204190 we have developed a method that enables us to visualise fingerprints even after the print itself has been removed
8204191 we conducted a study into the way fingerprints can corrode metal surfaces the technique can enhance after firing a fingerprint that has been deposited on a small calibre metal cartridge case before it is fired
8204192 for the first time we can get prints from people who handled a cartridge before it was fired wiping it down washing it in hot soapy water makes no difference and the heat of the shot helps the process we use
8204193 the procedure works by applying an electric charge to a metal say a gun or bullet which has been coated in a fine conducting powder similar to that used in photocopiers
8204194 even if the fingerprint has been washed off it leaves a slight corrosion on the metal and this attracts the powder when the charge is applied so showing up a residual fingerprint
8204195 the technique works on everything from bullet casings to machine guns even if heat vaporises normal clues police will be able to prove who handled a particular gun

8204201 he spoke with the squad and told the players that their obligation was to give their all as the professionals that they are insisting that they have to fight and battle for this shirt
8204202 the olympic gold medal has meant a lot to him and will be very motivated but it is insignificant now because the most important thing is for atl tico to play well
8204203 i have heard nothing from wigan and i have told him he will get plenty of matches this season

8204206 gusto kong liwanagin na walang nalalaman si first gentleman dito the first gentleman has nothing to do with this this is strictly a conflict between gsis and meralco of which i am a member of the board

8204208 he witness said that a lightning struck and he saw the plane into flames before it crashed all of that will be subjected to scientific expert evaluation by our investigation team

8204210 hindi ko minamasama ang liderato ng milf ngunit hindi nila pwedeng sabihin na hindi nila tao yan dahil dapat sagot nila ang kanilang mga tao ngayon at dati hindi justification na hindi na nila miyembro yan i have nothing against milf but they cannot say that they have no jurisdiction over these persons because they have
8204211 admitting that residents of mindanao cannot expect justice to be served by the milf
8204212 if this is the kind of leadership that the milf wants to show us wherein it could not even control its erring commanders how can we expect them to run the bangsamoro juridical entity and the whole of mindanao if at all it is granted to them
8204213 what fears me most is that these irresponsible statements that the npa and milf are in connivance would put us on the edge because we are in a situation where we could not seem to ascertain the perpetrators
8204214 are we or is the government in search of new alibi to justify its mishandling of the mindanao crisis thats going out of control

8204227 i am proud to announce that by streamlining its management during the first half of 2008 the company has been able to maintain strong production growth as well as its competitive cost structure both of which has contributed a lot to our financial success
8204228 the first half of 2008 is a tough period for the company we met challenges from appreciation of rmb increase in labour cost and r amp d expenses rise in effective tax rate and decrease in average selling price of vga lens set and camera module which are part of the main product categories facing the changing of market the company responded flexibly during the period by making strategic investments in research and development to explore new applications for different industries and effectively increased the sales proportion of non mobile phone related business
8204229 facing the challenges in the second half of this year the company will further strengthen its competitive advantages
8204230 the company will seize opportunities brought forth by the rapid growth of the optoelectronic industry to become the leading integrated optical and optoelectronic products manufacturer in the world and the major optical and optical related products supplier to world renowned brands to generate fruitful return to our shareholders
8204231 we believe chinas domestic spending is relatively stable with weaker cyclical performance we remain cautiously optimistic that the group will benefit from the favorable macroeconomic environment despite the negative impact of the implementation of austerity measures
8204232 we will focus on expanding our business network to cities we has yet to set foot on we will also consider opening new stores in cities that we have entered and established a brand presence by enhancing our brand image in more affluent cities outside jiangsu province as well as improving operation standard and profitability we are dedicated to developing a nationwide chain store network maintaining a steady and healthy development and bringing positive returns to shareholders
8204233 me going to chelsea im staying as a rossoneri player i should help milan to win the trophies were up for the club have made some great signings and sheva will fit in without problem
8204234 i cant say if someone has promised me to abramovich it wasnt me
8204235 ive always said im happy at milan and as long as my aims remain the same as milans ill stay until now its always been that way
8204236 my goal is to win milans is too as long as we are like that ill remain at milan
8204237 my optimism about new signings gets less the nearer we get to the deadline
8204238 if we dont then we will have to soldier on with what we have but hopefully we will still get a couple in
8204239 if we dont get anyone in then well have to wait for our strikers to get fit but we have six strikers out at the moment and mark viduka obafemi martins and damien duff are all going to be out for three or four weeks were stuck between a rock and a hard place at the moment
8204240 james has a three year contract with us at the moment
8204241 i dont even want to talk about losing james milner
8204242 hes a very important player for us and i think hes worthy of a call up to the senior england side hes been too long in the under 21s once youve played 30 odd games for the under 21s you deserve a crack at the big time
8204243 now barack obama and i have an honest disagreement on the issue of abortion but the fact that im speaking here tonight is testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people that may disagree with him
8204244 it was a wonderful speech she hit a homerun she has convinced her supporters to back barack obama
8204245 riordan managed to get into the club at about 11pm but one of the bar staff saw him and knew he was banned
8204246 our door stewards approached him to ask him to leave and got a mouthful of abuse it went on for a few minutes but he left before he had to be ejected
8204247 thats a slight on my character what does he mean by that
8204248 when i get into trouble i dont get away with it i take my punishment like a man i have just told the truth and had a go at character

8204258 you will have to pay this bill at any cost
8204259 traditionally fuel bills have not always been at the top of the agenda for smes and owners with little time on their hands have been happy to assume that prices are comparable across the board
8204260 increasingly however small businesses are being forced to reassess their attitude to fuel costs a sandwich bar with several refrigerators used to paying an annual 1 800 for electricity will have to sell a lot more sandwiches to meet this years electricity bill of 3 600
8204261 by understanding their contracts and benefiting from the support available from alternative suppliers and industry bodies businesses can reduce the financial impact of high energy bills
8204262 sadly our survey shows we still have a long way to go to convince businesses that there is a cheaper way but with wholesale prices soaring the case for switching to a supplier like e4b is stronger than ever

8204265 he has little regard for the well being of his neighbors or anyone else in the greater community
8204266 this is serious he will do whatever he wants to do
8204267 i cant believe he could do this and get arrested and be out the next day
8204268 if kens kids had been outside mr hunker would have killed them
8204269 he drove right by and i said there he goes
8204270 i asked if he had been drinking and he stated yes he drank a pint of vodka
8204271 hunker could not perform field sobriety tests safely at the scene and was placed under arrest for dui
8204272 his continued driving and a lack of any kind of apology suggests a frank disregard for the safety and consideration of everyone around him
8204273 the mind is a labyrinth sometimes its just one of those very dull labyrinths where the rat runs around one way and he gets an electric shock and the other way he gets a grain of corn and then there are other days when its a labyrinth that consists of a straight line i have all the time the sense that there are perilous random seas that surround all our discourses we really are on little rafts and maybe we make it to the fuji islands and maybe we dont but in trying to bring back something of the quality of the journey we have got to talk about more than the raft if there is not in the tale something of the quality of the random seas as well then you have essentially falsified it you have in the phrase of an old friend of mine snipped off all the necktie ends to make it look as though the suitcase closed neatly and something im more interested in now as im perhaps older or more confident or less reticent or something like that is getting a sense of that into my work
8204274 there are two kinds of temporal tensions in this film in the first part the stutter creates a future past tension the incomplete phrases gives us a sense of what is to come the repetition brings us backwards then carries us forward stops and returns time does not evolve in a linear way we are continually moved from future to past and back again with no true sense of a present in the second past of the film the sound image disjunction brings about the temporal problem because of our retarded awareness of the disjunction we are never quite sure whether we are listening to something that has already been spoken in the image or to something about to be spoken we are simultaneously either listening in the present and seeing the past or listening to the past and seeing the present
8204275 as a work of art i think critical mass is quite universal and deals with all quarrels those between men and women or men and men or women and women or children or war it is war it is one of the most delicate and clear statements human relationships and the difficulties of them that i have ever seen it is very funny and rather obviously so it is a magic film in that you can enjoy it with greater appreciation each time you look at it most aesthetic experiences are not enjoyable on the surface you have to look at them a number of times before you are able to fully enjoy them but this one stands up at once and again and again and is amazingly clear
8204276 if you mean do i think i communicated to those in the audience who tramped indignantly out of my films the answer is no but i think there is a problem with your idea of communication
8204277 cinema is a greek word that means movie the illusion of movement is certainly an accustomed adjunct of the film image but that illusion rests upon the assumption that the rate of change between successive frames may vary only within rather narrow limits there is nothing in the structural logic of the filmstrip that can justify such an assumption therefore we reject it from now on we will call our art simply film
8204278 if i didnt have that feeling i would be better off retiring
8204279 in every game i want to beat the player i am directly up against i dont want to lose my personal battle in training i want to show the manager that im worthy of my place in the team
8204280 i have had great success at celtic but i want to have more every day i want to repay the manager and chief executive here for the belief they have shown in me
8204281 they wanted me at celtic and thats why im here i want to do my best for them
8204282 we have managed to win the league three times in three years and that is my target again i would also like to become faster but i dont think thats going to happen at my age
8204283 we all have to be captains out on the pitch even if we dont have the armband i think you need to be a leader
8204284 im not the most vocal of players but hopefully i can do small things to help the team if i try to control the game at times and help with the team work then maybe that will set off a chain reaction and make the side play better
8204285 ive got a lot of experience in the uefa champions league now but its not for me to decide whether im better now than i was three years ago
8204286 people who have watched me over the years can make a judgment on whether im a better player now its not for me to say
8204287 in the past i said i wanted to play milan and it happened
8204288 these results point towards a continued confidence from candidates on remuneration levels
8204289 we would however advise candidates in markets more vulnerable to a downturn to be mindful of market conditions and not to get carried away they must take care not to price themselves out of the market through unreasonably high expectations

8204294 we look forward to working with them as we continue to grow the market presence of insurance co uk
8204295 its clear that the worldwide economic issues affecting businesses are having an impact on where and how advertisers spend their money
8204296 it is also significant that the us and the uk as the highest spenders on advertising in their regions are showing reductions in our forecasts but overall the picture is still one of growth
8204297 similarly while tvs share of spend has stabilised internet advertising is continuing to drive spending ahead of other sectors in nearly every region
8204298 internet is set to overtake radio this year to become the worlds third most popular medium behind tv and print
8204299 this is why we are predicting further strong growth for the internet even when advertisers are cautious in many of the other sectors
8204300 advertising trends have continued to deteriorate over the course of the year and future performance will inevitably be linked to the economies of the uk and to a lesser extent that of the republic of ireland
8204301 in response to the current challenging circumstances we continue to actively manage our cost base to achieve productivity gains and in a manner which will protect the long term prospects of the group we expect to deliver a result reflective of these initiatives and the difficult market conditions

8204307 the current economic climate presents a challenge to all media companies throughout the world it also presents opportunities not least the potential for joint ventures shared investments mergers and divestments which may change perceptions of the structure and nature of media
8204308 while it is difficult to forecast advertising revenues reliably for the second half as we have only experienced the two traditionally quiet summer months trading in the next three months leading up to christmas will be critical in determining the full year result
8204309 however as second half comparators are easier and assuming a continuation of the first half advertising trends inm believes that it will achieve profits in line with consensus forecasts for the full year

8204328 in the broad sense the earths climate is determined by solar radiation
8204329 there is now little doubt that solar wind variability streams of ionized gases that radiate out from the sun is the primary cause of climate change on a decadal time scale
8204330 we are not concerned about hundreds of thousands of years or millennia we are concerned about decades in the study because we are interested in what fits the human life span
8204331 it looks as if solar activity not solar radiation itself determines what happens with the climate
8204332 by disregarding or ignoring the very much larger changes of solar ultraviolet or of the solar wind and its magnetic field effect on cosmic rays and thus on cloud coverage the ipcc has managed to trivialize the climate effects of solar variability
8204333 anything that falls beyond the purview of anthropogenic human caused global warming is not going to be seriously investigated by the ipcc
8204334 thats why the ipcc should never be viewed as a scientific manual it was created for the sole purpose of supporting the notion of human induced climate change
8204335 although the rarity of the current episode of high average sunspot numbers may indicate that the sun has contributed to the unusual climate change during the twentieth century we point out that solar variability is unlikely to have been the dominant cause of the strong warming during the past three decades

8204405 i expect progress by the end of this year and solution in the beginning of 2009 if a solution is to be found it will be found in a short time
8204406 we have talked about all issues including administrative issues judicial issues property security execution legislation
8204407 however what we have done so far is to put forward our positions
8204408 give and take and detailed discussions will take place during negotiations
8204409 there is agreement over the fact that there will be two parliaments but there is difference over how parliamentary elections will take place there is agreement over the fact that there will be political equality but there is no complete agreement over how this will be implemented
8204410 during the annan plan negotiations guarantees and security was the only issue on which there was an agreement the greek cypriot side did not even bring up this issue
8204411 after the failure of the plan however they tried to present this issue as the number one problem former greek cypriot president papadopoulos presented this issue as a serious obstacle because he knew that it is very difficult to change the guarantee agreements therefore this is quite an artificial problem
8204412 there is no agreement over this issue but christofias has announced that he accepts rotating presidency in principle the sides have put forward their positions regarding the duration
8204413 it is a 45 year old problem and it closely concerns every individual it is a difficult complex and an expensive problem
8204414 they will become proposals on the negotiations table the positions may also change on the negotiations table
8204415 the map will only be discussed provided there is progress towards an agreement
8204416 because discussing the map would create difficulties in our daily lives it would affect the economic activities
8204417 many children are happy making some money from selling the animals to the markets but they keep some for their family
8204418 not only are our poor eating it but there is also demand from vietnamese living on the border with us
8204419 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8204420 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8204421 when barack obama is in the white house hell revitalize our economy defend the working people of america and meet the global challenges of our time
8204422 but we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8204423 john mccain says the economy is fundamentally sound john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security and in 2008 he still thinks its okay when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
8204424 with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8204425 millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8204426 at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right and the status quo just wont cut it
8204427 we simply cant drill our way to energy independence even if you drilled in all of john mccains backyards including the ones he cant even remember
8204428 coding in c is like sending a 3 year old to do groceries you gotta
8204429 a lot of people still feel general motors owes us more than just a couple hundred jobs
8204430 i understand what people feel i still sometimes have those feelings but as competitive as the market is and the trouble general motors is having we have to help them with whatever we can do to keep them competitive
8204431 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8204432 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8204433 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8204434 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8204435 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8204436 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8204437 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8204438 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8204439 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8204440 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8204441 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8204442 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8204443 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8204444 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8204445 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8204446 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8204447 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8204448 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8204449 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8204450 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8204451 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8204452 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8204453 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8204454 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8204455 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did

8204457 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8204458 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8204459 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8204460 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community

8204472 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8204473 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8204474 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8204475 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8204476 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8204477 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8204478 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8204479 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8204480 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8204481 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8204482 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8204483 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8204484 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8204485 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8204486 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8204487 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8204488 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8204489 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8204490 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8204491 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8204492 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8204493 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8204494 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8204495 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8204496 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8204497 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8204498 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8204499 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8204500 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8204501 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8204502 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8204503 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8204504 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8204505 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8204506 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8204507 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8204508 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8204509 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8204510 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8204511 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8204512 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

8204518 assente dal 23 07 al 6 08 perch parto per lirlanda mi mancherete
8204519 ho imparato che non ha importanza quanto e come si ama tutti noi uomini e donne viviamo le nostre vite da soli non ha senso volersi appropriare di qualcuno e nonostante lo sappia a volte me ne dimentico ancora purtroppo non posso fare a meno di pensarci e mi sento cos sola e triste
8204520 ancora oggi continuo a pensare che ognuno sia artefice del proprio destino adesso per riconosco che non tutte le persone sono abbastanza forti da plasmare la propria vita e provo pi indulgenza nei loro confronti di quanta non ne avessi allepoca
8204521 il fatto che perdere ci che ho mi spaventi la prova di quanto sia fortunata ad averlo
8204522 lamore non bello se non litigarello dice la gente eppure secondo me i litigi non sono altro che lo scontro di ego e non credo affatto che quando si confessa allaltra persona il proprio disagio durante un litigio questo favorisca la comprensione reciproca forse vero che non possibile vivere senza subire qualche ferita ma finora ho sempre creduto che fosse doveroso compiere uno sforzo per non infiggerne agli altri sono stata proprio uningenua
8204523 sai nana a volte mi chiedo perch cenerentola abbia perso mentre fuggiva dal castello la scarpetta di cristallo nonostante fosse esattamente della sua misura secondo me lha fatto apposta per attirare lattenzione del principe
8204524 lead a determined attack on need by strengthening and expanding the role of faith based and community organizations fbcos in providing social services
8204525 the paramount goal is compassionate results and private and charitable groups including religious ones should have the fullest opportunity permitted by law to compete on a level playing field
8204526 the government gives them the drugs builds bigger prisons passes a three strike law and then wants us to sing god bless america no no no god damn america thats in the bible for killing innocent people god damn america for treating our citizens as less than human god damn america for as long as she acts like she is god and she is supreme
8204527 we must be honest enough to expose white entitlement and supremacy wherever it raises its head
8204528 when hillary was crying and people said it was put on i really dont believe it was put on
8204529 i really believe she just always thought this is mine
8204530 every house of worship that wants to run an effective program and thats willing to abide by our constitution from the largest mega churches and synagogues to the smallest store front churches and mosques can and will have access to the information and support they need to run that program
8204531 the challenges we face today from saving our planet to ending poverty are simply too big for government to solve alone
8204532 one of the key activities of these offices is to provide training and resources to faith based organizations to ensure that they are adhering to church state guidelines under the constitution
8204533 its not a partisan strategy it is an effective governing strategy
8204534 make no mistake as someone who used to teach constitutional law i believe deeply in the separation of church and state but i dont believe this partnership will endanger that idea

8204612 historically marketing budgets are among the first to be cut in a budget crunch but marketers should be cautious about trying to find a quick fix
8204613 in fact spending more during tough times when competitors may be scaling back is a good way to strategically boost market share because this often helps brands come out ahead when the economy rebounds
8204614 effective marketing spending during economic downturns is not about how much you spend but how you spend it
8204615 marketers must assess how consumers and customer behavior can be positively influenced during tough times if it can then marketers should give increased consideration to more spending rather than cutting
8204616 no mi dispiace io nel lavoro sono una persona molto professionale e metto tutta me stessa ma non potrei vendere ad un cliente un prodotto che io non comprerei neanche se da esso dipendesse la mia vita

8204644 the goal of the share the good campaign is to increase trials among consumers and the hit list encourages them to get together and drink
8204645 were talking to brands in the entertainment and movie industry
8204646 one thing people want to do is to create an event around a new movie or campaign i think hit list is perfect for that
8204647 we have done this before but it was more promotional our goal is to create a
8204648 we want to eliminate the guesswork by placing nutrition information up front
8204649 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe

8204653 yes but he may need to work on energy and taxes two economic issues that have been the target of several recent mccain ads obama has a comfortable eight point edge on economic issues overall 51 to 43 percent
8204654 but the mccain ads may have come with a cost half the public thinks mccain has attacked his opponent unfairly while only a third feel that way about obama
8204655 neither candidate scores well on that measure and the conventions are the first and best chance to present clear solutions to current problems
8204656 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8204657 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8204658 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

8204660 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8204661 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8204662 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8204663 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8204664 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8204665 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8204666 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8204667 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8204668 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8204669 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8204670 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8204671 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8204672 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8204673 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8204674 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8204675 we fully expect that both the number of suspected and confirmed cases will increase as this investigation continues and samples continue to be tested
8204676 we have an unwavering commitment to keeping your food safe with standards well beyond regulatory requirements but this week our best efforts failed and we are deeply sorry
8204677 on behalf of the 23 000 people of maple leaf foods who live a culture of food safety
8204678 deep and sincere sympathy to those who are ill or who have lost loved ones
8204679 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8204680 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8204681 the data show that early treatment can result in a slowing of clinical progression these data are also consistent with an earlier trial with rasagiline which showed a similar outcome
8204682 this may offer real benefit to patients who are treated promptly after diagnosis
8204683 there is a feeling among doctors that you should not put somebody on a drug until you really really have to but this work suggests that giving drugs at an early stage has an effect over and above what you would expect
8204684 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8204685 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8204686 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8204687 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8204688 the eye was reflecting a light but it wasnt just reflecting in one picture but in a few of them
8204689 i sent her an e mail just saying it was important she have it checked
8204690 if madeleine hadnt noticed this we might have waited before taking her to the doctor
8204691 i feel blessed ive been able to do something like that
8204692 its quite quite profound when you think about if it hadnt been found and the implications of that its quite humbling really
8204693 other than an online messageboard she doesnt know me from anyone and i have to say she saved my daughters life
8204694 shes selfless and wonderful she really thought hard about sending that email and im so glad she did
8204695 i wish i could meet her and give her a hug as shes the reason we are going to have our baby for her second birthday
8204696 there is no offer for villa and if one arrives we hope it will be as soon as possible although we hope one never comes
8204697 it would be very difficult to see villa leave valencia
8204698 a good offer but i cannot assure that we would say yes to it
8204699 valencia have not had any offer for villa anything that arrives will be studied
8204700 we will be reviewing his contract so that he is happier to continue with us
8204701 we have to meet with his agent but i dont know when
8204702 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8204703 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8204704 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8204705 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8204706 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8204707 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8204708 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8204709 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8204710 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8204711 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8204712 it was a tough decision but we just thought that with cassio and diego theyve already been there and know what to expect and cristiano has got a fair bit of experience
8204713 we have also got cover if we have to on that side the right but it wasnt an easy decision because i would have liked to have all of them in there
8204714 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8204715 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8204716 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8204717 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8204718 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8204719 me going to chelsea im staying as a rossoneri player
8204720 i should help milan to win the trophies were up for this season the club have made some great signings and sheva will fit in without any problems
8204721 i cant say if ive been included in the shevchenko deal because if someone has promised me to chelsea owner roman abramovich it wasnt me
8204722 ive always said im happy at milan and as long as my aims remain the same as milans ill stay here until now its always been that way
8204723 my goal is to win milans is too as long as we are like that ill remain at milan
8204724 physically the body works differently when upright you can challenge different muscles and allow full expansion of the lungs
8204725 psychologically it lets people live at the upright level and make eye contact
8204726 there are a number of devices about which stabilise the trunk and can help with gait
8204727 often they are very bulky and are only used for rehabilitation in specialist centres
8204728 sitting down in a wheelchair can be an issue for some people devices like this one might be appealing however it might not be any better than a wheelchair in terms of convenience
8204729 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8204730 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8204731 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8204732 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8204733 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8204734 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8204735 this latest research confirms we have a serious problem of self harm in the uk particularly among women
8204736 although we have made excellent progress in improving support services we still have a long way to go
8204737 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8204738 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8204739 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8204740 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8204741 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8204742 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8204743 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8204744 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8204745 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8204746 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8204747 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8204748 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8204749 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8204750 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8204751 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8204752 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8204753 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8204754 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8204755 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8204756 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8204757 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8204758 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8204759 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8204760 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8204761 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8204762 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location

8204766 in spite of the all pervasive language used in defining gross revenue in a telecom licence this tribunal has held that the concept of adjusted gross revenue will apply and income from activities of a licensee which are not part of the licensed activities cannot be included in gross income for purposes of calculating licence fee
8204767 we have received a query from the i amp b ministry and are in the process of replying to it we hold the norms set by i amp b ministry in the highest regard we have not violated any instructions of the ministry and would like to clarify that it was not a live uplink but a pre recorded show
8204768 with digital riding high in many markets across india measuring and reporting that data at a national level to the industry was the immediate task at hand after careful study and quality check processes starting this week we will now start delivering the digital viewing data along with the regular weekly data the last two years of measuring and studying digital tv viewing has been an interesting learning curve ever since we deployed tvms digital peoplemeter in tam elite panel and started generating digital tv viewing data from january 2007 onwards some very interesting viewing differences started emerging
8204769 mumbai with 50 per cent has the highest digital penetration the digital viewer also watches more channels and spends 20 per cent more time 186 minutes per day than the analogue counterpart digitalisation is also leading to greater fragmentation as 80 per cent tv viewing is coming from 10 per cent more channels
8204770 the individual or bouquet of pay channels pricing was not received well by audiences the value added services such as video on demand and interactivity werent used frequently due to lack of education the quickness in service is also a crying need
8204771 we are seeing a trend where in rural india terrestrial homes are moving on to dth in urban areas cable has given away to dth
8204772 four states account for 52 per cent of the dth homes in maharshtra dth and digital cable have grown but in gujarat cable is taken over by dth another trend is that while many cable stb homes had moved to dth the reverse has not been true
8204773 digital measurement will enable us to monetise better it will expand the business for broadcasters and they will be in a position to pay more for content
8204774 there are lessons to be learnt from abroad the players here have to be clear about which channels are going to be free and which pay
8204775 there are 5000 headends in the country and the digital revolution has just begun

8204853 this is a striking description of the relation between the church and the world at the present time the church which has received the pearls of the gospel throws them with pious indifference as food to the swine who are the human beings and this includes ourselves good christians embedded in the clay of this world which is so exclusively materialistic submerged by economic and political problems by their personal fears and their financial worries by their anxieties and their daily troubles absolutely dominated by the spirit of the present age and these people turn against the church saying we find no nourishment in your pearls no satisfaction in their beauty what are we to do with them they are no good to us in our present situation and this is true and they attack the church which has only given them fair words and illusions they want to tear it down
8204854 religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature the heart of a heartless world and the soul of soulless conditions it is the opium of the people the abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness to call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions the criticism of religion is therefore in embryo the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo
8204855 these people are wrong for the word of god is always valid and if they do not get anything from it today it is because they are in a false position it is not the word that that needs to be changed and to bring them something it is their own position that needs to be changed but they are right in their feeling about the church because it is the church that ought to initiate this changed situation in order that the word of god may be heard in human life as a whole and the church has no right to confine itself to casting pearls before swine first of all the church should do some preparatory work in order that the swine may be able to receive the pearls it is not for the church to separate human beings into two categories first of all the swine communists non conformists people who have mistaken ideas working men and so on to whom we cannot proclaim the gospel and secondly those who are not swine those dull good sheep which our world creates in such numbers what the church ought to do is to try to place all people in an economic intellectual yes and also in a psychological and physical situation which is such that they can actually hear this gospel that they can be sufficiently responsible to say yes or no that they can be sufficiently alive for these words to have some meaning for them the secret of their choice belongs to god but they should be able to make a decision it is up to the church to see to it that they are not placed in such conditions that they cannot react otherwise than as swine to whom pearls have been thrown cast not your pearls before swine but men must cease to be swine and this is not the work of grace it is human work which man is quite able to achieve though it is terribly difficult to do christians in particular are called to this work because it is possible for them to see the true situation of man better than other people and because they can see better than others where all this ought to lead and what is its aim
8204856 we need a revolution in a world in which it has become impossible a revolution that attacks the bases of a civilization whose efforts tend solely toward transforming people into swine all people who by this very fact can no longer receive the divine pearls we need a rediscovery of the meaning of human activity of the relation between means and ends of their true place in a world which is given up to the love of power to disorder to the pride based on a sense of limitless power over the external world
8204857 the community of believers was of one mind and one heart none of them claimed anything as their own rather everything was held in common the apostles continued to testify with great power to the resurrection of jesus christ and they were all given great respect nor was anyone needy among them for those who owned property or houses would sell them and give the money to the apostles it was then distributed to any members who might be in need
8204858 if any of you wants to be first you must be the last one of all and servant of all
8204859 it is not accidental ignorance but essential arrogance that dooms empires to the dustbin of time and graveyard of history empires according to charles s maiers 2006 book among empires american ascendancy and its predecessors are epics of entropy
8204860 never before has the essential arrogance of american imperialists been displayed in public with such fanfare and disastrous consequences than with the ascension of george w bush and his cabal of corporatist criminals to power
8204861 the first christians therefore had to present a positive counter mantra and a positive counter program to roman imperial theologys sequence of religion war victory and peace
8204862 we have a better way stay strong stay the course kill them
8204863 be confident prevail we are going to wipe them out we are not blinking
8204864 kill them be confident prevail we are going to wipe them out we are not blinking
8204865 subordinates cant have two superiors either theyll hate the one and love the other or be attentive to the one and despise the other you cant worship both god and money
8204866 if you wish to come after me you must deny your very self take up your cross and follow in my footsteps if you would save your life you will lose it but if you lose your life for my sake you will save it mark 8 34 amp 35
8204867 there has developed in effect a kind of corpus which practically all christian groups accept but which has nothing in common with the biblical message whether in the hebrew bible that we call the old testament or the gospels and epistles of the new testament all churches have scrupulously respected and often supported the state authorities they have made of conformity a virtue they have tolerated social injustices and the exploitation of some people by others explaining that it is gods will that some should be masters and others servants and that socioeconomic success is an outward sign of divine blessing they have thus transformed the free and liberating word into morality the most astonishing thing being that there can be no christian morality if we truly follow evangelical thinking
8204868 jesus came to nazareth where he had been brought up entering the synagogue on the sabbath as was his habit jesus stood up to do the reading when the book of the prophet isaiah was handed to him he unrolled the scroll and found the passage where it was written
8204869 after johns arrest jesus appeared in galilee proclaiming the good news of god this is the time of fulfillment
8204870 it will not come by watching for it it will not be said look here or look there rather the fathers kingdom is spread out upon the earth and people dont see it
8204871 if your leaders say to you look the fathers kingdom is in the sky then the birds of the sky will precede you if they say to you it is in the sea then the fish will precede you rather the kingdom is within you and it is outside you
8204872 you are old and your sons pervert your ways appoint a ruler to lead us as all the other nations do
8204873 give to the people whatever they ask for they are not rejecting you
8204874 no one can serve two superiors you will either hate one and love the other or be attentive to one and despise the other you cannot give yourself to god and money
8204875 blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god
8204876 you see once upon a time there was this little anarchist church that of jesus paul and the other new testament christians
8204877 actually in comparison to some other churches of other eras its church growth statistics werent all that bad
8204878 and wouldnt you know it worked they went for the emperor and got him and he brought the whole of the big arky over with him christianity was proclaimed the official religion of the roman empire and the world was won for christ at one fell swoop we now had a whole empireful of christians the church was finally in a position to do some real good for humanity and bring in the truly just society talk about revolution the church praised god from whom all blessings flow and the emperor snickered all the way to the bank his empire had found the lord and become christian without having to make any changes at all christianity had done all the changing indeed the conversion would probably qualify as forensic justification all it took was a word from god or at least his official representatives and we now had the holy roman empire pretty neat wouldnt you say
8204879 after consulting my legal advisers and closest political supporters and listening to their advice in the interest of the nation i resign from my post today i leave my future in the hands of the people to let them be the judges and let them do the justice

8204882 senator bidens smooth insincere promises that he would treat me fairly were nothing but talk
8204883 it appears to me that you are saying that the government has as much right to control a married couples decision about choosing to have a child or not as that government has a right to control the public utilitys right to pollute the air
8204884 that the economic gratification of a utility company is as worthy of as much protection as the sexual gratification of a married couple because neither is mentioned in the constitution
8204885 do you think that there is a basic right under the constitution not to be forcibly sterilized by the state
8204886 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
8204887 its a very naive way of thinking how youre going to conduct foreign policy
8204888 having talking points on foreign policy doesnt get you there
8204889 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
8204890 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
8204891 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
8204892 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
8204893 i am not going to fail to protect these kids as long as we have a single solitary troop in iraq
8204894 this isnt cutting off the war this is cutting off support that will save the lives of american troops
8204895 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a tragic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake
8204896 hey this body armor works that didnt hurt at all
8204897 a lawyer came to my office one day complaining he was feeling bad but didnt know why as we talked i found out he had this habit of always slightly exaggerating his achievements for example he would make 80 000 but report his income as 81 500 or when he went golfing he would report his score of 73 which is already a great achievement as 71 no wonder he was feeling terrible no matter how well he performed he could never do as well as the self he pretended to be
8204898 wow i feel great why the hell did i start doing it in the first place
8204899 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron

8204908 constantine thus forged an alliance with the church not because of faith or miracle but to further his personal ambitions
8204909 in a genius driven without surcease by ambition and lust for power there can be no question of christianity and paganism of conscious religiosity or irreligiosity such a man is essentially unreligious even if he pictures himself standing in the midst of a churchly community
8204910 economic developments leading to accumulation of wealth and to the centralized forms of government needed to safeguard that wealth undoubtedly played a role in the development of the israelite monarchy

8204917 woe unto you preachers and president hypocrites for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess ye blind president and politicians cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter that the outside of them may be clean also woe unto you politicians and president hypocrites for ye are like unto whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead mens bones and of all uncleanness even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity woe unto you preachers and christians hypocrites because ye build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous
8204918 commentary on the news and the gospel for march 8 2008
8204919 this is the same man who claims that he is a christian this is the same man who is supported by thousands of christians in this country i suggest that neither he nor those who support him are actually christians in any meaningful sense of the word

8204921 beyond the sheer number of inmates america is also the global leader in the rate at which it incarcerates its citizenry
8204922 citizens of the usa often like to proclaim to themselves and to the world what a wonderful compassionate and christian bunch of people we are these statistics put a lie to that idea china with more than a billion people has fewer people in prison that do we imagine that it simply boggles the minds and wrenches the heart that we are such a punishment oriented society most western nations have long since abandoned the death penalty the usa stands as a beacon of darkness against the world on this score as well unfortunately like the occupation and exploitation of iraq the prison industry is big business and getting bigger with every passing day because the government has decided to enrich the few at the expense of the many it has privatized prisons as it has privatized the war in iraq billion dollar industries are difficult to fight they have the money to hire lobbyists that infest the halls of congress like roaches infest the tenements of slum lords in every city in the usa these people are not interested in reducing the population of the prisons their interest is in seeing these institutions grow and grow as quickly as possible read this entire article for the grisly and abhorrent details of placing profits ahead of human beings profiting from human misery is one of the main markers that tell us we are living in a capitalist economic system in its 2005 annual report the corrections corporation of america laid out whats at stake for a prison industry facing reform
8204923 this is the profit making system of criminal justice if we cant make money on it we dont want it this of course stands in stark contrast to the teachings of jesus of nazareth here again is one of the objectives of jesus ministry a ministry to which all who would consider themselves disciples are called
8204924 god i thank you that i am not like other people thieves rogues adulterers or even like this tax collector i fast twice a week i give a tenth of all my income
8204925 but we have come to accept the delusion that the more people we have in prison the safer we will be
8204926 we are jammed up in this situation right now because we have fallen in love with one of the most undocumented beliefs
8204927 that somehow you get safer if you put more people in jail
8204928 do to others as you would have them do to you if you love those who love you what credit is that to you for even sinners love those who love them if you do good to those who do good to you what credit is that to you for even sinners do the same if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive what credit is that to you even sinners lend to sinners to receive as much again but love your enemies do good and lend expecting nothing in return your reward will be great and you will be children of the most high for he is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked be compassionate just as your father is compassionate
8204929 because of the tone grace and sensibilities with which he approaches politics warren is replacing the religious right model with a new better and i think more christ based paradigm
8204930 love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind
8204931 for the record i will never have a welcoming attitude toward homosexuality or its celebrants although as christians we should of course point homosexuals toward the love and forgiveness offered through christ

8204946 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8204947 arizonans are also proud of their political tradition from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt theres a pattern here
8204948 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8204949 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8204950 to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8204951 so you decide which makes more sense entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience who started running for president the day he arrived in the u s senate
8204952 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8204953 now i could stand up here and say lets just get everybody together lets get unified the skies will open the light will come down celestial choirs will be singing and everyone will know we should do the right thing and the world will be perfect

8204958 there are no plans that i know of to change the agreement but you know in life you never rule things out
8204959 but its obviously got to be something that both the united states and india you know can agree to if there were going to be changes but ive heard no mention of a need to you know adjust the agreement in any way
8204960 there are a number of concerns that some countries have about whats been about the agreement but they are good questions and we think weve got good answers to those
8204961 and we have discussions with governments about these issues and we will do our best to address those concerns as the indians are trying to do to address concerns other governments may have about the agreement

8204988 and in lane 4 we have suns javafx used by web properties such as well its still in development
8204989 this isnt the type of market where only one technology is going to win
8204990 i think sun has the opportunity to catch up very quickly in that space
8204991 i would say that the javafx platform looks very good it has a lot of potential
8204992 it probably should have been announced three four five years ago
8204993 a powerful client technology for creating rich internet applications with immersive media and content across the multiple screens of your life
8204994 javafx script the language of javafx doesnt replace swing the core java gui toolkit but provides an alternative way of programming that hopefully will bring java technology to the masses
8204995 javafx takes that momentum and the advantages we have with java but makes it much easier to create rich interactive and immersive experiences
8204996 it matches the way they think about interfaces in their head and is very intuitive
8204997 the platform promises a lot of new apis and new abstractions to make the harder things simpler and the simpler things very easy

8205032 thank you for this the gold medal in the lib dem olympics
8205033 im with chris hoy im comfortable and confident in being part of a federal political party team lib dem scottish mps msps meps and councillors across the country working together to build a stronger party a stronger scotland and yes a stronger uk
8205034 team scott as with our athletes has only won because of the support staff like chris hoy victory would not have been achieved without them thank you
8205035 today i am clear in my mind about the challenge ahead
8205036 and when they stop i am determined that the liberal democrats will be a dominant presence on the political landscape
8205037 our values of community liberty and fairness locked into 21st century scotland
8205038 after less than eighteen months in government the snp is riding high in the polls
8205039 we can already see underlying weaknesses that will undo alex salmond
8205040 will be seen as arrogant misguided and politically dishonest tomorrow
8205041 the other day mr salmond ended weeks of dither by announcing what he would do to help the housing market
8205042 this is the man who attacks gordon brown with venom
8205043 when scotland votes in the coming election people will be looking for a party that understands their needs that offers solutions to their problems and that is ready to lead throughout scotland
8205044 i made it clear during this leadership campaign that i wont rest until it is crystal clear that the scottish liberal democrats fit that bill
8205045 my election today is not a prescription for more of the same
8205046 change that locks in liberal values thats why well continue to make the case for protecting our environment improving our public services and taking back our civil liberties
8205047 but if this party is to take advantage of the changing political climate we must move outside our comfort zone away from the holyrood bubble
8205048 we must engage individuals families and communities about the problems that they face in their daily lives
8205049 and we must provide the big ideas the practical solutions that will make life easier for them
8205050 and real solutions for families who are struggling to meet the rising cost of food and fuel solutions for scotland
8205051 i want our party to turn to those issues with renewed energy and vigour
8205052 to speak with business and industry to the academic and voluntary sectors to campaign and consumer groups
8205053 to ensure that the scottish parliament has the powers to act or the foresight to devolve power to communities and individuals so that they can take decisions for themselves
8205054 a place where people come together and work to solve the problems facing our community
8205055 not just because we need to but because we want to
8205056 i will bring a little bit of shetland to the leadership
8205057 i will work day and night to build the team produce the ideas and grow the party that will earn scotlands trust
8205058 the liberal democrats contributed the brightest and the best ideas in scotlands first eight years of devolution
8205059 that the successes we have achieved are a starting point and not an end
8205060 im grateful to have received the support of so many liberal democrats from across scotland
8205061 its a particular honour to have won given the choice that party members had
8205062 ross finnie and mike rumbles are formidable candidates who have fought excellent campaigns
8205063 and i very much look forward to working with them to take our party forward in the months and years ahead
8205064 building on the dedicated work and commitment of nicol stephen and i would like to thank him on behalf of all our party

8205098 after they realised we werent from home amp away there was this dead silence
8205099 the crickets were chirping and i think i could hear a crow in background so they ushered us up the red carpet and on to a podium to have our picture taken
8205100 then a security guard came up to me and the other female cast member and said can we get the girlfriends out of the shot we were like were actually in the show but thank you for validating our presence and our sense of equality in the comedy industry
8205101 i was like adams the nicest guy in the world of course hes going to say that then his producer called the following week theyve had me on five times this year

8205103 shows like little britain and the league of gentlemen started as radio shows and then went to tv
8205104 i thought the way i grew up was normal until i started comparing myself to other people
8205105 instead of giving us umbrellas for example mum would cut arm holes in a garbage bag we were only allowed to watch half an hour of tv a day until i reached the age of 10 i had to be in bed by 6pm when it was daylight savings the f ing sun would still be shining
8205106 if that was true my job would be done the jokes would write themselves id just sit back and put my hand out for the cash
8205107 were just trying to find out what we wanted to do with our lives
8205108 we just used to laugh about all these situations we and our friends would get into so we decided to do something with it
8205109 but the characters are not josh and i im not that much of a bitch
8205110 i think our friends just wondered what wed been doing for two years
8205111 bogan pride really celebrates the people that often go un noticed my hope is for people to look beyond their fuggliness and see the hero within these characters
8205112 on a more serious note this is the bestest thing ive ever done so if people dont like this show then im going to quit being a writer performer and become something easy like a model or do something with ice cream watch the show embrace your bogan within then feed it a little it prefers carbs

8205136 the symptoms of bipolar disorder are basically extreme highs and lows

8205139 the article was horrendous and completely devastating not only because of the actual girl but because on another level it could potentially have ruined my career because if i had been anorexic there is no way i would have been able to do a lot of the action movies that i do people wouldnt have hired me
8205140 i was 18 and the idea that an 18 year old girl is not going to be in some way feeling awkward is ridiculous i wouldnt say that i have body issues but if youre going to ask me whether im completely 100 per cent satisfied of course im not nobody is

8205145 ive always loved joe biden i think hes a bit of an attack dog
8205146 but i love that from him i already see him firing things up in this party im completely looking forward to him too i was overjoyed to see him take the stage today
8205147 its not merely a womans right to choose thats at stake
8205148 its whether or not you are going to be able to have a fair shot at a fair wage its whether or not you are going to be able to demand that you are treated equally in every aspect of your life the country needs barack obama as president

8205155 obviously we now have to view those russian statements with a high degree of skepticism
8205156 at about 0600 on the date in question that place was lit up like a friggin christmas tree
8205157 tacit government endorsement for hate crimes and racism youre a genius putin
8205158 a lot of experts have concluded that bushs portrayal of putin as some kind of broad minded humanitarian tops the list for all time goofiest statement made by a power drunk executive officer
8205159 it makes neville chamberlins chummy relationship with hitler seem almost astute by comparison
8205160 if hillary clinton or rudy giuliani should repeat bushs error it would make it hard for even poland to join u s military missions without feeling stupid
8205161 it could be that what were seeing here is the russians in a panic
8205162 some have argued conclusively i think that the original device is only effective on persons with below normal levels of intellectual curiosity
8205163 obviously if you deploy a device like that against a hardened political cynic like hillary clinton or rudy giuliani it could backfire they might be induced to make idiotic remarks for the benefit of duping the american public but its highly unlikely that they could ever be made to believe what they themselves have said

8205169 the fact that its this overwhelming is the public making a statement that they want to see new momentum like this in the state attorneys office
8205170 i think you guys will be pleased in what we have to present as far as our structure and the way well conduct business in the office
8205171 this community wants the police and the state attorneys office working together to go after the bad guys

8205176 we have refused to compromise product quality even in the face of unprecedented increase in input costs believing that the customer needs products that can be relied upon in india our strategy of delivering value for money is no different

8205394 our high grade minto copper gold mine continues to generate strong financial results
8205395 recognizing that there is an approximate three month lag between metal production and the related financial return we generated cash flow from mining operations i of 21 4 million in the second quarter and 38 3 million in the first six months of 2008 given that copper production totalled 12 8 million pounds in the second quarter and that there will be two concentrate shipments in the third quarter as compared to one in each of the first two quarters we are well positioned to deliver a strong set of third quarter results
8205396 going forward we expect to achieve our objective of 55 million pounds of copper production in 2008 and to benefit from 1 lower unit operating costs as mill throughput is sustained at or above design levels 2 head grades increase into the fourth quarter as fresh high grade ore is accessed following the current pushback in the open pit and 3 lower energy costs as we connect to lower cost grid power in 2009 we are targeting production of 70 million pounds of copper as a result of a sustained period of processing high head grades and we complete our phase 3 expansion to 3 200 tpd of mill throughput

8205438 its fair to say we predicted more drama from a track lined with concrete walls and had factored the appearance of at least one safety car period into our pre race calculations
8205439 i dont know whether thats down to us misinterpreting the level of risk involved in racing around this track or whether it was just a testament to the good driving standards of modern formula 1 drivers nonetheless we came away from valencia having made gains in both championships which was very encouraging
8205440 at 8am on saturday i received a phone call from the teams doctor aki hintsa telling me that lewis was in some difficulties hed woken up with a severe migraine and with his neck in spasm
8205441 as a precaution we readied pedro to take over but despite delaying his start to saturday practice lewis was able to continue with his full race programme his physical problems are unlikely to disturb his fitness programme and we expect him to make a full recovery for both the
8205442 lewis felt a lot better on sunday but was still slightly sore and tender we are delighted he was able to sustain the performance of a full race in hot conditions we did not have the package to beat but we feel we did a first rate job and secured a very useful haul of world championship points lewis extended his lead in the drivers championship and in the constructors we extended our lead over ferrari
8205443 most definitely the reality is that heikkis particularly strong when hes got the car in front in his sights when he homes in on another competitor then his natural competitive instincts really come alive heikkis much more adept at switching effortlessly between engine saving brake saving and tyre saving modes and knows exactly when to push so the situation he encountered at the start of the year when he was dealing with slightly more tyre degradation is no longer a concern
8205444 i think ferrari were pleased the sun came out on sunday as im sure they feel when the track temperature really heats up thats when their car really comes to them

8205449 i think its a bit shocking for all of us because with that ruling it sets a precedent now
8205450 i guess therell be nothing of the sort bringing down lineouts like that even though it wasnt a real bad one it sets a precedent now
8205451 any interference of this kind carries real danger and a sanction is required
8205452 ive lost a couple of kilos so ive just got to get that back on before the weekend

8205454 it could have been picked up from my hands something i picked up food anything so all we know is it was a pretty bad case to keep me out for that game which was real disappointing

8205456 i think whether they bring stirling into inside centre or timana theyve both got the ability to ball play
8205457 its more just getting your head around it that youve got to ball play more instead of being those runners
8205458 you dont want to take things away from players that theyre good at timanas obviously a great runner so is stirling but they can also pass the ball and use the ball well

8205468 when are the americans israelis and the jihadists going to learn that they simply cannot accomplish their goals through violence
8205469 peace requires a new and different palestinian leadership so that a palestinian state can be born
8205470 i call on the palestinian people to elect new leaders leaders not compromised by terror i call upon them to build a practicing democracy based on tolerance and liberty
8205471 a palestinian state will never be created by terror it will be built through reform and reform must be more than cosmetic change or veiled attempts to preserve the status quo
8205472 the united states will not support the establishment of a palestinian state until its leaders engage in a sustained fight against the terrorists and dismantle their infrastructure
8205473 to be counted on the side of peace nations must act every leader actually committed to peace will end incitement to violence in official media and publicly denounce homicide bombings every nation actually committed to peace will stop the flow of money equipment and recruits to terrorist groups seeking the destruction of israel including hamas islamic jihad and hizbullah every nation actually committed to peace must block the shipment of iranian supplies to these groups and oppose regimes that promote terror like iraq and syria must choose the right side in the war on terror by closing terrorist camps and expelling terrorist organizations
8205474 this moment is both an opportunity and a test for all parties in the middle east an opportunity to lay the foundations for future peace a test to show who is serious about peace and who is not
8205475 my case is the first and only case in the history of modern espionage in which a prime minister actively assisted in the indictment and prosecution of his own countrys agent
8205476 a conservative is a liberal whose been mugged by reality
8205477 america and its followers are stuck in a whirlpool and they sink deeper as time passes a dangerous future is predicted for them
8205478 if nuclear energy is something good all nations should enjoy it on the basis of law
8205479 we have formal links with hizbullah we copy hizbullah in the way they fight and their tactics we teach each other and we are getting better through this
8205480 i am a lowly soldier of the imam khamenei hizbullah youths acted on behalf of the imam khomeini and sent their blessings to the iranian people
8205481 but because the final goal of the resistance is to wipe this entity israel off the face of the earth this goal necessitates the development of the capabilities of the resistance until this entity is wiped out
8205482 we argue over what the solution is but we still havent agreed on what the problem is
8205483 utterly forbidden the torture and ill treatment of palestinian detainees
8205484 as long as you begin with the deceitful premise that jews
8205485 with great pride i announce as of today our dear country is among the countries of the world that produces nuclear fuel on an industrial scale
8205486 if ever british prime minister tony blair hoped to carry his western values agenda on a white charger to the gates of teheran that hope vanished in the mire of iraq
8205487 for decades american policy sought to achieve peace in the middle east by pursuing stability at the expense of liberty the lack of freedom in that region helped create conditions where anger and resentment grew and radicalism thrived and terrorists found willing recruits
8205488 america makes no distinction between those who commit acts of terror and those that harbor and support them because theyre equally guilty of murder
8205489 or perhaps you agree with cindy sheehan that our nation isnt worth fighting for
8205490 it is increasingly apparent to both coalition and iraqi leaders that iran through the use of the quds force seeks to turn the iraqi special groups shiite militias into a hizbullah like force to serve its interests and fight a proxy war against the iraqi state and coalitions forces in iraq
8205491 will bring us closer to a korea peninsula that is free of nuclear weapons
8205492 if you hold out long enough and wear down the state department negotiators eventually you will get rewarded
8205493 the apocalypse said that the stealth beast would use cheating killing spying coercion and bribery and economic deprivation to subjugate all nations this appears perfectly descriptive of the regime
8205494 we arabs cant talk about anything else until palestine is solved
8205495 without further explanation from you i will feel compelled to forewarn my colleagues in the congress that any visits with your government offer little value toward bringing peace and security to palestinians and israelis furthermore i will help lead opposition in congress to any proposed call for additional us taxpayer dollars being sent to the palestinian authority
8205496 the split between judea and samaria and gaza which happened as a result of hamass coup is temporary and will be removed
8205497 said they believed that this was a clerical bureaucratic mistake not a conscious effort to help hamas
8205498 in light of the fact that israels foreign minister israels prime minister and our consul general all agreed on that fact mr fayads representations had more credibility with us when we brought it up with him
8205499 the terrorist threat facing britain from home grown al qaida agents is higher than at any time since the september 11 attacks in 2001
8205500 the security services have constantly warned that the task of countering islamic terrorism is a daunting one there will be more attacks in britain

8205505 i dont deal with mort kleins and i dont deal with the zionist organization of america
8205506 the prime minister has become convinced that negotiations with syria and a possible peace agreement will significantly alter the regional strategic situation and facilitate the isolation of iran and a solution to the problem with hizbullah
8205507 against the backdrop of the collapse of fatah and of palestinian authority chairman mahmoud abbas aka abu mazen and the fact that there is no chance for a diplomatic initiative with the palestinians in the near future
8205508 our best estimate is that 85 to 90 percent of all the suicide bombers are foreign ninety percent plus come through syria
8205509 what most entranced me about singaporean schoolchildren was that while there is discipline it doesnt look like repression i didnt see fear in the childrens eyes
8205510 we cannot demand that our arab neighbors mark the borders from 4 june 1967 when our own education ministry has erased them from the textbooks and from the students consciousness
8205511 rather than learn a lot of material well learn thinking today it is important to process information not memorize things
8205512 occasionally you have to look at the results of your brilliant theories
8205513 i dont think there is anything to be resolved there will be technical issues but i dont think we have any political issues
8205514 a small group of officials leaking cherry picked unvetted intelligence to key reporters in order to promote a preexisting political agenda
8205515 while our enemies take and take more concessions in futile for the west diplomatic negotiations
8205516 are abandoning their former headquarters at basra palace where a recent official visitor from london described them as surrounded like cowboys and indians by militia fighters an airport base outside the city where a regional us embassy office and britains remaining 5 500 troops are barricaded behind building high sandbags has been attacked with mortars or rockets nearly 600 times over the past four months
8205517 what your interpretation of the mission was in the first place
8205518 the place and the people to a state where the iraqis could run this part of the country if they chose to
8205519 the attorney general is not permitted to limit the powers of a minister or of the prime minister he is certainly not permitted to threaten to limit them
8205520 this is an extremely serious matter it is without precedent in any democratic country there is a danger in a regime of bureaucrats an elected representative is always dependent on the public whereas we have no control over appointed officials
8205521 as in the cold war where violence and intimidation were the methods used by an ideology hell bent on hegemony so today islam tries to put its leaden mantel all over the world benedict xvis cruel experience is testimony to this nowadays as in those times the west has to be called the free world in comparison to the muslim world likewise the enemies of the free world the zealous bureaucrats of the korans vision who swarm in the very center of the free world should be called by their true name
8205522 there is no safe place for me i have to beg two evenings here two evenings there i am under the constant protection of the police i must cancel all scheduled conferences
8205523 palestinians are humans humans who value freedom amp human rights as much as any white christian or jew
8205524 since by electing totalitarian terrorists to power the palestinians have proven incontrovertibly that they oppose democratic values of freedom and human rights support terror and oppose peaceful coexistence with israel
8205525 die bundesregierung muss parlament und ffentlichkeit ber die details bedingungen und konsequenzen des verkaufs der krisengesch ttelten mittelstandsbank ikb genau informieren

8205527 we apologize for the mistake and for the consternation it has caused
8205528 the next time harper goes to get the vote he will find out what people think of him
8205529 sends a message that he doesnt get his information right
8205530 it boggles the mind that any regime on the face of the earth would want to do anything that could remind people of nazi germany
8205531 immediate cessation by hizbullah of all attacks and the immediate cessation by israel of all offensive military operations
8205532 affirms that all parties are responsible for ensuring that no action is taken contrary to paragraph 1 which calls for a cessation of hostilities that might adversely affect the search for a long term solution humanitarian access to civilian populations including safe passage for humanitarian convoys or the voluntary and safe return of displaced persons
8205533 calls upon the government of israel as that deployment of the lebanese military and unifil begins to withdraw all of its forces from southern lebanon in parallel
8205534 in fairness movwater at least admits what hes been denying for over a week we did take sides in a war we otherwise had notning to do with as we are doing now which caused a sneak attack on our soil as we saw on 9 11
8205535 lydia writes friday august 18 2006 12 18 pm lol you are a lunatic
8205536 we know that the us is concerned about our missile test launch so our position is why dont we try to resolve this problem through negotiations
8205537 why should the iranians be the only ones to cash in on bushs decision to make the europeans love him
8205538 it should make people nervous when non transparent regimes who have announced they have nuclear warheads fire missiles
8205539 russias general staff has no information about whether ukraine has given 250 nuclear warheads to iran or not
8205540 will acquire a nuclear weapon and the ability to integrate it with ballistic missiles that iran already possesses
8205541 at least in part a growing sense of confidence because of shifts in the middle east in recent months especially the hamas victory in palestinian elections political paralysis in lebanon and the intense difficulties facing the united states in trying to stabilize iraq and stymie irans drive toward nuclear power
8205542 now irans frontline with israel the iranians are using hizbullah to spy on us so that they can collect information for future attacks and there is very little we can do about it
8205543 americas leadership in preventing irans nuclearization is indisputable and unequaled i just met my good friend a true friend of israel president george w bush in washington his determination to prevent this most serious of developments is unquestionable but america must have the support of the international community if we are to successfully defuse this mortal threat
8205544 a coalition of moderate arab countries can and must unite their common interest in preventing iran from undermining stability in the middle east this coalition must struggle against the dangers of radical islam that manipulate the very source of islam itself
8205545 if the promise of never again is more important than the price of oil then the time for international indifference and hesitation in the face of the iranian threat has long passed
8205546 my attitude is lets work in concert to convince the government of iran that its not just the israeli voices speaking or the united states voices speaking but theres a lot of other voices saying the exact same thing
8205547 there could be no greater legacy for america than to help to bring into being a palestinian state
8205548 i have no doubt that we bolstered the secretary of states instincts and strengthened her opinion that aggressive american involvement was needed to achieve practical results
8205549 the settlers are an ideological sector kadima as a party devoid of an identity a face a name or a path is their polar opposite
8205550 cannot do anything against it they prefer former far left meretz party leader yossi sarid the idealist ten times more than kadima which lacks any identity
8205551 with men of letters consistently involved it will be impossible for a reality to emerge where pr mens cannon shells roar out while the muses and their servants are silent and silenced
8205552 no one who cant push me ahead is allowed to play the game
8205553 i wouldnt have a chance of reelection in the likud
8205554 in the world of advertising there is no parallel to the phenomenon of moral corruption called adler homsky
8205555 not all the arab neighborhoods will be part of the city in the future
8205556 if this resolution makes you satisfied go on and issue as many as you want
8205557 do not understand that the world has changed they believe that we are still in the middle ages where several people decide and others accept but this era is over
8205558 the jury is still out on whether the mullahs want the bomb
8205559 the middle east free of weapons of mass destruction including their means of delivery
8205560 we wont remain idle in the face of the siege imposed on the palestinian people by israel the us and other countries
8205561 we will strike at the economic and civilian interests of these countries here and abroad
8205562 there will be an explosion of anger and this would lead to a chaotic situation of which we cannot foresee the results
8205563 i cant say that we have a perfect response for the kassam rockets but our operations are effective the palestinians think twice before they shoot
8205564 you have to look at the glass as half full it could be better it could be worse
8205565 with our departure from the gaza strip the palestinians were given the chance to choose a new path instead of fighting i hope that they will choose the path of hope and of fighting terror
8205566 there is a threat of gunfire attacks on gilo but we have an effective answer to that threat as long as we retain the freedom to act and collect intelligence in bethlehem today we have freedom of action in the city but there are mortars moving around in bethlehem there are attempts to transfer know how attempts to transfer missiles we also see attempts to connect the area to northern samaria and gaza and by that i mean in terms of weaponry know how and personnel
8205567 one of the most troubling aspects of this affair is the probable involvement of relatives and neighbors beyond the immediate circle of the gang of kidnappers who were told about the jewish hostage and dropped in to participate in the torture
8205568 we respect the right of elected officials such as speaker pelosi to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops the catechism of the catholic church is clear the current teaching of the catholic church on human life and abortion is the same teaching as it was 2 000 years ago
8205569 i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion

8205572 coordinated information from a number of intelligence services leads us to believe that iran has not given up its wish to pursue its nuclear program
8205573 were very proud to have had a palestinian holding such a high position in hizbullah

8205597 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
8205598 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
8205599 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8205600 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
8205601 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno

8205604 cesen los allanamientos y la militarizaci n de las comunidades mapuche
8205605 los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche
8205606 el ministerio del interior presente las debidas querellas criminales en contra del gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n por su participaci n en la apolog a a la violencia tales acciones criminales deben presentarse al m s breve plazo de lo contrario ser n las comunidades que concurrir n al tribunal
8205607 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8205608 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia

8205674 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

8205760 he didnt go through histrionics but he got the legislature to do essentially what he wanted and what needs to be done i think hes been very forceful so far and hes very much growing into an outstanding player in the role
8205761 leadership is not just rah rah its also giving people news that they dont want to hear to the extent that they can stand it and i think thats what he did for us
8205762 there was bad news but it was bad news that we could bring back to people where they could hear what we were saying
8205763 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8205764 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8205765 its just like if you can speak to somebody in their own language
8205766 we never forget that our role is to serve families and their selected charities
8205767 theres no question that this process of geographical diversification in real estate started several years ago
8205768 if you were a son of mine i wouldnt want you to be an architect because its a tough way to be in the world
8205769 we never have a weak august it is supposed to be one of the strongest months of the year it is not a good indicator that the market is down in the strongest season of the year
8205770 if you look at rents here they are incredibly higher than elsewhere there is still low inventory and what is renting is going very quickly
8205771 goldman has been a little countercyclical like shorting the whole credit market when things were falling apart
8205772 now they seem to be bracing for the cmbs market to recover
8205773 the talk on the street is anywhere from 12 to 24 months
8205774 the market is still difficult the buyers of those bonds have not resurfaced to any large degree
8205775 last year we did 230 000 hamburgers and hot dogs 30 000 pizzas 5 000 pounds of pasta 13 tons of steaks 77 000 pounds of chicken breasts 4 5 tons of crab and lobster
8205776 it got to the point last year where we had depleted almost all of new york of crab and lobster
8205777 our fish purveyors had to go to secondary markets outside of new york just to get it
8205778 we have five different restaurants not including the dining rooms for the players the umpires and media
8205779 it was one meeting at which we were going to discuss several things and one was to be a surprise
8205780 she said nobody knows this please dont share this with the press
8205781 its extremely surprising that broadway boulevard got done as quickly as it did
8205782 in the whole history of dot projects this has probably moved the fastest of anything i have ever seen
8205783 weve got 6 000 miles of streets and over 12 000 miles of sidewalks and were trying to look at making them livable spaces and not just these utilitarian corridors
8205784 so when you take a look at the streets of new york thats 80 percent of our public space in some ways i think of myself as the largest real estate developer in new york

8205801 ive actually extended my lead in the championship despite losing two points to felipe
8205802 im mentally strong enough to deal with that and im more relaxed about it too im playing a long game
8205803 but ive learned that sometimes its more advantageous to score as many points as possible and live to fight another day
8205804 my aim is still to win the world championship and you dont do that by ending up in the barriers after making an opportunistic move
8205805 as you can see reliability is the key im not worried about the reliability of my car because for the past 18 months weve had phenomenal reliability
8205806 weve not really got any problems which means we can focus on developing the car rather than worrying about reliability which is a bonus for us
8205807 gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone
8205808 he has little regard for the well being of his neighbors or anyone else in the greater community
8205809 this is serious he will do whatever he wants to do
8205810 i cant believe he could do this and get arrested and be out the next day
8205811 if kens kids had been outside mr hunker would have killed them
8205812 he drove right by and i said there he goes
8205813 i asked if he had been drinking and he stated yes he drank a pint of vodka
8205814 hunker could not perform field sobriety tests safely at the scene and was placed under arrest for dui
8205815 his continued driving and a lack of any kind of apology suggests a frank disregard for the safety and consideration of everyone around him
8205816 slow strengthening is forecast and gustav could regain hurricane strength on thursday once it moves away from haiti

8205818 the constitution doesnt use the phrase separation of church and state so it reflects no such concept
8205819 it was the fundamental presuppositions of the christian faith that led newton to some of the greatest scientific discoveries of all time
8205820 liberals proclaim that christianity is not only out of date but never really existed
8205821 evolution begins with the presupposition that there is no god
8205822 it was the fundamental presuppositions of the christian faith that led newton to some of the greatest scientific discoveries of all time faith did not hinder him it helped him
8205823 if you want to discredit colsons claim you will have to show that newton was not motivated by his faith in a higher power or that if he were alive today his scientific studies would have quenched any spiritual ideas that he might have entertained
8205824 darwins key and lasting ideas about evolution were motivated by his atheism
8205825 colson also mentions c s lewis writing about a logical fallacy lewis is the father of one of the grandest logical fallacies of all time his false trilemma so this is yet another piece of shit in the stew but its beyond examining here
8205826 how predictably it is that you go to your tried and not true
8205827 lewis trilemma discredits itself although philosophers have formally maruaded it as well
8205828 people who insist on trying to defend the idea of gods no matter how intelligent they may write or speak in other realms invariably make asses of themselves because they are invariably wrong and when they do not make erroneous claims outright they make assumptions that are screamingly free of evidence this applies to lewis francis collins and other godders
8205829 as i said based upon your simple dismissal it is obvious that you are completely ignorant of what lewis actually wrote
8205830 its easy to ignore or side step difficult subjects if you just misquote and mischaracterize
8205831 thanks for the comedy its truly hilarious that you say that these well respected scholars make asses of themselves while you dogmatically extol the virtues of chris hitchens
8205832 if id known 100 he had cheated on me i wouldnt have gone in there and made a fool of myself
8205833 i just want to ask him about it all properly when he comes out i know that stories can be made up
8205834 its not nice reading those stories but do i believe them i will have to wait and see when he comes out ill ask him
8205835 i wont be with him if he admits he has cheated on me
8205836 first sergeant hatley then made the call to take the detainees to a canal and kill them
8205837 so the patrol went to the canal and first sergeant sgt first class mayo and i took the detainees out of the back of the bradley lined them up and shot them
8205838 we then pushed the bodies into the canal and left

8205840 people gathered there publicly declared their primary demand for azaadi freedom at the meeting venue and through numerous street processions in various streets of srinagar on 22 and 23 august during our interviews with individual families and with groups people voiced the same demand a wide range of social and political organisations have also reiterated this demand
8205841 the second time curfew was imposed with the express purpose of preventing the dharna at lal chowk the previous gathering at idgah where this dharna was announced had been peaceful therefore curfew became the means by which a confrontation was created which could have been easily avoided the clamping down on media and the brutal attacks on journalists happened while the team was still there arrests of leaders raids of homes and intimidation of local residents by the army and crpf are happeningeven now
8205842 imran ahmed wani who was injured in the bagi mehtab firing on 12 august was deliberately refused ambulance service for nearly two hours in fact when he did get into one it was attacked at rambagh bridge he was declared dead on arrival at the hospital
8205843 what is unbelievable is the attack on smhs hospital on 11 and 12 august successively
8205844 when families tried to get their version recorded the same was refused complaints are rejected in the case of the bagi mahtab killings where the families of the deceased javed ahmed mir and imran ahmed wani were given a totally false version of the happenings in the fir when challenged the police said that the families must come ten days later with 4 eye witnesses to corroborate their story thisrefusal even to receive complaints is tantamount to making the security forces judges of their own actions
8205845 essential supplies to srinagar city such as medicines water tankers and milk have been blocked and this blockade has been done at the instance of the crpf the entire control of land and order in srinagar city has all been handed over to the crpf and news reports have suggested that the local police have also been beaten by the crpf
8205846 despite these happenings the people of kashmir have shown exemplary restraint and ensured that all processions and public gatherings after the lifting of curfew remain wholly peaceful this situation should have been utilized to initiate political dialogue instead of the visit by the national security advisor
8205847 he is being questioned at the police station in sderot for entering the gaza strip in defiance of a military decree banning israeli citizens from doing so
8205848 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men fifteen other villagers were wounded or otherwise injured
8205849 this is matter of grave concern to the united nations i have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations the impact of such operations undermines the trust and confidence of the afghan people in efforts to build a just peaceful and law abiding state
8205850 the patience of the afghan people has run out we no longer can afford to see the killing of our children
8205851 i want to remind all parties engaged in the conflict that the protection of civilians must be their primary concern they must respect their duties under international humanitarian and human rights law to protect the people we are here to serve
8205852 i saw him throw his finger toward the showers and i thought what are you talking about
8205853 youre going to throw me out and the games already over youre cool
8205854 somebody to get close enough to where i could touch them
8205855 wtwc is insightful and clever with a terrific team of writers i highly recommend it
8205856 thats what i want really my birthday present is to win today
8205857 i dont want to get too amped because then i leave the ball up if i get too hyper and thats not me
8205858 just kind of relax a little bit and narrow my focus all that is going to happen once you get on the mound once the game starts its fine
8205859 the settlement activity is not conducive to creating an environment for negotiations
8205860 anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
8205861 the peace process is not and should not be affected by any kind of settlement activities
8205862 the issue of settlement building is not just that they exist on occupied land in the west bank and occupied east jerusalem its about control over water and the territorial contiguity of any possible future palestinian state
8205863 its difficult for palestinians to have any confidence in the committment to reach a solution when settlement activity has almost doubled and by the palestinain count more than doubled
8205864 more effort should be put in order to further reduce
8205865 we hope to have a deal to mlb by the end of the year
8205866 despite its self proclaimed position as an unbiased think tank the discovery institute has played a central role in the religious rights national campaign to undermine science education
8205867 under the guise of teaching the controversy the institute has strived to discredit the theory of evolution a theory that has withstood decades of critical analysis from the scientific community and replace it with a religiously motivated pseudo science with no scientific standing
8205868 im taken with the reply of an elderly scientific scholar to an exuberant young skeptic
8205869 it showed you that you always play the game out
8205870 weve chatted with him but we thought it was most appropriate to kind of wait until the end of the season to move forward on anything
8205871 but he has expressed that he is pitching next year and beyond probably
8205872 but wed be crazy not to think that hed be able to help us next year but again that doesnt mean hes going to be back
8205873 superstitions there are stup erstitions stupid stuff you do that you think works that stuff doesnt work wear the same underwear make sure one is marked game and the other is marked bp make sure the socks are the same way all that stuff its crazy there are only 24 hours in a day
8205874 people are just going to have to get people out
8205875 you define your own role i dont define them well just have to keep doing it until we figure it out and we will
8205876 a lot of times we like to blame one group or another but this was a team effort
8205877 we didnt hold them and we didnt add on weve had some tough losses this year but the sun will come up tomorrow and well play again
8205878 its frustrating to lose when youre ahead by that much
8205879 but in this team with this stadium its not enough this bandbox here is a good place for them to play
8205880 it can do nothing or it can do a lot well find out the next couple games obviously thats not the way you want the game to end after you have a 7 0 lead but well see what were made of
8205881 this is not the first time weve seen this and not just in philadelphia
8205882 it happens all over the place you have to keep playing hard right through the 27th out
8205883 i clearly had the advantage because he couldnt walk me and he really couldnt risk it and throw me a slider
8205884 so i pretty much knew i was going to get fastballs to hit it certainly wasnt an easy situation but it was as easy a situation as a batter could be in as long as you recognize that and know that hes got to come with a fastball ultimately he did
8205885 you forget that you get paid to play the game it was almost like we felt like little kids
8205886 we probably should try to stay away from him tomorrow
8205887 were having trouble scoring runs and everybody probably goes up there squeezing the sawdust out of the bats
8205888 i dont think theres any magic formula other than keep going out there and fighting the frustration we seem to be experiencing
8205889 id rather have that any night than no balls hit to me it makes it fun they can hit to me every time thats what i think thats what youve got to think i take a lot of pride in my defense
8205890 its a great way to win we pulled it out tonight
8205891 you forget that youre getting paid to play the game we almost felt like little kids with the excitement and kind of a playoff atmosphere
8205892 i heard youre not necessarily supposed to get your kids vaccinated right away and that youre supposed to wait a bit
8205893 it will help us crack the mysteries of these enormously powerful emissions
8205894 we dont yet understand the mechanism for how the particles that emit the gamma rays are accelerated
8205895 were not even sure what the nature of the particles are
8205896 today regarded as one of the top scientists of the 20th century
8205897 most economists believe a carbon tax a tax on the quantity of co2 emitted when using energy would be a superior policy alternative to an emissions trading regime
8205898 the irony is that there is a broad consensus in favor of a carbon tax everywhere but on capitol hill where the
8205899 the ozone layer has been depleted gradually since 1980 and now is about an average of 4 lower over the globe the average depletion exceeds the natural variability of the ozone layer the ozone loss is very small near the equator and increases with latitude toward the poles
8205900 stratospheric ozone is considered good for humans and other life forms because it absorbs ultra violet uv b radiation from the sun see figure q3 1
8205901 the rise in effective stratospheric chlorine values in the 20th century has slowed and reversed in the last decade top left panel
8205902 here is another fact those cfcs were banned right well they happily still produce them everywhere else and will for several years to come the levels have dropped maybe from the us and the other countries but what do you do with the other guys use harsh language and send them an epa report i am sure they will change their ways
8205903 cutting the cfcs has though dropped their levels in the atmosphere like turning off the spigot in the us canada and the eu
8205904 but you know phoca you could always be right and because i keep an open mind unlike some feel free to prove your argument
8205905 phoca since you dont know my background it is in aviation

8205934 i knew it was coming but i was hoping to be out before it came
8205935 and in lane 4 we have suns javafx used by web properties such as well its still in development
8205936 this isnt the type of market where only one technology is going to win
8205937 i think sun has the opportunity to catch up very quickly in that space
8205938 i would say that the javafx platform looks very good it has a lot of potential
8205939 it probably should have been announced three four five years ago
8205940 a powerful client technology for creating rich internet applications with immersive media and content across the multiple screens of your life
8205941 javafx script the language of javafx doesnt replace swing the core java gui toolkit but provides an alternative way of programming that hopefully will bring java technology to the masses
8205942 javafx takes that momentum and the advantages we have with java but makes it much easier to create rich interactive and immersive experiences
8205943 it matches the way they think about interfaces in their head and is very intuitive
8205944 the platform promises a lot of new apis and new abstractions to make the harder things simpler and the simpler things very easy
8205945 a new style of leadership is needed in the u s senate people see the need people like the new ideas we need to look at the issues as alaskans as americans
8205946 right now i dont trust the republicans especially at the local level
8205947 its not an intuitive thing there are people who have been convicted in federal court
8205948 we need him in washington i dont think we can afford to lose him there
8205949 while the vast majority of car mechanics and garages are entirely reputable our research highlights that there are a number of rogue tradesmen trying to exploit drivers and consumer confidence in the industry is low
8205950 in the current economic climate car owners could be holding on to used cars for longer for the safety of all road users its vital we make sure our vehicles are adequately maintained and serviced

8205956 oh no i played it years ago when quite a youngster
8205957 we judge that we are now entering into a period of contraction but it wont be as steep a drop as in 2001 2002
8205958 i believe the riksbank will raise interest rates in september but then there wont be any more rate increases
8205959 the riksbank is also going to changes the direction of its interest rate policy which means that they will send signals for a lower repo rate next year
8205960 to fully surround russia with the help of in the caucasus and ukraine and turn the black sea into an american lake
8205961 in the end it seems to me that will lead to a balanced international system in which very obviously it will be impossible not to take account of russia or to humiliate her by gradually pushing her out of the sphere of european influence
8205962 russia simply acknowledged the real situation georgia did not control those territories and there was no hope for reunification
8205963 i have just come back from a 5 star all inclusive holiday in north cyprus hotel name which by the way was not cheap
8205964 yes it was terrible and i quite agree with you
8205965 building work claims are regularly received by holidaytravelwatch why a tour company or hotelier should expect a holidaymaker to take a holiday amongst building works never fails to surprise me the package travel directive and regulations need to be tightened up to ensure that holidaymakers are clearly warned about such significant changes to the quiet enjoyment of their holidays
8205966 it was great good waves and different open race course nice to get a shifty race course we took a few boats on the first run of the first race and ross did some nice work on the second beat and in the second race we managed to come away with a third so we are pleased with that it was shifty and pretty puffy and so it was really nice racing and the forecast is for even more tomorrow and so it might even be a bit like marseille one of the things today was there was opportunities on both sides of the race course and then the nice thing is when you do get a bit of an opportunity to mix it up it works it was really good for us we are slowly getting more and more out of this boat but we are certainly not as quick as the newer boats in that breeze our speed is ok but not as good as the newer boats
8205967 it was a disappointing first race we had a great work up the first beat and rounded the top mark in the lead we set our spinnaker and then the spinnaker sheet got wrapped around the coaming in the back of the boat and started sawing through the back of the boat a little bit of a worry our eight or nine boat length lead went down to zero and from there we were passed by all but again the guys did some great work on the last run and we got back into fifth in the second race we got the end of the line we wanted but i didnt do such a good last wrap up but if today is anything to go by it is going to be full on this week and some awesome racing expected its a good feeling to get started again the race committee did some great work out there holding the marks because these conditions are pretty tough on everybody
8205968 nobody is used to these kinds of conditions you get the feeling you are in the middle of the sea rather than in a bay or gulf or some kind of protected area like in marseille cagliari or palma
8205969 it was a good start to the week since we didnt sail brilliantly and made quite a lot of mistakes and even then got some decent results it has been a while since we sailed with this kind of wind and there were a few errors as well as my starts not being too good either i am going to have to read the manuals again but if we can get it all straightened we will be feeling confident
8205970 the boat is going well and we still have quite a few new sails both for here and portimao we have run our programme well so we still have some good material to use the race course is tough and the depth and shifts makes it very hard for the committee to lay the marks something we have to keep an eye on especially at the start as they move around quite a lot
8205971 it was very tricky out there big wind and waves and although the breeze was up it was very shifty normally when the wind is up it doesnt move around so much but with the two winds and big mountains inland it makes it very hard to fathom out we felt quite confused at times but we have come away with a couple of good results so as an opener thats not bad
8205972 thierry peponnet and i are a new partnership i havent worked with him before but im really enjoying it

8205979 at this point i cant say what we expect from this feature were just curious to see how it will be used
8205980 unfortunately because the examples he provides are still only experiments we cannot talk in length about how they work if we end up rolling out this experiment for all users we would definitely be able to talk in more detail right now we are experimenting with a number of factors so we cant really explain how the final product would work
8205981 n o entendemos que a situa o que se vive no pa s seja de tal forma extraordin ria que fundamente a convoca o extraordin ria da comiss o permanente
8205982 o ps entende que a audi o de ministros normal em democracia
8205983 teremos muito gosto e o ministro da administra o interna com certeza tamb m em viabilizar essa audi o ou na comiss o permanente ou na primeira comiss o parlamentar de assuntos constitucionais direitos liberdades e garantias
8205984 man kan vel sige at jeg har to suc ceskriterier enten kommer jeg ikke ind eller ogs kommer jeg ind og af g r kampen under alle omst ndigheder er det dejligt at v re tilbage
8205985 if they play with that kind of confidence week in week out they will be a threat for going up
8205986 roberto obviously has them playing with confidence and they are a technically gifted side
8205987 its a great compliment but we know we have to consolidate first
8205988 it is a great achievement to reach the third round for the first time in 26 years
8205989 i know there were a lot of changes on both sides but it speaks volumes on how far we have come as a football club when we can compete with and beat a premier league side
8205990 that is testament to how well prepared and how hard the lads have been working because our quality of play was outstanding
8205991 we looked the stronger side as the game went on and we played some special football that i hope our fans enjoyed
8205992 hull had some very expensive premier league players but i thought we controlled the game from the start of the second half
8205993 we created enough chances after the break to win the game comfortably and it was a pleasure to watch
8205994 the decision of where to send aid was made at the highest level of the pentagon and the only decision was to send it to batumi
8205995 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8205996 i knew it was coming but i was hoping to be out before it came
8205997 we are fearful that job cuts are on the way at m amp s why else would they cut their existing policy if they did not intend to use it
8205998 why do people at the bottom get the sack on the cheap while the top bosses get large payouts even when they leave having messed up
8205999 we believe that heinekens results are not as bad as feared
8206000 the outlook for 2008 is very cautious though but provides room to over deliver
8206001 this is a good first half performance demonstrating our competitiveness against a background of weaker economies and increased input costs
8206002 shared user experience at any time mobility and location dependency are all key features of the web 2 0 on top of this comes the fact that web 2 0 services generally must be rapid to implement and easy to change in moves that frequently turn the user into a provider this is precisely the situation our mobile widget runtime is designed to take account of as demonstrated by our model applications for mobile car sharing and location based digital notepads users are on the move and have to engage with a service from where they are and also need to communicate and so on the solution here is to create close intermeshing of the web and the mobile phone
8206003 with its integration of web and telephony our solution has attracted interest from different quarters
8206004 on the one hand it enables extended use of the mobile phone as an access point for location based services which is just what telephone and network providers want to see on the other browser providers are also showing interest in the new platforms even though they know that todays web applications cant be realized on a one to one basis on mobile end devices and then the rapid implementation of business ideas our solution offers also means that completely new services can be created for market niches as the web has already shown us
8206005 ard zdf rtl und prosieben sat1 gruppe verlieren anschluss an die fernsehzukunft
8206006 die konsumenten kaufen immer gr ere fernsehbildschirme und investieren in flachbildger te die heute angebotene signalqualit t reicht bei weitem nicht aus
8206007 die ffentlich rechtlichen aber auch die privaten programmanbieter speisen den verbraucher immer noch mit einer berholten jahrzehntealten technologie ab wir fordern die sender deshalb auf die deutschen fernsehhaushalte nicht l nger vom fortschritt abzukoppeln und umgehend mit ausstrahlung in hd qualit t zu beginnen die medienpolitik ist ihrerseits gefordert den versorgungsauftrag der ffentlich rechtlichen tv anstalten zu berpr fen
8206008 720 zeilen sind nicht stand der technik sondern im wahrsten wortsinn von gestern hier werden unsere rundfunkgeb hren in den sand gesetzt
8206009 alles andere als full hd w re verschwendung von rundfunkgeb hren
8206010 full hd damit verbraucherinteressen und der technologie und medienstandort deutschland nicht auf der strecke bleiben
8206011 damit fernsehzuschauer mit ihren flachbildfernsehger ten endlich auch qualit tsfernsehen
8206012 an end to old style politics regional divisions partisan bickering and personal attacks
8206013 more than 50 agencies boards and commissions and thousands of positions in state government
8206014 we are beginning to manage our real estate portfolio like a business would
8206015 this is what we stand for and this is why we should lead and this is why you should choose us instead of the other guys
8206016 we democrats must unite so that the entire nation can unite because surely the republicans wont bring this country together their policies divide the nation into the lucky and the left out into the royalty and the rabble the republicans are willing to treat that division as victory
8206017 those liberal democrats are trying to hide more than the colors of our flag you see theyre trying to hide their true colors they want higher taxes but they wont say so they want to weaken america but they wont admit it you see liberal democrats believe washington should manage dreams for all americans and republicans believe americans should have the freedom to achieve our dreams ourselves republicans believe that if liberty is threatened anywhere it is threatened everywhere
8206018 to paraphrase winston churchill give us the tools and we will finish the job give us a republican congress and we will put our people back to work and we will put criminals in jail where they belong
8206019 talking about working together with republicans and the lessons and success he had doing that in virginia
8206020 john mccain promises more of the same a plan that would explode the deficit that will be passed on to our kids no real strategy to invest in our crumbling infrastructure and he would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq
8206021 a whole lot of good folks who didnt see themselves as either democrats or republicans but as virginians
8206022 we need leaders who will appeal to use not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans i spent 20 years in business if you ran a company whose only strategy was to tear down the competition it wouldnt last long so why is this wisdom so hard to find in washington i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or a d next to it
8206023 this election isnt about liberal vs conservative its not about left and right

8206026 wir haben verbesserungen gefunden und es ist nun definitiv besser zu fahren
8206027 ich bin fest entschlossen f r uns im trockenen noch einige starke resultate zu holen
8206028 trotz meiner ersten startreihe haben wir in br nn nicht das ergebnis geholt auf das wir gehofft haben in misano stand ich 2007 auf dem podium ich mag diese strecke und ich bin ausgeruht ich f hle mich nun wieder wesentlich st rker
8206029 well keep doing it until we find the right way
8206030 i think the whole ballpark knew he wasnt going to swing but he put on a good show
8206031 its frustrating but with this team in this stadium you never know
8206032 dale du bist ein gro er fan der rockmusik hast du dir jemals berlegt dir in dein rennauto einen cd player einbauen zu lassen damit du w hrend der langen 600 meilen rennen nebenbei ein wenig musik h ren kannst
8206033 in den usa bist du ein hnlicher superstar wie es michael schumacher bei uns ist michael hat seine ferien immer gerne in den usa verbracht weil ihn dort niemand erkannte und er sich absolut frei bewegen konnte du hast ein faible f r australien aber ein hast du dir jemals berlegt einen ferientrip nach deutschland zu unternehmen anstatt nach australien
8206034 in australien kann ich mich komplett frei bewegen wenn ich das in deutschland auch k nnte dann w rde ich mir das sogar berlegen ich mag es einfach wenn ich nicht auf den radarschirmen auftauche
8206035 ich frage deshalb weil du ja mit adidas einen gro en pers nlichen sponsor aus deutschland hast was genau macht adidas f r dich
8206036 sie machen meinen climacool rennanzug und wir haben eine jr nation linie mit sportkleidung und sportschuhen
8206037 seitdem juan pablo montoya und jacques villeneuve in der nascar fahren ist das interesse auch in deutschland rapide gestiegen wie siehst du pers nlich die ffnung der nascar gegen ber dem rest der welt
8206038 ja ich denke auch dass nascar immer popul rer wird aber es wird auch an der nascar selbst liegen wie international sie die sache wirklich aufziehen wollen trotzdem ist es schon richtig klasse zu sehen dass man pl tzlich soviel internationales interesse generieren kann
8206039 rein aus der sicht eines piloten gefragt was kann nascar tun um die serie auch in deutschland noch popul rer zu machen
8206040 mensch das ist eine gute frage die ich leider nicht wirklich beantworten kann das ist die sache der nascar und deren marketingabteilungen die sich darum k mmern sollten ich fahre ja nur das auto und versuche f r meine fans meine bestm gliche leistung zu bringen das ist das was f r mich wirklich wichtig ist
8206041 2007 war hendrick motorsports absolut dominant 2008 stellt sich das bisher etwas anders dar was sind daf r die gr nde ist es vor allem das car of tomorrow oder haben gibbs und roush einfach gegen ber hendrick aufholen k nnen
8206042 es ist schon das cot ich glaube dass alle teams quer durch den sprint cup immer noch gro e probleme damit haben denn das auto ist wirklich eine riesige herausforderung in der saison 2007 haben sich die teams von hendrick motorsports vor allem darauf konzentriert die meisterschaft zu gewinnen w hrend alle anderen bereits f r 2008 gearbeitet haben wir sind derzeit vielleicht ein kleines bisschen hinter dem zug aber wir sind ja trotzdem immer noch erfolgreich
8206043 jeder spricht davon wie eng jeff gordon jimmie johnson und deren crews zusammenarbeiten nun bist du bei hendrick sozusagen der neue wie gut ist deine beziehung zu jeff und jimmie
8206044 ich bin mit ihnen befreundet aber jeff und jimmie sind ja verheiratet und sie leben beide in new york von daher ist die einzige zeit in der ich die beiden sehe an der strecke aber wir kommen immer gut miteinander aus jeff und mein vater waren ja auch schon miteinander befreundet wir sind es auch da gibt es berhaupt keine probleme
8206045 aber verglichen mit den anderen superstars der szene eben jeff gordon jimmie johnson und auch tony stewart hast du bisher nie den sprint cup titel gewinnen k nnen glaubst du dass es ende der saison vielleicht soweit sein k nnte
8206046 es ist zumindest bisher unsere beste chance und ich hoffe wirklich darauf dass uns das am ende auch gelingen wird wir haben das team dazu wir haben das talent und auch die ausr stung wir m ssen nur an unserer konstanz arbeiten und ich dann denke ich dass wir richtig gut aussehen werden
8206047 nun kommt 2009 mit mark martin ein weiteres gro es kaliber zu hendrick motorsports welche ver nderungen erwartest du dann
8206048 einfach noch mehr erfolg ich kann es gar nicht mehr erwarten ich liebe mark martin er f hrt mein auto in der nationwide serie und hat meiner firma jr motorsports seinen ersten sieg geschenkt ich habe eine riesige menge respekt vor ihm ich bin fest davon berzeugt dass er uns alle noch einmal wesentlich besser machen wird
8206049 du bist bekannt als der vielleicht beste restrictor plate fahrer berhaupt aber welcher streckentyp sind dir pers nlich am liebsten die short tracks die intermediate ovale oder die gro en superspeedways
8206050 also eigentlich liegen meinem fahrstil die short tracks am besten aber ich liebe daytona and talladega aber genauso mag ich michigan oder atlanta ich kann nicht sagen dass ich einen wirklichen favoriten habe aber die vier stechen da schon heraus
8206051 in sonoma hast du an deine box gefunkt dass juan pablo montoya als er direkt vor dir lag gas geben soll denn schlie lich sei er der rundkurs profi ein paar wochen sp ter hast du in watkins glen eine menge runden gef hrt ist dale earnhardt jr nun auf dem besten weg ein rundkurs spezialist zu werden
8206052 nein auf keinen fall lacht anm d red ich bin einfach traditionell in watkins glen viel besser unterwegs als auf dem infineon raceway juan pablo ron fellows oder auch boris said sind auf diesen strecken einfach irrsinnig gut ich versuche da nur mir anzusehen auf welcher linie sie fahren und wo sie genau bremsen aber man schaut den rundkurs spezialisten eigentlich immer genau auf die finger denn normalerweise fahren wir ja nicht auf solchen strecken
8206053 die letzte frage betrifft das nationwide rennen in montr al danach gab es sogar bei uns in deutschland diskussionen dar ber ob nascar auch im sprint cup regenreifen zulassen sollte wie ist deine meinung dazu
8206054 bbc programme makers and reporters decide what and how stories are reported there is absolutely no truth in any implication that the bbc compromised editorial independence

8206086 it was absolutely horrendous when we realised what had happened i knew what had happened straight away because we put the bags out in the garden before collection day
8206087 and its the time of year when hes looking for nice warm places to hibernate but we panicked because we didnt know where the rubbish goes so we had to phone the council to find out

8206138 er wordt door instellingen een smak geld uitgegeven aan campagnes en het werven van nieuwe b tastudenten maar blijkbaar komen studenten toch met verkeerde verwachtingen binnen
8206139 of dit komt doordat de wervingscampagnes niet voldoen ja eigenlijk wel instellingen hebben er baat bij om zoveel mogelijk eerstejaars binnen te halen
8206140 voor iedere student die start met een opleiding krijgt een instelling geld als studenten in het eerste jaar uitvallen verdienen ze dus zelfs aan een eerstejaars deze eerstejaarsbonus vinden wij onwenselijk
8206141 and in lane 4 we have suns javafx used by web properties such as well its still in development
8206142 this isnt the type of market where only one technology is going to win
8206143 i think sun has the opportunity to catch up very quickly in that space
8206144 i would say that the javafx platform looks very good it has a lot of potential
8206145 it probably should have been announced three four five years ago
8206146 a powerful client technology for creating rich internet applications with immersive media and content across the multiple screens of your life
8206147 javafx script the language of javafx doesnt replace swing the core java gui toolkit but provides an alternative way of programming that hopefully will bring java technology to the masses
8206148 javafx takes that momentum and the advantages we have with java but makes it much easier to create rich interactive and immersive experiences
8206149 it matches the way they think about interfaces in their head and is very intuitive
8206150 the platform promises a lot of new apis and new abstractions to make the harder things simpler and the simpler things very easy
8206151 slow strengthening is forecast and gustav could regain hurricane strength on thursday once it moves away from haiti

8206154 i know what we have out there i cannot dive without seeing abandoned gear its everywhere
8206155 its like a jungle of fishing line around those piers
8206156 abandoned nets drown marine mammals hundreds of coastal birds suffer injury when they become entangled in fishing line or when they ingest hooks
8206157 marine mammals including the federally threatened southern sea otter are injured or killed with wounds from entanglement or with obstructed or perforated intestines from swallowed hooks and line
8206158 boaters catch ropes attached to lost traps and pots or discarded monofilament line around their propellers surfers are injured running into lost gear underwater that reefs up in breaking waves as well lost gear clutters legal fishing grounds affecting fishermens ability to safely and efficiently deploy their own gear and in some cases damaging their nets
8206159 the gear will continue fishing and the fish will continue to die needlessly

8206173 a reading of the foregoing grounds reveals the intention of the lawmakers to make the registration and issuance of securities dependent to a certain extent on the merits of the securities themselves and of the issuer to be determined by the sec
8206174 this measure was meant to protect the interest of the investing public against fraudulent and worthless securities and the sec is mandated by law to safeguard these interests following the policies and rules therefore provided
8206175 the absolute reliance on the full disclosure method in the registration of securities is therefore untenable
8206176 they cannot really point their fingers to the company the situation right now is beyond the control of oriental public investors are unwarranted victims
8206177 for example they want to invest in other mining claims they can do that as long as they disclose it to the public we dont impose penalties on deviation but on non disclosure

8206369 we call on the civic religious and all peace oriented organizations to evaluate objectively the situation in order to appropriately address the issues
8206370 to lay down arms renounce any act of hostility and reopen avenues for dialogue and partnership

8206378 we are actively seeking property owners in the jackson hole market areas who want to auction their property for 100 percent of the current market value with no seller commission to enter their properties prior to the monday september 1st deadline
8206379 as one of only 322 accredited auctioneers of real estates aare in the united states we can deliver a higher level of service than 98 6 of real estate professionals in the marketplace
8206380 last year we auctioned two homes in teton springs and delivered 660 000 and 715 000 for a private seller who had purchased based on pre construction appraisals with inflated resale values of 1 4 to 1 6 million each our seller could not make the 18 000 payments for property in a subdivision that only had two arms length transactions during 2007 and they had no hope of selling using traditional methods
8206381 if you read the newspapers listen to the radio or watch the news on tv the message is nothing but doom and gloom about the real estate market
8206382 if you are trying to sell using the broken list price put up a sign and place it in the mls methods they are correct and your property can sit on the market for years with no bids or contingency
8206383 people selling real estate in the jackson hole market think they are immune to the nationwide correction in real estate values with almost every agent saying the same things agents in orange county california were telling us two years ago which is it cant happen here there is too much demand prices will never go down
8206384 july 2008 saw an actual 28 percent across the board decrease in orange county property values

8206632 some of the most common challenges faced by employers of international assignees are those regarding competitiveness of expatriate packages issues with different tax structures and of overall cost containment
8206633 companies of indian origin find themselves challenged by significant costs borne to offset international compensation inequity
8206634 for me its pretty steady continuous work and im kind of playing continuously even though its not necessarily a national tour or a publicity campaign im just playing all the time

8206658 i turn into another person while i am dancing traditional indian dance i feel that i am connected with the culture
8206659 once i even felt that i was connected with the gods
8206660 there are too many choices in hong kong and the pace is so fast that people forget things easily no one stops and looks around or thinks and looks inside their hearts
8206661 you can feel the connection between people and the gratitude that they have towards life but in this city you seem to forget the closeness among each other
8206662 some people think i am crazy but it seems that i have two identities one is ella a normal hongkonger which goes to work while the other identity is an indian who loves the culture and practices of the traditional indian dance and yoga
8206663 he told me that he was a mime artist at the local theatre mime group
8206664 teaching yoga is not easy but there are no politics to deal with i have more freedom and i can share my passion with others
8206665 rather than focusing on peoples faults and weaknesses we should appreciate others for what they are good at
8206666 i have learned how to detach myself in certain situations to have an objective view balance and compromise with different parties to work things out especially at the office

8206671 its from another era in our history and its time it had some new life and new meaning
8206672 this exhibition showcases the proposals for the future regeneration of omagh it presents an exciting and forward thinking set of proposals which offer a symbol of hope through regeneration to transform this historic county town to a vibrant area of which people can be proud
8206673 it is important that the people of omagh and the surrounding area take the opportunity to view these proposals and to share their views with us
8206674 this will ensure that the final documents will represent the views of the people who will be most directly affected by these developments
8206675 the visioning framework and town centre masterplan provide an ideal opportunity for us to plan together for the future development of omagh
8206676 i welcome the co ordinated approach between the department and council in this work and i look forward to its continued development in the weeks ahead
8206677 i was scared of my first match thats the first time ive felt pressure since the world championship
8206678 it was always going to be a tough match playing michael but i didnt expect to win 5 1
8206679 although it was 5 1 there were three frames decided on the black ball so winning them was massive
8206680 ive not had the heart going like that for a while you never forget it but when it comes back its quite scary you realise youre under some pressure
8206681 id love to retain my title here this year ive got so many fond memories of winning here last year
8206682 i know how difficult the player coach role can be and i think it was a very smart move for steve to want someone behind the bench this year
8206683 i think this will be a great year of hockey here in belfast and i hope i can add as much to the giants behind the bench as i did on the ice
8206684 ive known both todd and steve for a long time and i know we will work well together it should be a great year ahead for all of us
8206685 rob knows the game well and knows how to win something we did together here in belfast
8206686 i need someone behind the bench to see everything that i cant see when i am on the ice
8206687 i respect robs opinion and i trust his judgment in game situations and i know he is capable of implementing the systems we are putting together for the team this year
8206688 i dont know if someones going to raise it or not but being of sound mind is a condition of becoming president
8206689 his opponents may bring it up to attack mr zardari and submit a petition to the election commission
8206690 we are sad over nawaz sharifs decision we want to move together and solve the problems facing the nation
8206691 we will request nawaz sharif to return to the government
8206692 yes ive had another approach quite recently but im very happy just to be involved with tyrone
8206693 we did not think a few weeks ago that we would be bidding to book our place in the all ireland final and obviously we are delighted to be going in against wexford on sunday thats my only focus right now
8206694 i go out to do my best we shipped a bit of criticism at the start of the championship and maybe rightly so but we have gained in confidence we have had a few decent wins and now we want to take it to the next level against wexford
8206695 both of us were injured against westmeath my injury looked worse than it was but colm has had a frustrating time lately he is glad to be getting back into the groove
8206696 we were very pleased with the way we played against dublin but wexford is a new challenge
8206697 we have to be up for it and make sure we do the basics well
8206698 if i were this old man mugabe the events of this week would have convinced me that at 84 years old its now time to ride into the sunset and never re appear on the political scene again
8206699 many of us ruling party mps realise that fact and we will be aligning with the opposition
8206700 there have been a number of incidents this year that have left a lot to be desired
8206701 id say on reflection some of the players involved might feel embarrassed about that theres no point in saying otherwise im not getting into specific cases but players have a responsibility to each other
8206702 i smile when i hear people saying the gaa is trying to take the physicality out of the games thats nonsense over the last couple of weekends weve had some good physical encounters but at times stuff is creeping in we could frankly do without
8206703 its a proposal by the government to attract people outside the usual summer holiday period we are renowned for our sun and that sun shines all year round
8206704 they are ideas proposals at this early stage work in progress
8206705 then well be in a position to mount our international campaign for winter holidays in spain
8206706 the outlook is stormy theres nothing to indicate that the rest of the year will compensate for the fall in business that occurred in july
8206707 we need urgent measures to prevent us suffering the same fate as the construction industry big financial injections to reconvert our deteriorated tourist areas
8206708 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8206709 this is a difficult choice but it is the only chance to save peoples lives
8206710 russias decision today confirms that its invasion of georgia was part of a broader premeditated plan to redraw the map of europe
8206711 today the fate of europe and the free world is unfortunately being played out in my small country
8206712 i dont see how anyone can look at russia in the same way after this
8206713 mr saakashvili himself buried the territorial integrity of his country
8206714 national interests and considerations are much more important than saving the face of someone who has discredited himself
8206715 steve mcclaren is obviously a big fan of dick van dyke
8206716 he loves umbrellas and the dutch and the next step for the former england boss could be to change his name to help him in his new job as coach to fc twente
8206717 we were very happy with paddy no one has put in as big an effort as he has he won a national league title maybe this years championship wont be remembered as a great thing but he won a major title and i think a lot of people forget that
8206718 donnacha oconnor intimated to us that he would like to appeal the decision whenever a player wants to appeal a decision we stand by our players and help them
8206719 if there is any humanity and empathy in my work which i think there is i would rather owe it to her
8206720 in recognition of her sublime unparalleled voice and unique stylistic versatility
8206721 connoisseurs and the general public alike have been dazzled by the beauty of her soft and natural voice
8206722 its not fair that punters should be out of pocket because of dodgy judging decisions
8206723 after that fight we believed that anyone who backed kenny deserved to be paid and thats exactly what we have done
8206724 it may be costing us over 220 000 but in our eyes kenny is every part a champion and were treating him as one
8206725 this was simply an amazing game and it produced an equally amazing in running betting story for a football team to trade at 1 100 in running and fail to win is very rare indeed and almost unheard of in gaa betting
8206726 this is the biggest gaa betting story in years and those punters who backed the draw at 54 1 have good reason to celebrate backers of kerry had a nightmare
8206727 good news stories about media companies are rare at the moment however the group is pleased to announce significant growth in both turnover and pre tax profits in the first half of 2008
8206728 i am particularly pleased to report strong performances in both our radio and new media divisions
8206729 this is further indication that the groups decision to diversify away from a pure television offering was indeed the right one
8206730 this strategy has been key to protecting the group against the current market volatility and leaves us well placed to take advantage of opportunities arising from an upturn
8206731 with a strong management structure and clear strategic vision we are confident in the groups ability to deliver robust revenue and profit figures in the face of uncertain macro economic conditions

8206735 yes but he may need to work on energy and taxes two economic issues that have been the target of several recent mccain ads obama has a comfortable eight point edge on economic issues overall 51 to 43 percent
8206736 but the mccain ads may have come with a cost half the public thinks mccain has attacked his opponent unfairly while only a third feel that way about obama
8206737 neither candidate scores well on that measure and the conventions are the first and best chance to present clear solutions to current problems

8206748 this years rankings show that market events rather than just advertising alone can be critical drivers to brand websites

8206751 it is the view of west sussex county council that this approach makes no sense and will leave gatwick unfit for purpose for the olympic period and beyond
8206752 gatwick is going to be a major gateway into this country for the olympics second only to heathrow and we need a fast efficient and effective rail network to move people around it would be a major disappointment if we only get the concourse improvements before 2012
8206753 we need the track signalling and platform improvements for the long term future of gatwick as part of ensuring that its growth from 35 5 million passengers a year to a predicted 40 million by 2015 is as sustainable as possible
8206754 there are considerably fewer applications built into the iphone than you can find in a standard s60 phone that relative simplicity means that some feature focused users will decide not to use the device but the device taps into a new market that is arguably underserved by previous offerings this is the very considerable market of users who dont need every bell and whistle in feature packed smartphones

8206757 the retraction of the expropriation bill is proof of the power which civil society can exert when its organisations cooperate with each other
8206758 the expropriation bills stipulation that the expropriation amount may be less than the market value of the property and that market value will not be the determining factor would have deterred local as well as international investors had it been implemented
8206759 advice sought by the portfolio committee indicated that more time was needed to ensure that a wide variety of stakeholders had been consulted and that public participation may have been insufficient to see the bill through

8206765 who has actually done it killing of vhp leader laxmanananda saraswati or indulging in violence that followed we have to find out some people say this party or this section of society having this kind of ideology has done it let it be decided
8206766 i have been in contact with the chief minister of orissa and i have told him that the incident in which the swami was killed has to be condemned but it should not cause damage to others and it is the responsibility of the state government and all of us that different sections of society should not be attacked
8206767 unless and until it is proved who has done it acting against some section of society is wrong
8206768 after raj kumar sangwan got the arjuna award for boxing in the late 1990s a craze for the sport increased coming from a poor family it was one of the main avenues to get a job when we started in 1996 vijender was in class v and he joined the sports authority of india centre he has been fortunate to train under one coach from the beginning as jagdish singh was then coaching the sub juniors
8206769 my father is a driver haryana transport and at that time he did not have enough funds to provide us good facilities both of us used to go for boxing on one cycle and even shared a pair of gloves but things changed after i joined the army in 1998
8206770 the haryana government awarded him rs seven lakh for his achievement and he never looked back after that he has won medals in the asian games commonwealth games and now the olympics
8206771 you dont see such celebrations even in a marriage we have been endlessly attending to guests and the media and have not even slept properly for the last four to five days
8206772 this is the second occasion i am feeling the honour of being vijenders father when he got the arjuna award i had been to the rashtrapati bhawan that was a great moment in my life and so is this
8206773 after bindra won the gold medal i always thought may the almighty help vijender achieve the same glory thank god it has happened
8206774 he is a winner despite the defeat he has done something which no indian has ever done
8206775 boxing has given him so much he should not leave it rather he should try to win the gold next time i also feel the same for me i am ready to go on with life and drive vehicles as i used to do
8206776 i have fought against the system my detractors land mafia and other vested interests to come this far i believe that athletes who have the hunger for success can be nurtured into world champions with proper training
8206777 its purely on the basis of talent basically i look for students from lower middle class families i believe being deprived they have the spirit to excel in life they can go through the hardships to succeed in their mission
8206778 some senior boxers assist me besides athletics coach jagdish prasad takes care of the fitness part of the training we maintain a flexible schedule
8206779 i know this is not the infrastructure with which olympic gold winning boxers can be produced there is this five to 10 per cent difference between winning a bronze and a gold
8206780 i want to have all the modern facilities latest technical support the help of a nutritionist a library and cds of all top boxers and the development of boxing all this requires a lot of money recognition has started coming and i hope i will get some aid to build my dream centre
8206781 all the difficulties are coming to an end and i can see a new chapter waiting to open
8206782 all those who have done well in the olympics are good boxers

8206794 the government seems obsessed with fighting a losing battle to artificially prop up the housing market rather than finding ways to deal with its worst effects
8206795 ministers must act to help the thousands of families struggling to keep a roof over their heads
8206796 the government should allow councils and housing associations to buy up land as well as empty homes to help replenish britains much depleted stock of social housing
8206797 ministers must also tighten up repossession rules to ensure that peoples homes are only ever repossessed as a last resort
8206798 the government should introduce regulated mortgage rescue schemes under this arrangement families struggling to pay their mortgage could sell part of the equity in their home and rent it back from a housing association or private firm
8206799 these plans could be funded using money already committed to social housing but currently unspent because of the collapse of new building they would also save taxpayers the cost of re housing the homeless without going down the disastrous route of giving open ended guarantees for new mortgage lending
8206800 im delighted that we are able to demonstrate our commitment to regeneration not just in what we say but in what we do
8206801 this is also about the relocation of a major government agency to the north west bringing not just jobs but all the associated benefits to the local economy
8206802 i am delighted that all of the agencys 270 staff in manchester will soon move to modern well equipped offices located right at the heart of the city
8206803 close to regional stakeholders and ideally located for transport links these offices will offer a vastly improved working environment that will support real team working right across the agency
8206804 the tda already has close links with the north west where some of our largest and high quality teacher training providers are based
8206805 the interests of our staff are paramount and we are planning the move carefully to ensure business as usual we will maintain our service to all the people and organisations we work with and effect a smooth transition to our new location
8206806 manchester is a truly vibrant city and we look forward to sharing our new premises with the highways agency and government office for the north west
8206807 government agencies have had a strong presence in this part of the city centre since the 1960s so its great news that not only have they chosen to stay here but are enhancing their presence with the relocation of the tda from london
8206808 this expansion will inevitably bring new employment opportunities for local people and help sustain manchesters economy

8206825 i am very frustrated the investigation is not as advanced as i had hoped but i am extremely frustrated at the way the victims are being treated by the attorney general
8206826 he the attorney general tried to reprimand me for speaking out when two suspects were released without charge
8206827 the victims were ringing up and giving the victims liaison people a very hard time
8206828 i put a press release out to show it was not our position and try to recover some of the creditability i felt we had lost with the victims
8206829 the attorney general took exception to that and tried to reprimand me i was so angry
8206830 the attorney general and his office are scaring off witnesses the attorney general can be in no doubt that the victims in this case hold him in contempt i am not saying i do but the victims do
8206831 the job is not completely over it could finish in six months or it could take another two years but the investigation being carried out by jersey and uk police officers is first class and they will continue fighting for justice for the victims i am glad to be retired it has been difficult at times in jersey but i am also very sad at leaving behind the people i was working with
8206832 in the days before my retirement i was getting a huge number of messages from victims and members of the public
8206833 throughout this investigation i have had people pleading with me to keep on talking out and telling the truth
8206834 in fact i got a letter this morning from a man who lived on the island all his life and he said what a pleasure it was to see a truly professional police officer not being influenced by politicians in jersey like so many had before
8206835 i have had dozens of people approach me in the street as well
8206836 i recently went to a game at old trafford and outside at the turnstile someone tapped me on the shoulder and said you dont know me but i am from jersey and he shook my hand and wished me a long and healthy life
8206837 this sort of thing makes all the hassle and grief worthwhile

8206839 la empresa productora no ha cumplido con los procedimientos administrativos para manejar este tipo de eventos
8206840 es injusto que se frustre un concierto de rock efectuando la mala imagen del pa s y de todos los involucrados se ha iniciado ya un proceso legal por abuso de autoridad y da os y prejuicios contra la municipalidad de ate

8206843 a lot of our guys dream of getting into the movies but i think live sequences are harder because you only get one chance
8206844 but the training is very intense the skill level of these people is unbelievable these guys have to be committed you have to be very fit and dedicated and gutsy and a bit mad a lot of the guys get an adrenalin rush from knowing that they could break their necks
8206845 sometimes people will twist an ankle or break a leg if they land wrong but its the same if you are a gymnast
8206846 you have to remember there are only about 300 people in the country who make a living out of being a stuntman these are highly skilled people
8206847 you have to be an extrovert a team member and bit crazy
8206848 it can look dangerous but you have to remember that we are all trained and educated in this and know what were doing were not just messing around its all carefully co ordinated
8206849 my dad is very proud of what i do but my mum doesnt really approve
8206850 the incredible hulk is my first job with 2ma although ive been on the books for about six months its quite scary but im hoping it will add to the skills i have
8206851 its about giving children confidence and getting fit at the same time
8206852 its also about channelling their energy into something positive often children who are less academic can really excel at sports and workshops like this
8206853 the emphasis will be on fun but its not a free for all stunt work is a discipline just like gymnastics so there will be structure and discipline to what we are doing
8206854 when i got into the business in the early 80s there was nowhere to learn these sorts of things and noone to tell you the good and bad things about the industry
8206855 i hope the academy will be accessible to children from all walks of life and not just the families who can afford expensive fees for stage schools
8206856 hopefully some of the children who take part will find something that interests them and is challenging

8206867 nun sieht der dgb seine felle schwimmen und versucht mit einer gro angelegten pressekampagne die bundeskanzlerin politisch unter druck zu setzen und doch noch seinen mindestlohn f r die zeitarbeit zu erzwingen zu einem solchen vorgehen passt das alte sprichwort man erkennt die absicht und ist verstimmt da sommer weder ross und reiter nennen noch seine zahlenspielereien mit harten fakten belegen kann sollte sich die politik vom dgb nicht auf diese primitive art manipulieren lassen

8206871 sputtered strain gauge manufacturers sputter deposit a layer of glass onto the diaphragm sputtered strain gauge sensors actually from a molecular bond
8206872 gauge pressure is measured relative to ambient atmospheric pressure as shown in figure 3 similar to absolute pressure the abbreviations pag pascals gauge or psia pounds per square inch gauge are use to describe gauge pressure
8206873 a classic example of overloading a pressure sensor is known as the water hammer phenomenon this occurs when a fast moving fluid is suddenly stopped by the closing of a valve the fluid has momentum that is suddenly arrested which causes a minute stretching of the vessel in which the fluid is constrained this stretching generates a pressure spike that can damage a pressure sensor

8206924 dont wear cropped trousers with knee length boots they will fight for attention
8206925 short women should avoid them because the cut can broaden the figure and make legs look stumpy
8206926 make sure the hem brushes the ground so that only the shoes toe shows because this elongates the leg
8206927 by adding a pair of sturdy heels the legs will appear super long or for a mannish look like hepburns wear them with a pair of flat loafers brown leather loafers 125 russell amp bromley 020 7629 6903 or brogues
8206928 high waisted trousers are wonderful on tall or petite women with hourglass figures
8206929 but they should be avoided by pear shapes as they accentuate the hips and the waist
8206930 if you have the confidence to carry them off high waisted trousers look amazing with a tucked in blouse blue red cotton plaid blouse pictured 34 99 river island 020 8991 4759 or top
8206931 this draws attention to the waist and lengthens the leg alternatively wear a loose top and the trousers will have the same effect as control pants
8206932 they flatter the leg and bottom and create subtle curves

8206934 but curvy women should steer clear because skinnies accentuate curves
8206935 pair them with a voluminous top to play with proportions
8206936 add a pair of round toed pumps cream leather pumps pictured 85 for a classically smart look or a pair of heels or wedges for killer legs
8206937 they flatter taller women and drown small frames the loose cut at the top makes them ideal for anyone whos self conscious about their stomach but they should be avoided by those with big bottoms or thighs

8206948 asia is the biggest growth market for hospitality today and we have many active members from the region
8206949 at the same time technology in asia poses major challenges for global and regional hotel companies trying to meet the rapidly changing technology needs of asian hotel guests additionally many technology providers struggle to adapt their products and services to the nuances of asian markets making it more difficult for hotels to acquire what they need our first asia pacific conference will introduce the asian hospitality market to the processes and tools htng has used to address many of these problems
8206950 htng has had enjoyed great leadership from asia based hotel companies on its board of directors so we are able to put together a program that is largely by and for asia based hotel technologists and their vendors and that integrates the relevant work that htng has accomplished in north america and europe

8206954 the british sailors and windsurfers performances in china have been nothing less than amazing this is the third games in the row that they have topped the sailing medals table and immediately following ben ainslies third consecutive gold we experienced a massive rush of enquiries leading us to extend our season by a week to accommodate demand
8206955 these people create a situation whereby when the day comes and the agreements are signed on the lawn in washington it will be easier to give up this land which isnt really ours this land where not only the laws and landscape are different but also the people
8206956 reject ion all the basic values that hold us together
8206957 contempt for the law and refus al to accept the states authority

8206959 like many of us they would say boy when i can i would really like to live in one of these beautiful scenic areas
8206960 and as they get close to retirement they can fulfill those wishes
8206961 people come to the nice little mountain town so pretty soon guess what they want to live here or at least have a part time home

8206964 abm recognizing the enormous opportunities in todays global marketplace and its members needs is positioning itself to become the global b to b association
8206965 we are delighted to offer media members the opportunity to experience indias b to b community first hand much like we did in china in late 2006 bringing industry leaders together for a collective sharing of information ideas and challenges and we are thrilled to be working with both bpa worldwide and cross border media on this exciting indian venture abms journeys abroad support our strategic initiative to help our members grow globally and become the global business information association
8206966 given the economic vibrancy that is india and with the opening of media to foreign investment
8206967 there are great opportunities for foreign media firms in the b to b sector to collaborate with their counterparts in india we have been in contact with publishers in india interested in best business practices and sharing their experiences with peers in their b to b markets taking a delegation of our publishing members from around the globe who have an interest in doing business in india will result in precisely that as bpa worldwide is the largest global non profit organization tasked with auditing media in more than 30 countries our incoming indian publishers may have an interest in reciprocating and visiting other countries in which they may have an interest in expanding their brands
8206968 i am particularly impressed with the enthusiasm expressed by indian publishers who have pledged full support by way of sponsorships
8206969 in fact i see 2009 as a turning point in indias b to b publishing industry
8206970 regrettably durban ii is looking more and more like the original durban debacle of 2001
8206971 by failing to review the performance of african countries on racism and related intolerance the conference is ignoring its primary mission and squandering a golden opportunity to help africas many victims of racism and xenophobia
8206972 moreover the text fails to review the xenophobic attacks that recently broke out in south africa the leading organizer of the abuja meeting and the overall durban process where foreigners notably from zimbabwe and mozambique were targeted in may during a wave of anti immigrant attacks in which at least 62 were killed and tens of thousands were displaced
8206973 nor does the text review the ethnic crimes in kenya this year that killed 1 000 people displaced another 600 000 and burnt down 40 000 buildings in an outburst of tribal bloodletting millions of african victims of xenophobia present and future are ill served by the conferences grant of impunity for racial or ethnic crimes committed in african countries
8206974 inflexibly clinging to free speech in defiance of the sensitivities existing in a society and with absolute disregard for religious feelings
8206975 mirror efforts by islamic states at the un human rights council to insinuate islamic anti blasphemy prohibitions into international law yet un expert on religious freedom asma jahangir and other international human rights experts have expressly opposed defamation of religion resolutions which seek to alter international human rights law by defining religions instead of individuals as the bearers of rights
8206976 seeks to impose a hierarchy of religions placing adherents of islam above all others
8206977 this is contrary to the basic principles of equality enshrined in the un charter and the universal declaration of human rights and undermines the very premise of the global struggle against racism
8206978 reiterat ing its concern about the plight of the palestinian people under foreign occupations
8206979 why is a non african situation mentioned in a declaration about africa one that references neither sudans racist killings nor any other country in africa
8206980 the special reference to the palestinian issue implies that israel is practicing racism
8206981 portraying israels conflict as racial is more than political mischief its an attempt to dehumanize israelis and their supporters as uniquely evil we regret that african states today allowed the extreme political agenda of certain middle eastern governments to undermine their legitimate cause

8207013 we strongly believe that uranium mining could be an opportunity for our people to generate equity and commercial benefit and importantly play an important part in the development of significant resources projects for this state
8207014 legislating a ban becomes even more hypocritical when the prime minister apologises to the indigenous people of australia and overturns a long held ban on uranium mining due to it becoming obsolete
8207015 that is one reason why as a people we are exploring opportunities away from the government sector for us to play a pro active role in our future an opportunity we believe has been taken away from us by the premier yesterday

8207034 this new post will be aimed at creating sustainable reductions in anti social behaviour and importantly the fear of anti social behaviour
8207035 as the lead authority in staffordshire we need to keep tabs on what everyone else is doing and this officer will be the one to bring that together
8207036 this is good news and the council is totally committed to reducing anti social behaviour across the whole of the chase
8207037 people always think anti social behaviour is to do with young people but it can include noisy neighbours dog fouling and people driving around with car radios blaring late at night
8207038 what works in manchester doesnt work in rugeley and thats why we need someone locally who is dedicated to tackling anti social behaviour and can co ordinate what can be done about it

8207051 i would firstly like to thank allah for providing me with this great family this is a very hard decision for me to make as i feel that i could possibly play one more year but out of respect i would only do that if i felt 100 and i wouldnt want to risk that for the family
8207052 i am going to miss playing for the club greatly
8207053 i am truly honoured to have spent six wonderful years here
8207054 my love my feelings and my heart will always be with sussex and i will always pray to allah for continued success at sussex
8207055 mushtaqs legacy at the club is that he leaves us statistically romantically and emotionally the best player to ever pull on a sussex shirt
8207056 in view of the impact hes made its difficult to think of another cricketer who has achieved or done more for one county his legacy extends beyond the playing arena as im sure all that have been graced by his presence will agree he is simply a great man
8207057 i dont think that it will ever be possible to overplay the enormous influence mushtaq has had on sussex in recent years
8207058 his record as a player and the trophies that he has helped us win will speak for itself but i would like to pay tribute to him as a person from myself and all the people whose lives he has touched for the enormous influence he has had on us

8207085 harvey nichols has bought into leather trousers across the board this season
8207086 but our most popular pairs so far are the spray on les chiffoniers treggings 513 that have graced the legs of the ber cool including juliette lewis and mary kate olsen
8207087 the rock wardrobe is their heritage so wearing them with heels in an abigails party way can look really sloaney and uncool
8207088 the line cuts the leg horizontally and therefore shortens it
8207089 they look great with a long top or this seasons chunky knits beige merino wool cardigan pictured 260 my wardrobe com 0845 260 3880
8207090 dont wear cropped trousers with knee length boots they will fight for attention
8207091 short women should avoid them because the cut can broaden the figure and make legs look stumpy
8207092 make sure the hem brushes the ground so that only the shoes toe shows because this elongates the leg
8207093 by adding a pair of sturdy heels the legs will appear super long or for a mannish look like hepburns wear them with a pair of flat loafers brown leather loafers 125 russell amp bromley 020 7629 6903 or brogues
8207094 high waisted trousers are wonderful on tall or petite women with hourglass figures
8207095 but they should be avoided by pear shapes as they accentuate the hips and the waist
8207096 if you have the confidence to carry them off high waisted trousers look amazing with a tucked in blouse blue red cotton plaid blouse pictured 34 99 river island 020 8991 4759 riverisland com or top
8207097 this draws attention to the waist and lengthens the leg alternatively wear a loose top and the trousers will have the same effect as control pants
8207098 they flatter the leg and bottom and create subtle curves
8207099 but make sure they are long enough nearly touching the floor or they will look silly any shaped top looks good with them and this seasons blazer black pinstripe 45 by topshop 0845 121 4519 will work a treat
8207100 but curvy women should steer clear because skinnies accentuate curves
8207101 pair them with a voluminous top to play with proportions
8207102 add a pair of round toed pumps cream leather pumps pictured 85 frenchsole com for a classically smart look or a pair of heels or wedges for killer legs
8207103 they flatter taller women and drown small frames the loose cut at the top makes them ideal for anyone whos self conscious about their stomach but they should be avoided by those with big bottoms or thighs
8207104 wear with a pair of fabulous heels like a shoe boot or platform black patent peep toes pictured 465 yves saint laurent
8207105 and a structured jacket or a neat top will offset their looseness

8207110 parkinsons is a costly disease and places a huge burden on carers and society as a whole we need governments to realise that taking action to reduce this burden by ensuring people receive the best care and treatment available makes the most economic and social sense
8207111 there are nearly 1 2 million people living with parkinsons in europe and with an ageing population this figure is set to rise its time to address inequalities in care and treatment of the disease and improve the lives of those affected by parkinsons now and in the future
8207112 it always amazes me how parkinsons is so visible socially and yet seemingly invisible to society this is a ruthless condition and help is needed throughout europe this epda initiative is crucial we need to increase understanding we need to raise the profile we need people not just to see but to act

8207133 were not going to let an unsafe condition exist its just going to be slower

8207146 we are concerned about the fourth child needing dialysis at some point
8207147 its still a violation but its no longer an issue
8207148 we would not have taken action because we corrected it
8207149 i would tend to say they seem to do a sufficient job at maintaining their facility and protecting customers
8207150 a snapshot in time we all have bad days and we all have blips we tend to look at the big picture and at trends over time then if its consistently good but theres a blip what has changed
8207151 our deepest sympathies go out to mr ingles family additionally we remain concerned about our neighbors who have become ill from what appears to be the same illness
8207152 were not releasing that because it could be matched to individual cases
8207153 as soon as we get a confirmable situation we release it to the public
8207154 this condition can be permanent although that is fairly unusual
8207155 it is a back breaking loss said floridas luis gonzalez
8207156 youve got to give the braves some credit they seem to get big hits when they need them they rallied and escobar got a big hit
8207157 it was great we had a lot of fun tonight
8207158 we didnt have any pressure and thats the way we should play
8207159 is it high end condos on the upper floors and a gourmet italian market on the bottom floor no
8207160 were not a typical neighbor and im not going to pretend to be a typical neighbor
8207161 what happens when you bring in 20 individuals who have issues and how does it affect the neighborhood
8207162 nobody points at our buildings and says theres troys homeless shelter
8207163 barack obama understands that we must renew our commitment to the american story today
8207164 and the gateway is through a first rate education thats why barack obama wants to help our kids be ready to learn when they get to kindergarten by investing in early education thats why he wants to fix and fund no child left behind thats why he wants to better train and reward high performing teachers why he wants to emphasize more math and science preparation and why he wants to support the college ambitions of young people by helping them pay for it
8207165 but he is against fully funding no child left behind against fully funding head start against hiring more teachers and wants to abolish the department of education john mccain is just more of the same say one thing do another crowd in the white house today
8207166 to rebuild our national community to focus not on the things that tear us apart but on those that bring us together not on the right or the left but the right and wrong
8207167 david axelrod knows the governor hes seen him in action and he knows there are probably few people out there who can articulate barack obamas vision better than deval patrick
8207168 ive been at a couple of events with him this week with people who have been doing this for a long time and deval described himself as an
8207169 im not going im not going i am not going to washington
8207170 obviously our voters found that the current funding source the 2 payment on their utility bills is the one that they prefer at this time instead of a property tax
8207171 more importantly to our residents i think it just means that we will have to more gradually implement some more advanced medical capabilities within our fire department
8207172 we take no comfort in the fact that theres no big increase in poverty
8207173 it should be going down since the year that the census report captures is presumably the last year of an economic expansion
8207174 the single largest most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
8207175 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
8207176 this case shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
8207177 consumers companies and governments from around the world must further develop ways to protect our sensitive personal and business information and detect those whether here or abroad who conspire to exploit technology for criminal gain
8207178 il segreto del canto risiede tra la vibrazione della voce di chi canta ed il battito del cuore di chi ascolta
8207179 the data in this report refer to last year when everything was different
8207180 this year were losing jobs on a monthly basis inflation is running well over 5 percent and unemployment was last seen at 5 7 percent and rising
8207181 in 2007 at least 26 states made efforts to expand coverage but as the economy has turned downward so have state efforts
8207182 the fall in private insurance was similar to recent years
8207183 that fall was offset by the rise in government insurance
8207184 states such as massachusetts have also played an important role in stemming the rising tide of uninsured and thanks to their health reform law they now have one of the lowest uninsured rates
8207185 but 45 7 million uninsured people are far too many and we need a national solution to this crisis
8207186 with more current data we would see that the type of the poverty that we see among latinos has actually already spread to the general population
8207187 working households helped bake a bigger economic pie but ended up with thinner slices
8207188 a national program would be the best way to do it
8207189 most other states and some of the territories have been more successful and committed to serving children

8207191 most wealthy people know that additional money beyond a fairly modest income yields little additional happiness
8207192 the financial habits of people who believe money equals happiness stand in the way of achieving that happiness

8207195 nuestras tropas entraron en georgia para destruir bases desde donde se lanz el ataque y despu s se marcharon restablecimos la paz pero no pudimos calmar los temores y aspiraciones de los osetas y abjasos
8207196 puede imaginarse lo que fue para los abjasos ver cerrada su universidad de sujumi por el gobierno de tiflis bajo el argumento de que supuestamente no ten an una lengua adecuada o una historia o cultura por lo que no necesitaban una universidad
8207197 argumentamos constantemente que ser a imposible despu s de esto decirle a los abjasos y osetas y decenas de otros grupos en todo el mundo que lo que era bueno para los albano kosovares no era bueno para ellos en las relaciones internacionales no se puede tener una regla para unos y otra para otros

8207207 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
8207208 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
8207209 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
8207210 id say i believe in what i believe in and im willing to fight for it and im pretty feisty

8207221 after watching hillary clintons speech tonight i am truly sorry not to see hillary running in this election she portrays the knowledge of americas struggles today and knows how to convey it to the american people speaking on topics of health care rising prices and an economy in stress she knows where america is hurting being a democrat myself i am listening closely to her words time to unite and if a change is going to happen it is my duty to help make that change
8207222 hillary makes an effort to come across with sincerity on stage but i feel behind the stage she and bill are holding back their animosity michelle obama seems to be eyeing hillary with suspicion
8207223 hillary provided an excellent example of grace professionalism and complete teamwork
8207224 i like how she is respectful to mccain calling him a friend and giving a nod to his service
8207225 hillary clinton spoke of how important it is for the party to unite and elect barack obama she spoke of how far our country has come her mother was born before women could vote and now her daughter was able to vote for her for president she really hit home telling voters to think of their own children and grandchildren when they go to cast their votes have hope and faith in our nation
8207226 i appreciated that hillary posed the question to her followers of who they were really supporting during her bid for the presidency it reminded us that we all have a duty to vote based on the issues and not on rhetoric or personality although hillarys speech tonight was bittersweet for some of her supporters it signified a new direction they must take to unify the democratic party
8207227 i found senator clintons speech to be energetic and unifying although there was a bit of a swan song going on she did a good job of unofficially handing the torch to obama i thought she did a great job speaking better than i had heard in the past it could not have been easy for her to stand up there as a speaker not the nominee she did her job with grace and style
8207228 what a thunderous welcome her message to disappointed followers of their marching orders was powerful
8207229 hillary reminded us all to think about why we got so involved in this election we must think about the men and women in iraq and bring them home responsibly we must fight for equal pay for equal work and the people working for minimum wage and trying to raise a family for health care for people like the woman who is fighting cancer while raising two children that have autism we must remember that allowing mccain to win means allowing these people to continue to fall through the cracks and be forgotten
8207230 kate does not know the plaintiffs and has never met with them or spoken with them
8207231 her representatives believe that the claims are baseless and without merit and they intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit
8207232 my superiors were not happy the local bishop was not happy but they did not understand me either
8207233 now no one is saying that nuns cant be beautiful but i was thinking about something more complete
8207234 and i worry that jim eschs plan to increase taxes on small businesses and middle income families is going to not only hurt families but it is going to exacerbate this economic slowdown
8207235 its convenient for lee terry jr to talk about the extension of the tax cuts but he has never come out with a plan to pay for the tax cuts apparently the 4 6 trillion in national debt that has accumulated over terrys 10 years in congress isnt of concern to him
8207236 almost every day we have a line outside our building for emergency assistance for rent and utilities help and food
8207237 these are virtually all families with children and this is just a way to keep them from becoming homeless
8207238 ive never even used public transportation before we were just regular middle class people
8207239 i just got off the phone with a single mother who is living in her car
8207240 she has a job but she doesnt make enough to get an apartment and i want to cry because i dont have a place to help this woman
8207241 i dont think anybody who has been following the current economic news is expecting the poverty rate to go down
8207242 to unite with a single party with a single purpose
8207243 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win together
8207244 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8207245 tonight i ask you to remember what a presidential election is really about when the polls have closed and the ads are finally off the air it comes down to the american people and your lives and your childrens futures
8207246 we are going to unite and work on the things that are important to democrats family and children energy and health care
8207247 she is saying the right things and she is genuine
8207248 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead
8207249 millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8207250 it was a forced marriage but were all getting along
8207251 those saying im not ready to make nice to those who say we have to unify now
8207252 it was nice to hear her directly distinctly and empathetically throw her support behind barack obama
8207253 i support senator obama as the nominee i supported what hillary did in the primaries
8207254 ok so she didnt become an astronaut but she did reach for the stars
8207255 because of her theres 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling that gave way and what opened up is a whole new world of possibility for all of us
8207256 we simply cant drill our way to energy independence even if you drilled in all of john mccains backyards
8207257 weve got two families where the mom and the dad were released with ankle bracelets

8207332 i want everyone to understand one thing todays russian step is totally illegal with no legal consequences either for georgia or the rest of the world
8207333 today yesterday and in recent weeks russia made unimaginable strategic mistakes and struck an unimaginable blow to its place in the international community and in the history of the contemporary world
8207334 now georgia has gained huge international support and solidarity from all over the world and support for our territorial integrity and we would have failed to gain such huge support even if we had tried for 200 years if not for the mistakes made by russia
8207335 the end of the revival of russias imperialism has started today in georgia
8207336 accelerate georgias integration into nato in order to prevent a reoccurrence of past mistakes
8207337 the territorial integrity and borders of georgia must be respected just as those of russia or any other country russias action only exacerbates tensions and complicates diplomatic negotiations
8207338 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the six point agreement
8207339 in accordance with united nations security council resolutions that remain in force abkhazia and south ossetia are within the internationally recognized borders of georgia and they must remain so
8207340 i can assure you that these are purely humanitarian aid shipments that are going into georgia and nothing else
8207341 very clear to the russians what the purpose of the u s military is in georgia and we are not anticipating any problems with our ability to deliver humanitarian assistance
8207342 the united states and some european capitals are promising mikheil saakashvili nato defense and are calling for the re arming of the regime in tbilisi and have already started new arms deliveries to him
8207343 the idps who have fled the georgian villages in the buffer zone next to the south ossetian border told unhcr staff that they have made the decision to leave due to massive harassment by ossetian militias in the past two days they claimed that the number of ossetian militia in the georgian villages and the brutality of their attacks have increased considerably since sunday 24 august

8207364 bbc programme makers and reporters decide what and how stories are reported there is absolutely no truth in any implication that the bbc compromised editorial independence
8207365 the programme was commissioned a long time ago we would not be in the position of having our editorial decisions prompted by people outside the organisation
8207366 we are pushing this material to uk media channels eg a bbc radio programme exposing tensions between aq leadership and supporters and a restricted working group will communicate niche messages through media and non media
8207367 said imam also known as dr fadl is seen as the godfather of jihadi thought leadership drew on his edicts for years but last november he published a devastating treatise that drew on islamic law and jurisprudence to argue that resorting to violence is banned and so was rebelling against a muslim ruler he writes to young muslims urging them to turn away from recruiters
8207368 as part of our counter terrorism strategy we are constantly looking at new ways to tackle terrorism and extremism
8207369 the effect of the prevailing macro economic environment has been a vast detriment to a host of companies and as a result of the aforementioned conditions along with other market variables we find our own share value at its lowest levels despite these conditions we have maintained our operational integrity while simultaneously feeding our growth requirements and engaging new prospects we are continually seeing opportunities for growth but we must maintain a stringent diligence in order to manage the delicate balance of financing that growth while maintaining a strict adherence to shareholder value it is our belief that becoming a reporting company and trading on a larger more prominent exchange will provide the liquidity and the breadth to achieve this aim we have already implemented the beginning stages of this process and will be making future announcements pertaining to our progress
8207370 we also look forward to making future announcements relating to additional retail locations for our existing clientele
8207371 we pride ourselves on delivering personalized patient care second to none
8207372 we believe the tone is set with the patients very first call and in a medical situation people will always be more comfortable dealing with a person thats why reaching a person right up front rather than a recorded message is so very important providing superior personalized service and fostering enduring patient relationships is one of our core strategies
8207373 no environment is more critical than healthcare when it comes to making sure calls are handled promptly efficiently and with personal care and attention
8207374 weve designed a solution for carolinas healthcare with this absolute priority top of mind
8207375 our high grade minto copper gold mine continues to generate strong financial results
8207376 recognizing that there is an approximate three month lag between metal production and the related financial return we generated cash flow from mining operations i of 21 4 million in the second quarter and 38 3 million in the first six months of 2008 given that copper production totalled 12 8 million pounds in the second quarter and that there will be two concentrate shipments in the third quarter as compared to one in each of the first two quarters we are well positioned to deliver a strong set of third quarter results
8207377 going forward we expect to achieve our objective of 55 million pounds of copper production in 2008 and to benefit from 1 lower unit operating costs as mill throughput is sustained at or above design levels 2 head grades increase into the fourth quarter as fresh high grade ore is accessed following the current pushback in the open pit and 3 lower energy costs as we connect to lower cost grid power in 2009 we are targeting production of 70 million pounds of copper as a result of a sustained period of processing high head grades and we complete our phase 3 expansion to 3 200 tpd of mill throughput
8207378 we have developed a method that enables us to visualise fingerprints even after the print itself has been removed
8207379 for the first time we can get prints from people who handled a cartridge before it was fired wiping it down washing it in hot soapy water makes no difference and the heat of the shot helps the process we use
8207380 the procedure works by applying an electric charge to a metal say a gun or bullet which has been coated in a fine conducting powder similar to that used in photocopiers
8207381 even if the fingerprint has been washed off it leaves a slight corrosion on the metal and this attracts the powder when the charge is applied so showing up a residual fingerprint
8207382 the technique works on everything from bullet casings to machine guns even if heat vaporises normal clues police will be able to prove who handled a particular gun

8207384 biologists have known that in these beetles there is an investment trade off between secondary sexual characters and primary sexual characters
8207385 as horns get bigger copulatory organs get smaller or vice versa what was not known was how frequently and how fast this can occur in nature and whether this can drive the evolution of new species
8207386 in terms of the integrity of a species its important for these things not to change too much
8207387 so there is a lot of evidence suggesting that within species or within the populations of species natural selection maintains genital characters but if these primary sex characters are linked to other characters that can change readily then youve got what we think is a very exciting mechanism that could prime populations for reproductive isolation
8207388 if this is all it takes to change genitalia it may be easier to make new species than we thought

8207394 i am continuously amazed at how few resources we put towards the brain when it is the most complex organ in the human body we are murdering ourselves more than others yet we hide it under the rug shadowed by shame what is happening that is making us turn against ourselves
8207395 we spend billions on wars across the globe and i wonder when we are going to spend that kind of money finding peaceful resolutions to the wars going on in the mind depression has taken the lives of many way too early wasted so many good years for others and it is time we understand why and encourage people to get treatment so they can improve the lives of all

8207426 he has been killed police have recovered his body and are trying to bring it down from the top of the mountain
8207427 we must not waste itos efforts i believe we should continue our activities

8207435 if spending on healthcare alone determined health outcomes glasgow would be the healthiest place in britain and wokingham the least healthy
8207436 resource allocation within the nhs the review of which should have been published last year and wasnt and then in july but wasnt has put measures of deprivation income support and attendance allowance up alongside age as a determinant of health need leading to corresponding greater resources for poorer areas and less for areas that are less deprived and more elderly this is despite age being a more significant determinant of relative burden of disease there is a fundamental flaw in this it treats the differences in health outcomes as if they were all the result of differences in access to nhs services
8207437 we therefore have a huge postcode lottery in access to nhs services but we dont have the resources needed behind public health measures in the most deprived areas
8207438 he has been killed police have recovered his body and are trying to bring it down from the top of the mountain
8207439 its the worst thing that could possibly happen its what we hoped would never happen
8207440 we must not waste itos efforts i believe we should continue our activities
8207441 both sides indicated that discussions regarding an accommodation have resumed
8207442 the court once again urges the political branches to resolve this dispute without further recourse to the judicial branch
8207443 were reviewing the order and will respond at the appropriate time
8207444 i dont think we can continue with the schizophrenic view that we have today sort of part public company part private company where the leaders of the company do well when things are going well but then the government and the public and the taxpayer has to bail them out when it goes bad
8207445 the fact is that we have to have a clear definition of what the mission of freddie and fannie is and if it is to serve the public than it ought to be owned by the public where the risk and rewards are controlled by the public

8207449 turning the house upside down adding weight to it and shaking it
8207450 we are extremely encouraged by the results of the aza 001 trial which for the first time showed that survival could be extended for patients with higher risk mds
8207451 roughly 30 percent of patients diagnosed with mds will progress to acute myeloid leukemia aml but treatment with vidaza significantly delays this progression vidaza not only has great survival data in mds but can also prevent progression to aml
8207452 worldwide avian flu control efforts have been mostly successful but like seasonal influenza avian flu changes year to year creating new subtypes and strains that could easily and quickly spread among humans
8207453 vlps may be advantageous over other vaccine strategies because they are easy to develop produce and manufacture
8207454 using recombinant technologies within ten weeks we could generate a vaccine most effective towards the current circulating strain of virus making it a cost effective counter measure to the threat of an avian influenza pandemic
8207455 antioxidants sit within this tiny trojan horse protecting it from attack from digestive juices in the stomach
8207456 once in the small intestine the nanoparticle gets sticky and bonds to the intestinal wall it then leaks its contents directly into the intestinal cells which allows them to be absorbed directly into the blood stream
8207457 we hope that by mastering this technique drugs and supplements also vulnerable to the digestive process can be better absorbed by the human body
8207458 for catechins the class of antioxidants under examination and among the most potent dietary antioxidants only between 0 1 and 1 1 per cent of the amount consumed makes it into our blood if we can improve that rate the benefits are enormous
8207459 if there is a real commitment to protect all children then supporting families and children before they reach the point of being abused and neglected should be a priority
8207460 we already know many of the risk factors for child abuse and neglect and in many cases we could identify many children who are most vulnerable before theyre even born
8207461 the current approach does little to prevent abuse but focuses on intervening once much of the harm has already been done an approach that in my view is both unethical and inhumane
8207462 while urgent action is needed to protect children being abused and neglected we need to broaden adult focussed services such as alcohol and drug treatment mental health corrections homelessness family violence etc so that they can enhance the parenting of their clients
8207463 we also need to use health promotion campaigns with messages such as alcohol and children dont mix given that one in eight australian children now lives in a household with at least one adult who is regularly binge drinking
8207464 child abuse and neglect needs to be attacked in the same comprehensive way we have tackled other serious health issues such as smoking or coronary heart disease that is to identify the risk factors promote a range of interventions and change community attitudes
8207465 if we keep the current approach with its heavy emphasis on the crisis end of the scale then we will never see these rates reduce while we must look after the children who have been abused we must do much more to stop it happening to others
8207466 the debate on when and how to treat early parkinsons disease patients has been ongoing currently treatment would typically be initiated when symptoms have caused disability however providing the medical evidence for a treatment to retard or prevent the progression of pd is a major therapeutic priority and the proud study aims to shed more light into this question pramipexole was considered an optimal candidate for this study due to evidence suggesting possible benefits to pd patients beyond treating the well known core symptoms based on the unique technique used in this study proud may provide a major breakthrough in our understanding of early pd treatment which would offer hope to the ever increasing number of patients diagnosed with parkinsons disease
8207467 previously the prodest study identified that pd related depressive symptoms are common with nearly half of those pd patients receiving anti depressants continuing to experience depressive symptoms these symptoms impact significantly on quality of life both for pd patients and their carers the new european study aims to provide answers on the role pramipexole may play in managing these commonly experienced pd related depressive symptoms that are often under recognised and consequently under treated
8207468 the survey reveals there are some big unheard messages these kind of data help us to quantify the differences between countries and to highlight where additional efforts are needed some of these countries have rarely had any population survey data to help their programme planning efforts
8207469 we know that people need to be given a reason why they should change they need to be shown how to change they need to be given resources or support to change they need to remember to change and they need positive reinforcement for changing many of these principles can be applied in designing education programmes to encourage and support behaviour change
8207470 further studies should target underlying biologic and socioeconomic factors to explain these differences
8207471 indicates that early palauans were of normal size and that their physical characteristics are well within the variation seen in modern human populations
8207472 if a group of small bodied humans was to evolve in an island environment it would likely require the population to be isolated for tens of thousands of years which was not the case in palau
8207473 particularly intriguing are the unusual categories of vocalizations and the more frequent loud harmonics evident in the btbr t tf j btbr mouse model of autism that may resemble the atypical vocalizations seen in some autistic infants
8207474 we hypothesize that ultrasonic vocalizations may be a measure of social communication in mice delayed reduced or unusual ultrasonic vocalizations in mice could offer a useful assay with reasonable face validity to the second diagnostic symptom of autism impaired communication
8207475 obvious customers for medical tourism are the uninsured who have to pay the entire cost of their care
8207476 g ood foreign facilities offer many common treatments at 15 of the u s price
8207477 the attraction is obvious and not just to patients without coverage
8207478 some u s employers who cover their workers now pay for treatments abroad
8207479 this is nothing less than the globalization of medical care
8207480 economists used to say that health care was the one thing that couldnt be outsourced
8207481 it means they had better get cracking on supporting a national health care system that insures everyone and controls costs
8207482 c learly they no longer have a monopoly hold on the u s consumer
8207483 the medical interests are already lobbying their elected officials to make it harder for americans to seek medical care in other lands for the good of patient safety of course
8207484 weve already seen the drugmakers try to stop americans from getting cheaper prescriptions from canada and mexico this doesnt work when the price differentials are enormous
8207485 the wiser path is to offer american consumers a better deal and let the cost of travel give domestic providers a competitive advantage
8207486 most patients would rather have medical treatment close to home anyway
8207487 we need a whole new approach and we need to act now
8207488 our research shows that many of the worlds existing no take areas are in the wrong place
8207489 new protected zones are needed that focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
8207490 coral dies when it is put under stress so what we need to be doing is reducing the direct human impact such as over fishing pollution and sedimentation across the whole area
8207491 by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
8207492 this provides the key to conserving coral reefs in the face of climate change
8207493 we are not suggesting that we scrap the existing ntas in terms of protecting fish stocks they have been quite successful
8207494 but they are not effective against global warming and in order to ensure the long term survival of this rich marine community that is what we need to address
8207495 the mean brain volume in preterm infants with abnormal blood flow distribution was 45 millilitres smaller than in other preterm infants
8207496 we examined tissue samples from preterm placentas and classified them according to the amount of inflammation found in microscopic examinations inflammatory reactions were seen in 45 per cent of the placentas
8207497 a genotype causing strong inflammatory response increases the risk of placental inflammation but on the other hand protects the child against inflammation our preliminary findings suggest that genetic regulation of interleukin 6 is also associated with the volume of the deep gray matter of the brain
8207498 in order for us to create treatments that can help protect the development of the brain its essential that we systematically follow up the development of preterm infants this should always be an integral part of the care of preterm infants

8207509 this was the first time weve organized a jaripeo and we are pleased with the event as a whole

8207512 painting gave me joy and took my mind off of what was going on

8207519 my kids ate my lunches i made lots of little cut up fruits and crunchy vegetables
8207520 id put the frozen peas from a bag in a little cup and by the time my kids got to school and lunch time was there they loved them
8207521 they could eat them with their fingers little kids love this sort of thing
8207522 cookies are good but not every day make it special and oatmeal cookies are good they dont have to be overly sweet to be good
8207523 make it happy for the kids and they will eat it
8207524 dont fill the lunch bags or boxes with sugar give your kids fruits and vegetables and they will get used to it its so bad to send a packed lunch full of nothing but sugar
8207525 keep it simple make sure you get some healthy foods into the lunch box put in a tomato and use whole wheat bread
8207526 you can add carrots to a peanut butter sandwich kids will love the crunch and you should take advantage of this
8207527 mix fruit juice with soda water and it tastes better and if your child grows up with this they will like it milk is always good too soda is addictive and has nothing positive in it for growing kids
8207528 kids like little things stringy cheese is fine as are frozen grapes
8207529 i think if you plan ahead and make a list you can provide your children with great lunches to take to school ones they will love

8207537 i never make my own lunch at home no time i sleep in as long as i can before i have to take the bus i have to get up before 6 a m
8207538 sometimes i buy lunch at school but mostly i bring my own my dad makes it for me i love peanut butter and jelly and peanut butter and butter actually i always have a peanut butter pop which is a spoon of peanut butter

8207611 you mean that the us did not say that in exchange for deploying the x band system israel needs to receive us permission to attack iran

8207613 will send a message to iran that israel has powerful political support from its ally against any iranian threat
8207614 if the israeli government makes the difficult decision that it must launch a preemptive attack against iran that is when israel will need its allies the most and that is when the us will be called in to show what it means to have us as an ally

8207760 during everyday life we constantly evaluate social behavior and this largely affects how we feel about ourselves and other people
8207761 but the way we store and use information about our own and other peoples social behavior are not well understood

8207763 the most distinctive feature of depressive disorders is an exaggerated negative attitude to oneself which is typically accompanied by feelings of guilt
8207764 now that we understand how the brains of healthy individuals respond to feelings of guilt we hope to be able to better understand why and where there are differences in brain activity in people suffering from or prone to depression
8207765 the brain region we have identified to be associated with proneness to guilt has been shown to be abnormally active in patients with severe depression in several previous studies but until now its involvement in guilt had been unknown
8207766 by translating these basic cognitive neuroscience insights into clinical research we now have the potential to discover new key functional anatomical characteristics of the brain that may lie behind depressive disorders
8207767 the results will hopefully make an important contribution to our understanding of the causes of depression that will ultimately allow new approaches to find better treatments and prevention

8207841 we are condemning first the hijacking of a civilian aeroplane and we are now in continuous contact and consultation with the libyan authorities in kufra airport
8207842 it is not clear whether there is one or more or whether they belong to abdul wahid were not expecting him to say yes
8207843 we dont have any relation with that hijacking civilians theyre angry theyll behave like that they may agree with abdul wahid but in our structure we have no decision like this to hijack a civilian airplane
8207844 the hijackers claim to have coordinated with him nur to join him in paris
8207845 we categorically deny the responsibility of our movement in this hijacking operation
8207846 no one declared responsibility for the hijacking all the rebels until now denied the operation
8207847 i have seen four or five dvds of uzbekistan at the moment so for me it is not a big surprise anymore
8207848 for the players probably yes but we will have enough time to prepare for the game
8207849 i have always said that quality wise we are one of the best teams in asia it is about circumstances it is about the trips we have to make and this time we will be well prepared
8207850 we have to find out how the circumstances are when we arrive in tashkent
8207851 the china and middle east games we had to play under difficult circumstances so i am not so worried about that
8207852 it can never be worse than it was in dubai and qatar last june so the players will go there and adapt quite soon they will be ready
8207853 this slows down decision cycles constricts the passage of information in an age of email and blackberries and the sharing of lessons learned so we need to address this situation
8207854 training and structuring for high level combined arms warfighting provides a crucible for the growth of highly developed leadership skills and adaptation mechanisms
8207855 no other form of training hones these essential components of land forces for contemporary operations to such high levels
8207856 these skills provide the essential foundation for all types of operations that we may undertake
8207857 these measures will ensure army is better able to contribute to the conduct of joint operations and do so in a manner that balances our current commitments with preparations for the future

8207870 the trouble is im a college student and not an affluent one
8207871 and i simply do not have the time energy or resources to fight this battle right now theres a point at which i am willing to give up and be practical to let the world have its way with that ever mistreated little ideal of principle

8207876 unlike the last time we went to the moon everybody is going to the moon now there are at least a dozen proposals i know of from various countries to go to the moon
8207877 this is going to open a new era of scientific understanding of not just the moon and the formation of the earth moon system but how we can live on another world
8207878 of the moon on the moon and from the moon
8207879 i think the way to sell it is that were going to the moon as a step beyond
8207880 the other is that the moon is an interesting enough place to stay as well people talk about exit strategies on the moon to touch base leave and go to mars i think thats dumb
8207881 if we can work in antarctica for 50 years and still want to go back and do more the moon also is at least as interesting as antarctica
8207882 theres still a lot of science to be done on the moon its a natural world with natural complexity
8207883 were never going to have a long term 50 year plus research base on mars if we cant figure out how to do that on the moon so lets figure out how to do it on the moon
8207884 the moon is hot or cool depending on what your generation is
8207885 but i dont think we have to go sell the moon i think it sold itself
8207886 but im here to tell you its not your fathers oldsmobile
8207887 with humans going back the lunar environment needs to be studied and studied well
8207888 if i were a betting man i would say the lunar program is here to stay
8207889 ive been trying to get nasa to adopt a mission statement of why were going to the moon not six themes not 182 different sub goals
8207890 were going to the moon to learn the skills we need to live and work productively on another world
8207891 my goal is to provide an alternative not to free the mac os
8207892 what we want to do is to provide an alternative an option its not that people dont want to use mac os many people are open to the idea but theyre not used to spending an exorbitant amount of money on something that is essentially generic hardware
8207893 psystar argues that its opencomputer product is shipped with a fully licensed unmodified copy of mac os x

8207895 i was just fascinated with the amount of waste that was going into every one of those homes
8207896 not to mention all the different crews that had to go into the process of construction itself
8207897 i have a 3 200 square foot home and my electric bill runs about 130 a month
8207898 i just dont believe we can afford to cut down anymore trees for houses
8207899 this is very nice because it is standard masonry and thats done around the world but a majority of the frame homes in united states use a different skill set

8207903 it was to be expected that the leipzig trade fair would try to keep the topic in its 2009 program as well by announcing its date
8207904 but they will have to do it without the industry for the most part the lead trade fair will take place in cologne in 2009 and beyond
8207905 from leipzig we are bringing the clear message that the games industry will be exhibiting in 2009 in cologne at gamescom we have met with broad approval and the industry is looking forward to gathering in cologne whatever happens in germany in 2009 outside of cologne cannot claim to represent this sector
8207906 today the ministry cancelled all opening bands for avril including us one buck short as we are immoral someone please fix our industry before it goes down the drain with idiots like these sic a guy who won an islamic singing competition in the states will now open for avril we wish him the best of luck rahul

8207990 we are greatly encouraged by our findings because the nearly half of the children on the diet were either able to maintain healthy cholesterol or gradually metabolized the extra fat and returned to somewhat normal cholesterol levels
8207991 this means the benefits of the diet a diet that is lifesaving in many children and therapeutic in most of them continue to outweigh the risks

8208027 the economic environment continued to negatively impact mobile phones sales in both mature and emerging markets
8208028 consumers in mature markets continued to favour mid tier devices over high end devices while new subscribers continued to join mobile networks in emerging markets during the quarter however replacement sales remained weak as consumers faced higher prices for fuel and food in addition to higher levels of inflation despite this we remain positive that mobile phone sales in 2008 will reach 1 28 billion units
8208029 we expect samsungs sales to remain strong in the second half of 2008 as new products such as the omnia pick up momentum
8208030 our confidence in an improved performance by sony ericsson weakened further as recent product announcements were disappointing since they delivered similar current features and designs
8208031 net new cellular connections declined significantly operators added more than 83 million connections in the first quarter of 2008 but they added only 75 million in the second quarter of 2008 this drop negatively impacted sales of mobile devices in the second quarter of 2008
8208032 in addition high food prices and inflation also had a negative impact on sales of replacement mobile handsets
8208033 the economy in several countries has slowed down and the region saw slower than expected replacement sales as consumers dealt with the higher cost of living despite these unfavourable conditions operators and handset vendors continue to target areas with low penetration in the commonwealth of independent states and west africa
8208034 this drop is twice as much as last quarter and it was the result of a lack of new phone features that were compelling enough to drive growth
8208035 the performance this quarter was below expectations mainly due to strong growth in the first quarter of 2008 and slightly weaker demand in the second quarter of 2008 generating higher levels of inventory as vendors did not fully materialise sales
8208036 despite industry concerns over the economic downturn handset sales were strong up 5 3 quarter on quarter
8208037 new subscribers were limited during the quarter as growth continued to be dominated by replacement sales
8208038 however the market was up 16 per cent quarter on quarter the region reached a penetration rate of 121 5 per cent in the first half of 2008 demonstrating that there is a strong dependence on replacement sales as a driver in this market
8208039 economic conditions remained challenging during the quarter although some vendors and operators felt this more than others with sony ericsson continuing to feel the strain and vodafone sales being affected by delays in new devices availability and slower replacement sales

8208052 if we dont have any money for new programs to do the kind of outreach to the homeless that we need to do and to have public restrooms available and to do all those types of things weve got to do something different
8208053 a lot of times it might look like junk to us but if its their only blanket thats not junk to somebody who has to sleep outside in the cold
8208054 its not fair to give somebody a ticket for something they cant do anything about
8208055 im sympathetic to the plight of the homeless but before pledging support for any of these proposals i would like to see specifics because it looks like something that affects the quality of life for not only the community affected but the broader community as well

8208062 part of it is political parties are a distant analog to families and you really hate to step outside a family environment
8208063 there have been many of us frustrated with the party because of the abandonment of the principles we believed the party stood for
8208064 republicans of today are nothing like the republicans who founded that party
8208065 barack obama should be talking about that fact and suggesting that he is the candidate that people who appreciate the old republican values should be supporting
8208066 when we see several redundant crossings where it would make pedestrian and vehicle traffic safer
8208067 its hard to imagine a grid of streets connecting the city across the isthmus getting closed
8208068 it goes against all our thinking about connections and getting around
8208069 if you cant get across the isthmus without going downtown that seems not very urban friendly
8208070 i dont think its necessarily a bad idea but i dont know if its a good idea
8208071 we may have to lose a little to gain a bit
8208072 its an idea that makes sense its an idea that likely would have a lot of support
8208073 but if the public participation process is not complete there will be challenges none of us needs that
8208074 although we could if we chose to were choosing a coordinated comprehensive approach with the city and the railroad commission to address safety in the entire east corridor
8208075 if we are convinced the plan would increase public safety and reduce trespassing
8208076 we have smart active engaged people here who can help they need to be embraced
8208077 you look at the things the city does and were not operating a factory and producing goods and selling goods
8208078 its the people out on the street doing field services
8208079 in general public employment is going to pay you less than private sector employment for the same level of skill and then in general public employment is going to give you better benefits and more security than the private sector
8208080 dont like big increases in their property taxes thats clearly one thing but if they can see what their taxes are going toward and that theyre getting a return on their money on their dollars in terms of public infrastructure or education or whatever theyre not dissatisfied with that
8208081 madison police are no longer in the highest three or four departments in the state
8208082 early on madison was one of those departments everyone else pointed to and said well look what theyre making we should be making similar money and now theres a fair number of departments in the state that are making significantly more than we are in terms of base salary and some of their incentives
8208083 a lot of comparing our union employees to other cities with unions with comparable positions and were very comparable
8208084 were competitive but were certainly not out of the range of other unionized city employees
8208085 it is cost effective especially in the short run rather than hiring additional drivers quickly which is not efficient to use overtime where we need to
8208086 i think were striking an improved balance with each passing year
8208087 say your organization is having an event and you want officers there either to help with crowd control or for traffic direction
8208088 the city bills you a rate and they take a small percentage of that and then the officer gets a percentage of what the city is billing so the city is actually bringing in income and part of that income theyre giving back to you the officer
8208089 this is not the year for new programs or expansions or new personnel its not going to happen dont even think about it
8208090 these are the people that mow the lawns in the parks and inspect the buildings and trim the trees and man your concession stands in the winter at the skating rinks
8208091 im hoping we can look to other places should we have to talk about not filling positions and eliminate positions

8208117 because the experienced swimmers didnt win any medals people have lost sight of the performances of the new generation the second line who came through

8208160 i want to go there and win the game so i will have that attitude the players might feel that as well and maybe that will free them up to play without pressure
8208161 i make no bones about the fact that the league is the most important thing for us this season and playing on a wednesday gives us less time to prepare for our next game another away match at cheltenham
8208162 but dont get me wrong i am very upbeat about what we have done so far especially when you consider there are new players trying to fit into a new team
8208163 i obviously know a lot of the players there very well and ill be ringing morgs sheffield united skipper chris morgan to see what i can prise out of him about kevin blackwells selection plans its always hard to try and second guess what kind of sides are put out in the carling cup but ill try my best to get some details
8208164 i started out at blackburn and while i never broke through into the first team picture it was a time i remember fondly they were good times i was there in the mid 1990s when jack walker turned the club around and they won the premiership under kenny dalglish
8208165 at the time i was skipper of the youth team and we also had success winning the youth league ahead of the likes of manchester united and liverpool that team included players like damien duff and david dunn who is now back there of course i would love to play as ive only ever played at ewood park with the youth team but its more important for me to get fully fit

8208196 luckily i did and he really loved the script and then we did a table reading
8208197 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from

8208350 the evidential test has not been passed and it would be simply wrong to bring the prosecution
8208351 i realize that this decision will come as a disappointment to the complainants in the case and possibly to others who have made statements to the police or are considering doing so
8208352 i am obviously aware that assertions have been made without any basis or foundation that justice will not be done in the child abuse investigations that are taking place
8208353 indeed it is for that reason that i am making this full statement as to why a decision not to prosecute has been taken in this case
8208354 all those who have any relevant evidence to give in the current child abuse investigation to contact the police and to make statements
8208355 that is the only way the prosecution will be able to reach a fully informed decision on the evidential test in the various cases that come before us for consideration

8208395 we do not have to worry about too many other players i believe we have the needed squad and a strong squad i believe in the players i have instead of always looking at who might be coming in
8208396 it is not one player who makes a difference it is up to us as a team to show personality strength and belief if we can find one more we will do it if not we will not limit our ambitions because of it
8208397 i do not know why we are always under pressure to buy 30 or 40m players
8208398 i am under pressure to buy good players it is as simple as that and good players are not always necessarily linked with the price
8208399 the names dont impress me what is impressive for me is the attitude the quality all the rest is part of the media
8208400 there is only one thing thats important and that is what you do on the pitch i agree that what we did on the pitch on saturday was not good enough but to compare the team with names is not very interesting and not very useful
8208401 i focus on my players i believe in my players
8208402 dont forget senderos is 23 years old that is when other central defenders just start to play
8208403 he has played in a champions league final and has played over 100 games in the premier league
8208404 i think one result and its called a crisis in a top four club that is what arsenal are
8208405 they dont get beat very often so when they do the scrutiny is more on them
8208406 i have seen them play in pre season and there has been some great football with arsenal i think because the way they play and the type of football they play they cannot be 100 per cent all the time on their day they are capable of taking apart anyone
8208407 i always used to say dont judge over two games arsenal have quality in their side they have injured players to come back fabregas will make a big difference so crisis at arsenal no
8208408 young players theo janssen and chioke tiote people like that this is a fantastic experience for them playing against arsenal in emirates stadium

8208413 ive always said im happy at milan and as long as my aims remain the same as milans ill stay here until now its always been that way
8208414 me going to chelsea im staying as a rossoneri player
8208415 we have said it again and again in the last two years he wont leave

8208417 i will never stay to live in england thats for sure
8208418 you get only a brief glimpse of sunlight before its all cloudy again the winters are mild but in summer the temperatures seldom go higher than 20c and it rains rains rains
8208419 in future i would like to test myself in another top league im thinking of spain at least there will be no reason to complain about the weather in england they say that manchester is the city of rain its main attraction is considered to be the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for other less rainy cities
8208420 its not only the weather that im not happy about here
8208421 in russia and serbia the peoples way of life is similar in england its totally different here they just dont have time to feel the joy of life
8208422 throughout the week they all work so hard they only talk to people at lunch break then in the evening they come home and watch the telly so they can get up early for work the next day
8208423 the only time to meet friends is at weekends but for football players its the busiest time of all it was much easier for me to adapt to russia than england in england i had no one to talk to the first month was especially hard i lived alone in a hotel which i left only for training i thought i would go crazy inside those four walls
8208424 arshavin is a seriously good player he was one of the best when i was in russia
8208425 how he would do in england is difficult to know i didnt know how i was going to do in england

8208545 creo que el alegato del fiscal alfredo terraf fue muy importante porque ha condensado en forma minuciosa y pormenorizada la enorme carga probatoria en contra de bussi y de men ndez
8208546 ha hecho una reconstrucci n hist rica del hecho que no deja lugar a dudas acerca de la responsabilidad de bussi y de men ndez pero lo m s importante de su s ntesis es que ha quedado demostrado cosa que no pudo ser refutada en el alegato de la defensa que ninguno de los testigos que declar en esta causa aun los que ha ofrecido la propia defensa ha desconocido la responsabilidad de bussi y de men ndez sobre la acusaci n en esta causa
8208547 me parece que el fiscal volvi a excederse en sus manifestaciones traspasando el l mite de su funci n inclusive refiri ndose a mi hermano por ricardo bussi y a m cuando no correspond a bajo ning n punto de vista le noto un encono personal que no se compadece con la investidura que desarrolla
8208548 creo que si el fiscal quiere hacer pol tica que se presente a elecciones a ver c mo le va pero no me parece correcto que aproveche un micr fono del tribunal oral para hacer manifestaciones de tinte exclusivamente ideol gicos y pol ticos
8208549 realmente hay que tener la cara muy dura para hacer eso pero mi padre se al le ha replicado con presteza a pesar de sus limitaciones y ha puesto en evidencia que al fiscal le falta autoridad moral para levantar hoy el dedo acusador puesto que 21 a os atr s no tuvo empacho en negociar en persona y reiteradamente con mi padre los electores para el cargo de gobernador
8208550 en los alegatos se plante el principio de contradicci n elemento fundamental de todo proceso penal dijo m s all de las diferencias de opini n con ella ha estudiado el expediente y ha valorado la prueba pero no ha conseguido de ninguna manera transmitirle al tribunal la falta de m rito de su defendido
8208551 en mi condici n de abogado estimo que todos los argumentos del ministerio p blico fueron destruidos uno a uno por una impecable exposici n jur dica de la defensora oficial ella se ci estrictamente a la cuesti n que nos llev a todos a ese estrado que es la lamentable situaci n por la que atraves la familia vargas aignasse y sobre la que nos hubiera gustado como a ellos dilucidar lo que realmente aconteci cosa que en este expediente no se ha dilucidado

8208556 understanding how the cellworks should allow us to affect the activityof enzymes in one neighborhood and leave alone their identicaltwins in a different neighborhood in that cell
8208557 as scientists were excited about thisdiscovery because its afundamentally new approach to regulating what enzymes do in cells
8208558 the fact that it also offers a potentially noveluse of adrug already widely in use for other applications is an unexpectedbonus
8208559 the idea is to use a pde5 inhibitor such as viagraselectively toinhibit platelet function we now know that not all theenzymes in the cell are doing the same job just like in real estate its all about the location
8208560 the limitedsuccess of existing therapy suggested to us that factorsbesides erbb2 or proteins that collude with erbb2 might nullify theeffects of herceptin and lapatinib
8208561 our results might explain why the strategyof using erbb2 inhibitorsalone to treat breast cancers has fallen short
8208562 iferbb2 is the accelerator that makes the car move brk helps shift thegear to gain more speed
8208563 we might need to hit erbb2 expressing cancers with drugsagainst both erbb2 and brk
8208564 we also thinkthat brk would be an ideal clinical marker than could beused to provide both a diagnosis and prognosis for breast cancer
8208565 innovation capacity is the driving force behind the economic success of one of the most important sectors of the future with the european biotechnica award we are supporting upcoming biotechnology firms which thanks to their dedication make a significant contribution to the development of europe as a research location
8208566 all three companies have submitted convincing concepts alongside innovative technologies and highly promising products they also show proof of excellent business expertise their products services and business ideas are certainly a valuable asset to the european biotechnology sector

8208568 population health focuses on the distribution of health outcomes within a population as well as the determinants that affect this distribution e g ethnicity medical care environment and public health policy
8208569 the development of improved interventions for chronic conditions hinges on understanding their distribution within the population and the factors that influence that distribution
8208570 the new title of our official journal reflects the evolution of chronic disease care to strategies across the entire care continuum from prevention and wellness to the most complex interventions
8208571 our journal has evolved too keeping pace with these changes as the leading peer reviewed publication for population health
8208572 this is a major milestone for kamada there is significant potential for the aerosolized version of aat which is an innovative approach for treatment of chronic inflammatory processes that could potentially prevent degeneration of lung function we believe that pending the successful completion of the trials and registration process this formulation could considerably improve the quality of life and potentially extend the life expectancy of a wide range of cystic fibrosis patients
8208573 we are extremely pleased with this major achievement aerosolized administration of aat for cystic fibrosis holds great potential for the treatment of these severely diseased patients we are eager to pursue the development of this product and demonstrate the benefit for this patient population as well as other respiratory populations
8208574 it was so important to me to get my dog back and i was so thankful
8208575 i was really happy to see veterinarians come to new orleans it really helps every convention that comes helps a little bit i never knew that there were so many animal lovers in the world
8208576 it was a wonderful program run by the foundation the improvements made to these facilities were immense but i still believe that the people that got the most of out it were the volunteers themselves they really enjoyed contributing their time and the efforts to help rebuild new orleans
8208577 we were able to complete more work than we expected and the facilities looked so much better when we were finished
8208578 the american veterinary medical association generated over 9 million in economic impact by bringing their annual convention to new orleans in the off peak summer months which not only fueled our citys most important economic engine tourism but also supported our chefs street performers musicians artists etc that make new orleans the unique destination that it is
8208579 above and beyond avma donated their time to assist in building new homes for our animal community we cant wait to welcome them back
8208580 people loved the cajun food in wonderful restaurants and they had to be surprised at seeing no effects from katrina in the downtown area
8208581 many unsolicited comments related how impressed attendees were with quality of speakers breadth and relevance of topics and excellence of educational opportunities
8208582 only safe animal dietary supplements are allowed on the market
8208583 they will support improved management of personnel safety traffic management collision avoidance and the improved efficiency of haul truck operations at mine sites
8208584 they will also help develop workforce management systems to provide increased security for workers in remote areas such as queenslands outback and piemontes alpine regions in italy

8208591 traditionally fuel bills have not always been at the top of the agenda for smes and owners with little time on their hands have been happy to assume that prices are comparable across the board
8208592 increasingly however small businesses are being forced to reassess their attitude to fuel costs a sandwich bar with several refrigerators used to paying an annual 1 800 for electricity will have to sell a lot more sandwiches to meet this years electricity bill of 3 600
8208593 by understanding their contracts and benefiting from the support available from alternative suppliers and industry bodies businesses can reduce the financial impact of high energy bills
8208594 sadly our survey shows we still have a long way to go to convince businesses that there is a cheaper way but with wholesale prices soaring the case for switching to a supplier like e4b is stronger than ever
8208595 the two hijackers and the seven crew are still inside we are continuing to negotiate with them
8208596 we are condemning first the hijacking of a civilian aeroplane and we are now in continuous contact and consultation with the libyan authorities in kufra airport
8208597 it is not clear whether there is one or more or whether they belong to abdul wahid were not expecting him to say yes
8208598 we dont have any relation with that hijacking civilians theyre angry theyll behave like that they may agree with abdul wahid but in our structure we have no decision like this to hijack a civilian airplane
8208599 the hijackers claim to have coordinated with him nur to join him in paris
8208600 we categorically deny the responsibility of our movement in this hijacking operation
8208601 no one declared responsibility for the hijacking all the rebels until now denied the operation
8208602 this kind of new technology will add something to our ammunition box
8208603 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8208604 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8208605 i have seen four or five dvds of uzbekistan at the moment so for me it is not a big surprise anymore
8208606 for the players probably yes but we will have enough time to prepare for the game
8208607 i have always said that quality wise we are one of the best teams in asia it is about circumstances it is about the trips we have to make and this time we will be well prepared
8208608 we have to find out how the circumstances are when we arrive in tashkent
8208609 the china and middle east games we had to play under difficult circumstances so i am not so worried about that
8208610 it can never be worse than it was in dubai and qatar last june so the players will go there and adapt quite soon they will be ready
8208611 we had a pretty good showing earlier this season when we raced at california for the first time back in february unfortunately the last time we were at
8208612 there is one units that beats any kind of units is gt the messaih
8208613 the design of new small format marketside stores which will open in the phoenix arizona area in coming weeks marks a dramatic break with the branding of the rest of more than 3 400 low cost us stores
8208614 i think its a bit shocking for all of us because with that ruling it sets a precedent now
8208615 i guess therell be nothing of the sort bringing down lineouts like that even though it wasnt a real bad one it sets a precedent now
8208616 any interference of this kind carries real danger and a sanction is required
8208617 ive lost a couple of kilos so ive just got to get that back on before the weekend
8208618 its like one of the things that could only happen to me
8208619 it could have been picked up from my hands something i picked up food anything so all we know is it was a pretty bad case to keep me out for that game which was real disappointing
8208620 ive had something to eat this morning which was pretty much the first thing in three days which i kept down
8208621 i think whether they bring stirling into inside centre or timana theyve both got the ability to ball play
8208622 its more just getting your head around it that youve got to ball play more instead of being those runners
8208623 you dont want to take things away from players that theyre good at timanas obviously a great runner so is stirling but they can also pass the ball and use the ball well
8208624 the home seems to be in order but were very early in the investigation
8208625 if there is anyone who has information about this double shooting we encourage them to call crime stoppers at 74 crime
8208626 i carry that stench on my back ever since the day it happened
8208627 i was a day boy and i was not the only victim back then
8208628 the college received some internet material which contained allegations that i think are linked to the ones that are currently taking place
8208629 those matters were referred to the police some years ago
8208630 this slows down decision cycles constricts the passage of information in an age of email and blackberries and the sharing of lessons learned so we need to address this situation
8208631 training and structuring for high level combined arms warfighting provides a crucible for the growth of highly developed leadership skills and adaptation mechanisms
8208632 no other form of training hones these essential components of land forces for contemporary operations to such high levels
8208633 these skills provide the essential foundation for all types of operations that we may undertake
8208634 these measures will ensure army is better able to contribute to the conduct of joint operations and do so in a manner that balances our current commitments with preparations for the future
8208635 the adaptive army initiative will result in a more effective army and one that is well positioned to continue its adaptation to changes in the security environment in the coming decades

8208639 a 33 year old man from carlisle was arrested on suspicion of witness intimidation assisting an offender drink driving criminal damage making threats to cause damage and resisting arrest
8208640 both males are in custody and are helping police with their inquiries
8208641 its really to try and stop any criminal activity taking place in the first place
8208642 if the operators can see a problem brewing they can make the perpetrators aware that they are being followed
8208643 it will act as a deterrent and hopefully they wont follow it through
8208644 a suitable cctv system has been specified and costed which would provide a live link to the councils control room at the civic centre and would allow controllers to interact with intruders via a loudspeaker built into the camera mounting
8208645 following inspection of the affected boilers a thorough cleaning process is underway
8208646 if all aspects of this process are successful then we will be able to give further clarification on when the plant will resume production
8208647 at around 6 45pm yesterday police received reports that two men had damaged a car belonging to the family of the 22 year old man who was stabbed during an incident in wigton officers attended the scene of the damage then arrested two males in the crosby villa area
8208648 a 15 year old male from aspatria was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder a 33 year old man from carlisle was arrested on suspicion of witness intimidation assisting an offender drink driving criminal damage making threats to cause damage and resisting arrest
8208649 both males are in custody and are helping police with their inquiries
8208650 there is a serious problem with traffic coming through the village
8208651 there is a chicane that involves giving way to traffic coming up the hill and at peak periods there is often trouble when some people dont want to give way and they have already set off
8208652 there has been a lot of minor accidents that are not reported
8208653 i have noticed an increase to damaged cars not everybody is speeding but people will not give way
8208654 when you are trying to set off you are sitting for a long time just waiting to get out
8208655 because of the volume of traffic coming through lowca it is really slower
8208656 we cant stop people coming through the village but we want them to use it with respect
8208657 i believe the second amendment ought to be preserved which means no gun control
8208658 i still cannot believe this happened we were only a few minutes late because a rides queue hadnt been moving and then the ride lasted longer than we thought
8208659 we ran back to the bus zone as quickly as we could but we were seven minutes late at first i wasnt worried because the bus driver had said he would wait 10 extra minutes but soon i realised he had gone and left us
8208660 who leaves a bunch of kids in an unfamiliar area
8208661 alton towers is based in the middle of nowhere on a dark country road anything could have happened
8208662 the kids shouldnt have been late but if the coach company is willing to take teenagers on trips they should be prepared to give them a bit of leeway especially when youre only talking seven minutes
8208663 youd think in this day and age that people would look after the younger people in the community
8208664 there are strict policies that the bus driver has to follow so he had to leave them
8208665 the driver needed to get back up to carlisle before his driving hours were used up there are tight working regulations for coach drivers so we have to keep to a strict schedule the driver waited for five minutes before setting off
8208666 it was the drivers first day doing those sorts of trips usually the coach drivers should say be back for 5 15pm so they can leave at 5 30pm
8208667 we didnt know he was that young but even so he isnt too young to get back on time
8208668 it must be ingrained into young males heads early that there should be a nationwide moratorium on
8208669 my own personal opinion is that contacting elected officials will do nothing at
8208670 i wont pretend to fathom the psychology of a man who was severely abused by his older sister and

8208672 the defendant spotted her he had clearly had too much to drink he shouted at her and put his hands in her cleavage and touched her breasts
8208673 there are no plans for community legal advice centres to be built around here
8208674 and even if there was we are funded by several different sources we are not funded by the lsc at all
8208675 a few years ago we decided that it was too risky to rely on just one funder so we decided to apply for help from many different sources we now get help from sources including the royal british legion raf benevolent fund macmillan cancer support and the county council and city council
8208676 the defendant spotted her he had clearly had too much to drink he shouted at her and put his hands in her cleavage and touched her breasts
8208677 in addition to the dedicated team of over 30 detectives who are working in these cases we have increased high visibility police patrols around workington to reassure the community and provide a visible presence
8208678 it is extremely rare for two incidents of this nature to occur just over a mile apart in an area such as workington and we are devoting significant resources to catching those responsible

8208684 inflation and crude have linked us from the global markets but i dont see any structural problems in the country i expect banking steel and power counters to do well in the coming days the biggest issue facing us is that growth is slowing down globally challenge is that all developed economies are in recession or data is suggesting that they may tip over into a recession

8208691 ive actually extended my lead in the championship despite losing two points to felipe
8208692 im mentally strong enough to deal with that and im more relaxed about it too im playing a long game

8208694 my aim is still to win the world championship and you dont do that by ending up in the barriers after making an opportunistic move
8208695 as you can see reliability is the key im not worried about the reliability of my car because for the past 18 months weve had phenomenal reliability
8208696 weve not really got any problems which means we can focus on developing the car rather than worrying about reliability which is a bonus for us

8208700 der eu au enministerrat hat nach dem ausbruch des krieges geschwiegen wenn wir nicht einmal in einer echten krise uns zu etwas durchringen k nnen was bleibt uns da noch momentan k nnen wir nur sehr wenig tun wir sollten unsere erwartungen an eine gemeinsame au en und sicherheitspolitik runterschrauben
8208701 die hoffnung dass diese krise einfach vorbeigeht und wir zum business as usual bergehen k nnen ist sehr naiv nun an ein partnerschaftsabkommen mit russland zu denken ist utopisch wenn georgiens territoriale integrit t nicht gewahrt wird werden wir um 40 jahre zur ckgeworfen dann sind die weltordnung die nach dem ende des kalten krieges entstanden ist und alle fundamente die das helsinki abkommen von 1975 geschaffen hat hinf llig

8208726 we could top of the league now and the players know that its only individual errors that has cost us it is nothing to do with the team what we are concentrating on in training is being hard to beat to be fair no one has turned us over so far
8208727 at the end of the last season if id have said we would have eight points from the first five games i would have been laughed at if we get that tally over the rest of the season we could well be in the it is not rocket science
8208728 it is going to be hard against southport but from what i have heard of them every one of their games has been a hard fought battle and they have got a win or a draw out of it so i am thinking we can get something out of the game
8208729 we did not play well at all for 75 minutes against tamworth in the last fifteen minutes we were a lot better but if we had have won it would have been an injustice
8208730 it was not that tamworth were that good we just made them look like world beaters if we had played like i know we can we would have won we needed to respond very quickly against solihull and that is what we did
8208731 if we have had the week to reflect on it it would have been different we just had to go there and win to be fair to the players its a credit to them the way they responded
8208732 we didnt have much choice but to play 4 4 2 at solihull without andre francis and ishamel reid we had to shuffle the pack that way that said we could have five or six goals
8208733 infelizmente n o temos como continuar mas seguramente o espet culo poderia ficar em cartaz por dois anos com a casa lotada

8208749 men are handling the grocery shopping more than ever before either on their own or shared with their spouse
8208750 men are grocery shopping more because they say it gives them time with their spouse partner or family
8208751 in contrast women are more likely to shop independently and say it gives them some time alone
8208752 men tend to buy treats like three different kinds of potato chips while women tend to choose household items such as detergent cleaning supplies and paper items
8208753 shopping enjoyment decreases steadily as consumers age particularly among older women
8208754 the weight of the shopping bags the convenience or lack of it with parking and the size of some supermarkets can be a chore for older shoppers
8208755 customers who are leaving stores due to long wait times have other options
8208756 enhancing the customer experience is the best way for most retailers to set themselves apart and retain customers
8208757 wait times is the first indicator of customer experience across multiple sectors and a primary driver of consumer satisfaction whether we are talking about groceries or health care
8208758 it should be top of mind for business when assessing how the needs of customers could be better addressed

8208765 deslegitima de manera tan burda y reiterada las decisiones de la corte suprema de justicia en relaci n con las investigaciones que ella realiza en contra de los pol ticos aliados del paramilitarismo

8208786 its been three weeks since i last played against havant amp waterlooville so i definitely needed the match
8208787 everyone got through it okay and had a good run out against a young and enthusiastic sunderland side it was a good work out
8208788 it was good to blow away a couple of cobwebs and now i want a good week in training so i can be in contention for saturday
8208789 maybe the manchester united game came a little bit too soon when you havent played youre never quite sure how fit you are and against manchester united you cant afford to have any chinks in your armour youve got to be 100 percent spot on
8208790 it was disappointing to miss out on the first game of the season though it would have been great to have been involved
8208791 who knows what the team will be against everton and whether theyll be any changes
8208792 if you have seen our league action our league action has been pretty good we dominated an everton side who finished fifth in the premier league on saturday
8208793 we didnt get the result but if we play as well as we did on saturday week in week out we will be fine
8208794 any win is nice but it wasnt to be we wont dwell on it too long we move on
8208795 the premier league is our bread and butter and we are looking forward to every game
8208796 we have started very well whether you are a media man whether you are reporter yes people want to see results and points on the board
8208797 as a manager who realises it is 38 games it is all about the performance for me and if we play as well as we have done we will win games
8208798 i think it was an interesting game for him and it would have got him up to speed with the english game very quickly
8208799 there were a few heavy tackles and stuff like that but theres nothing in the rules that says you are not allowed to tackle and be physical
8208800 i knew coming to hartlepool would be a very steep learning curve for him
8208801 we were always going to hold on for as long as we could because we wanted to get him on the pitch and get him used to english football as soon as we could
8208802 its a very technical game in spain and he is probably used to a bit more protection over there and used to a bit less physicality than he was subjected to tonight
8208803 he was fine fitness wise and thats another reason why the game was important for him

8208849 in the first week of september more than 800 representatives of multilateral and bilateral donors developed and developing country governments and civil society organisations csos will gather in accra ghana for the oecd dac development assistance committee s third high level forum on aid effectiveness 2 4 september
8208850 the reality of aid in 2008 is that it continues to fail to promote human development for the eradication of poverty based on the core values of human rights democracy gender equality and environmental sustainability this is despite the appearance of progress in the form of high profile debt cancellations new aid pledges and the signing of the paris declaration on aid effectiveness
8208851 collaboration on development strategies that includes civil society organisations and other key actors could help achieve the principles of alignment and harmonisation while preserving the rich and powerful diversity that comes with a range of local development participants
8208852 the paris declaration has not given the necessary relevance to gender equality and womens empowerment issues gender responsive budgeting should be part and parcel of the aid effectiveness agenda at the high level forum because less funding impacts on progress towards gender equality and womens empowerment at country level especially in africa
8208853 the csos gathered in the parallel cso forum and the 80 accredited cso delegates to the hlf while very critical of progress to date will be pushing for real aid reform measures for aid effectiveness that give opportunity to citizens of donor and developing countries to reclaim their democratic mandate to have a say on global public goods and to control their future development

8208863 there was a fire in the plane as a result of the accident itself and obviously a number of inquiries have got to be made to establish what circumstances were in relation to the fire and what caused it
8208864 its absolutely remarkable and despite the tragic outcome were very pleased that we havent had to provide care to any other individual
8208865 it just slowly circled down and its nose down entered the ground and then just a matter of a few seconds later a great pool of black smoke went up
8208866 i guess a look at the climate would suggest that weve had in a lot of places in australia less rainfall so there would be less water available to irrigate which would be one of the driving factors
8208867 weve been in a period of drought for quite a number of years and it seems now to be impacting on the amount of irrigation water that farmers are able to use

8208875 but to crack the top three and get on top of the podium feels awesome especially with the competition in milwaukee
8208876 going to milwaukee i think i was only 25 points out of third
8208877 the points are so tight because there are so many good drivers so anytime you can jump a few places in one race is great now we just have to finish strong and hope to stay in the top five

8208882 i would say that the javafx platform looks very good it has a lot of potential
8208883 it probably should have been announced three four five years ago
8208884 a powerful client technology for creating rich internet applications with immersive media and content across the multiple screens of your life
8208885 javafx script the language of javafx doesnt replace swing the core java gui toolkit but provides an alternative way of programming that hopefully will bring java technology to the masses
8208886 javafx takes that momentum and the advantages we have with java but makes it much easier to create rich interactive and immersive experiences
8208887 it matches the way they think about interfaces in their head and is very intuitive
8208888 the platform promises a lot of new apis and new abstractions to make the harder things simpler and the simpler things very easy

8208896 roberto obviously has them playing with confidence and they are a technically gifted side
8208897 its a great compliment but we know we have to consolidate first
8208898 it is a great achievement to reach the third round for the first time in 26 years
8208899 i know there were a lot of changes on both sides but it speaks volumes on how far we have come as a football club when we can compete with and beat a premier league side
8208900 that is testament to how well prepared and how hard the lads have been working because our quality of play was outstanding
8208901 we looked the stronger side as the game went on and we played some special football that i hope our fans enjoyed
8208902 hull had some very expensive premier league players but i thought we controlled the game from the start of the second half
8208903 we created enough chances after the break to win the game comfortably and it was a pleasure to watch

8208914 despite promises from the airline that its air to ground system developed by aircell would block voice calls
8208915 as to how he was able to use phweet to make calls while in flight
8208916 for those of you who are technologically clueless about hip programs like phweet which i was until about three minutes ago its a short url that makes conversations and conference calls possible between twitter friends
8208917 i dont mean a five second hi hello i mean a real conversation as she held her lenovo umpc up to her face i even heard the announcement from the flight attendants as she was about to land
8208918 at americans request we set up various mechanisms to block voice calls obviously someone found a way around them
8208919 although its up to american to enforce its no call policy during flights aircell is doing everything it can to address the issue

8208921 we are seeing accidents in essex dramatically reduced as a result of our intervention and education campaign but we need to make more of an impact on motorcycle accidents
8208922 we feel that signs warning of the likelihood of detection by air will be an extra incentive particularly for motorcyclists and all motorists to drive safely and help us to reduce accidents further

8208931 i consider this proposal to be of national significance it is relevant to new zealands obligations to the global environment in terms of the kyoto protocol in addition the proposal will have direct physical effects on more than one region in this case the franklin and waikato districts and the waikato region in terms of security of electricity supply the proposal will have potential effects beyond these areas
8208932 this wind farm is expected to meet the electricity needs of about 180 000 households per year
8208933 i have considered the views of the councils affected by his decision to intervene and that while they have the capacity to process and decide the applications the proposals national significance means a call in process is necessary
8208934 the applications will be considered in line with the relevant district and regional plans local council expertise and processes will be used where possible and the board of inquiry will consider submissions from the public and hold hearings

8208944 if your goal is to get lower electricity costs the economics show the turbine is not practical
8208945 the price can be for a turbine kit that does not include all parts needed to get a finished and operational system
8208946 thats not going to be a trouble free maintenance free 20 years
8208947 we get a lot of people who call up and say they want to go green
8208948 what they really want is to save money solar panels and wind turbines dont save energy they produce it
8208949 we really try to push them down the conservation first route
8208950 your average house is going to be just fine on a 5 kilowatt system
8208951 its like buying a new car but its like buying a car in 1906 when people dont know much about cars and you may not have even seen one before
8208952 consumers are eager for clean energy solutions and a small wind system is one of the most productive ways to generate clean reliable fuel free electricity
8208953 to fully meet growing customer demand we need policies that make it easier and less costly to invest in small wind systems
8208954 we need to work very hard and see if it is important to use or not to use the joker if we really have a problem
8208955 it was definitely not the weekend i was hoping for but i do not believe that i am now out of the running for the title even if i realise things are now more complicated
8208956 it kind of nearly led to me not racing this weekend

8208965 the arrest is part of an ongoing investigation by lancashire constabulary and greater manchester counter terrorism unit
8208966 traditionally fuel bills have not always been at the top of the agenda for smes and owners with little time on their hands have been happy to assume that prices are comparable across the board
8208967 increasingly however small businesses are being forced to reassess their attitude to fuel costs a sandwich bar with several refrigerators used to paying an annual 1 800 for electricity will have to sell a lot more sandwiches to meet this years electricity bill of 3 600
8208968 by understanding their contracts and benefiting from the support available from alternative suppliers and industry bodies businesses can reduce the financial impact of high energy bills
8208969 sadly our survey shows we still have a long way to go to convince businesses that there is a cheaper way but with wholesale prices soaring the case for switching to a supplier like e4b is stronger than ever
8208970 the family seemed really frustrated and initially thats what prompted us to go out and try to help

8208972 the orange county sheriffs office has been phenomenal theyve been very responsive to our calls
8208973 leed has been frequently criticized for not having a solid rationale for allocating credits
8208974 the classic example is you get one point for putting in bicycle lockers and showers and one point for saving 7 percent of energy are those equivalent benefits
8208975 we are saying climate change is the most important thing so we put the most points to credits that deal with climate change
8208976 if you want to get certified you have to focus on those areas
8208977 this is the best way possible to give responsibility to chapters theyre the ones who know the local issues without jeopardizing the consistency of leed overall
8208978 there is a tension between having a national system and yet still allowing a lot of regional differences
8208979 a solution is for leed 2012 were not ready to make that big of a leap
8208980 leed in general is a way for institutions and corporations to collect points from a public relations standpoint
8208981 the changes in leed are definite improvements i think everyone is behind them but we also need to improve the system
8208982 we need results not just a certification on a building
8208983 block island is one of the best spots for wind in the country

8208995 morals are nothing more than a tool used to keep the mindless masses under control and should never be used for an argument as they have absolutly no substantive quality one should look behind the morals and see what informs them
8208996 preventing the child from engaging or continuing to engage in offensive or disruptive behaviour
8208997 small number of investigations that did not lead to prosecutions used by paranoid extremists to curtail childrens rights
8208998 small number of investigations leading to no prosecution used by frightened nimbys to protract their own state of denial
8208999 clearly brian lochore is a monocultural dinosaur a hangover from the baby boomer days where it was ok for white men to do whatever they wanted in the belief that there were no threats to the comfortable existence of themselves and their families oh how we all wish life could be so simple again rugby players are a sickening bunch second only to the baby boomers in their self absorption lochore ticks both boxes
8209000 the dsp is a marxist leninist party and we dont think that is a bad thing
8209001 it is aimed at promoting discussion and greater understanding between the forces for socialism that are actively involved in building parties and organisations
8209002 promoting discussion and greater understanding between the forces for socialism that are actively involved in building parties and organizations an exclusive interview with sandinista leader and former nicaraguan president daniel ortega is the lead article in the first issue two articles on socialist renewal in the communist party of the philippines a report on left unity in south africa an article on left regroupment in the u s the editorial board includes jeremy cronin a leader of the south african communist party sacp and editor of the african communist langa zita from the sacp and the south african metalworkers union dr francisco nemenzo from the philippines baddegama samitha from the new socialist party of sri lanka and leading members from the new zealand alliance the sandinista national liberation front fsln the farabundo mart national liberation front fmln and the fourth international
8209003 this is a project involving the left from the communist party the trotskyist maoist ex social democratic independent left and liberation theology traditions we all have in common a desire for socialist renewal based on support for democracy feminism ecological sustainability and internationalism
8209004 if socialism is to survive as a relevant political movement in the 21st century it must develop a response to the ecological crisis and a socialist strategy to build a sustainable future green left weekly provides the tools of information and analysis to make that possible
8209005 what it was like what happened and what its like now
8209006 look at me arent i wonderful and dont you want to be just like me

8209015 im going to cover the white walls of the room that you will sleep in or gauguin when he comes with nothing but paintings of large yellow sunflowers
8209016 and then you will see these large pictures of bunches of twelve or fourteen sunflowers filling the tiny room along with a pretty bed everything else all very elegant i want to make it into a real artists house everything from the chairs to the pictures should have character
8209017 gauguin was especially taken with the sunflowers as you know peonies are jeannins hollyhocks are quosts and sunflowers well sunflowers are mine

8209027 die fakten zeigen eindeutig dass es nicht so weitergeht wie bisher
8209028 wie tief der abschwung sein wird k nnen wir noch nicht mit sicherheit sagen
8209029 die forderung m sste eigentlich niedriger sein als im vergangenen jahr
8209030 es geht nicht dass diese tarifrunde zu einer tarifrunde der gef hle werden soll wir m ssen weitestgehend von fakten ausgehen wie sollen wir denn gegen ber gef hlen in einem fl chentarifvertrag sachgerechte l sungen finden

8209032 there is a desire for energy independence and this will reduce the need for oil and natural gas
8209033 different sectors like to associate with wind power and if compressed air will truly help wind then fine
8209034 but we dont want to give anyone the impression that storage is needed to integrate wind even growing 20 fold storage isnt needed
8209035 in the next couple of years we want to install a couple of them so it becomes a tool in the toolbox to meet needs
8209036 nos solidarizamos con nuestros compa eros de trabajo que en escaso n mero ante la cantidad de agresores siempre enfrentan los riesgos para cumplir la tarea encomendada con dignidad y valentia instamos al poder pol tico municipal a extremar los recursos para proteger el trabajo de los agentes de tr nsito que hoy se encuentran arriesgando su integridad f sica muchas veces en soledad en cuanto a acompa amiento y protecci n que debe brindarle el departamento ejecutivo municipal
8209037 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8209038 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8209039 i have gone back and forth on this because as a player youll always want to play youll never lose that urge to be out there
8209040 but i could only do this if i could commit 100 percent physically mentally emotionally and i cant do that ive tried to convince myself and my body to give it one more year but in the end i just dont think i could turn it on like i need to again
8209041 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize ive got a great home at fox now and i think its where i belong i wish i couldve had different news for giants fans but ive known for a while im done
8209042 we talked money but the money was secondary to whether he was actually coming back
8209043 first you have to figure out if you can come back and he never really got past that point
8209044 i think he was telling himself hey i can make a difference but ultimately you have to look at all the factors and like i said before after going out on top the way he did he really separated himself from all of it it just would have been too hard for him to get back to where he was
8209045 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8209046 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8209047 regarding the surgical procedure on osi umenyiora the doctors were very pleased
8209048 the surgery went well the knee looked good the prognosis is very very optimistic for a full recovery
8209049 its something i havent been able to do in the past year to go out and practice with no limitations i worked this tuesday morning and i wasnt as sore as i thought i would be its all positive that i can go out there back to back days im going to get some treatment and see how i feel wednesday but as of right now i feel pretty good
8209050 its something im still getting used to but they do help a lot
8209051 at one point i argued with the decision but i am still about three weeks away
8209052 i have been running routes and i have not had any drawbacks which is good
8209053 que tengan prudencia porque no se puede dejar sin clases a 4 millones y medio de chicos
8209054 resulta imprescindible comprender que la instancia de di logo que ha propiciado el gobierno de scioli desde el comienzo de su gesti n ha permitido llevar soluciones concretas al reclamo docente y es en ste marco que el paro docente aparece como excesivo configurando por tanto un ejercicio abusivo del derecho a huelga comportamiento ste que parece olvidar que todos los derechos se ejercen dentro del bien com n as cada uno de los 4 millones y medio de ni os que no tendr n clases ven vulnerado su derecho tambi n constitucional a la educaci n
8209055 dar aumento a esta altura provocar a un desfinanciamiento de otras reas
8209056 el 95 del dinero destinado a educaci n es para el pago de los sueldos docentes en el global son 13 930 millones de pesos que representan el 34 del presupuesto general de gastos que la provincia estima realizar en el a o los dirigentes gremiales tienen que buscar un equilibrio entre defender los derechos de los trabajadores y no perjudicar a los chicos

8209059 an atmospheric pressure drop at wind turbine blades is an undetectable and potentially unforeseeable hazard for bats thus partially explaining the large number of bat fatalities at these specific structures
8209060 people love to sit in their backyards and watch birds its much harder to watch bats because they are nocturnal
8209061 it was important for us to determine as much as we could about this issue
8209062 we had to be quite patient mainly because we were started from a knowledge base that wasnt quite zero but very very low
8209063 so many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security conformity and conservatism all of which may appear to give one peace of mind but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future the joy of our life comes from our encounters with new experiences and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon for each day to have a new and different sun
8209064 if the day and night are such that you greet them with joy and life emits a fragnance like flowers and sweet scented herbs is more elastic more starry more immortal that is your success
8209065 jadi kalau lagi di musik panggil saya ronaldisko jangan ronal surapradja atau ronal extravaganza
8209066 you never know how people are going to react to a subject like this but the coaches were confident that we would deliver a positive and appropriate message i cant explain how thrilled we were to have the opportunity to address the team
8209067 were just trying to get the message out there that this can happen to anybody and the fact that depression is a disease its not something you can just get over
8209068 it really hit a lot of our players who have dealt with this first hand
8209069 so many of the players came forward to speak with my wife and i after the talk was over they spoke about how depression has hit their lives through family and friends it felt good to cultivate an atmosphere where the young people felt they can talk about these issues without feeling ashamed
8209070 i know we will receive other calls and i know that it will be thanks to the opportunity that lycoming gave us
8209071 it shoots 1280 720p video at 24fps with a 16 9 aspect ratio for up to five minutes producing around a 600mb file its essentially recording the live view feed which gets its own button so focus is locked because the mirror has moved out of the way and you get mono sound the major appeal is that itll work with any of your lenses so you can do wacky hd clips with a fisheye lens on the relatively cheap or be artsy and use a shallow depth of field
8209072 for the first time in digital slr photography nikon introduces the addition of the d movie mode allowing consumers to create their own hd movie clips 1280 x 720 with sound from their d slr camera photographers will appreciate the cinematic qualities that come from the 24fps frame rate which matches theatrical film whether producing vacation clips or creatively melding stills with video additionally the large size of the d90s dx format sensor combined with the optical superiority and broad selection of nikkor lenses provides shooters with the ability to capture amazing perspectives not possible with typical camcorders d movie clips also benefit from nikon vr image stabilization which is automatically activated during recording to aid the low light capability that trumps many other hybrid devices users can record movie clips onto an inserted sd sdhc card created as motion jpeg avi files that are easily edited with widely available video editing software the d90 also features an hdmi terminal allowing viewing of both pictures and movies on high definition television

8209076 and in lane 4 we have suns javafx used by web properties such as well its still in development
8209077 this isnt the type of market where only one technology is going to win
8209078 i think sun has the opportunity to catch up very quickly in that space
8209079 i would say that the javafx platform looks very good it has a lot of potential
8209080 it probably should have been announced three four five years ago
8209081 a powerful client technology for creating rich internet applications with immersive media and content across the multiple screens of your life
8209082 javafx script the language of javafx doesnt replace swing the core java gui toolkit but provides an alternative way of programming that hopefully will bring java technology to the masses
8209083 javafx takes that momentum and the advantages we have with java but makes it much easier to create rich interactive and immersive experiences
8209084 it matches the way they think about interfaces in their head and is very intuitive
8209085 the platform promises a lot of new apis and new abstractions to make the harder things simpler and the simpler things very easy

8209090 durante a segunda parte foram feitas bastantes altera es e isso acabou por causar algum desequil brio para al m disso registou se uma quebra a n vel f sico que levou a alguma desconcentra o a verdade que a equipa teve muito pouco tempo de prepara o para este encontro porque estamos no in cio da poca e por isso normal que em termos f sicos ainda n o apresentem o n vel desejado

8209108 la pranzul luat impreuna cu lideri ai partidelor de opozitie la resedinta mea unul din ei a afirmat ca aderarea la nato este importanta pentru tara lor dintr un motiv pe care nu l am mai auzit inainte gt biden vizibil infuriat s a ridicat de pe scaun s a aplecat peste masa si a spus gt capetele mai lucide l au asigurat pe biden si pe mine ca respectivul domn s a exprimat eronat si ca romanii sunt atasati ideii de bune relatii cu minoritatea lor maghiara iar acestia au avut dreptate atunci cand partidul de opozitie a ajuns la putere partidul etnicilor maghiari a spri jinit noul guvern in 2004 romania a aderat la nato cu sprijinul lui biden
8209109 cea mai remarcabila intalnire pe care am avut o a fost cea cu petre roman pe atunci presedinte al senatului
8209110 acesta a fost prim ministru la inceputul anilor 90 asa ca biden l a intalnit mai inainte biden i a pus intrebari in legatura cu politica sarba un subiect despre care roman avea foarte multe cunostinte insa la iesirea de la intalnire biden mi a spus
8209111 yes yes you look like some gestures fat by winging arms upwards vietnamese
8209112 mom do you think i could be in the olympics if i practiced really hard
8209113 well there are a lot of factors that go into whether you make it to the olympics or not but if you picked a sport and practiced really hard i bet youd have just as good a chance as anyone else
8209114 but you know youre good at a lot of things
8209115 youll find the thing you enjoy the most whether its a sport or not and thats the thing youll be really great at

8209118 i think the human psychological underpinning of buying and selling stocks is pretty universal for both the amateur and the professional
8209119 if youre a younger person with a much longer time horizon with much greater risk tolerance markets like this give you an excellent opportunity to put more money to work
8209120 establish what your needs are what your goals are what your plans are and the professionals will sit down and put together a program with an acceptable level of risk tolerance
8209121 you need to be well armed with an array of plans for all situations
8209122 you need to spend time educating yourself so that youre prepared for all different types of markets
8209123 people hold on to losers because they dont want to admit theyre wrong they think things are going to get better
8209124 when you go into a trade you have to have some idea of when you get out of a trade
8209125 at the moment you enter a trade you should set that exit plan up
8209126 if you find yourself rooting for or cheering for your stock as if its a sports team you have to step back
8209127 when youre anxious and youre stressed you tend to overreact
8209128 that tends to escalate your anxiety and makes matters worse

8209144 i wonder if michelle would give the queen one of her little knuckle punches
8209145 holy mackerel the energy coming out of this country is unrivaled
8209146 the reality of exclusives is that they will become far more infrequent the way hardware companies have to offset that is through enhancing the quality of games coming through their own studios that will drive customers to buy their own hardware system
8209147 its a trend were excited about but not completely surprised about if you look at the installed base and attached rate
8209148 i went to her funeral and they were singing hymns and the preacher was preaching and praying and i sat there thinking to myself that this young woman may have died unnecessarily
8209149 i think had we done that some of the issues that you have uncovered in your investigation would not be as prominent within the system today as they seem to be
8209150 senator obama feels that patients deserve more protections than the patients bill of rights not fewer
8209151 one of the real tragedies of our health care system is that people who have had health insurance have done all the right things have paid their premiums they pay their co pays when they see their doctors and when they need it most the coverage isnt there
8209152 thats whats creating a lot of anxiety in the health care system
8209153 he would change the nature of the relationship so even if an insurance company has the power to interfere they would no longer have the incentive to
8209154 the reason they intervene now is because they make money by cutting off either people or treatments and we want to people to make money by delivering good health care and thats the purpose of the reforms
8209155 one of the real complexities in the current system is that fact that we have 50 states each with their own set of regulations governing insurance
8209156 you have to fight your battles at the state level and it really makes it very complex because it means you have to fight 50 battles rather than one at the federal level
8209157 my office hears from constituents all the time who have seen insurance companies deny care have seen insurance companies do everything but march into the hospital or doctors waiting room and try to cut off their conversation
8209158 the insurance companies have been far too intrusive in violating what should be a sacrosanct doctor patient relationship
8209159 i think it could be helpful to the physician community in operating on a level playing field
8209160 i dont think they are operating on a level playing field now
8209161 it is fixable it is going to take time and it is going to take some changes
8209162 the best way to provide care for patients is to create value for patients better safety better service
8209163 and one of the main ways of doing all of this is to coordinate
8209164 thats where insurance companies could play a significant role a positive role in making part of the insurance plan a care coordination model for the patients that they insure
8209165 it is a different approach when you think of the insurer as somebody you want to partner with and somebody who wants to do a better job for their beneficiaries
8209166 im very worried about the fact that the health care conversation in america is all about putting 44 million more people into the system which is certainly all well and good for the 44 million who right now dont have reliable access
8209167 but what nobody is talking about is if the system isnt shored up with more finances and more access to providers you are just going to dilute things further and you are going to have a lot more miserable people who now are insured but the insurance isnt covering them and the waits are long and the visits are short
8209168 it seems like a very superficial election year conversation as opposed to figuring out what we are going to provide who is going to provide it and how it is going to be there when people need it i dont hear anybody taking that approach
8209169 there are now 50 and i am certain that we will shortly have even more
8209170 he finished training and he felt he had to go to harvard business school and maybe leave medicine
8209171 when i say to them why are you doing this
8209172 they have to quit moaning and get back to the business of figuring out what is the most cost effective care they can give their patients
8209173 blue collar workers are fantastic but medicine is not a blue collar job we need very creative people with a lot with great memories and ability to correlate a and b it is not a road job but thats what it is turning into
8209174 the total loss of control the corporatization the unfunded mandates big overhead thats been a frustration to most of us
8209175 a lot of things are taking away from the satisfaction of being a doctor the doctor patient relationship is the biggest

8209183 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him

8209185 cornwall county councils policy document on renewable energy says that 93 megawatts should be the target by 2010 and we already have 92 megs now so we are almost there already so we dont need these giant turbines on bodmin moor they are in the wrong place and they are far too big and im sure people will continue to fight this application all the way
8209186 i heard very deep concerns about the proposed wind farm on a whole range of issues i am asking for a meeting with the company behind this development and will be pressing them for clear information and answers to the questions raised

8209227 i dont like to have to do research to be quite honest
8209228 i always feel like the writer should have done that having said that whenever im about to start a film ill usually go to a book store and just nab whatever books i can get on the subject just because im interested i suppose but i dont feel like i need to do research in order to find the character i feel like i should have found the character after reading the script for the first time
8209229 and in that period i was sick of the industry and sick of the whole thing and felt very negative about it all and thought i wanted to stop just sort of give it all away
8209230 the beauty of it to me i suppose ultimately outside of the industry is were able to develop ourselves and better ourselves
8209231 and i think that in thinking i wanted to give this all away
8209232 and i think i just learned that films are kind of important in a way they can help people change their lives
8209233 we joked about the fact he hoped that i would do the film and he was already involved and i wanted to do it because he was in it and then we never really got to work together we sort of saw each other in hotel foyers

8209270 first there was the rousing iron man now marvel entertainment brings
8209271 the uptake of the service has been phenomenal and beyond our expectations hence the decision to launch the second business express some time in october this year we have faced some challenges as we did not expect this tremendous turnout from commuters
8209272 the train is no doubt benefiting commuters but parking is problem people park anywhere at pretoria station and if you have an emergency its highly unlikely that you will get out because you will be parked in
8209273 there is not enough space for everyone i guess metrorail did not expect such a huge turnout from commuters
8209274 the receptionist said i could put my name on a waiting list for when someone cancelled their ticket
8209275 they would then call me and give me the spot i was 20th on this waiting list
8209276 when i asked if i could buy a monthly ticket for september she told me i could only do that from august 25
8209277 as a precaution we have stationed a diesel locomotive to haul the train at high risk sections of the network to minimise commuter inconvenience

8209291 we felt all the time that we had the team to win a championship and hopefully it stays like that
8209292 we need to go out every day keep playing the way we know we can play and go from there
8209293 im just trying to help out any way i can
8209294 obviously i havent been seeing live pitching this summer so its been kind of tough but im getting back in the groove of things a little bit
8209295 its not so much coming in late to this team its just the time off i had was brutal
8209296 obviously this is nothing like college it takes time to adjust to it
8209297 we have not been able to get a lot of power
8209298 within the world of basketball within those trail blazers teams he was a jokester
8209299 he was a big loving teddy bear at times guys got frustrated because he didnt have a mean streak he was just a great guy he loved the team atmosphere loved being a teammate in those successful blazer teams
8209300 kevin will be remembered by fans as one of the most popular and recognizable players to ever wear the blazers uniform but to people who knew him hell be remembered as one of the warmest and biggest hearted
8209301 you wake up in the morning and its your first news of the day it just kind of hits you
8209302 for me i spent so much time with that young man and had so much success with him it really hurt its almost like losing a brother
8209303 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8209304 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8209305 its time to bring our jobs back and bring our troops home
8209306 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8209307 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry
8209308 you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8209309 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8209310 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8209311 i know were at the democratic national convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it
8209312 i knew he was going to make an impact on football and basketball
8209313 we won state in basketball made playoffs in football and he was a big part of it
8209314 hes real quick hes smart runs hard just a good ballplayer hes a good running back
8209315 hes one of those guys where he can go into a group of a whole bunch of people and then a couple seconds later you see him pop out and hes off to the races
8209316 as a guy on the punt return team knowing that hes back there that gives you a lot of confidence
8209317 it feels good but i got a lot of blocks too
8209318 thats why most people arent by me i got to break down a couple people thats great thats fun stuff but blockers are what start it out
8209319 we got someone ahead of me about 15 yards and hell say something when an opposing player passes him and thats how i know if i need to fair catch or not
8209320 i dont like to put my hand up ill take a hit he can hit me till i grab it and i can hold on to it throughout most hits
8209321 derek lulay hes good hes a little slower but he can throw some hits from the running position i probably wont split as many carries hopefully ill get more
8209322 ill have a little more pressure on me there but ill take the pressure
8209323 one of the things were going to try to do with him this year is get him in the open field with the ball
8209324 punt return kick return thats just something the fields naturally open on special teams i think thats why he excelled there
8209325 thats kind of something were going to try to do with the offense is just get in the open field and use that field vision to help us out
8209326 made a transfer for the better the people here are great theyve made me feel welcome as soon as i came
8209327 it worries me that we would have fewer kids taking that
8209328 the number of students that took the test is still higher than two years ago so thats good
8209329 well work to encourage more of these students to take the sat as seniors
8209330 we like the notion of more and more students taking it
8209331 our hope is that that will help generate interest in it
8209332 all red hatters are friends but you get reacquainted with those from other chapters
8209333 i have the flipped side and its the only one see

8209339 the chaplaincy at eastbourne contacted us after some kids said there was a body floating in the water
8209340 we were preparing to retrieve the body when all of a sudden a car drove off the cliff at the same time
8209341 we made our way to the car as it was more likely the man in the vehicle would still be alive
8209342 the tide was in which made it very difficult a coastguard helicopter spotted the second mans body in the water he had been thrown clear of the car
8209343 obviously that sort of thing does happen quite a lot at beachy head but the fact that this person drove off at the same time as we were preparing to remove a body has made it a little hard for us to take in

8209412 when we phoned sage on friday we couldnt get through to their software support either exasperated i phoned sage sales who said that their support had been swamped with calls because of the hmrc online problems
8209413 we are aware that some customers were receiving a 1046 error message when filing their online tax return this error has now been resolved
8209414 we usually get advance warning because clients are on phone if things are not right
8209415 we did refer them to hmrcs helpdesk but unfortunately until the second line technical teams have verified anything the helpdesk tends to be in denial mode

8209423 lucentis is an expensive drug costing more than 10 000 for each eye treated
8209424 but that cost needs to be balanced against the likely cost savings
8209425 it has been estimated that the costs related to sight impairment for patients treated with lucentis are around 8 000 cheaper than for patients who receive best supportive care over a 10 year period
8209426 our guidance means that patients who are suitable for this treatment will have the same access to it irrespective of where they live
8209427 it is a victory for thousands bringing overwhelming relief to desperate people across the country

8209433 the reimbursement scheme is an innovative approach which shows how pharmaceutical companies can work together with nice and the department of health to ensure patients do get access to treatments on the nhs
8209434 rapid implementation of the guidance is now needed to ensure that patients receive the treatment they need as soon as possible

8209550 the brains ability to reorganize itself is much greater than previously believed in our studies in which a group of sighted study subjects were blindfolded for five days we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight the speed and dynamic nature of the changes we observed suggest that rather than establishing new nerve connections which would take a long time the visual cortex is unveiling abilities that are normally concealed when sight is intact
8209551 we recruited 47 subjects to participate in the study half of the study participants remained completely blindfolded 24 hours a day for a total of five days under the careful watch of the staff of bidmcs general clinical research center the other half were only blindfolded for testing but spent the rest of the day seeing normally during their stays both sets of study participants underwent intensive braille instruction for four to six hours a day from a professional instructor from the carroll center for the blind
8209552 this extremely rapid adaptation indicates that functions that are normally inhibited in the brains visual cortex will come to the surface when they are needed we believe that over time if these adaptive functions are sustained and reinforced they will eventually lead to permanent structural changes
8209553 our brain captures different types of information from the world sounds sights smells or tactile sensations the impressions we form require us to merge these various different elements but sciences traditional view of brain function is that it is organized in separate and highly specialized systems
8209554 our study shows that these views are incorrect and illustrate the potential for the human brain to rapidly and dynamically reorganize itself we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight and we believe that these principles may also apply to other sensory loss such as deafness or loss of function following brain injury

8209562 die viren werden durch geschlechtsverkehr bertragen und haben eine inkubationszeit von zehn bis 15 jahren
8209563 der erste liegt bei etwa 30 jahren also entsprechend zehn bis 15 jahren nach dem ersten geschlechtsverkehr
8209564 der grund daf r kann sein dass die ehe gescheitert der partner gestorben ist oder die frau einfach in eine midlifecrises kommt
8209565 wir k nnen noch nicht sagen wie hoch die prozentuale heilungsquote ist sind uns aber sicher dass die impfung sinnvoll und n tzlich ist
8209566 wir glauben da wurde ein hoch riskanter test auf den markt gebracht der nicht ausreichend klinisch getestet wurde und der die gesundheit der bev lkerung gef hrden k nnte

8209579 we have developed a method that enables us to visualise fingerprints even after the print itself has been removed
8209580 for the first time we can get prints from people who handled a cartridge before it was fired wiping it down washing it in hot soapy water makes no difference and the heat of the shot helps the process we use
8209581 the procedure works by applying an electric charge to a metal say a gun or bullet which has been coated in a fine conducting powder similar to that used in photocopiers
8209582 even if the fingerprint has been washed off it leaves a slight corrosion on the metal and this attracts the powder when the charge is applied so showing up a residual fingerprint
8209583 the technique works on everything from bullet casings to machine guns even if heat vaporises normal clues police will be able to prove who handled a particular gun

8209632 articles in the media about studies on health safety and other matters often suffer from subtle statistical flaws than can cause major misunderstandings says an mit researcher the same is true for advertisements that cite scientific research he adds dr arnold i barnett contends that some statistical flaws were already present in the original studies while others reflect misconceptions by journalists about what the studies actually found the most cautious general course for the reader is to treat such reports more as public announcements that studies have been done than as clear guides to their content or reliability

8209634 as scientists were excited about this discovery because its a fundamentally new approach to regulating what enzymes do in cells the fact that it also offers a potentially novel use of a drug already widely in use for other applications is an unexpected bonus
8209635 understanding how the cell works should allow us to affect the activity of enzymes in one neighbourhood and leave alone their identical twins in a different neighbourhood in that cell
8209636 the idea is to use a pde5 inhibitor such as viagra selectively to inhibit platelet function we now know that not all the enzymes in the cell are doing the same job just like in real estate its all about the location

8209652 whether the brightest galaxies in clusters grew substantially in the last few billion years is intensely debated our observations show that in this time these galaxies have increased their mass by 50 per cent
8209653 most surprising is that in three of the four groups the brightest galaxy also has a bright companion galaxy these galaxy pairs are merging systems
8209654 the stars in these galaxies are already old and so we must conclude that the recent merging did not produce a new generation of stars
8209655 most of the stars in these galaxies were born at least 7 billion years ago

8209721 we won three medals in beijing and that gives us a lot of responsibility to keep the olympic momentum going
8209722 i see this as a great opportunity to promote olympic sports
8209723 we must now give our athletes the best opportunity so that they perform well at the london olympics in 2012
8209724 until now it was only cricket which is played by only 10 countries
8209725 but now we have olympic medallists who have won in competitions among over 200 countries olympic sports have come of age in the country
8209726 governments must do more many governments in the region are engaged but the laws are not sufficient and the application of laws does not prevent trafficking
8209727 all countries in south asia are destination origin and transit points for trafficking
8209728 the report sounds an alarm we have a very long way to go to understand the problem we have an even further distance to go before we can deal with the problem
8209729 madonna felt as if she has been living in a siege situation
8209730 the noise of the drilling meant she was forced to listen to her ipod at full volume potentially damaging her ears

8209736 well shes certainly telling friends shes planning to write a book
8209737 its supposed to be about her allegedly but come on you know lindsay will be all over that book shes the only one people want to read about
8209738 shes using my daughter people never even knew who samantha ronson was until she met lindsay she was just some l a dj and now shes writing a book i am at wits end with this stuff this is not in lindsays best interest
8209739 we have benefited a lot from radio since it enhances our general knowledge we should listen to the radio as the programmes help us immensely just as our parents and teachers do
8209740 after listening to the radio for half an hour students have improved significantly watching tv they can observe and listen but for the radio they ave to concentrate on the subject only by listening through radio we are imparting general knowledge to the students they have been told about their regular syllabus a revision of the same lesson first in classroom and then on radio will enable students to be more proficient
8209741 my wife and i thought of this when we were trying to come up with something new for the business
8209742 we wondered what is the best theme car we could have
8209743 the whole thing just escalated from there we thought it was such a wacky idea
8209744 its the shape thats the appeal its such a sexy looking car as soon as you sit in it you fall in love with it
8209745 theres just something about it theres so much detail i love it
8209746 no longer can pak hide its poor governance behind rifts with india afghan
8209747 that is a hard lesson to learn and one that will stick only if india afghanistan and the us take up the challenges it implies to take a long serious view of pakistans governance and the possibilities it might one day offer the region
8209748 god fulfills wishes of everyone who pray at the fair if one has faith in god all that is desired is fulfilled
8209749 visitors from pakistan can only pay tributes from a distance ever since 1999 there have been restrictions on them to cross the border they can only pray and make wishes from a distance they are given prasad after which return
8209750 supaul araria madhepura samastipur khagaria bhagalpur and saharsa districts are totally submerged in water and the tremendous loss cannot be assessed at this moment
8209751 the state government should have taken precautionary measures like repairing the damaged embankments store food grains keep boats etc in the affected areas in advance because flood is a regular feature bihar
8209752 they appreciate your respect for their privacy in this matter
8209753 i am very committed it is a very special time in my life i have a good feeling about the future
8209754 they are not going to disperse the crowd we are trying to negotiate
8209755 if you want to arrest us come here and arrest us here it is the government who must go
8209756 they the pad want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and stage a coup again
8209757 they have broken the law and it could be a serious setback for them
8209758 the government has a lot of options they have time on their side
8209759 tome la decisi n de hacer algo que la mayor parte de la gente no hace
8209760 desafortunadamente la mayor a de la gente gana un d lar e inclusive antes de que ese d lar llegue siquiera a su cheque salarial le pagan al gobierno alrededor de 27 centavos en impuestos federales
8209761 que no dependa de que te limites a un presupuesto o de que seas disciplinado
8209762 we found the abducted japanese man minutes ago he has been shot several times
8209763 but we are waiting to see in person to make 100 percent sure it is him
8209764 was a male body that appears to be of a japanese national
8209765 police closed the circle on abductors that is why they left him there bleeding
8209766 la nourriture etait digne dun chien mais pas digne dun roi
8209767 mi auguro che lo sco firmer una dichiarazione che esprima inequivocabilmente un sostegno alla posizione russa nel conflitto con tbilisi condannando la violenza e apprezzando il ruolo della russia nel mediare le ostilit
8209768 it is not part of the punishment it aims to reduce the likelihood that they will need to be punished again
8209769 anything which makes our children safer is a step in the right direction
8209770 well actually i have a studio at the house he benji actually helped me write some of the songs for my new album and for the bff show her new uk reality show for mtv hes a really amazing talent songwriter and singer
8209771 i was kind of afraid of obama the first time i saw him
8209772 i thought ive been burned by guys like you before
8209773 ive been burned by politicians before that i wanted to believe in and just didnt live up to it
8209774 and i was afraid to trust him and i was afraid to have hope when i first kind of became aware of him
8209775 i just said i cant deny how i feel about you barack obama i want you to be the president i want you in the white house
8209776 i just heard the other day he just paid off his student loans two years ago
8209777 and so when people talk about financial issues and the higher cost of education he really gets it
8209778 i think hes the sort of person that inspires us all to be our best selves
8209779 chris hoy thinks that the day chris hoy refers to chris hoy in the third person is the day that chris hoy disappears up his own arse
8209780 i dont think a public employee should be acting like this
8209781 we have no code of conduct that explicitly addresses off duty time
8209782 i felt the videos were reminiscent of what we see coming from al qadea when they want to spread terror to the peaceful people of the world
8209783 i find garcias actions disturbing and disgusting and i believe she has become unhinged
8209784 we were here first its not fair for them to have a job
8209785 he doesnt drink he doesnt smoke he takes care of his kids
8209786 not a xenophobic party not an intolerant party we are a compassionate party that follows the rule of law and endorses federal law
8209787 our nominee has tried to use this language and he has now backed away unruh said
8209788 if he has backed away from it then i think it is ok to put it in writing
8209789 sam winder from new mexico wanted to add language that welcomed other languages but did state that english was the official language of the country
8209790 right now i dont trust the republicans especially at the local level
8209791 its not an intuitive thing there are people who have been convicted in federal court
8209792 we need him in washington i dont think we can afford to lose him there
8209793 betrachtet jede andere instant messenger app f rs iphones als tot und vergraben
8209794 we have taught him certain things but other things like music he picks up he just likes to imitate what he hears
8209795 we listen to radio 4 a lot and he always joins in the pips before the news he also copies noises before you even realise you are doing them
8209796 my nephew had got the gravelly voice down to a tee and now leonard can do it too
8209797 he also whistles dock of the bay the theme tune from mission impossible renditions of red red wine ymca and perfect impressions of water splashing and a squeak in the floorboards
8209798 he doesnt do anything to order of course if people come around wanting to hear him he will often just sit there with his beak firmly shut

8209803 a vote is like a rifle its usefulness depends upon the character of the user
8209804 the girl who won is not caymanian by birth but she has her papers i dont think it is fair because the true caymanians who were up there couldnt win because a girl from st lucia won who i heard came here when she was 12 or 13
8209805 miss cayman should be a born caymanian not a paper caymanian
8209806 i thought the lions miss teen cayman organisers were better than this there was a jamaican girl who competed in miss teen cayman brac but she didnt win the title
8209807 if i was there at the lions club i probably would have raised a stink too
8209808 i dont have any problems with expats but when they win a title like miss cayman it really boils my blood
8209809 it is sad that they have chosen to focus on this because the miss cayman islands committee has made it our duty to prepare not only the winner of the pageant but also all the entrants to be exceptional representations of our country and be good role models for the future generation
8209810 we elected four professional and competent local judges and one foreign judge who we charged with the responsibility of picking the next miss cayman islands because we believed they would be fair and there is nothing to suggest that they werent
8209811 we are in line with the international rules nicosia met the criteria to participate in the pageant and is a citizen of this country we did our due diligence and liaised with immigration to ensure that all contestants have the proper documentation to enter the competition and she has that so really i dont understand what the problem is
8209812 the eligibility rules for entering the miss cayman islands pageant are in full alignment with those set for international contests such as miss world and miss universe
8209813 that being said miss nicosia lawson is a naturalised caymanian with caymanian status and a caymanian passport she has lived the majority of her life here in cayman and in the past has represented her chosen country overseas nicosia is not the first recipient to have possessed caymanian status numerous queens dating back many years have also done so
8209814 unfortunately all eight young caymanian ladies couldnt be crowned on saturday night at the lions centre
8209815 she has an exciting year to look forward to and has the full confidence and support of the miss cayman islands committee the ministry of tourism family friends and the community behind her nicosia we know you will continue to do us proud just as you and all of the contestants did this past saturday evening
8209816 cayman is all i know and is the country that i love and identify with

8209818 digicel finally caved and asked that we drop the appeal
8209819 i am grateful for this dynamic opportunity to be partnering with this soccer federation the first of it kind for kelme to do this kind of distribution we at kelme are very excited and have not taken this partnership lightly we are looking forward for a long and lasting relationship
8209820 i am excited about this partnership the hospitality was great i met with majority of the clubs and the responses were favourable this is like a pet project being the first sponsorship agreement that kelme has ever signed with any company both in north america and in the caribbean
8209821 i have no doubt that this will be a lasting business relationship between kelme and the cayman islands football association which will only get better as time goes by
8209822 anything they tried to do would all have to be according to the law because people would tear it to pieces there are houses along there now and the public has been using the cove for years and years
8209823 there is no way of fencing off that land and the public is going to continue to use it
8209824 and there will be constant bickering between the public and the owner any condo owners will be in a constant fight
8209825 id be delighted if someone did something with that parcel of land people suffer with noise litter all night parties loud music its just unbelievable there is nothing that doesnt go on in there the neighbours would love to have something in there
8209826 if youd really like to know i think itd be nice it would cut us off from the cove which is a pretty rough place a couple of years ago there were some people actually living over there in the brush they pitched a big blue tent and plumbed into the electric lines they had it made no one even knew they were in there
8209827 he mr thomas bought the colliers land as an investment
8209828 and its very possible he bought the south sound property for the same reasons its very important to remember what smith cove means to the caymanian people
8209829 if you wanted to impress caymanians it would be good to be able to say you were donating that land to the government
8209830 why would you want to build condos next to smith cove anyway
8209831 you get a million people in there at the weekend with boom boxes
8209832 it would depend on what he mr thomas put in there
8209833 a private home maybe some small apartments would be all right but wed hate to see major development wed like to see it cleaned up more
8209834 condos or commercial development might create problems in the neighbourhood and we certainly wouldnt entertain anything with a liquor licence i just wish theyd leave the area along here for homes there are too many condos already its just getting to be too much
8209835 there is still a lot of uncertainty on the political front people just want to get out of the market
8209836 the margins between costs and the gold price are shrinking as the companies try to dig out a wasting asset
8209837 all of this activity is happening at a difficult time operationally for gold fieldss south african mines all this change marks a period of heightened execution risk
8209838 harmony has had quite a big clean up and they are doing better on costs than before
8209839 the prevailing power and labour issues have highlighted the vulnerability of the south african miners to higher costs and production disruptions
8209840 after all the talk this week about the clintons can you imagine how happy democrats would be about a republican revolt in st paul about john mccains choice for vp
8209841 its an attack ad it attacks me personally its nasty its mean spirited frankly it tells you more about sen mccain than it does about me that he would run an ad like that
8209842 i must admit that the mccain ad was well it was reminiscent of what he did against george w bush in 2000 which is you recall he accused president bush of twisting the truth like bill clinton and again this is the kind of nasty personal attack which really doesnt have a place in this process
8209843 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8209844 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8209845 to prop up existing organizations as opposed to creating fresh educational practices in the schools
8209846 at the end of five years will we have broken the mold not much seems to be bubbling up that is inspiring or substantive
8209847 the fact that obama and ayers were working together stems from the pretty sharp left leaning ideology that both of them shared to some extent
8209848 its absurd and disingenuous for the obama campaign to say we are running this ad they are trying to blame us and use a straw man to take this issue off the table if he thinks having a relationship with an unrepentant terrorist is not an issue that concerns the american people he is deluding himself or being naive
8209849 captures all the random absurdity of mtvs the state and all the topical significance of dave chappelle
8209850 the two hijackers and the seven crew are still inside we are continuing to negotiate with them
8209851 we are condemning first the hijacking of a civilian aeroplane and we are now in continuous contact and consultation with the libyan authorities in kufra airport
8209852 it is not clear whether there is one or more or whether they belong to abdul wahid were not expecting him to say yes
8209853 the hijackers claim to have coordinated with him nur to join him in paris
8209854 we categorically deny the responsibility of our movement in this hijacking operation
8209855 is a true leader of a rebellion of the resistance in darfur who says that he does not know these people and that he absolutely refuses to use these methods
8209856 no one declared responsibility for the hijacking all the rebels until now denied the operation
8209857 the decision of where to send aid was made at the highest level of the pentagon and the only decision was to send it to batumi
8209858 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8209859 we are proud to be a vital part of the ciscs
8209860 we feel it is very important for the youth of the cayman islands to have the opportunity to access the resources and expertise needed to learn to sail
8209861 all of us at conyers dill amp pearman understand that sailing is important in each of our firms jurisdictions and i am particularly pleased that we can make this contribution to facilitate the sport here in cayman
8209862 this was my first international regatta and i am looking to get as much racing experience as possible over the next few years my goals are to race at the byte world championships in 2009 and the world youth sailing championships in 2010
8209863 i like sailing the byte because it is fast and exciting
8209864 i also like sailing single handed boats because i like being completely responsible for the outcome of the race
8209865 are the many international people that i can meet here and the beaches i really love the beaches especially those at east end
8209866 you can feel the effort that it took to get these games together
8209867 china is a place that doesnt hold back when it comes to effort and that is one of the things that the great wall signifies when you see it firsthand
8209868 i will also be thinking about what the next olympics will be like
8209869 not only being more experienced and being more ready but also having the experience of being here at the games knowing that not everyone in the world can get to experience that from an athletes standpoint
8209870 it is really magnificent to see what humans can do if they push themselves to the limit
8209871 it just underscored what the olympics is all about human greatness pushing themselves to the limit just like cydonie and just like ronald they pushed themselves to the limit
8209872 cydonie made the finals our first for the cayman islands they have been great ambassadors for our country the cayman people are known for their friendliness and everyone wants to just be around them and they have had a great experience we all have
8209873 the players are adjusting to the training well fitness coach thiago is taking them through the motions and they are adapting to it these players have potential they only need to be determined and do their part by scoring goals and winning the games
8209874 we need the communities to come out and support them during these games inspiring them as they excel to the next phase of the competition
8209875 all i am saying is that when the investors offer to build hotels you caribbean governments need to say you can build your hotel but you also need to build a museum or a theatre
