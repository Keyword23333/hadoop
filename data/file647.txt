6470000 the mccain campaign continues to level dishonest attacks on barack obamas integrity and patriotism
6470001 mislead the american people in order to obscure his own record of failed policy judgments
6470002 he and his neoconservative foreign policy types that he agreed with are one of the reasons that george w bush decided to go to iraq
6470003 im sure he mccain loves his country its just that loving your country and lying to the american people are apparently not inconsistent in his view
6470004 we might not have gotten into iraq if the war were being fought by a broader spectrum of americas young men and women
6470005 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
6470006 it looks very nice and wide with a smooth surface it also looks like good fun track but we wont really know until tomorrow as there is big difference between walking a track and driving it at almost 300 km h
6470007 learning a new track to start with is not too difficult and just takes a few laps to find out which way the corners go but after that you continue to learn small details about it i dont find it too hard to deal with a new track the only place i found any bumps is where the track goes over a bridge and theres one in the middle of a corner that might have an effect but apart from that it looks like the people here have done a very good job
6470008 of course i would have liked to have won more races but the opportunities were sometimes missed
6470009 but i am still in a good position in the championship and while the season so far could have been better it could also have gone the other way and been a lot worse i am hoping we get some good results for the remaining races to get back to where we should be the main issue has been getting stuck behind other drivers in the race after having had a bad qualifying session if we can sort that out we should be fine coming up now are some circuits that i really like we have good speed in our package and the important thing is to make sure we use that speed in qualifying because that is the crucial point of the weekend getting the car to work the way i want is just a matter of some very small things but thats enough to make the difference some times we get it right but unfortunately we seem to have got it wrong more often so far now we have found a solution that helps to make the car a bit easier to drive in qualifying even though it looks as though you can overtake here it is still very important to try and start from the front but in general i am not worried about the rest of the season the pressure is always there but at the moment it is not getting bigger as the championship gets nearer the end then there will be maybe more pressure not to make any mistakes
6470010 mts has made an agreement with apple on the sale of iphones
6470011 there have been plenty of graphic prints out there in recent seasons but its usually a lot of the same style over and over again how many more skulls can there be
6470012 to us there is so much more than making a cute little dress in an interesting print
6470013 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6470014 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6470015 beckhams story is a modern day fairytale of heroes villains love and what it means to lead your country
6470016 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6470017 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6470018 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6470019 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6470020 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6470021 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6470022 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6470023 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6470024 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6470025 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6470026 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6470027 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6470028 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6470029 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6470030 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6470031 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6470032 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6470033 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6470034 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6470035 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6470036 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6470037 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6470038 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6470039 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6470040 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6470041 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6470042 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6470043 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6470044 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6470045 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6470046 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6470047 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6470048 this independence was not a gift but as the result of fighting against the colonialist to get the victory
6470049 go back and do something for the sake of nation
6470050 our goal is always to deliver sports to fans across any platform and this is yet another agreement that fulfills that strategy
6470051 bring our game to our fans in a variety of new and exciting ways
6470052 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6470053 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6470054 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6470055 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6470056 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6470057 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6470058 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6470059 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6470060 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6470061 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6470062 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6470063 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6470064 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6470065 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6470066 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6470067 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6470068 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6470069 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6470070 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6470071 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6470072 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
6470073 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza

6470076 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
6470077 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
6470078 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6470079 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
6470080 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
6470081 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
6470082 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
6470083 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
6470084 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
6470085 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
6470086 we are the largest for profit debt management company in the country with award winning customer service
6470087 we are an industry innovator and we have the results to prove it but our biggest asset is our people
6470088 be even more ruthless and focus on usability almost like a haiku
6470089 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6470090 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6470091 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6470092 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6470093 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6470094 i think if you ask people what their favorite counting crows record is a lot of them would probably say august and everything after i was wondering if that was yours as well or if not what would be
6470095 wow when i was really in the middle of that happening that was really thats creepy or thats powerful
6470096 a workforce drawn from a diverse base of former special operations defense intelligence and law enforcement professionals ready on a moments notice for global deployment
6470097 hes not listening to his people and he should be listening to his people if he was listening to his people maybe fredy villanueva would still be alive today
6470098 we dont say its a bad idea and we dont say its a good idea
6470099 but a lot of people ask for a public inquiry on that and we cant ignore that so that is why we say well have a good reflection on that
6470100 the current system lacks transparency it lacks public confidence and it seems more designed to obscure matters keep information from the families of those who have died or been seriously injured
6470101 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6470102 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6470103 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6470104 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6470105 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6470106 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6470107 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6470108 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6470109 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6470110 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6470111 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6470112 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6470113 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6470114 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6470115 we met dale when we played at james simons gist street loft in uptown we went through hundreds of photographs and found the ones that dale thought were the most profound its a polish band called spielman kapelye and buddy boltons band from new orleans and both are pictures from 1905

6470119 you can find it in calypso music a realm they explore in venezuela by jewish creole composer lionel belasco often referred to as the scott joplin of calypso on the first part of each measure theres a hesitancy a limping that rhythm exists in the habanera and throughout the whole caribbean culture also in new orleans music and greek and turkish music
6470120 its about looking around you what is part of my culture but what can we learn from others
6470121 in african american music you mostly hear rap and hip hop but there are many other things
6470122 we just want to remind people of the beauty of that and we picked these styles because we felt some sort of closeness to them
6470123 i dont like the idea of a compartmentalized society where certain things have to be the exclusive property of certain ethnic groups
6470124 little dark baby little jew baby little outcast america is seeking the stars
6470125 people are being driven apart from one another but we use our music to say that there is a greater whole of humanity common thread between all these groups of people and the music can help show this oneness
6470126 were not black and were not jewish but theres no reason why you have to be either of those things to play this music or even to appreciate it on a deep level
6470127 if youd like to hang out and eat me drop a line

6470130 we spent 250 000 on the site last year and again this year to bring it up to where it should be
6470131 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6470132 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6470133 i was supposed to be meeting this guy out here at midnight but he n
6470134 the ionsound residency will be great for our undergraduate and graduate composers because our students will be able to work with this ensemble on an ongoing basis
6470135 the group is open to new music of all styles and will help the students develop their craft through rehearsing and performing their compositions
6470136 because we are a liberal arts department not a conservatory we lack the performance resources of those institutions
6470137 instead we bring professional ensembles to perform on our music on the edge new music series and then invite them to stay to work with our graduate composers
6470138 working with professional musicians and a distinguished composition faculty is the best way to learn the art of composition now pitt will have both
6470139 sources very very reliable tell me alvarez is going to happen

6470146 i look opon socialism with a human face and dubceks reforms with the same distance as people in the west look upon hippies the political messages during dubceks time was also on thin ice socialism and democracy sovereignty and friendship with the soviet union democracy and a one party government a true czech stew dish of everything prague spring as a fight for freedom is a myth
6470147 our first priority is the security of the children and the personnel
6470148 so if theres a major protest definitely the kids will not be in school
6470149 its a shame that students are caught between those two problems because theyre not implicated in the negotiations or anything theyre really caught in the middle
6470150 bring me solid proof that the business will come and install themselves there and then well see what we can do
6470151 i strongly advise the public especially those at high risk for listeriosis such as the elderly pregnant women and those with weak immune systems to make sure they avoid consuming these products
6470152 the pattern was people in certain long term care facilities
6470153 those people who were arrested in saint john are of interest to us right now based on the investigation were doing

6470155 i do verily believe that when god shall accomplish it unity it will be the effect of love and not the cause of love it will proceed from love before it brings forth love
6470156 when i have communion with a saint i must not look so much whether he be of such an opinion or whether he have taken the covenant or to have been baptized once or twice or them times but see if he have fellowship with the father and with jesus christ
6470157 labor mightily for a healing spirit away with all discriminating names whatever that man hinder the applying of balm to heel your woulds discord and division become no christian for wolves to worry the lambs is no wonder but for one lamb to worry another this is unnatural and monstrous
6470158 and if ever we intend to take one step towards any agreement or unity it must be by fixing this principle in the minds of all men that it is of no advantage to any man whatever church or way in christian religion he be of unless he personally believe the promises and live in obedience unto all the precepts of christ and that for him who doth so it is a trampling of the whole gospel under foot to say that his salvation could be endangered by his not being of this or that church or way especially considering how much of the world hath immixed itself into all the known ways that are in it

6470161 these folders are restricted via annenberg challenge until further notice
6470162 libraries of course exist not to restrict information but to make it available to the public i would hate to think that uic library was doing anything less than all it could to permit public access to these important materials

6470168 youre going to see an even bigger exit in the airline industry
6470169 one is that ingenuity american or otherwise will overcome the problem in terms of oil prices the second is that well wrestle it to the ground with technology and the third type of response and this one doesnt have a specific argument is that this just cant happen

6470175 in 2006 i went to my first nearfest i had an amazing time it made me feel like i was in a music camp for the weekend i got to hear bands ive known and ones i didnt know
6470176 when i first came here 28 years ago there were cool places you still had the stanley graffiti the syria mosque the decade and the sound in those venues was good in todays environment theres less places for bands to play that fit that quality of sound and venue size although we do have the rex mr smalls club cafe and the theater in homestead
6470177 theyre used to doing country and western and they do a dinner and show type of thing which wasnt what i had in mind at all
6470178 the seating is semi in the round with no seat more than 60 feet from the stage there wont be any food or drinks in the venue those will be in a big tent outside the exit doors
6470179 there are maybe 200 people around here who might go see carl palmer or allan holdsworth or the flower kings and i needed to try to attract interest from the music scene here
6470180 around the time i talked to them they had lost their bass player so it was a missed opportunity
6470181 therell be people coming from all over who go to the other festivals but to build something in pittsburgh you need to have some type of base if can build a base of 300 400 people from the area thats enough to draw from
6470182 ive also seen people bringing their college age and high school age kids to these shows lately and thats where the future lies

6470186 fifteen years ago theres no way a guy like me could start a business
6470187 i was every kind of geek and one of the geeks that i was was a band geek
6470188 you know its not on my schedule i imagine the relationship that i have with the good people of scranton that every single scrantonian man woman and child will be showing up on aug 20 to go see the rocker so probably theres no need for me to show up
6470189 a modern classic about a little girl who wants to join the high school football team
6470190 i gotta move with the acting thing because thats panning out
6470191 ive always been in supporting roles kind of reacting to other people and my character fish the heavy metal drummer hes got to drive the film its his energy and his wants and needs and desires that are the motor that push through the film and that definitely took some getting used to
6470192 fun things to do behind the kit to pump up the crowd and put on a show
6470193 theres so many disconnects in hollywood movies even in almost famous as great a movie as that is the music kind of sucks i mean who remembers fever dog as a song
6470194 you got to believe that this kid is writing these songs and can sing and play them he just looks so natural with a guitar slung over him and its such a great voice and you can tell that its his voice singing not some studio musicians voice
6470195 i got to hang out with him he was a great guy he has a really great sense of humor and a great sense of peace about the whole thing he is the original booted drummer and i guess the spark for the idea of the movie
6470196 ive waited on about a billion tables in my lifetime catered about a million catered events but i also had office jobs
6470197 what it gives you especially shakespeare and other classic texts is the importance of language and how to use it the importance of making strong choices about the character and about where they begin and where they end and the use of physicality to support the character and the language
6470198 people are really digging this movie i dont know about reviewers its not like the most original movie in the world i guess but its such a feel good fun old fashioned romp and audiences go crazy for it i think also movies nowadays are very r rated and dark the rocker kind of feels like a john hughes movie a fun for the whole family kind of rock comedy
6470199 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6470200 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6470201 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6470202 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6470203 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6470204 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6470205 report from every state in the nation during the 50 days leading up to the presidential election
6470206 hannah montana and miley cyrus best of both worlds concert
6470207 fill the franklins 1895 victorian palm house with volumes of changing light and color
6470208 the subject of pain is the business i am in
6470209 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6470210 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6470211 it was a good omen for a cat to walk towards you
6470212 it has nothing to do with her or her performance or her listenership or her sponsorship
6470213 it was slicing the talk pie pretty thin and we just found that quite honestly it was like trying to push a boulder uphill
6470214 of a certain mind set who are hungry to hear their own voice coming back at them on the radio
6470215 the station is on for 24 hours but my three hours were the only revenue producing hours
6470216 you could drive from the east coast to the west coast and never hear anything other than a right wing point of view
6470217 recognizing that western pennsylvania has predominantly been a democratic area
6470218 lynn has offered an alternative and thats probably what people are going to miss the most
6470219 we wanted to make this movie part of the national conversation before the election
6470220 we are actually showing the film at both the democratic and republican conventions after the premiere
6470221 we are hoping that the presidential candidates will take up these issues and take a leadership position in helping to resolve them and lead a conversation about them which is not happening now
6470222 its economics and it seems like a difficult subject to understand
6470223 but we have succeeded in making it a fun and entertaining movie we convey an important message but at the same time its not so heavy people cant understand it
6470224 we intentionally didnt want to make it like inconvenient truth or any michael moore film
6470225 we wanted to make this entertaining but also convey the important message of the crisis we face
6470226 its a perfect opportunity both to celebrate the history of television and at the same time introduce new generations to some of the mediums most important events
6470227 summer doldrums for gold and gold equities may be over
6470228 yamana has quickly seen its brand recognition rise over the past two years as a new tier ii gold producer
6470229 the truth is that there is no painter like my father
6470230 i want my children to appreciate the work of their grandfather
6470231 who knows if any of them will follow in his footsteps one has shown potential but well see what happens
6470232 we must thank that de niro came from new york in order to support the exhibition
6470233 his sensitivity towars the work of his father is admirable
6470234 that theres nothing you can do to us that we arent already doing to ourselves
6470235 i dont care where you stand or which party you support
6470236 i grew up in alaska where we didnt have electricity so my father taught me to yodel
6470237 i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
6470238 in the real world thats what tolerance means putting up with something giving it equal time particularly if you dont agree with it last time i checked opinions were equally valid i tolerate your opinion and you tolerate mine its only tolerance if you are putting up with something that you do not like
6470239 i believe that gay marriage should be legalized and if you disagree with me then you are intolerant
6470240 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
6470241 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
6470242 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
6470243 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
6470244 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
6470245 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6470246 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6470247 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6470248 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6470249 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6470250 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6470251 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6470252 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6470253 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6470254 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6470255 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6470256 other people have done it so were not going to bother
6470257 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6470258 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6470259 by transitioning to an mpeg 4 network aliant is investing in a platform for the future which brings even higher quality video to our aliant tv customers

6470266 thirty years is pretty good and the show is still very popular

6470269 i like to help people but im here to follow my dreams
6470270 an unprecedented opportunity for a community that is underrepresented on television we applaud tyra banks and the cw for making this historic visibility of transgender people possible
6470271 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of be rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
6470272 the polyrhythms start snaking around each other but you still know exactly where you are
6470273 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6470274 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6470275 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6470276 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
6470277 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
6470278 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
6470279 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
6470280 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6470281 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6470282 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6470283 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6470284 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6470285 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6470286 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6470287 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6470288 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6470289 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6470290 as a leading conditional access player in the market latens understands the complexity of successful mass deployment of security technology in the set top box so gmi is pleased to be integrated with latens bcas and to provide new solutions to operators as latens bcas is the only effective software cas solution for one way dvb c networks we are now able to offer a unique solution that is highly competitive and very cost effective giving operators greater choice and flexibility when launching pay tv services

6470294 lolol i guess you realized you wouldnt be able to keep the site if only the council voted
6470295 if the site is designed for being a simple business site not to be using anything past text and smilies
6470296 a smart look at politics pop culture and all the days top stories
6470297 can you ever forgive me memoirs of a literary forger
6470298 tavis smiley presents america i am the african american imprint
6470299 what the exhibition does is tells the story of the african american imprint on this country for the 400 years that weve been here starting with the first slaves who arrived in jamestown va 400 years ago all the way up to barack obama
6470300 its important to know that there is a back story to barack obama he didnt just fall out of the sky theres a back story that made this moment possible
6470301 so much black history and so much american history thats come out of the great city of pittsburgh
6470302 never before has this much black history been assembled in one place
6470303 it gives the chance for all of america to see what the contributions of african americans have been to this country
6470304 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6470305 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6470306 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6470307 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6470308 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6470309 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6470310 dire o de vera egito todos produzidos pela ioi filmes etc estar o no 19 festival internacional de curtas de s o paulo
6470311 during the creation of this album we finally discovered the now on sound and have created a piece of music that truly expresses our uniqueness
6470312 when we looked at 3g the chipsets are not quite mature in the sense that theyre not low enough power for what we were looking for we cared a lot about battery life and we cared a lot about physical size
6470313 yes he may not be aggressive on the base paths he may not be a fan of bunting ever and he just couldnt get along with brandon phillips
6470314 i would expect that we would be the first to know if mark had interest in going back on the air someplace other than espn
6470315 weve taken mark off the air pursuant to our contractual rights

6470318 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6470319 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6470320 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6470321 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6470322 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6470323 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6470324 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6470325 feeling of peace security and exaltation happiness and well being when in the clothing of the other sex
6470326 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
6470327 hi ty this is phil how much did you want again
6470328 were getting fairly close to getting clearance in terms of him getting his visa meehan said i would think by the end of the next week hell get it thats the last conversation i had with a contract at the u s embassy
6470329 looked up the translation of nikita filatovs name nikita means inconquerable filat or filatov means god guard inconquerable god guard not a bad name
6470330 he fights with zero defense and welcomes punches to his face with a big smile his warrior spirit is reminiscent to that of his deceased indian warrior heroes crazy horse sitting bull and geronimo
6470331 the 5 hole cbj news and notes 8 19 08
6470332 i checked those schools out but i was born to be a buckeye
6470333 i have to teach people what i know worked for me
6470334 i have to teach people what i know worked for me im responsible but what they poured into me how they blessed my life the older generation now that im a part of the older generation its my responsibility to pour into the generation thats come after me
6470335 its about saving our youth a lot of our youth dont understand their value they just accept the lies that the enemy has told them about their worth about what they can accomplish and about what they should settle for
6470336 im fired up about firing up young people to understand their power and their worth
6470337 i love singing with bebe we have a great time on stage in the studio we have a great time we do what we do and so its not something thats weird i think im more at home with that than even by myself
6470338 always sisters becoming the princess you were created to be
6470339 i could do these girls conferences full time because its just life changing when you take out time and you see those faces and you see the encouragement and you get them to realize who they are and whose they are its just nothing else compared to that to me
6470340 the abuse that happens when people in power high rank holders use their rank to exploit demean or gain unfair advantage over those of lower rank
6470341 dignity for all how to create a world without rankism
6470342 the olympics are a great festival of human beings seeking rank and thats ok
6470343 we all seek high rank and we rather enjoy watching other people seek gold medals and we applaud the victor and feel sorry for the loser
6470344 were assuming these people arent cheating and if any of them are thats rankism thats the abuse of the process through which rank is earned legitimately
6470345 there are other egregious forms of rankism but we dont get to see that on our tv screen a few coaches really abusing their athletes
6470346 it went on in east germany it went on famously in gymnastics where young girls have their futures compromised both nutritionally and otherwise by brutal coaches
6470347 rankism happens when we over celebrate the victory and having lionized the victor then give that victor all sort of special privileges
6470348 its we gullible people who think winner takes all means winner knows everything
6470349 winner doesnt winner knows how to hit the baseball or knows how to swim winner doesnt know which car is better than another car
6470350 when you have a company where everybody feels dignified they work harder they get sick less often they love the boss they go the extra mile and theyre a team
6470351 they know that everybody has equal dignity from the ceo to the janitor and all of them are invited to the christmas party and everybodys contribution is acknowledged and essential
6470352 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6470353 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6470354 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6470355 we suffer from a fiscal cancer it is growing inside us
6470356 our country would need 53 trillion invested today which is about 175 000 per person to deliver on the governments obligations and promises how much of this 53 trillion do we have zip
6470357 when brown needs defense down low he can go to anderson varejao
6470358 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6470359 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6470360 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6470361 it takes it to a whole new level when you see the game on a screen thats more than 50 feet wide
6470362 if they wanted to book a four hour window we could certainly go later in the evening
6470363 if the theatre manager has the staffing they could go till two in the morning

6470366 students experience the mentoring culture of peace and the nsse results demonstrate the efforts of faculty and staff in producing the types of behaviors that lead to student success
6470367 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
6470368 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
6470369 new book out and making the move to open access
6470370 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6470371 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6470372 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6470373 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6470374 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6470375 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6470376 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6470377 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6470378 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6470379 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6470380 i want to see a breast will you make my dream come true
6470381 at centerd weve been thinking about how to solve the challenges that exist in making plans
6470382 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy
6470383 this revision of the academic understanding of technology contributes to weakening technocratic rationales for public policy a new era of technical politics has begun
6470384 the average briton is not only using the net more they are going online faster than they used to
6470385 we are deeply saddened and shocked by the sudden and unexpected death of our leader gene upshaw our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife terri and their three sons eugene justin and daniel
6470386 gene learned he was sick just this past sunday and he died with his family at his side we ask that the media respect our need to begin the process of dealing with this unexpected tragedy and to begin the grieving process
6470387 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6470388 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6470389 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6470390 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6470391 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
6470392 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
6470393 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
6470394 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
6470395 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
6470396 ha sido la tormenta m s fuerte que he visto en mi vida
6470397 i believe my wife to be very creative so of course im interested in how she thinks and there seems to be no end to the desire to be creative i find that invigorating and interesting
6470398 you know you have conversations some deep some shallow thats the same in everybodys relationship
6470399 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6470400 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided

6470403 did ravens fans eat paint chips when they were kids
6470404 just how many rider fans do you think therell be
6470405 well if theyve got 22 000 season tickets here im betting at least 20 000 rider fans for sure
6470406 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6470407 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6470408 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6470409 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6470410 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6470411 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6470412 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6470413 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6470414 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6470415 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6470416 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6470417 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6470418 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6470419 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6470420 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6470421 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6470422 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6470423 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6470424 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6470425 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6470426 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6470427 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6470428 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6470429 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6470430 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6470431 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6470432 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6470433 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6470434 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6470435 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6470436 if you give a dance you have to pay the band
6470437 to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right
6470438 mayers childish behavior only confirms she was right to dump him now hes acting like a spoiled child expect jen to behave like a lady
6470439 i left here when i was 21 and when i left here i was a drug addict
6470440 but like so many ex drug addicts i just switched from drugs to alcohol and then i became an alcoholic
6470441 it was a film about drugs and he talked the producer into hiring me as a consultant
6470442 i would leave every day go to hollywood work on the movie and return at night
6470443 i read about 25 screenplays all of which were crap
6470444 so i sat down and wrote dance in about three months
6470445 i got these rave reviews and i thought i was william shakespeare
6470446 i had the most money i ever had in my life
6470447 i didnt buy a new car or anything i put it all in the bank and drank it up
6470448 i checked into the drunk hospital and have been sober ever since
6470449 i didnt know you love your grandchildren more than you love your original children
6470450 once i had a grandbaby i had to stick around see how this turns out
6470451 in my situation everything that could go right did i was out of the hospital in eight days and back to playing basketball in two months
6470452 i never thought about donating organs until i needed a liver
6470453 i tell people if i was working the pearly gates and you showed up missing some organs id move you to the front of the line
6470454 in politics everyone wants to be seen as a mudslinging virgin who like king lear is
6470455 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6470456 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6470457 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6470458 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6470459 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6470460 the movie revolves around a singular day when jimmy page the edge and jack white first met and sat down together to share their stories teach and play
6470461 captures the guitarists as each explains and demonstrates how he changed the sound of the electric guitar to suit his own distinctive musical style
6470462 were doing jokes about people in his orbit not really about him
6470463 people have a tendency to react as far as their ideology allows them
6470464 i think some of us were maybe too quick to caricature al gore and john kerry and theres maybe some reluctance to do the same thing to him
6470465 anything that has even a whiff of being racist no one is going to laugh
6470466 the audience is not going to allow anyone to do that
6470467 most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
6470468 totally inappropriate and frankly i understand if sen obama and his supporters would find it offensive
6470469 we put people in a crazy box they might be truly offended by it but the reaction is part of the standard digestive process bill maher who is host of a politically oriented late night show on hbo said if you cant do irony on the cover of the new yorker where can you do it one issue that clearly has some impact on writing jokes about obama is a consistency among the big late night shows not only are all the hosts white the vast majority of their audiences are white i think white audiences get a little self conscious if race comes up sweeney of obriens show said things might be somewhat different if even one late night host was black black comics are not having any trouble joking about obama said david alan grier a comedian who starting in october will have a satirical news magazine show on comedy central chocolate news i tell jokes on stage about him grier said reciting a few that would not ever get onto a network late night show nor into the new york times but he said of the late night hosts those guys really cant go there its just like the gay comic can do gay material it comes with the territory
6470470 no way theyve had 200 years of presidential jokes its our time jimmy kimmel the host of the abc late night talk show jimmy kimmel live
6470471 theres a weird reverse racism going on you cant joke about him because hes half white its silly i think its more a problem because hes so polished he doesnt seem to have any flaws maher said that being sensitive to obama was in no way interfering with his commentary though on hbo he has more freedom about content than other comedians theres been this question about whether hes black enough
6470472 i have this joke what does he have to do dunk he bowled a 37 to me thats black enough kimmel said i think his ears should be the focus of the jokes mostly the late night shows seem to be in a similar position were just waiting
6470473 there hasnt been a lot of frame of reference about obama yet not like hillary or mccain but there will be
6470474 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6470475 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6470476 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6470477 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6470478 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6470479 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6470480 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care
6470481 if we use their tactics well lose the moral high ground
6470482 a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor

6470490 weve had a lot of things said about fans here
6470491 most of them you cant repeat thats their opinion they get to come from the outside and look in i think a lot of players they ask knowing their free agent year is coming up they try to get a feel for how the fans are i think they have a good idea of how the team is they like the team they enjoy the team a lot of times and ive actually heard it they dont want to put their family and kids in a situation where they come to the field and these are the types of things their kids are going to have to sit through and listen to thats just the truth those arent my words those are words that ive actually heard

6470493 weve got a bad thing made by men and by god thats something we can change
6470494 it honors the hard work of so many people who supported sen clinton
6470495 many of the pennsylvania delegates worked their heart out for sen clinton and theyre excited to cast a vote for her from my vantage point that will be closure for them
6470496 the government has taken tremendous liberties with our liberty taking away our liberty in the name of fighting terrorism using fear to take away peoples rights and their privacy in this country
6470497 and thats caused me and a lot of americans to lose a great deal of faith in the government which ought to be protecting our liberties not taking them away
6470498 they simply dont want the competition from an outsider so to speak somebody that might make them feel uncomfortable by raising some issues some new perspectives some new choices for the american people
6470499 youll get to see hillary speak on tuesday and barack obama the next president of the united states on thursday
6470500 and i hear hillary and you will have a chat ill make sure to stop by

6470504 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6470505 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6470506 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6470507 why do you need us to join the climate debate are you saying because i am black i am not involved already or that you need more useful victims for your cause agenda
6470508 it becomes evident that while discussing climate we are not witnessing a clash of views about the environment but a clash of views about human freedom
6470509 as someone who lived under communism for most of my life i feel obliged to say that the biggest threat to freedom democracy the market economy and prosperity at the beginning of the 21st century is not communism or its various softer variants
6470510 why do so many people who subscribe to the belief in global warming also subscribe to the leftist liberal viewpoint on so many matters why does this belief appeal to those that have a certain political view
6470511 what does a cane toad and salt water intrusion have to do with global warming see you liberals just flip and spin flip and spin obama is an expert at it
6470512 it didnt take us long to figure out what this
6470513 if the lawyers will take the case sue the people who sell carbon credits that includes al gore that lawsuit would get so much publicity so much media attention and as the experts went to the witness stand and testified i feel like that could become the vehicle to finally put some light on the fraud of global warming
6470514 also i dont think that the republicans have handled the war on terror very well either
6470515 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
6470516 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
6470517 after the crimes they know they have committed and that many of us know they have committed because we have seen the evidence some of which has even appeared on the corporate whore news media of late

6470542 if you look at the domain of natural resources here in canada there are some opportunities there we might explore
6470543 where are the opportunities that maybe somebodys left open or are there opportunities to do things here in canada we havent looked at before
6470544 as much as half of the water used to grow food globally may be lost or wasted
6470545 thats like leaving the tap running and pouring 40 trillion liters 10 6 trillion gallons of water into the garbage can enough water to meet the household needs of 500 million people
6470546 improving water productivity and reducing the quantity of food that is wasted can enable us to provide a better diet for the poor and enough food for growing populations
6470547 reaching the target we propose a 50 percent reduction of losses and wastage in the production and consumption chain is a necessary and achievable goal
6470548 uts program which will begin in 2010 will distinguish itself with its faculty having extensive academic industry and cultural experience

6470551 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6470552 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6470553 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6470554 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6470555 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6470556 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6470557 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6470558 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
6470559 given the significant rally in the u s dollar that has taken place over the last two and a half weeks i think the market has gotten a little bit over extended here and weve entered into a bit of a corrective phase
6470560 for the most part the main catalyst still comes back to price action in the commodity markets and with a substantial spike higher in oil today were seeing not only the u s dollar weaken off against the major currencies but thats been a benefit for the canadian dollar given the positive correlation between crude and the loonie
6470561 if military activity heats up again pipeline flows into europe could be disrupted and that would affect the united states as well
6470562 this is probably about it in terms of a retail gas drop we may be a few cents away from the august bottom
6470563 on the one hand the crude inventory buildup was quite strong but the gasoline draw was also very prominent
6470564 the closer examination of sales will reveal that even in this soft retail environment across america the book business is stubbornly holding up

6470572 jim is an expert in utility regulation and utility law and he shares my commitment to promoting and expanding our use of alternative energy and conservation measures to reduce demand
6470573 im not convinced this is in the best interests of recipients
6470574 we have been pressured by the federal government to move to a pure 30 day standard we have been reticent to do that
6470575 i watched the guys warm up and its hot out there
6470576 i just sat there with my cooling vest on listening to music and just chilled out i think that really paid off
6470577 the majority are using it to block out everything else thats going on around them
6470578 essentially what theyre doing is really not thinking at all theyre just listening to music and being in a space before they actually get ready to narrow their focus
6470579 you have to also plan for contingency if you forgot your music or something happens
6470580 for many athletes that point in time would have been a turning point to really underperform
6470581 kevin drew and broken social scene brendan canning those guys jason collett all the guys from broken social scene thats my favourite band probably
6470582 but to relax myself when im preparing to come to competition i like to listen to some upbeat music
6470583 not before the dives because im the type of guy wholl keep the song in my head and lose focus on what im supposed to think about
6470584 im very electronic techno house music really gets me going
6470585 to start warming up its very helpful it gives me a lot of energy and gets me pumped heading into the warm up and into the meet
6470586 maybe 10 or 15 minutes before i get ready to warm up i dont do a lot of running with an ipod
6470587 i dont let my athletes have headphones and things while theyre warming up i think you have to focus on what youre doing
6470588 you do not isolate your brain from whats important thats just my idea and i know some people think its an old fashioned old man talk
6470589 our great project site at glen dhu is further validated through this ea and we are confident that with the new environmental application process we can anticipate a positive approval from the minister of the environment within 30 to 45 days

6470591 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6470592 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6470593 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6470594 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6470595 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6470596 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6470597 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6470598 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6470599 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc

6470612 importancia del municipalismo para el cambio en la comunitat valenciana
6470613 son muchos los municipios donde gobernamos y agrupaciones locales donde estamos en la oposici n desde donde trabajamos para obtener apoyo del gobierno de espa a a las acciones municipales sobre todo por la par lisis de la generalitat por su bancarrota o simplemente porque son discriminados en las ayudas
6470614 asesoramiento pero tambi n apoyo sobre el terreno ya que sin duda los municipios son la gran fuerza del cambio por su proximidad a los ciudadanos
6470615 abrir los ojos y no se dejen enga ar por las mentiras de un consell incapaz de asumir sus responsabilidades y de atender las necesidades de los ciudadanos

6470640 so i would never dissuade anybody a physician in particular from suspecting marfan syndrome
6470641 but if thats all there was the likelihood would be relatively low
6470642 the enlargement of the aorta can be present before birth or during childhood
6470643 but in an adult male if he had marfan syndrome it would be present and if they were looking for the disease they would have detected the enlarged aorta already im sure michael phelps had an echocardiogram already and then he probably wouldnt be swimming since physical activity is restricted
6470644 hyman had been checked countless times for college for the olympics and no one suspected marfan syndrome
6470645 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6470646 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6470647 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6470648 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6470649 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6470650 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6470651 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6470652 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6470653 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6470654 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6470655 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6470656 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6470657 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6470658 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6470659 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6470660 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6470661 they told me there are going to be resources here
6470662 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6470663 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6470664 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6470665 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6470666 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6470667 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6470668 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6470669 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6470670 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6470671 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure

6470732 you know i was just thinking about how fun it would be to have a girl
6470733 i dont think running for office is anything im prepared for or could even prepare myself for
6470734 there is nothing i can even compare it to in my own life i work really long hours and work a lot and have done press tours and junkets but there is nothing like a presidential campaign that i have experienced before i think at one point we visited three different cities in one state in 12 hours its exhausting
6470735 most of the college students showed up to get a picture and an autograph
6470736 but if in the process they did hear my argument or did hear something that resonated with them i dont think its because i am on ugly betty

6470738 i was young not too long ago and i know the last thing you want is someone preaching to you
6470739 with the addition of these three projects we are now actively working on approximately 19 projects in some stage of development
6470740 the addition of these projects is very representative of our process we sign initial agreements and then move along the development cycle with our local owner groups over a normal course of time until we construct and commission a wind farm
6470741 we are pleased to note that the 2006 year of account continues to develop in line with our expectations
6470742 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6470743 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6470744 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6470745 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6470746 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6470747 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6470748 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6470749 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6470750 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6470751 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6470752 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning

6470771 on the occasion of the treaty of hudaibiyah the companions had left madeenah with the intention of performing umrah and had donned their ihram however allah taala had destined for them not to perform umrah that year after the treaty was signed the prophet sallallaahu alayhi wasallam ordered the companions to shave their heads and remove the clothing of ihraam the companions however did not comply as they were hoping that maybe allah taala would grant them an opportunity to do umrah that year if they insisted on their intention upon seeing this the prophet sallallaahu alayhi wasallam retired to his tent and the signs of worry were apparent on his face his wife umme salamah radialahu anha asked the cause of his concern after being informed of the situation umme salamah advised the prophet sallallaahu alayhi wasallam that he should shave his head in front of the companions seeing this the companions would immediately realise that there was to be no umrah that year and thus they would immediately follow suit the prophet sallallaahu alayhi wasallam followed his wifes advice and the situation was resolved as she had predicted commenting upon this hadeeth my respected teacher shaykh islamul haq rahmatullahi alayh would say that

6470809 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
6470810 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
6470811 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
6470812 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming

6470922 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6470923 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6470924 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6470925 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6470926 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally
6470927 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6470928 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6470929 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6470930 we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6470931 gene was a true pioneer as one of the few african american leaders of a major union
6470932 he was the equal of owners in negotiations and made the league a better place for all players playing alongside of gene was an honor and a privilege he was a pillar of strength and leadership for our great raider teams

6470950 kansas city is clearly a home away from home for iowa state fans
6470951 so many people have shared with me how much they enjoy a weekend of cyclone athletics in kansas city we fully expect a large contingent of fans traveling down i 35 and we plan to host a significant pep rally in conjunction with the iowa state university alumni association both years
6470952 the chiefs approached us about the concept of playing in kansas city and the financial guarantees were very appealing
6470953 additionally cyclone fans have supported our teams in kansas city incredibly well in the past and enjoyed the experience providing our players the chance to compete in an nfl stadium giving our fans a desirable weekend road trip to see the cyclones and earning extra revenue was a great combination

6470962 we urge beneficiaries to choose wisely when selecting their drug coverage
6470963 again we emphasize that any changes to the coverage gap would need to come from congress

6470967 i rarely plug someone elses book but her views coincide with mine and are brilliantly presented
6470968 all across the country places where people gather for good food and lively conversation are top destinations for campaigners so we wanted to bring that experience directly to both conventions

6470970 my dogs give me much more than i could ever give them
6470971 i had slipped on some water that the dogs spilled out of their bowl and my legs came up from under me and slammed me down right on my back
6470972 i wasnt able to ride my bike i wasnt able to do a lot of things that i normally do
6470973 they can get up and get moving much quicker in the hospital and they leave the hospital quicker

6470978 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
6470979 some may say that the olympics are an edifice complex that megalomaniacs just want to build big buildings

6470989 with over 100 000 genes we think we have genes that a lowly fruit fly would know nothing about but this is not true
6470990 all animals including humans have a very similar set of basic genes and yet were so different
6470991 its kind of a biologists dream to be able to design your own animal

6470993 you never feel completely comfortable in this ball park but with the wind blowing in today it made it a little easier to pitch to some of the tough guys in the middle of the order

6471001 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
6471002 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
6471003 theres a big negative feedback loop and theres no way out of it
6471004 as the stock falls more and more its more likely the government steps in and more likely equity holders get wiped out
6471005 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6471006 they cant keep playing games with the accounting rules to avoid taking their losses
6471007 it could be tomorrow it could be six months from now
6471008 the rationale for government involvement is to maintain fannie and freddies role in the marketplace which comes through buying mortgages
6471009 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
6471010 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
6471011 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
6471012 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
6471013 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
6471014 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future

6471028 i can see 21 t 72 tanks moving towards the roki tunnel in the direction of russia
6471029 i can also see four grad artillery launchers several armoured personnel carriers and heavy trucks ready to move into the tunnel
6471030 certainly here on the road we have seen lots of russian military personnel
6471031 what we have just seen is atrocious there are russian interior ministry special forces bringing old people from villages basically emptying the villages on the south ossetian side and dumping them in gori
6471032 the pullback has started at such a pace that by the end of august 22 all the forces of the russian federation will be behind the line of our zone of responsibility
6471033 they dont show any sign that they want to give up control
6471034 it looks like the word withdrawal is understood in different ways by different people
6471035 these principles allow the russian peacekeepers to take additional measures to ensure security in the security zone
6471036 after the famous nato meeting when the alliance froze contacts with russia some leading alliance officials were whispering into my ears you are not going to halt the afghanistan transit are you
6471037 i think that assistance is probably going to happen its a matter of how much and how fast
6471038 le viol a toujours t une arme redoutable de domination patriarcale en temps de guerre il se transforme en outil dan antissement de peuples entiers
6471039 thats too bad ill bet you missed talking to your friends
6471040 its not the fall that hurts its the sudden stop at the end
6471041 those who suffer from frequent and severe fainting often die suddenly
6471042 we think the exposure is minimal but we certainly would not want to risk any of our student information being exposed to a security breach
6471043 even when there is a presumption of confidentiality we dont have that social security number in the mix
6471044 each organization that is hired to do another piece loses the sense of urgency the personal contact and sense of responsibility are gone

6471055 one of the videos on our site has gained 5294 views already
6471056 my lower teeth are crowded and i have a big adams apple
6471057 the other part of me thinks that the very fact that i had the courage to even start posting videos is saying something
6471058 yeah that is a good point i am equally also aware of the media interest that american tv star is building up too
6471059 the irony is that in the amount of time it will take to read respond and comment to these posts casey could have done a video stuck it on the site and he has nothing to lose only further promotion
6471060 my lower teeth are crowded and i have a big adams apple
6471061 i can probably kick it into high gear and work hard on improving my camera appearance and make a nice entry video in the next several days working full time on it

6471064 prayer is that act in religion in which there is the greatest encouragement
6471065 ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened to you for everyone who asks receives he who seeks finds and to him who knocks the door will be opened
6471066 if you believe you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer
6471067 i will do whatever you ask in my name so that the son may bring glory to the father you may ask me for anything in my name and i will do it
6471068 i fear john knoxs prayers more than an army of ten thousand men

6471074 most physicians in the united states have financial relationships with industry ranging from the acceptance of meals to the receipt of large sums of money for consulting speaking or conducting research
6471075 consumers should absolutely know where their doctor is coming from
6471076 doctors think they wont be influenced by these financial relationships but the research shows that they are
6471077 lets say your investment counselor went on a trip to aruba paid for by a certain company
6471078 then he comes home and recommends you invest in that company wouldnt you be concerned
6471079 look around for hints that your doctor sees a lot of drug reps
6471080 and if you see an extremely attractive impeccably dressed polite person with a briefcase in the waiting room watch out thats most likely a drug rep
6471081 ask the doctor whats the scientific evidence for prescribing that particular drug over another one they must have a scientific reason especially if its a high price brand name drug instead of a generic
6471082 there are circumstances where you want to take this extra step and there are other times where you really dont want to bother
6471083 the first priority of physicians is the health and well being of our patients

6471097 the russians fall even further into this spheres of influence thinking and cold war thinking and they see nato as only an anti russian kind of alliance
6471098 the danger is the west does exactly the same thing particularly in the u s they say well everybody is playing by the old script now and we all just going to fall back that would be really devastating for international affairs

6471212 in the belleville area for example i heard from a member who just had a few buyers come off the fence because of the incentive which is very encouraging
6471213 and in naperville i heard from a member whos been telling his first time buyers about the credit he said that some of his clients are excited about it simply because the financial perk will allow them to buy a few pieces of furniture for their new home

6471334 other aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example the principles of the invention
6471335 the largest half year consumption decline in volume terms in the last 26 years
6471336 shell estimates that after 2015 supplies of easy to access oil and gas will no longer keep up with demand
6471337 an oil crisis is coming in the next 10 years its not a matter of demand its not a matter of supplies its both
6471338 i dont think we are going to see the supply going over 100 million barrels a day where is all that going to come from
6471339 with the increase of malware targeting home users and their information we felt it was imperative to give all people the same control over sensitive information that was previously reserved for it administrators
6471340 proventsure is uniquely positioned to address the challenge of red flag programs
6471341 my id protector meets requirements to audit the soundness of personally identifiable information handling additionally proventsures enterprise audit platform now in its third generation enables organizations to go further by automating probability of loss assessment and mitigation of risk to that information
6471342 this communications tool allows us to quickly and efficiently deliver updates of user selected information to the public
6471343 real time information sharing is critical to keeping the public informed safe and healthy
6471344 the state of indiana represents govdeliverys first statewide implementation and we are excited to provide the state with an instant communication platform to reach the public
6471345 indiana agencies need to get their information out to the public and we are proud to help them do it in a faster more efficient manner
6471346 we are ok but our drinking water supply is a problem
6471347 we want to get you back to your village as soon as possible
6471348 the school district is faced with the same challenges of rising prices as individuals
6471349 in the creative field surfing non work sites may be considered part of the job because it allows professionals to keep up with trends and seek new sources of inspiration
6471350 also many employers recognize that making appointments and attending to personal tasks online might actually improve productivity since professionals can quickly take care of needs while in the office instead of stepping out
6471351 lately youve been seeing pics of me and britney partying blah blah sic and she knows that some of her fans are very upset about what they call her behavior and sadly theyre blaming the issue on her being friends with me
6471352 for people to call out her parenting skills on behalf of her partying ethics is appalling
6471353 anyone who has called her out on this should really be ashamed
6471354 today is a day of mourning for the french nation
6471355 today sadness and grief have engulfed the families but every frenchman is gripped by emotion
6471356 they gave their lives far away from their country to do their duty for the freedom of human rights and for the universal values which are the heart of our republic
6471357 what we have been discussing in brussels in preparation to accra is that on part of the partner countries are not all that positively interested in division of labor because they fear maybe and that is my translation that this will decrease opportunities for them

6471359 but what is more important is the content and nature of the understanding that we can reach with the palestinians
6471360 we have agreed that nobody will make decisions for us
6471361 it would also be a disappointment for the audience because they know this film too well
6471362 we identify with his drama and his dilemma fighting to maintain his integrity while his conscience is battered by low grade work for bucks dont we all think we could have been a contender
6471363 obviously were working with berkoff so from day 1 the question is how are we going to tell this story viscerally

6471373 if youre on the front page of digg that guarantees 50 000 hits the likes of techcrunch and gizmodo are there every day youll never see shiny there
6471374 theyre a bit lazy its easier to buy space on 50 000 guardian online pages than to deal with hundreds of little blogs
6471375 you have to develop your own niche you need to break news you need to write stuff that nobody else is writing
6471376 if youre on the front page of digg that guarantees 50 000 hits the likes of techcrunch and gizmodo are there every day youll never see shiny there

6471378 the animal is suffering shark inflicted injuries is experiencing breathing difficulties and its flukes are hanging down
6471379 its not something we are proud of that happened but its a fact
6471380 it has become a mystery that enthralls people and to that extent id love to see businesses here take advantage of that
6471381 about 600 000 tourists come to salem looking for the dark side of history

6471383 sejak pertama saya membuat film dan saya yakin semua orang yang membuat film juga merasakan hal yang sama kami terus mencoba mencari alternatif bentuk yang berbeda film harus dicari level yang baru
6471384 dalam film drupadi ini saya melihat sebuah kesempatan untuk menjadikannya suatu film dengan format yang lain jika melihat kisah drupadi sangat relevan dengan persoalan masa kini kami menggarapnya dengan serius tapi kami juga ingin penonton bisa menikmatinya dan merasa ada kaitan dengan persoalan yang dihadapinya

6471390 as a sovereign and independent state and sign a treaty of friendship cooperation and mutual assistance
6471391 the poll shows how wrong the washington conventional wisdom has been on this race
6471392 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6471393 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6471394 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6471395 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6471396 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally
6471397 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6471398 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6471399 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6471400 we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6471401 had it been us i dont think we would necessarily have done the switcheroo with the girl with the braces
6471402 every so often we see reports of this kind in the saudi media i believe its part of the saudi demonization of relations with israel
6471403 we make sure no products are manufactured that endanger the israeli consumer so this claim is unfounded
6471404 possibly but a lot of the time its not down to the songwriting its more down to production the last few albums up to in requiem its been very vocally orientated the vocals have been high in the mix and weve kind of kept the drums and guitars down lower with the last one we wanted to make a point of bringing the guitars and the drums up again which is kinda what metal productions are really loud drums and guitars we really made a point of doing that this time and as a result it instantly sounds heavier well probably do even moreso on the next one because were still in that mindset each album you try and better your last one and thats what everybody does sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt but we want to take it even more extreme and probably make the most extreme album weve ever done
6471405 well weve always been about writing songs well hopefully be writing good and melodic songs but hopefully yeah with a bit more heaviness in there too
6471406 were actually working on it right now were working on the material and were looking at going into the studio round about january
6471407 tom unified the organization and brought renewed focus to our customer target while making the tough changes necessary to get the brand back on track
6471408 firstly we want to extend our heartfelt sympathy to the
6471409 we are terribly sorry and wish that the circumstances werent so and that we could change them
6471410 he explained to us that he felt so powerless and worthless that he wanted to make a stand
6471411 he went to school intending to give them which was never directed at a specific person a fright and to hurt them but he never intended to kill anyone he wanted to release built up frustration and his feeling of powerlessness he wanted to be someone
6471412 his words to us were when i put on the mask everything became dead quiet and my body moved i wanted to stop but couldnt
6471413 he also mentioned that the matric final exams had put a lot of pressure on him although he never failed a grade he was terribly afraid he would
6471414 we suspect a combination of stress bad self esteem wrong influences and an absolute feeling of powerlessness led our child to this terrible deed
6471415 we appeal to all parents to have deep conversations with their children to make sure everything is alright one is inclined to attribute certain personalities to physical development but that isnt always the case
6471416 we appeal to people not to judge us please grant us the time to pick up the pieces of our lives

6471430 oil is the driver and then it depends on a series of other factors that are kind of like magnifiers
6471431 all three reports tend to indicate that were bottoming out but that there is no real end in sight and thats what i think the market has to get used to
6471432 if military activity heats up again pipeline flows into europe could be disrupted and that would affect the united states as well
6471433 this is probably about it in terms of a retail gas drop we may be a few cents away from the august bottom
6471434 on the one hand the crude inventory buildup was quite strong but the gasoline draw was also very prominent
6471435 terrified of allowing western countries to build any kind of cushion for the unexpected because it has the potential to return prices to normal or sustainable economic levels
6471436 the slide in the dollar has taken some of the wind out of the bears sail in the energy complex
6471437 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6471438 in the past weve usually had flooding in pockets i have not seen anything this widespread throughout the county
6471439 if it was a category 1 2 or 3 hurricane making a direct hit on jacksonville youd have something
6471440 this is the first day we can actually see the tops of the roads
6471441 were pulling in our plants and porch furniture making sure we have our supplies and gas for the generator
6471442 i still think we all need to stay on our toes
6471443 people say if it hits your hand you should have it
6471444 im going to go home and figure out what happened
6471445 i thought my hand was there maybe someone has a voodoo doll of me
6471446 winning five bouts in a short time is very difficult
6471447 these bouts are 15 20 minutes apart with such little time to rest it is very difficult to recompose yourself

6471452 recently booked a full day at the wheel of what is said to be the best custom motor racing simulator in the world the one run by former benetton technical chief nick wirth

6471457 you know you want to suck my d ck b tch dont f cking lie
6471458 i dashed down to the lobby and called my friend toni
6471459 i was crying and told her i was on my way to her house and that i would explain everything when i got there i got into the limo and cried even harder and i cried all the way to tonis house i told her everything that happened

6471464 my people needs independence in order to preserve our ethnic identity i hope that our voice will be heard
6471465 it is absolutely obvious that all initiatives within the framework of the negotiations have completely exhausted themselves
6471466 by participating in the negotiations mediated by the russian federation and international organisations abkhazia tried to find a civilised solution to the problems in relations with georgia and strictly performed its obligations however georgia repeatedly violated the cease fire agreement and invaded abkhazia three times in the post war period in may 1998 october 2001 and july 2006 unsuccessfully trying to take revenge for its military defeat
6471467 the new aggression and genocide against the people of south ossetia explained georgias stubborn refusal to sign an agreement on international guarantees of non resumption of hostilities and proved tbilisis adherence to the policy of purposeful elimination of the peoples of abkhazia and south ossetia
6471468 its not a matter of forcing people its getting them to want to use it if you cant youre not going to do great advertising
6471469 i lived in arizona for about 15 years and watched as the spirit of the west swiftly eroded to become just an extension of east l a thats why i moved farther north to idaho but sure enough the same stuff is happening in small areas even up here
6471470 i cant describe it the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end it wasnt exactly a nice feeling but it was an incredible experience that i wont ever forget the 3 000 year old bones are so far removed from our lives today and these 120 generations thats so long ago
6471471 i spent a while last night and this morning decorating easter eggs in mathematica and this activity has proved wildly popular in this household my children are going to run me out of toner in my color printer very shortly
6471472 this is a new trend within the global food crisis
6471473 the food crisis gave alarms for all countries to look for places to secure supplies of agricultural goods
6471474 the importers are nervous and they have realised that they had better have a stake in countries with potential for agriculture exports
6471475 the uae is looking at implementing some agricultural projects in kazakhstan as part of its efforts to develop stable food sources for its needs
6471476 but now fertile land with access to water has become a strategic asset
6471477 we told them the saudis that we would be very eager to provide hundreds of thousands of hectares of agricultural land for investment
6471478 this is a situation that could bring real benefits to people in some developing countries but to be sustainable land purchase or lease arrangements must benefit and be seen to benefit all parties including citizens of the host country local communities and investors
6471479 joint venture agreements between on the one hand those countries that have the financial resources and on the other those that possess land water and human resources
6471480 some negotiations between host countries and the investors have led to unequal international relations and short term mercantilist agriculture
6471481 we are talking about some host countries where there is widespread poverty and hunger and we must ensure that the local populations share fully in the benefits of these initiatives
6471482 can you ship the grain back to china the cost will be very high as well as the risk
6471483 the history of the aaaid was the history of bureaucracy general managers who didnt want to do anything or who wanted to keep their offices outside of sudan and so it did very little
6471484 convincing the private sector is not going to be easy
6471485 some of these countries are extremely corrupt and will they have the political will to improve their infrastructures
6471486 due to the harshness of most dyes i find myself walking a balance between choosing eco friendly and socially conscious yarns for my store
6471487 fair trade sources usually use industrial dyes because they dont have access to anything else or access to land to grow dyestuffs thats why i sell a lot of undyed yarns like alpaca and wool that get their color from the animal
6471488 its not quite as soft but you can get a nice drape
6471489 allhemp3 sport weight hemp yarn 5 75 1 5 oz skein 888 301 0011
6471490 and the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when i was eight years old somehow reflects on me and my values doesnt make much sense
6471491 the relationship between the ambitious obama and the unrepentant ayers is a subject that excites republicans who havent really thwacked that pinata as hard as they might
6471492 it really irritates obama and his political champion chicagos sovereign lord mayor richard m daley
6471493 its really unfortunate theyre friends so what people do make mistakes in the past you move on this is a new century a new time he reflects back and hes been making a strong contribution to our community
6471494 it does not speak well of the kind of candidate he would be in the fall against sen
6471495 completely unmentioned is whether documents held at a state run universitys library about a project to reform and improve public school systems relating to a public figure who wants to be the next president can be withheld from the publics eyes
6471496 all the things that go to make heaven and earth
6471497 were going to try our hardest not to be violent
6471498 my accountant set it up for me and i need to put in a claim
6471499 might black be a common usage name perhaps theres a legal name as well
6471500 i didnt mean lucky at all very unlucky in fact especially for pennie we shall all mss her dreadfully
6471501 she was the last of her line i think even her ex husband pre deceased her
6471502 there wont even have been a coroners report or a death certificate yet what coincidence that you take out a policy the day before she dies
6471503 you sir are the very worst kind of client i shall be marking your claim for investigation and i shall be referring the whole matter to the police
6471504 do firemen ride mopeds or fire engines call it occupational advertising policemen have their panda cars and i have my jag
6471505 most grateful i was most grateful my colleague mr speaker happened to mention another little matter you discussed with him however
6471506 i dont recall asking for your help with anything else in fact i doubt ill be asking for it ever again
6471507 what was the business proposition mr spenser outlined to you yesterday
6471508 he referred to the insurance policy hed taken out on his assistant and picnic partner ms pennie black
6471509 intimating that it would be worth a considerable amount upon her sudden death
6471510 local lady in guillotine house of horror as a cover story look if it isnt the aforementioned ms black what a coincidence
6471511 you dont imagine for one minute that i had anything to do with it do you
6471512 you tell me what you were doing there at eight oclock this morning
6471513 then how do you explain seeing the body or part of it of poor ms black and then breaking into her house to steal papers
6471514 i have it on good authority that you did i wonder if the police are aware of that little fact
6471515 i didnt say you did but its an interesting choice of phrase i wasnt even aware that she was murdered tsk you just cant trust the papers these days
6471516 not my line of business murder blackmail extortion with threats of violence extortion with actual violence thats more my game
6471517 nothing fancy and then you can get on feeding your animals
6471518 im partial to a bit of bacon do let me know when you need it butchering dog here could do with the practice couldnt you dog

6471521 you can sign it now or you can sign it with ten broken fingers he thumped his fist onto the desk catching chases hand underneath it one of the chunky blocks of gold benton wore as a ring turned out the be a lot less pliable than chases finger
6471522 dont mind me ive witnessed a lot worse than that in my time
6471523 just an affidavit stating that youve made me the beneficiary of the insurance policy

6471530 on the sort of screen dappled with different states and impressions which my consciousness would simultaneously unfold while i was reading and which ranged from the most deeply hidden aspirations of my being to the wholly external view of the horizon spread out before my eyes at the bottom of the garden what was my primary my innermost impulse the lever whose incessant movements controlled everything else was my belief in the philosophic richness and beauty of the book i was reading and my desire to appropriate them for myself whatever the book might be
6471531 we should be mindful of everything for we can interpret everything
6471532 for a long time i would go to bed early
6471533 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy and to try and weaken the georgian state
6471534 the implications of russian actions go beyond their threat to the territorial integrity and independence of a democratic georgia russia is using violence against georgia in part to intimidate other neighbors such as ukraine for choosing to associate with the west and adhering to western political and economic values as such the fate of georgia should be of grave concern to americans and all people who welcomed the end of a divided of europe and the independence of former soviet republics

6471551 the services contract performed by ibm engineers on site will help with hardware recovery times and thus facilitate lentas objective to reduce risks related to hardware operations and make the companys it infrastructure more stable
6471552 ibms retail industry and it services experience will ultimately help lenta provide better services to its customers
6471553 we selected ibm because it has a service center and a stock of spare parts and components in st petersburg another key factor that influenced our choice was ibm russia and cis service departments invariable focus on customer needs the fact that ibm engineers are highly qualified and have the knowledge required to provide the services recover hardware within agreed to time frames and use original spare parts also had a critical role to play

6471560 if they truly believe that this is a determining factor in this election then their prospects are slim indeed
6471561 jay nixon is dreaming if he thinks he is going to peel off a significant number of republican votes
6471562 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed
6471563 the us has gone very far in this agreement it is a very advanced agreement
6471564 redoubling efforts to bring it a deal to a final conclusion
6471565 it has taken us a very long time but we are very very close to close this agreement
6471566 still issues concerning exactly how our forces will operate i think that is only natural at this point
6471567 we are continuing to work to make sure that any timeline aspirational timelines that are in the agreement really do reflect what we believe and what is reasonable
6471568 two men apparently blew themselves up outside the factory during a shift change the bombers were on foot and they exploded themselves less than a minute apart
6471569 directed the authorities to make efforts to expose the hidden hands behind the incident
6471570 our bombers carried out todays attack it is in reaction to military operations in swat and bajaur
6471571 similar attacks will be carried out in other cities of pakistan including lahore islamabad and rawalpindi
6471572 i was working in the factory when i heard one blast and then another they were huge
6471573 security people then immediately surrounded the place and we were not allowed to go outside
6471574 the blast took place as staff were leaving after finishing their days duty and it was very crowded
6471575 i was too hard on myself towards the end of the match as i was so keen to win i feel very regretful about losing the first three games so easily
6471576 but when i was close to victory i actually started to become shaky and to lose confidence i became more conservative because i was scared of losing the fourth game
6471577 i have great respect for him he played very well he is fantastic what can i say
6471578 the recent decline in gas prices isnt enough to overcome all the negative momentum thats been building up through the spring and summer
6471579 a few months ago there was some discussion about a second half recovery if theres a second half recovery itll be the second half of 2009
6471580 is it just us or is it getting nauseating reading the press corps soap opera fascination with the relationship between kenny hulshof and sarah steelman
6471581 could you come down instead at least i can deal with the post while we talk
6471582 as long as its not harold he threw away my pot of coffee at the house this morning three weeks ive been brewing it until it was like treacle it was perfect
6471583 good morning to you too felicia why cant you drink tea like a sane person
6471584 sorry harold i havent been able to drink tea since mother forced it upon us every night when we were kids i swore when we moved out that id never touch the stuff again
6471585 to be fair she used to make it with holy water
6471586 then i went through the stained glass in the door and got guillotined then i watched chase break into my apartment and steal the papers steve trusted to me then i followed winston and watched him have a mini breakdown over my death and then make jokes at my expense why do people do that
6471587 what are we supposed to do wail and beat our chests in a manner befitting our irreconcilable loss of your friendship or mention casually that you cant lie to us because well see right through you
6471588 i should have put a contract out on him too
6471589 i talked to that lovely girl valerie who was so helpful yesterday i wondered how a nun was so good with computers turns out she moonlights as a contract killer handy that handy that i had a big wad of cash stashed in a safe deposit box too i put a contract out on sam hunt
6471590 that was enterprising why because he was spying on your flat or because hes possessed by a demon
6471591 neither actually i didnt know about the demon thing though it makes a sick kind of sense that my husband was working for a demon i want him dead because he killed me
6471592 you know all this already dont you why couldnt you just have emailed me
6471593 because i get to see your face this way sams made a life size homunculus out of metallic resin in the image of her husband its like being attacked by an action man
6471594 it came toward me and i fell backwards down the stairs it was trying to touch me
6471595 harold knows more about this stuff than i do but isnt it likely that the homunculus is steve and he was trying to tell you a message from beyond the grave he was probably desperate to tell you that he still loved you and would wait for you beyond the veil or something
6471596 if steven still loves me even though his spirit is tied up in that thing why did he go haring off after chase
6471597 i was so annoyed with chase i just thought good riddance
6471598 he deserves it i was falling in love with him and all he wanted was the stupid papers
6471599 you said you didnt tell him about them until after your house was burgled he only stole them after that probably at the instigation of a third party
6471600 after finalizing the locations construction of the power plants can begin
6471601 darkhoin is under basic design and there has been a nine year scheme drafted for its construction

6471603 dump that chump from doormat to diva in only nine steps a guide to getting over mr wrong
6471604 thanks but no thanks for the new underwear you bought me ma
6471605 how about if we join her for chinese one sunday per month as opposed to every one
6471606 i get the sense that its hard for you to let your son really become his own person i wish you wouldnt feel like youre losing him to me but that youre just developing a new relationship with him that also includes me
6471607 we havent done anything to her it rather begs the question who did we thought it was you
6471608 you did insure her life for a vast amount yesterday
6471609 odd since that would clear all your debts and allow you to reimburse the sanctuary coffers
6471610 we could use a man of your talents and a thousand wont keep you for long

6471631 nach aussagen georgischer soldaten die wir verh rt haben wurden all ihre bungen vor dem beginn des milit reinsatzes von offizieren der us armee geleitet
6471632 dopo lultima esclusione ho riflettuto e ho fatto un bilancio con la nazionale sono state poche le soddisfazioni che mi sono tolto poche le possibilit di dimostrare quanto tenga a questa maglia e quindi dopo aver riflettuto a lungo preferisco pubblicamente annunciare che con lattuale staff tecnico alla guida della francia ho deciso di dedicare tutto il mio tempo alla fiorentina non voglio mancare di rispetto allattuale ct ma evidentemente io non rientro nelle sue scelte
6471633 masa ada ibu bapa kita ada tempat untuk bergantung dan berlindung hidup tetapi setelah tua tetapi masih tidak ada teman hidup dan tidak ada anak kepada siapa kita harus mengadu dan membawa diri
6471634 saya rasa nasib ibu ibu tunggal lagi lebih baik daripada kami andartu
6471635 sebab selama ini kita sudah membuang masa dan tenaga kita membantu ibu membesarkan anak anak hingga mereka bersekolah tinggi dan akhirnya mempunyai keluarga sendiri
6471636 bayangkanlah ada sesetengah anak anak ibu bapa mereka sendiri pun mereka tak boleh jaga terutama setelah mereka tua inikan lagi kita cuma bersaudara
6471637 saya tak katalah adik beradik saya tetapi inilah kenyataannya terhadap andartu lain yang seusia saya mereka juga melahirkan pandangan yang sama malah mereka mendakwa tenaga mereka cuma diperlukan semasa masih ada tenaga dan ketika anak anaknya masih kecil setelah itu nasib kita akan terumbang ambing kerana sudah tidak berguna lagi
6471638 sebenarnya apa yang saya katakan ini tidak melibatkan nasib andartu yang bekerja tetap yang jadi pegawai eksekutif dan berpendapatan tetap tetapi apa yang saya lahirkan ini adalah berdasarkan kepada kami golongan andartu yang sudah tua dan tidak ada pekerjaan tetap
6471639 sebabnya sebagai anak anak yang tua dulu kita banyak membantu ibu membesarkan adik adik akhirnya kita sendiri tidak bersekolah tinggi dan sudah pastilah tidak bekerja
6471640 kalau boleh kerajaan tolong kami golongan andartu ini kalau golongan ibu ibu tunggal dan ibu ibu tinggal boleh dan diberikan perhatian mengapa abaikan kami
6471641 ada orang kata mengapa tak bekerja di kilang dan sebagainya sebenarnya bukan kami tak mahu
6471642 sebabnya perbezaan umur budak budak muda itu tak sukakan kami sebab kerja kilang duduk bersama jadi mereka tak seronok kalau kami melihat kelakuan mereka yang kurang baik dan mereka sendiri suka mencemuh kami
6471643 kalau boleh kami mencadangkan kerajaan mengadakan sebuah projek perumahan khas untuk kami golongan andartu yang tak bekerja ini memberikan kami rumah pprt ke rumah panjang ke ataupun beri kami rumah murah
6471644 sebenarnya kami tak mahu ditempatkan di rumah rumah orang tua tapi kalau kami ditempatkan di rumah panjang atau pprt itu mereka bolehlah mencarikan peluang pekerjaan kepada kami kami mungkin boleh diajar membuat kraf tangan dan sebarang pekerjaan di mana tenaga kami masih boleh digunakan
6471645 berbalik kepada masalah saya dan ibu ibu tunggal ataupun ibu ibu tinggal mereka pada pandangan saya lebih bernasib baik daripada kami golongan andartu yang tidak bekerja ini
6471646 contohnya mereka boleh hidup dengan sempurna dan tenteram apabila hari tua mereka ada anak anak yang boleh menjaga mereka di samping menyara tetapi kami golongan andartu tak bekerja ini kepada siapa kami mahu mengadu
6471647 dalam pada itu ada juga orang khususnya jiran sekampung dan jiran setaman yang bertanyakan kami kalau bimbang tak ada orang nak jaga semasa tua dan sakit sakit nanti mengapa tak pelihara anak anak angkat mungkin mereka boleh bantu
6471648 sebenarnya apa yang saya luahkan ini bukan semata mata curahan hati saya sahaja tetapi juga luahan hati orang lain yang segolongan dengan saya juga
6471649 kami tahu tenaga kami masih boleh digunakan oleh kerajaan daripada mengimport banyak pekerja dari luar negara kami juga boleh bekerja mengikut kemahiran dan kebolehan masing masing cuma masa tempat dan waktunya sahaja yang boleh dirancangkan mengikut kesesuaian seseorang itu di samping melihat kepada minatnya
6471650 terus terang juga tidak ada kalangan kami yang mahu menjadi isteri yang tugasnya hanya membesarkan anak anak tiri dan menjaga cucu cucu sahaja
6471651 kami mengharapkan hasrat kami ini benar benar menjadi sebuah kenyataan pembaca jangan mentertawakan cadangan kami ini sebab keadaan ini berlaku banyak berpunca daripada kurangnya jumlah lelaki yang sesuai dijadikan suami
6471652 kerana seperti kita semua sedia maklum zaman ini telah ramai jumlah pemuda lulusan pusat serenti tidak kurang juga yang sudah jadi zombi yang hidup mereka berkeliaran menunggu matinya sahaja
6471653 saya tidak memandang masalah andartu ini sekarang sahaja tetapi lebih jauh daripada itu dan saya mengakulah apa yang saya katakan ini adalah curahan rasa dari hati saya sendiri dan disokong oleh beberapa orang teman andartu senasib saya
6471654 you used mapquest didnt you yep youre like the 50th person to stop here and ask the same thing
6471655 this deal if approved would give india rights and privileges of civil nuclear trade that have been reserved only for members in good standing under the npt it creates a dangerous distinction between good proliferators and bad proliferators and sends out misleading signals to the international community with regard to npt norms
6471656 there is serious concern that the united states has taken this step with the intention to create a precedent and pave the way for israel to continue its clandestine nuclear weapons activities
6471657 the hizbullah organization is unremitting in its efforts to attack israelis throughout the world with its emphasis on kidnappings
6471658 insist on being accompanied by someone you trust when attending business meetings or while at recreation
6471659 alter your routine and habits occasionally if on a prolonged stay in one place switch hotels travel routes restaurants and recreational spots
6471660 the recent decline in gas prices isnt enough to overcome all the negative momentum thats been building up through the spring and summer
6471661 a few months ago there was some discussion about a second half recovery if theres a second half recovery itll be the second half of 2009
6471662 its been great to see jamaica get a clean sweep of the sprints
6471663 that would be more in the spirit of the olympic ideal
6471664 common sense would dictate that it looks likely to be a formality to disqualify her
6471665 it teaches you to be patient when you are lying in a hospital bed and that was almost the same strategy i chose here to wait for my chance in the pack
6471666 les faltaron agallas entrenaron ocho horas diarias y al final tuvieron un error de gran tama o sin esas agallas en una olimpiada no se puede aspirar a ganar una medalla
6471667 ni modo ellos son mejores entrenan diferente no estamos a su altura
6471668 in many ways my life has been an open book but i havent always been the one writing the story with this show however people will get to see and hear with their own eyes and ears what really goes on in my life and i think theyll come to understand me a little bit better with each episode
6471669 i am singing in their language they know what i am singing about it has to be right
6471670 its not the kids its not the gaggle of girls its the gaggle of parents
6471671 its great to come out and defend my gold medal it has been great to see jamaica get a clean sweep of the sprints now i have to concentrate on the relays
6471672 the start was bad and the end wasnt that great either but im grateful for the silver
6471673 its not often i get a visitor first thing in the morning would you like some tea
6471674 what is it about english men and tea everyone drinks it all of the time and expects me to as well in the convent we were allowed one cup a day after the evening meal more than that was hedonism and a trip to see mother superior
6471675 former nun come to me for advice wouldnt you be better off going to father hassock at st pitys
6471676 you cant be a priest and not believe in them
6471677 im a c of e vicar and were a bit more progressive in this church
6471678 i can see you believe in demons because theres one washing the dishes
6471679 its all true ive signed a pact with the devil
6471680 what could a demon possible offer a man of the cloth
6471681 if i got a promotion to bishop id be able to afford to take a wife then i could ask you to marry me
6471682 but ive never thought of you in that way ive never thought on me in that way i was a bride of christ
6471683 dont give me answer just yet promise me youll give it some serious thought
6471684 now will you please just sit down and pull yourself together
6471685 now i have a problem with a demon and i need some help can you help me exorcise a demon from a man or not
6471686 only a catholic priest or a bishop can do that youd have to ask bishop wolsey to do it and he doesnt believe in demons either
6471687 a generous donation would persuade him to at least go through the motions
6471688 ill make a donation of a thousand now and another ten when its done
6471689 heres the thousand get him to come today if he wants another ten the price goes down tomorrow
6471690 i could have the church roof fixed with that the bishop will add it to the cathedral fund if i give it to him
6471691 it would be another stain on my already black soul
6471692 tell the bishop my client is offering nine thousand instead of ten ill drop the rest on a collection plate
6471693 the devil promised me that when he did he would name me as his successor
6471694 i wouldnt be able to look myself in the face again
6471695 call me when hes confirmed his willingness to do an exorcism
6471696 itll be valid for a few days and then ill get rid of it
6471697 i may do latitia invited me but im not entirely certain its going to go ahead
6471698 but there might be if the bishop agrees to come
6471699 si os ha inducido a error lo que os he dicho sobre el libre acceso a internet durante los juegos entonces pido perd n por ello
6471700 no estoy desdici ndome habr un acceso a internet libre completo y abierto que permita a los periodistas informar sobre los juegos
6471701 no estoy aqu para defender las decisiones chinas estoy aqu para asegurar que los periodistas puedan informar sobre los juegos estoy decepcionado porque el acceso a internet no es m s amplio pero yo no puedo decirle a los chinos lo que tienen que hacer
6471702 no han logrado cumplir su promesa de una completa libertad de prensa durante los juegos ol mpicos
6471703 i believe that bin laden has been able to get into the good graces of omar who is very poorly educated and unsure of foreign affairs and to influence him in his way of thinking
6471704 the potential ramifications of a mullah omar who is drifting toward pan islamism are grim first and foremost it could mean that the taliban would under no condition expel bin laden because they see his cause as theirs
6471705 time for a diplomatic solution may be running out taliban brush off of our indictment and other evidence may indicate movement from tolerance
6471706 i did not say if there is global warming it would be man made
6471707 not all scientists agree that the warming weve seen is necessarily anthropogenic it is a blatant lie put forth in the media that makes it seem there is only a fringe of scientists who dont buy into anthropogenic global warming
6471708 numerous hurricane meteorologists agree that the historical data has not produced any evidence of changes due to climate change in the number or intensity of hurricanes particularly in the atlantic basin and even globally
6471709 there are some who have done studies that do claim a link but virtually all those studies have been heavily rebutted by others in the hurricane community
6471710 in my opinion the flaw in those studies is an improper utilization of historical databases i have been a specialist in hurricane climate data for close to three decades and others who know the databases well agree with what i am saying
6471711 the biggest fallacy is that people think that a hurricane feeds off a warm ocean and if the ocean gets warmer we will have more intense hurricanes
6471712 but there are other factors involved such as vertical wind shear which is the difference between the upper and lower layers of the atmosphere
6471713 everything else being equal if you warm the ocean under a storm you might get a stronger storm but everything else is not equal
6471714 warming may increase vertical shear and therefore inhibit storms the ocean itself warming is such a little effect
6471715 there are those who want to attribute any perceived increase in natural disasters to anthropomorphic global warming i predict that if we have an active hurricane season someone will attribute it to agw theyre not really looking at the science theyre looking at the disaster
6471716 the very purpose of these attacks is all about separating the region from china
6471717 want to use the olympic stage to enlarge the impact
6471718 i heard some bombs and then i heard some machine guns
6471719 we came down to the lobby this morning and it was breakfast as usual
6471720 this doesnt usually happen its happening now because of the olympics but i dont know who is doing it
6471721 death is better than living on this earth with the unbelievers among us
6471722 it is the curse of the thinking classes to imagine they can reason even the bloodiest mass murderer into peace
6471723 show me just what mohammed brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached
6471724 only through force and victory over the enemies is there security and repose
6471725 the apes are jews the people of the sabbath while the swine are christians the infidels of the communion of jesus
6471726 fighting infidels until they either convert to islam or submit to muslims as dhimmis is still considered by islamists to be a religious duty
6471727 the militants believe that controlling one country will rally the muslim masses enabling them to overthrow all moderate governments in the region and establish a radical islamic empire that spans from spain to indonesia
6471728 iraq would serve as the base of a new islamic caliphate to extend throughout the middle east and which would threaten
6471729 we are saluting to the spirit of our hero shahid
6471730 we tell them in as much as you love life the muslim loves death and martyrdom palestinians hit a new low setting up a boy unknowingly to become a suicide bomber palestinian children die as human shields for adult terrorist leaders israel tears for palestine child may 21 2006 it was always the case arab muslim leaders have been using abusing their kids as human bombs human shields or as general pawns in their propaganda war to smear israeli defenders
6471731 death is better than living on this earth with the unbelievers among us
6471732 there will be continuing enmity until everyone believes in allah we will not meet the enemy halfway and there will be no room for dialogue with them
6471733 islam does not coincide or make a truce with unbelief but rather confronts it the confrontation that islam calls for with these godless and apostate regimes does not know socratic debates platonic ideals nor aristotelian diplomacy but it knows the dialogue of bullets the ideals of assassination bombing and destruction and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine gun
6471734 the owners servants came to him and said sir didnt you sow good seed in your field where then did the weeds come from

6471773 the only question is is the finished product when it comes to market substantially similar to the original drawing
6471774 you have to judge this not from the standpoint of a professional doll sculptor but from the standpoint of a child thats the law
6471775 the evidence is uncontroverted that the drawings portray older edgier sexier dolls
6471776 the eyebrows were way too aggressive the lips way too pronounced the face way too harsh what mga made is a prettier doll that could compete
6471777 can you see a parent saying to their child why do you want that you have a substantially similar doll back home

6471794 man this isnt the way i wanted to go home with a medal
6471795 i would love to have crossed the line in the third place position because i looked at the replay and i dont feel like it gave spearmon an advantage i feel like he was deserving of the third place position
6471796 this is where my true competitive nature was born it only seems right to do something here this is where i became who i am growing up here is something that is still important to me to this day to this day pretty much every time i see rip hamilton i tease him about how we beat him my senior year on the way to the state championship just me and a bunch of doctors and lawyers
6471797 its late im sure people want to get some sleep so lets take care of business
6471798 i just go i just go i just keep going until it feels right to me
6471799 if something doesnt feel right im gonna stay there until i get it right i just continue to keep pushing and pushing and pushing thats all ive known thats how my parents raised me if youre going to be focused on something if you want to do something you cant you cant go about it in a half assed way you really gotta dedicate yourself to it try to be the best at it thats the only way
6471800 well they know they gotta come with it you know its this trains gotta keep moving you either gotta be on the train or get run over by the train but the trains gotta keep moving we want to win a championship and we want to win one now that fire sometimes you gotta light it the players have all stepped up and all responded and everything
6471801 you know it was something i was always aware of but i just got a firsthand look at his toughness
6471802 his focus how he approaches each game and how hard he works at getting better
6471803 i think everyone on the u s team knew kobe was the best player out there and they followed his lead
6471804 he was very focused on getting all the guys on the same page by being vocal they could score at will against anyone but he set the tone for the team on defense
6471805 i think that a lot of people say that he shoots a lot and doesnt pass the ball
6471806 but from playing with him over this summer and playing against him this year so far hes very unselfish he plays hard every possession and basically he can score when he wants he does whatever his team needs him to do hes the one guy that stuck out
6471807 i take pride in the respect i get from players more so than anything else because those are the people that you face on a daily basis
6471808 you know they have a deeper level of understanding of the game of basketball so to have respect from them is what matters most to me
6471809 i like kobe i think hes the best player in the nba but hes got some issues i think he could make dr phil take one of them breaks
6471810 for him its just important for him to understand theres a sense of urgency im not waiting for you you need to be ready and be ready now its the same thing i had to do i was 20 21 years old shaq was roughly the same age i am you know he didnt want to stick around and wait for his point guard to develop in fact there were talks for me being traded for jason kidd at the time so i had to step up to that pressure and meet those expectations right away
6471811 were a championship caliber team with bynum in the lineup
6471812 its ridiculous its ridiculous just because i didnt grow up in the hood and i actually have brains i worked hard on the books or stuff like that people think that i dont go out or i dont interact or i dont hang out its ridiculous
6471813 when we think they might be dying out or merely surviving they are actually thriving
6471814 they are moving into new states and settling or establishing new settlements in communities where local officials arent acquainted with them that creates some misunderstanding on zoning issues or other unique factors in amish practice

6471825 shes been open in telling us she would like to spend time overseas and that is her right
6471826 but i dont think it would be with us she has been talking to cnn and to be honest overseas positions are limited at seven
6471827 anyway our bureau positions are filled by adrian brown mike amor and rahni sadler
6471828 it would be good if she stayed but it is not compulsory for her to work at channel 7

6471831 the life of a city horse is short at best the maximum being about five years street car stock wears out in three years or less
6471832 it has been a sort of standing joke that all the broken down halt lame and maimed animals in new york were sent to a long island sausage factory where they were worked up into german delicacies shipped abroad and then perhaps shipped back to this country if this ever was the case it is not so now horses are so scarce that they are worked to the last minute and even then when they can no longer stand the cobblestones and the asphalt they are sold for fair prices to northern and eastern farmers
6471833 guatemala coach ramon maradiaga was angry at referee enrico wijngaarde of suriname whose foul call when ruiz kicked howard nullified guillermo rodriguez putting the ball in the net
6471834 they annulled a goal that was ours and that happens because they name referees that lack the preparation to direct a game of this level but that is what fifa does their decisions are unappealable
6471835 the referee today expelled gustavo cabrera as a way to level the game after expelling cherundolo

6471850 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6471851 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6471852 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6471853 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6471854 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6471855 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6471856 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6471857 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6471858 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6471859 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses

6471935 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons

6472020 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6472021 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6472022 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording

6472089 la imagen que m s fuerza me provoca es la coherencia que siempre sostuvo entre el discurso y la pr ctica el hecho de poder constatar que hay sujetos en la historia del pa s que se han entregado a la lucha por los intereses de los m s postergados es decir los trabajadores con una pr ctica congruente y una fuerte dosis de autoridad moral el hecho de colocarse ante la existencia de aspectos que trascienden a la simple coyuntura eso me llam profundamente la atenci n y hablo de trascendente no en un sentido idealista de la sociedad y la historia sino con aquella mirada que considera a los hombres y mujeres en los campos del conocimiento las ciencias el arte la pol tica esto para m es relevante toda vez que hoy estamos carentes de personalidades que le den a su vida un valor superior respecto de las cosas estrictamente materiales
6472090 yo era muy joven cuando conoc a clotario como estudiante y como muchacho clotario siempre estuvo dispuesto a apoyar aquellas expresiones estudiantiles y a los j venes trabajadores que estaban no vinculados a las formas tradicionales de hacer pol tica o a los partidos tradicionales siempre clotario goz de un reconocimiento efectivo de aquellos comprometidos con las transformaciones sociales aut nticas y con la lucha extra amente tambi n tuvo una animadversi n hacia aquellos sectores ligados a los partidos en especial a los partidos estalinistas en este marco se gener mi conocimiento a la figura de clotario como un joven conocido m s para l uno mira a los grandes personajes de la historia y procura emular algunas conductas clotario es una de esas personalidades importantes que dan luz sobre aspectos oscuros que la sociedad chilena transita hoy y que se observan cuando se escucha a ciertos dirigentes pol ticos que todo lo hacen en funci n de la negociaci n del objetivo pol tico coyuntural olvidando siempre a los m s postergados es decir a los seres humanos
6472091 hay una enorme inspiraci n que proviene de luis emilio recabarren para m es la figura m s importante del pensamiento pol tico social de los trabajadores chilenos a n no existe otra persona que pueda superarlo en consecuencia tica e incluso en el campo de la educaci n de los asalariados recabarren fue el gran profesor de los trabajadores y sindicalistas chilenos y explor much simas disciplinas en los amaneceres del siglo xx cre un peri dico desarroll el teatro la formaci n permanente desgraciadamente la historia se ha encargado de ocultar su nombre peligroso para los poderosos porque tras l hay toda una vivencia una propuesta una doctrina que deber a ser asumida por los trabajadores pero que lamentablemente es repetida s lo formalmente recabarren y clotario son las dos figuras emblem ticas del movimiento obrero chileno
6472092 actualmente existe muy poca vinculaci n entre las aspiraciones de los trabajadores por mejorar sus condiciones materiales respecto del escenario en el que lo hacen
6472093 tenemos a una enorme cantidad de chilenos que no son personas humanas se puede ser ciudadano en un estado dominado fuertemente por el consumo por un sistema capitalista ultra aqu s lo se puede ser ciudadano si se es sujeto de cr dito es decir un sujeto capaz de adquirir bienes y servicios a trav s de un salario estable en tiempos donde reina la flexibilidad laboral y superior a los 300 mil pesos mensuales 600 d lares que corresponde pr cticamente a un 30 de los trabajadores chilenos bajo este sistema la mayor a est compuesta por sujetos condenados a vivir la marginalidad a reproducir la pobreza en sus hijos a trav s de la educaci n la salud la previsi n social etc y un individuo as es infeliz entonces si la vida es tan precaria y s lo puede ofrecer infelicidad los trabajadores deben dotarse de dirigentes que comprendan este fen meno que lo socialicen que lo discutan que sean capaces tanto de explicar esta infamia como de proponer y practicar la transformaci n profunda de la sociedad y ello se logra por medio de una revoluci n social que coloque en el centro a la persona humana al sujeto que hace posible la riqueza esta discusi n fue planteada hace 150 a os y contin a plenamente vigente
6472094 lo que estamos observando es una destrucci n de las fuerzas productivas una concentraci n cada vez m s grosera del capital y el poder y eso naturalmente est lejos de la democracia lo anterior no ofrece soluciones a los grandes problemas de la humanidad incluso la situaci n es contradictoria a lo que dicen los propios te ricos de la sociedad capitalista a los grandes liberales que combaten el oligopolio el monopolio y promueven la competencia sin embargo en chile vemos una condensaci n econ mica cada vez mayor y la nica forma de revertir el actual estado de cosas es radicalmente de manera revolucionaria innovadora
6472095 eso habla de que estamos viviendo una etapa tr gica el sistema capitalista ni siquiera ha podido garantizar a las sociedades actuales un m nimo decoro las b sicas necesidades fundamentales que en otros per odos se hab an logrado de alguna manera producto de las conquistas de los trabajadores el hecho de que luego de la ltima post guerra mundial el sistema garantizara un elemental r gimen de seguridad social en algunas reas hoy est en tela de juicio el capitalismo para su mantenimiento requiere arrancar todas las conquistas logradas por los trabajadores dejando a fuertes contingentes de asalariados convertidos en mano de obra barata en esta estrategia se encuentra el embate del capital contra los convenios contenidos en la organizaci n internacional del trabajo oit considerando que para algunos durante los 50 del siglo pasado la oit era una mera expresi n de una concepci n tripartita conservadora ahora la oit para el capital es una instituci n contenedora de ciertos derechos y por tanto busca aniquilarla plantea que no se justifica ya porque el capitalismo ha concluido que la relaci n trabajo capital tiene que resolverse bipartitamente es decir el estado y los organismos internacionales deben renunciar a cautelar principios y derechos fundamentales esto explica entre otras variables el bajo porcentaje de la negociaci n colectiva en chile menos de un 9 porque la negociaci n colectiva como se alaba la socialdemocracia y muchos sindicalistas que repet an que el mejor reasignador de recursos era la negociaci n colectiva actualmente est n ocultando este planteamiento porque si la negociaci n colectiva era la mejor forma de reasignar recursos pero hoy pr cticamente no existe qui n reasigna los recursos s lo el mercado entonces ahora la tropa de antiguos pseudo socialistas quedaron desarmados
6472096 el derecho laboral surgi hace casi 150 a os a trav s de grandes juristas franceses italianos europeos que entendieron que la asimetr a entre el capital y el trabajo demandaba la formulaci n jur dica de una concepci n que equiparara al trabajador frente al empleador para negociar esta cuesti n la comprendieron en su momento hasta las miradas m s reaccionarias de la historia y por ello producto de la revoluci n bolchevique y el terror al comunismo la socialdemocracia europea los partidos capitalistas norteamericanos entendieron bien el contexto y generaron reg menes que cautelaron los derechos m nimos de la gente as garantizaron trabajo estable seguros de desempleo decentes salud gratuita y pensi n pero todo ello ahora mismo se est acabando
6472097 la huelga de 30 d as de las trabajadoras y trabajadores del santander banefe fue altamente educativa para quienes participamos en el proceso la ense anza m s grande est ligada a que los trabajadores hicieron su propia experiencia y pudieron sacar conclusiones importantes una de ellas es que la unidad sigue siendo una de las herramientas fundamentales para los intereses de los asalariados esta consigna tan lugar com n fue refrendada por los hechos no es suficiente claro est se requiere tambi n de representantes sindicales honestos dispuestos a dirigir sobre la base y el ejercicio de la m s amplia democracia y potente comunicaci n los conflictos nosotros tuvimos 14 asambleas en un mes de huelga ello genera un buen debate convicci n elevaci n de la moral y limita la incertidumbre que es un arma que suelen usar los empresarios
6472098 el conflicto tambi n revel elementos que no siempre est n presentes en la lucha sindical tradicional si bien el holding santander logr mediante sus poderosos recursos que la huelga y sus razones sufrieran un cerco comunicacional m s que importante afortunadamente nosotros explotamos la veta de la comunicaci n internacional ello signific que muchas organizaciones sindicales internacionales solidarizaran con nuestra lucha y el sistema financiero hoy es vulnerable a este fen meno el negocio de los bancos es la especulaci n entonces los grandes inversionistas al ver un conflicto que comienza a cobrar notoriedad p blica internacional presionan sobre la instituci n financiera en problemas
6472099 el conflicto hay que proporcionarlo pero sin duda fue importante para los trabajadores bancarios chilenos considerando que el grupo santander es el m s grande de iberoam rica para nosotros el hecho nos plantea grandes desaf os y conclusiones nos dice que con unidad convicci n voluntad y comunicaci n permanente es posible comenzar a derribar ciertos mitos basados en el poder o de las grandes corporaciones financieras supuestamente impenetrables por otra parte el conflicto tambi n descubri la certeza de que los trabajadores estamos solos somos la mayor a pero estamos solos de organizaciones sindicales reales una muestra fue la pr cticamente nula solidaridad de la central unitaria de trabajadores cut a pesar de todos los esfuerzos que se hicieron por tratar de comunicarse con la direcci n m xima de la cut para que prestara alg n tipo de apoyo por qu porque las personas que est n en la direcci n de la cut son ignorantes respecto de las nuevas luchas de este pa s y de las nuevas formas de la organizaci n capitalista del trabajo y por otra parte tampoco son capaces de dar cuenta de la realidad de temas tan relevantes como la educaci n en chile por ejemplo lamentablemente la cut hoy representa a sectores minoritarios
6472100 la mayor conmoci n que provoc la huelga de santander banefe y que activ sin buscarla por esos medios la solidaridad internacional fueron los grados de violencia que cobr el conflicto el primer d a fuimos detenidos casi 90 compa eros fue ultrajada una compa era el segundo d a un dirigente nacional fue brutalmente golpeado en el hall del banco durante toda la huelga fuimos seguidos por vigilantes de civil como en los peores tiempos de la dictadura militar ello y m s fue denunciado al gobierno a los parlamentarios a los partidos pol ticos sin embargo de qu nos sirvi cuando hay una complicidad en el hacer y en el silencio de los poderes establecidos y el capital financiero contradictoriamente con lo que podr a pensarse la indiferencia de los representantes del modelo dotaron de una mayor fuerza moral a las trabajadoras y trabajadores en huelga la violencia del capital no nos extra a tanto sino m s bien la pobr sima solidaridad sindical salvando excepciones que recibimos dentro del pa s
6472101 los trabajadores bancarios quedamos en una posici n un poco mejor que antes y adem s el conflicto nos permiti conocer nuestras potencias y limitaciones y una de las fortalezas de la confederaci n es la autonom a y la independencia de clase con las que nos conducimos poco a poco la confederaci n se arma de organizaciones reales de dirigentes que se forman en la lucha y mediante el ejercicio de la democracia y la acci n directa
6472102 la elecci n de la cut es irrelevante no tiene ninguna trascendencia para los trabajadores chilenos a pesar de que existan un par de dirigentes sindicales interesantes que desde hace poco est n tratando desde la cut de instalar un discurso y una pr ctica diferente pero en general lo que hay en la cut es la reproducci n de un ejercicio superado por la historia las elecciones est n organizadas sobre listas que responden a partidos pol ticos que en chile representan una cuota marginal de chilenos hoy es innegable para cualquiera que la gente y sobre todo la juventud no siente ninguna identidad con los partidos tradicionales yo pienso que estamos frente a la bancarrota del sindicalismo tradicional en chile y por eso lo que ocurra en las elecciones de la actual cut no tiene importancia para los intereses genuinos de los trabajadores del pa s lo m s probable es que las cosas queden tal cual est n en las listas hay personas que ni siquiera son dirigentes sindicales
6472103 las necesidades y realidades de los trabajadores transcurren por cauces distintos a las maneras que se expresa y organiza la cut todav a la cut vive en gran medida enfrascada en un modelo de desarrollo existente hasta 1973 pero rest ndole la autoridad moral de los dirigentes de esa poca hoy la cut cay en un pragmatismo exacerbado en el superestructuralismo y es antidemocr tica hasta en la elecci n de sus representantes
6472104 la cut sirve para blanquear las pol ticas del gobierno en t rminos generales funciona como ap ndice del gobierno y por lo tanto puede servir para validar la miseria de ingreso m nimo impuesto a los trabajadores para ello por lo menos siempre tiene prensa
6472105 las relaciones de producci n han variado tanto en chile que la organizaci n de los trabajadores se torna sumamente compleja toda vez por ejemplo que el sector de servicios terciario ha cobrado un vigor notable pero laboran en condiciones extraordinariamente precarias y no cuentan con tradici n de organizaci n hay muchos trabajadores que viven de la parte variable de su salario que son comisionistas trabajadores que se emplean luego de las 6 de la tarde y sus ritmos de funcionamiento son distintos etc todo ello demanda organizaciones diferentes que las tradicionales hoy hay que concentrarse en los trabajadores de los sectores m s dominantes de la econom a servicios comercio telecomunicaciones transporte
6472106 el sindicalismo no puede estar sujeto a los lineamientos jur dicos actuales ordenados por la patronal el sindicalismo desde sus albores ha estado al margen o en los l mites de la legalidad y por tanto ha obligado a que se haga la ley en funci n de sus demandas y luchas y no al rev s las leyes sociales nacieron en el mundo como fruto de las luchas y crecimiento del movimiento sindical organizado las leyes sociales de 1924 ley de la silla protecci n a la maternidad etc fueron consecuencia de las grandes luchas que dio luis emilio recabarren a comienzos del siglo pasado y que obligaron al presidente alessandri a promulgarlas para contener el avance del mundo obrero y por eso en 1931 nace el primer c digo del trabajo no como expresi n de la voluntad de la burgues a de la poca sino como resultado de la lucha de los trabajadores y hoy abrigamos grandes esperanzas toda vez que el promedio de edad de los trabajadores chilenos es mucho menor que el de las actuales dirigencias sindicales
6472107 en el contexto actual que gane la alianza por chile o la concertaci n para los trabajadores no significa ning n cambio significativo seguir a predominando el modelo econ mico actual las instituciones jur dicas no sufrir an grandes transformaciones en consecuencia para los intereses de los trabajadores resulta indiferente votar por pi era o lagos hay que recordar que el legado presidencial de ricardo lagos escobar se resume en el aumento de las inequidades sociales la concentraci n de la riqueza la violencia simb lica del capital sobre el trabajo se agudiz y lo que quedaba de servicios p blicos fue privatizado qu podemos esperar los trabajadores de un nuevo gobierno de la concertaci n o uno de la alianza por chile aqu en el corto plazo hay que construir una alternativa pol tica tal cual los empresarios que representen sus intereses incluso en el parlamento

6472112 die post hat sehr rasch auf die massiv gestiegenen berf lle der letzten tage reagiert gemeinsam haben wir eine gute l sung f r unsere kunden und unsere mitarbeiter erarbeitet
6472113 i have a little couch right beside his bed one person can stay in the room and i cant imagine any other place id rather be
6472114 i will never take for granted a day that i have with him
6472115 the extent of his burns were over 68 of his body most people from what i was told dont make it or certainly dont heal as fast as he has been
6472116 he was engulfed in flames the thoughts of it i know are horrific i am still in shock every minute in this surreal day to day zombie state that i seem to be in
6472117 my eyes were open to many things today things that have humbled me and made me thankful for not only my husbands life but my children and myself this time in our life yes has caused stress at times and is a daily emotional battle but at the end of the day jason is still alive anyone who has sustained the injury that jason has has either not lived or is now battling with many things they must learn to overcome jason is not missing a fingernail or an eyelash and he will eventually look back at this with only the scars as an attachment to the memory the lord truly has spared my husband
6472118 you can see her strength you get the sense one day thats shes broken confused about whats going on the next she might get news that jason is coming off the ventilator and you can feel shes just over the top thrilled little things like he opened his eyes it brings home the emotions of what theyre dealing with
6472119 i remember him as the agitating kind plays hard does the dirty work we were playing london in my rookie year it was the first round of playoffs jason didnt like something instead of just trying to antagonize or fight the one guy he dove head long into their bench he wanted to take them all on guys loved playing with him he was always no holds barred
6472120 i think he kind of got lost in the shuffle from 1999 to 2002 we had a great run with guys like brad boyes and carlo colaiacovo rupp and tim connolly and jason sort of flew under their radar
6472121 he still ranks in the top five in our franchise in goals assists points and hes no 1 in penalty minutes i dont think he ever got credit for that because there was always a first rounder here but he was an integral part in the building process here
6472122 we met in corpus christi tex the week he came into town the company i worked for sponsored the team we always had tickets and i dont know why but after two years i decided to go to a game after me and my girlfriends went to a bar and jason was there and he just followed me she laughs everywhere
6472123 i cant imagine a better person youd want your child to follow he has a beautiful heart
6472124 the community has also stepped up here and he hasnt been here for seven years but a lot of people remember what he did for the organization
6472125 and our daughter addison will be one year old this weekend so maybe well have a little birthday party here
6472126 its going to be over 1 million in medical costs
6472127 when you hear something like that you think any benefit we put together isnt even going to scratch that but someone opened my eyes and said hey this guy has three kids and a family never mind the hospital bills theyve got everyday living expenses while just trying to get through this
6472128 he hasnt changed since the day i met him hes soft spoken but he has a tremendous will hell work his way through this physically but the issue after that is debt hes a family type of person his mom and dad are just small town ordinary people the hospital bills are going to be unbelievable they dont have that kind of money and neither do his parents
6472129 don cherry sent him some stuff and so did bobby orr those are people who you would think are too busy to say or do something
6472130 its overwhelming everyone has opened their hearts people are reading the website and sending beautiful messages and prayer it just shows what kind of man i married a man who really left an impact on everyone he has come across
6472131 what were seeing now is the respect players had for him as a teammate he was quiet but he was always there when they needed him
6472132 it gives people a sense of what we can immediately do to improve the program on a daily basis
6472133 our objective every year is to put ourselves in a position to compete for the acc championship and earn a postseason berth our ultimate vision quest is to make the ncaa tournament and have a chance to compete for a national championship this quest will be reflected by believing in now and focusing our daily efforts into being the best we can be with the hope that our diligence and purpose will earn rewards
6472134 shannon is someone were looking at to provide leadership and be a role model in terms of how we like to do things in the gym
6472135 she is extremely fast and efficient as an attacker in the front row but shes also an obligate teammate shes really embraced the type of culture we are cultivating and is engaged in helping herself and others constantly improve she has made a concerted effort to nurture the young middles that we now have and also help them integrate into the environment and systems of our program
6472136 our biggest objective for sydney is to keep her healthy in order to put her in a position to take advantage of what she has learned throughout the spring
6472137 she has been working to add some stability as a blocker as well as become a more efficient attacker
6472138 hillary is one of those athletes thats dynamic quick and fast with her feet
6472139 she has great explosiveness off of one foot and will have an opportunity to contribute right away because she can compensate for a lot of things physically
6472140 tess could also contribute right away because she possesses the skill set that allows her to be versatile anywhere at the net outside middle or right side shes one of the more developed players coming in as a first year and has had great training in the past allowing her to comprehend and adapt quickly to what we are trying to implement
6472141 in assessing the makeup of our team we have the most depth at the outside hitter positions
6472142 we have a number of returning players who are versatile enough to play left or right side they each bring a different style of attack and with their skill sets we are confident in their abilities to pass and defend
6472143 laurens going to carry quite a big load as a passer and hitter for us
6472144 we feel that she has improved her health and conditioning from last season and we expect her to have a breakout season for us
6472145 the great thing about beth is that shes very versatile
6472146 she brings a lot to the table in regards to experience and has put in a lot of time and effort to give herself an opportunity to have a very good senior season
6472147 she has a high volleyball iq and has done a great job learning and executing our systems tara is a player that we look to bring a lot to the court physically
6472148 simone and kelly are both dynamic athletes that bring something different to the team
6472149 simone is quick has a solid foundation and developed skill set who also jumps very well while kelly was a two sport athlete in high school and is now focusing on volleyball kelly is very determined and that is allowing her to continually improve we look for big things from both simone and kelly as they develop
6472150 kendahl is coming off a great freshman season where she was honored for her performances
6472151 the biggest thing that she brings to the team is her terminal ability as an attacker shes a very physical player and we are looking to use that to our advantage
6472152 from a physical standpoint kelly is an athlete with a lot of agility and mobility that is going to be a positive for us if we are out of system knowing that shes the type of athlete who can run balls down and get us back into system with regards to marlow she has developed a nice technical proficiency with her setting to her advantage she has size and may be our best blocker at the net
6472153 there are two purposes of defense to stop the other team from scoring and to create offensive opportunities in transition
6472154 upon further review of this matter it now appears that no additional action by the commission is warranted at this time accordingly the investigation has been closed
6472155 we believe this will establish the psp as a viable communication device
6472156 we still have visitors coming to our sites who want to buy but sales are worse simply because of the difficulty in getting a mortgage
6472157 the internet is just a world passing around notes in a classroom
6472158 he swings at enough where hes going to hit a few out marshall said olson is strong on his feet and protects the puck well he finished the season playing alongside center jason krispel and right wing chris spicer and marshall liked what the line offered
6472159 as a freshman you are going to go through peaks and valleys he never really dipped too far down maybe he got frustrated when he wasnt scoring as much but he was still a guy we needed on the ice when his time came up he gained consistency and i think we can improve on that this year he has met our expectations

6472215 i met with sean penn and we talked at length
6472216 he was very clear that he is not currently planning to endorse any candidate in the general election but that he has serious concerns about the state of presidential debates he did support ohio democratic rep dennis j kucinich in the primaries and saw how dennis was excluded from msnbc debates
6472217 it was nice hanging out for a couple of hours
6472218 we just have to establish one thing before we get started i want to share with our listeners that luke made a comment on his blog a couple of years ago that soul prints was worthless but your girlfriend liked it
6472219 my girlfriend said it was the best book on judaism shed ever read
6472220 now we have the real source of luke ford going after marc gafni his girlfriend liked soul prints she thought it was the best book on judaism she ever read and he didnt
6472221 the reason im having this conversation with you we decided wed interview each other is to really do what nobody ever does talk to the other side who you feel is totally discredited totally unethical the worst version of tabloid internet everything i dont believe in
6472222 there was no one who said thats a good idea sorry
6472223 im really trying to go with my heart here and my heart was two things a because youre the person online whos created a lot of the negative record lets talk it through b everyone says youll distort everything i say c i have this belief that everybody no matter how complex they are has a point of integrity we can talk to and i believe thats true about me and i believe thats true about you im talking now to luke ford the angel im talking to the luke ford of radical integrity im talking to the luke ford who i can completely trust thats what im doing here
6472224 lets talk a little bit about what we talked about this morning who are you who is luke ford let me try to explain the question and ill give it completely over to you youre a little bit of a paradox and an enigma we just had a nice breakfast in salt lake city and we had a lovely waitress named lindsay wholesome beautiful energy shes sweet and you just fell in love with her
6472225 totally i fell in love with lindsay im a fool for love
6472226 shes this wholesome on the other hand theres lukeford com hardcore pornography right
6472227 thank you for helping me with that question what makes you run on the one hand theres this soft appreciation of a woman whos clearly a woman with integrity wholesome you could feel her values feel her goodness she didnt have her sexuality protruding she had her dignity a feminine beauty in its most wondrous dignified form you had this appreciation for that i saw it on your face i offered to perform the marriage did we agree on that
6472228 oh yeah shaking hands wish we had this on video
6472229 when luke ford gets married rabbi gafni will marry you
6472230 at the same time youre a gossip columnist or were correct me if im wrong for the pornography industry at least in the way youre quoted online you say things like true or not true im going to put anything out there and see what sticks slander is obviously a big jewish deal thirty nine times that doesnt seem to stop you so quickly you said something in the car that was helpful from some tv show that everyone has their own code
6472231 omar in the wire makes his living from holding up drug dealers
6472232 meaning that everybody has a code even hitler had a code
6472233 the downfall was a great movie on hitler that came out in 2004 he was a protagonist it was his last week of life in the bunker and he was a sympathetic protagonist
6472234 my point is that everybody has a code everybody thinks certain things are right and certain things are wrong hitler thought that killing jews was right
6472235 you take judaism seriously youre sitting here in a yarmulke and tzitzit you made a blessing over your food with your permission i can describe you
6472236 youre wearing a beard i was surprised you told me you read an article by meir soloveitchik in commentary about the jewish significance of the beard
6472237 those are pretty strong positions there and yet you may be mis cited correct me i dont want to say anything thats not right but youre cited playing fast and loose with the truth about a lot of people online people say about you online that the man just thrives for negative attention so how do those two fit together whats the code whats the internal system
6472238 first when someone converts to anything including judaism they bring everything that they are all their baggage to the mix
6472239 so i believe that judaism is gods will for the jewish people but my judaism is still poured through my very flawed vessel i am narcissistic i do have narcissistic personality disorder i had that before i became interested in judaism and i have that now when i am interested in judaism my judaism gets poured through my flawed vessel
6472240 one of my rules for this interview is that im going to slander no one im going to attack no one im going to try to go deep with you about ideas and what lifes about we can talk about me we can talk about you you can ask questions
6472241 you just talked about a gorgeous idea you said everyone has flaws you seem to have a very high level of contradiction but whatever
6472242 youre saying that the will of god or the light if you will is refracted through the prism of the vessel
6472243 who you are is the prism through which the light is refracted
6472244 it means that we need to do two different types of work in the world because were all imperfect vessels for the light
6472245 the analogy to the movie i dont mean to compare you to hitler theres no analogy between you and hitler no its not cool but in other words the idea is that a guy likes puppies on the one hand and on the other hand hes gassing jews youre talking about that level of deep and profound contradiction
6472246 at least not on thursdays thursday is a total gas free day
6472247 i just want to tell you luke that all this talk about me sexually harassing im really just into barnyard animals im also responsible for global warming its me and ive got something to do with famine in africa
6472248 but can you not disperse this tape too big its just kinda between us
6472249 secret safe with luke ford people listening how safe would that make you feel
6472250 when we were buying you your first digital tape recorder
6472251 luke has pointed out that 99 of the world is ahead of me in high tech and im a bad driver but youre also a bad driver
6472252 so were talking to morgan and we had this conversation are people basically good or are people basically bad stuff my basic position is that people often act out of narrow self interest but at their deepest place people are ultimately good at their deepest place people are gorgeous are beautiful
6472253 im concerned youll run over your phone with your chair
6472254 thats your goodness coming out that was purely altruistic you had no reason to tell me that that was goodness you were taking care of me in that moment and i appreciate it yo
6472255 my basic feeling is that ultimately people at their core love other people people at their core want to be good people at their core are good people at their core feel better when theyre living meaningful lives people at their core are what we call in judaism homo imitatio dei imitate god well thats latin bzelem elohim in gods image theyre what dante called babyfaced divines people are beautiful theyre loving people are devastated when theyre betrayed because it is a violation of something essential and beautiful in the human being people feel most alive and most aligned with the universe with the divinity when theyre actually expressing their basic good nature thats the gafni position
6472256 the first two statements you made that people are basically good and that when they are at their deepest place that theyre good and loving theyre not falsifiable assertions
6472257 this is another example of natural goodness someone just brought us a beautiful drink did you do this for an ulterior motive or just to be good
6472258 so give me your position now were finally understanding why you didnt like soul prints but why didnt you like the girlfriend
6472259 can we just drink to whatever is good in her
6472260 every army in the world when it can rapes on mass except israel and maybe america id argue to you that all men unless theyre extremely good or timid are rapists and they only reason they dont is not because in a deep place theyre good but because theyre afraid of being caught
6472261 let me try to unpack that and try to get to a deeper place here
6472262 when i say that all people in their deepest place are good im not saying that all people are naturally good
6472263 however theres a second level when theyre basically acting out of narrow self interest but society constrains them
6472264 then theres a third level when theyve done work theyve done spiritual practice theyre trained and refined their deepest self for what rav kook calls their essential self that third level is what im talking about
6472265 im not sure we disagree at the surface level i agree with you one hundred million people killed im not suggesting a naive position if you can speak to a persons deepest self we now have records of how the nazi guards felt in the camps they were devastated
6472266 dennis prager likes to cite the movie from woody allen crimes and misdemeanors
6472267 the good brother the rabbi goes blind and the bad brother whos having an affair gets away with murder
6472268 yes a persons weakness will create a default position which you described the default evil human being level one
6472269 level two the person constrained by the laws of society but level three ohmigod people are beautiful luke
6472270 theres a great statement by rabbi kook when he says that the essence of who i am is revealed at my moment of greatness
6472271 heres how i would say it to you you luke look for a person at their moment of flaw you look for a person when theyve messed up and you want to freeze frame on the flaw and youre always going to find that because everyones flawed
6472272 what were you gaining from that nothing nothing you were just in godspace if you were to ask me who luke ford really is its luke ford at that moment all that other stuff you do work it out work it out
6472273 respond tell me where im off have i created some resolution here
6472274 next question here i gave you this morning my psychologization of luke ford do i have your permission to repeat it one of our rules is no surprises
6472275 to reduce a person to somebody elses analysis is not fair
6472276 when i say with your permission its a real question anything you tell me you dont want to talk about ill stay away from
6472277 so what i said to luke this morning as we were having breakfast at this great restaurant the oasis restaurant where i left my credit card in salt lake city
6472278 my sense was that luke that somebody in your life disappointed you big time and that this person was an authority figure it was a mum it was a dad it was an uncle or a minister i dont know your life big time that this person was somehow an elmer gantry figure and you realized that the person was not only flawed but profoundly hypocritical profoundly fake and you can almost feel your rage at this person and you have this life mission to show that all these people who seem so elegant and beautiful that underneath they have clay feet part of your moral code if you will you have a moral mission to expose those clay feet is that accurate
6472279 yeah i think theres a lot of accuracy to that
6472280 in other words to a certain sense youve established an empirical data
6472281 your favorite book im thinking of inscribing it to you and giving you a copy
6472282 i write in the beginning of soul prints in my own self description i write i dont know if youve ever read this or not read it but i write in it some place that in his own self description gafni calls himself a flawed human being whos forever striving
6472283 i cant resist a parenthesis here with your permission i dont know if its you or someone else someone keeps writing online it comes up when my name comes that hes changed his name from winiarz to gafni and hes hiding
6472284 of course its the most ridiculous thing in the world
6472285 i think that for a little time in my twenties my secretary spelled my name winyiarz
6472286 were getting a little smile here from luke too bad its not on video
6472287 so back to our thing here ok let me throw it over to you thats what were talking about here
6472288 right i dont have any response i wasnt sure if there was a question
6472289 i didnt sleep well last night are you tired you got up really early
6472290 its a symptom of the craft one thousand airplanes landing safely in salt lake city today is not news one plane that crashes in bangladesh killing 85 people is news if i had a choice between writing about 10 000 airplanes that landed safely and the one airplane that crashed id prefer to write about the one airplane that crashed
6472291 to translate that if i had a choice between writing about the 98 that may be good in a person or the 2 thats flawed the news is the bit that is flawed the 98 that they did well thats not news
6472292 its on youtube and all of a sudden the entire campaign is about this one mistake bill clinton made
6472293 heres a question for you could i take one luke ford sexual mistake which you can tell me about today but no were not asking personal questions sorry sorry sorry right and blow it out and say that is who luke ford is of course i could
6472294 i have found as a journalist that politicians are about the most vapid group of people i have not been following bill clinton on the campaign trail ive seen the same news but ive not been following it carefully i have not been thinking about it but it is entirely possible to me that that angry three minute rant may be the most significant three minutes of his time on the campaign trail everything bill clinton has said that ive seen has been vapid
6472295 i accept the emendation i dont know politicians i dont even have an opinion
6472296 luke you made this emendation about politicians which i said i have no knowledge about
6472297 let me move away from the particular political issue and talk about the person
6472298 you said a thousand planes landing safely is not news the plane that crashes is news
6472299 the thousand planes that land safely depend on thousands of people to do their job with integrity
6472300 youre not acting in describing reality youre letting yourself be driven by the lowest common denominator in humanity remember the coliseum in rome where people are fed to the lions
6472301 does that give you an image maybe the blogosphere is where people are fed to the lions we try to find whats flawed in a person sure not true doesnt really matter as long as we can hook it on something then we kinda create a tabloid roman coliseum run by the lowest human instincts
6472302 why would you luke ford an intelligent refined man who can fall in love with the waitress let yourself be determined and controlled by this lowest human instinct
6472303 when you condemn news driven by ratings lets unpack that to use a gafniism
6472304 another word for ratings is reality when we say high ratings we mean news that people want to read or watch on tv even more than that its news that advertisers will pay to advertise on because there will be enough readers or viewers to reward them
6472305 in other words we are talking about news that sustains itself were talking about news that people are willing to pay for with either their time or attention
6472306 saying that a newscast or newspaper or blog has high ratings thats the same as saying that that business is profitable
6472307 now a lot of people want to buy pornography and drugs and buy bad things but a lot of people also want to buy good things so the fact that a lot of people want something is not necessarily indicative that were dealing with the lowest common denominator
6472308 we have so little spare time i see nothing wrong with someone wanting to spend 30 seconds on the plane that crashed rather than 30 seconds on the people who insure that planes dont crash
6472309 here he is doing all these deep complex issues and here he had five people in lingerie and that got the highest ratings and he was so disgusted by it he quit national tv
6472310 it is easier to look at five beautiful women in lingerie than to talk about the 50 million people who dont have health insurance
6472311 but what id rather do and i think you would also thats what im challenging you on and you can push back as im sure you will youre not known to be shy but i say that talking about the 50 million people who are suffering because they dont have health insurance and trying to come up with a solution so there will be more compassion and more goodness in the world is on a deeper level more satisfying than looking at the five women in lingerie
6472312 now they are different satisfactions they both have validity aesthetic beauty is beautiful but ultimately i apologize to referring to that book soul prints again
6472313 theres an idea that we talked about there called aftertaste
6472314 so the question is five women in lingerie on pragers tv show whatever nice moment
6472315 i guess im asking you a rabbi question but not asking you as a rabbi ive given up on a being a formal artist im more of a spiritual artist and a friend for these three hours wouldnt you rather spend your life doing something that will give you a great aftertaste isnt that a fair question
6472316 there are things that are more important to me than aftertaste
6472317 ill give you an empirical example i was immersed in the bowels of the pornography industry for about 12 years the pornography industry is what people who know nothing about the pornography industry think it is it is a low scummy place
6472318 i broke a story about a guy who had hiv and who was transmitting hiv to a lot of other people
6472319 this was a very dirty story this was about deviant forms of sex and deception and prostitution everything about this story was yucky i cant reveal tell the story in polite company because the details are revolting
6472320 by publishing that story i saved a lot of peoples lives this guy was outed as hiv positive he was stopped from performing there were girls who were saved from performing with him because of what i wrote
6472321 once you have the rush of saving lives worries about aftertaste are secondary
6472322 it was a filthy world and it was a filthy story but it was an important story the importance of a story is more important to me than how i feel about myself during and after
6472323 that validates what im trying to say that luke ford in all his complex contradictions is turned on by doing good just like getting the story right creates good in the world when youre just throwing spaghetti at the wall and getting things wrong creates bad in the world
6472324 a professor of a recent book on happiness said you can either be in the problem solving mindset or you can be in the victim mindset but you cant be in both simultaneously being in one state precludes the other if you feel like you are in charge of your life and you are taking steps to improve your life you can not simultaneous feel sorry for yourself and if you feel sorry for yourself you cant take steps to improve your life
6472325 a person can either be a victim or a player
6472326 a person whos a victim says they did it to me im powerless
6472327 if a person in a company says they did it they cover themselves but theyre not that helpful to the company whenever something happens its someone elses fault because they are not part of the solution they are part of the problem
6472328 what i do with spiritually incorrect is i try and tell the story of what happened without mentioning any person directly or indirectly without slandering anyone what are the big ideas what was the email you sent me last night
6472329 i dont tell it from the perspectives of people i use the prism of ideas
6472330 one way of telling the story is they did it to me
6472331 the question is what is my 5 or 10 or 20 what is my percent in any story that happens to me ive got to identify what my part in that story is and what did i do to create the conditions for what happened to me thats where my power is
6472332 the price of innocence is impotence im only innocent when im impotent i may be innocent of complaints people made about me but if i just focus on that i dont get anywhere ive got to see what i can learn from this whats my part
6472333 i want to introduce a new phrase a contribution system not a blame frame but a contribution system we have to move in life from a blame frame to a contribution system whats my part in a contribution system that created events
6472334 thats very different from new age thinking that says you create your whole reality
6472335 a lot of horrible things happen in the world which we dont create i dont blame the rwandan mother who sees her family massacred in front of her
6472336 theres one position that says we create our own reality thats position a
6472337 position b says we create none of our own reality were victims
6472338 the more intelligent and more true the deeper position says no i dont create my own reality and im not a victim
6472339 thats a position that seems to me to be very powerful
6472340 that creates a pretty powerful frame both men and women need to own their power
6472341 men need to own their power in the sense that she said no but i got carried way because if she said no and you got carried away thats rape
6472342 because a man is often more physically powerful than a woman we have a whole set of laws against rape no is actually no
6472343 theres a whole complex other question which ive never been involved with in my life per se what if a woman is saying no but acting yes
6472344 thats a complex question lets put that aside lets talk about a straight no
6472345 thats a straight no so when a man overpowers that no thats a violation of male power thats a violation of the vulnerable of the helpless and deserves societal restraint and censure
6472346 women also have power they have all sorts of power they have intellectual power they have feminine radiant power they have sexual power they have verbal power
6472347 the image of the powerless woman and the powerful man that is something that i hope feminism did away with what feminism tried to say was that women are autonomous and powerful
6472348 as opposed to power feminism victim feminism says women are basically victims he did it to me
6472349 were not talking about rape the he did it to me with rape is a real thing
6472350 were talking about theres a relationship the relationship is fully mutual fully consensual
6472351 they have a relationship that is completely mutual where both man and women engage initiate etc and that doesnt work and then she goes back and rereads the story re members reworks the story and it becomes a harassment story thats a violation of female power
6472352 men are powerful and women are powerful men are vulnerable and women are vulnerable men lie and women lie theres masculine shadow and feminine shadow
6472353 i wanted to move out of theoretical victim structure you set up and i expanded on to bring it into the realm of relationships between masculine and feminine
6472354 the following analogy is not fully true but it is true enough to be interesting and relevant to what you said
6472355 with every lover a man grows bigger and stronger and with every lover a woman is like a rose that loses a petal
6472356 i want to fully inhabit the idea without blabbing about it
6472357 that means that theres a part of masculinity in this aphorism which is expansive and polyamorous and is not monogamous by nature theres a male expansion that happens from being with many women
6472358 at the same time theres the greek goddess hera its about hearth theres a feminist hearth quality that her full blossom is achieved with her relationship with the one man and with every lover she loses a petal
6472359 you understand the feminists would kill you on this so you better hope that they are not listening and that they dont have your address
6472360 the idea that youre putting out is that theres a difference between feminine and masculine nature
6472361 and thats it is not ok to have mutual affairs with women
6472362 well youre talking about mutuality rather than consenting and if theres mutuality in a relationship it is between equals im saying that unless a relationship lasts a lifetime theres a power exchange to the mans benefit and to the womans detriment
6472363 even though in secular western ethics mutuality means something perfectly legal and ethical nonetheless theres something essential about the difference between the masculine and the feminine and that the mans masculine nature by itself is a violation of the feminine
6472364 my friend dalit completely believes in that position she views as her life goal an entire set of womens blogs to teach that position
6472365 shes the person i was announced to be marrying not true your friend seems to announce marriages that have no relationship to reality but what can you do
6472366 a good feminist can disagree with that position thats a chauvinistic patriarchal outmoded view of feminine sexuality which devalues feminine autonomy and all the gains of feminism i dont think that bothers you per se
6472367 i think you meant that position in a personal way so let me respond in a personal way
6472368 one of my greatest life desires in the same way i tried to talk about where your rage comes from is for a monogamous great love
6472369 when i was 31 much like the same experience you had with our waitress only deeper this is an example of one of the stories out there
6472370 i was willing to give up my rabbinic reputation at that time everything almost for that great love i dont think we even kissed we just hugged
6472371 her father plugged into pag parents against gafni he was the head of the local pag chapter he did everything he could successfully to break up that relationship
6472372 i remember that i thought that that relationship was more important than everything else in the world
6472373 it didnt work too well for me i gave up everything for it and then she didnt appear i was completely devastated
6472374 i only once in my life worked out intensely i had four months when i went they were after this thing fell apart
6472375 i was living in kiryat ona near bar ilan university
6472376 i would go five times a week i was the littlest guy in the gym i was pumping up and down it was the only way i could survive
6472377 about six or seven weeks later she got engaged to someone else the last thing she said to me was i will always love you
6472378 i remember the day she got married i was just streaming tears little gafni trying to pump iron in the gym
6472379 the great love has always been important to me and its always been numinous ive not succeeded in accomplishing that
6472380 that great desire remember herman hesses book narcissus and goldmund it was more about sexuality but that kind of split in me that deep desire to have this great love and that somehow this was the most holy thing in the world and this drove a lot of my life
6472381 we can psychologize it i dont like to reduce things to psychology not you or me
6472382 theres a second belief ive had parallel to this my whole life osha talks about this hes a complex eastern philosopher
6472383 you asked about my book mystery of love mystery of love is about this youll like my book mystery of love less than soul prints i promise
6472384 it talks about what does it mean to be a great lover
6472385 i take responsibility for anyone who was emotionally hurt in that process
6472386 bono thinks we hurt each other and do it again
6472387 i want to offer you something that takes us to a different place
6472388 my first girlfriend told me you play with a girls feelings and then say you need to act in your own self interest
6472389 she was saying once youre having sex with me you cant expect me to act rationally
6472390 thats beautiful thats not a legal category its not even an ethical category its about spirit
6472391 classical feminist issue will take complete issue with what you said you are moving it back to pre feminism youre saying that once a woman is sexually involved she can no longer be autonomous and powerful
6472392 feminism teaches that women can be autonomous and powerful women can be sexually autonomous and powerful women can make sexual choices women can choose to have sexual relationships for pleasure for friendship and intimacy
6472393 i have two groups of women friends on this issue
6472394 one group of woman friends which ill call the dalit position says you are absolutely right
6472395 theres a huge part of me thats holding that today as the highest possibility
6472396 let me ask you a question so what do we do with that today in a society in which that does not seem like an easy possibility youre not married i assume youve been involved with women
6472397 ive slept with about 40 women in my life some of them were porn stars and they were able to have sex without emotional commitment
6472398 ok ok ok so what do we do today our whole society is built in a way that men and women go out
6472399 its a sex society women are dressed immodestly tv billboards everything is conspiring against that ideal youd have to battle all of society not to mention our own nature
6472400 how do we navigate rabbi luke ford how do we navigate society
6472401 if youre going to fulfill this ideal youre going to have to ghettoize yourself you shouldnt own a tv you shouldnt go to movies maybe you shouldnt even look at the daily newspaper because there are bra ads you shouldnt be alone in a room with a member of the opposite sex you should fulfill orthodox judaism most people will need to become religiously orthodox to fulfill this ideal most people will need that kind of religious rigor to live this
6472402 i think youre right orthodox judaism is powerful in this area it prescribes all physical contact before marriage physical contact as is always a slippery slope being alone with a member of the opposite sex is by itself a sexual event its called yichud and therefore it is proscribed
6472403 it allows for sexuality only within the context of either marriage or a committed exclusive relationship called pelegesh ultimately that would make society a healthier place
6472404 theres a large part of me that agrees with that three years ago there wasnt three years ago i was more trying to see what was possible theres a large orthodox voice inside of me which feels that that is very powerful and true and compelling and that is the great gift of orthodoxy
6472405 i have another voice and i want to own that voice as well
6472406 heres the second voice sexuality is beautiful and gorgeous and that both men and women have the ability to be loving and sexual with each other with clear honest and full intention and that there are different stages of life the stages are the key to this hermeneutic
6472407 playing the field but in a sacred way in a way thats not demeaning disclosing of full intention the woman may be going out with different people thats a certain stage of life at the end of that stage of life i make a decision who im going to settle down with
6472408 i have a teacher who married a woman from paris he says they never talk about before they were married thats a parisian thing its not gentlemanly to ask what were you doing before we were married
6472409 that may be a model that holds the possibility of having different partners and loving people fully and transitioning to a place of radical monogamy at a different stage of life
6472410 i honestly dont know which one is correct i have deep inner conflict about each one i dont feel that i have purified myself sufficiently to be able to look at that in the most honest way
6472411 it seems that every redemptive messianic movement tried to rethink the sexual issue because everyone was stuck on this
6472412 the stuck problem is that monogamy doesnt work so well either
6472413 i found so many times that people married the wrong person for this or that psychological reason
6472414 the monogamy idea for all the idyllic beauty that weve ascribed to it isnt working
6472415 on the other hand theres the sharp critique that youve made correctly of the broad open free more flowing position
6472416 marc i came here to salt lake city with one simple question tell me about your life that gary rosenblatt communicated to you that he wanted to talk about your past sex life
6472417 always a good phone call to get from gary blessings to gary
6472418 i dont follow the blogs but a particular rabbi may he blessed whos been very much my nemesis for almost 30 years someone who i barely know but someone i represent something to is very good friends with gary rosenblatt i think it was on your blog
6472419 whats so funny about the jewish community with blessings to all is that nobody tries to hide it
6472420 there is a group of people who know each other and went to yu together or did not go to yu but are close old friends as this rabbi says he is with gary and as a number of other key rabbis and leaders that gary has left off the hook on sexual issues also are im not part of that group
6472421 if i can share something that luke said when the tape recorder is off which i thought was nice citing a feminist masculinist theorist in this case dennis prager that when you ask a guy a question hell give you all the theory and when you ask a girl shell give you details
6472422 luke and i have agreed that were not going to talk about this or that sexual detail its not about lukes sex life and not about gary rosenblatts sex life were not going to slander anyone but were going to talk about the the story and not just theories
6472423 the first feeling was how much im not in the old boys network im so unprotected i grew up in columbus ohio i send blessings to my parents i left home when i was 13 years old to go to a yeshiva high school it was a complex home
6472424 when gary called me garys an old insider i knew before it was written on your blog that he was close friends with this particular rabbi who doesnt seem particularly bent on my positive unfolding in life my heart dropped
6472425 it was even before that i remember where i was i was teaching at a retreat center and someone handed me a copy of the jewish week garys newspaper and it said there and people urged me to look into a philandering rabbi who changed his name and moved to israel
6472426 it was clear to me that i was in their sights these guys want to take me down
6472427 who people pick in journalism to go after have a lot to do with the old boys network has a lot to do with the old boys network has a lot to do with other things other than the things that should motivate a story
6472428 if gary wants to call and correct me on this im happy to have a private conversation with him and go through whats going on out there and why you pick a particular thing
6472429 i went to talk to someone and they said no what are you talking about but in my body it said this is real its nasty its not going to be pleasant i may go down i said to myself ill get back up with gods help
6472430 i just had this feeling i had a very bad feeling
6472431 i dont do anything about it what is there to do
6472432 thats where the changed name story began as i read to you from soul prints everything ive written in many lectures ive given i always talk about marc my name evoution similar to barry to barack winiarz and gafni and hebraizing it
6472433 it was the first planting of false the idea that i had somehow secretly changed my name to not be winiarz and be gafni
6472434 my second feeling was helplessness as i read to you from soul prints which was already published then both of my names are there its very clear that there was no false name change but that didnt matter to anyone
6472435 did you read kafkas trial the facts dont matter so much you begin to feel helpless that what should be isnt it was devastating i can literally call it up in my body now they talk about your heart falling to your stomach thats what it felt like worse than when those people left you in that bad neighborhood in la
6472436 i was teaching at rabbi michael lerner the editor of tikkun
6472437 the way the story is told 45 year old gafni is sleeping with a 14 year old girl when in fact gafni was just out of high school and not sleeping with anyone
6472438 the woman who i wish only good to and i would meet with luke at any time if you wind up being the facilitator of it i will meet with her at any time at any place in a facilitated context to bring healing to this
6472439 she wrote me a letter after the relationship was over describing it as the most beautiful relationship describing me
6472440 i read once your story this womans as it were story on the web and i literally threw up
6472441 at the time i was too naive to think what can i do about this i got sick to my stomach it was 25 years ago i didnt remember then
6472442 i only remembered a year and a half ago two years ago that she wrote me a letter afterwards
6472443 this womans sister had written michael that theres a story on gafni thats about to break
6472444 would i do it again of course not would i teach young men to behave differently in that situation of course i would but between that and re raising it and trying to wreck someones life with it is a long long distance
6472445 he asked me at the time i remember something like have you had affairs i said no which wasnt true i have had a bohemian lifestyle that didnt seem to be appropriate to share with gary why would i do that
6472446 i told him completely the truth of this early story which we discussed above i dont think that he believed me
6472447 kill the competition protect yourself from attack and pretend even to yourself that is was for noble motives
6472448 now i have a polygraph to support it i didnt then
6472449 the second story on the web as well is completely distorted in tone and substance thats also validated by polygraph
6472450 i wasnt fully transparent with gary about what did transpire and how it played that was a mistake
6472451 the reason that happened was simple when it first took place immediately her advisor brought her to this particular rabbi who held less than my ennobled self interest in mind and i called a very close friend no names who was a significant figure in the community at the time as well as now and said this is what actually happened very very limited its been blown up in two days through the prism of this rabbi its become this huge archetypal original sin story which is not what it was the woman was strongly encouraged to i was in my youth then she was 16 she was strongly encouraged to kinda blow this story up
6472452 i feel the story was a mistake that any encounter with her at all was a mistake
6472453 the advice that i received at the time again im not passing off my responsibility for the advice but the advice i received very strongly from a very strong older sister person was she called the rabbi in question who was moving the story forward and she called me back and said listen this man does not have your self interest or any sense of decency healing or fair play in mind
6472454 his wife hates you because you represent a man that she had two major collapses while she worked for him and you evoke this man in her it is not rational later someone very close to this couple told me the same thing and said to me twenty years later that their
6472455 so when a group of people went to support me in a public letter right
6472456 as the years went on when i founded my organization in israel there were two female board members who i again consulted with about this issue
6472457 with great respect for everyone but vicki polin who says she sacrificed and murdered babies on an oprah in 1989 right
6472458 and and so and so both of these people advised me very very strongly that i was doing the only appropriate thing that could possibly be done right which is what i did
6472459 in retrospect i shouldve been more transparent on that one issue it wasnt something that seemed possible then the best advice i got said not to do it and ultimately the people who give us advice arent responsible for what we do we are so i take responsibility for that
6472460 what i fully and utterly reject is the pathologizing that some people all with less then wholesome agenda and motives have done on the hate blogs of the internet and other forums
6472461 its kind of like if i can use an analogy its kind of like mccarthyism this is a term that the colleague you mentioned dennis prager also uses sexual mccarthyism
6472462 sexual mccarthyism and the term was actually coined by alan dershowitz i thought i coined it two years ago and then i looked it up online and i was so disappointed right to see alan dershowitz had written a book by that name but sexual mccarthyism means you take the correct loathing that we have of sexual abuse but then you use it you actually abuse sexual abuse you use it for a series of other far more complex and dark agendas which you actually cant own and you cloak yourself in a respectable battle thats essentially what mccarthy did and thats what alan dershowitz calls sexual mccarthyism
6472463 so to take a sexual mistake anyones whether its yours or mine or the rabbis or the editors and then transform it into this larger than life archetypal original sin motivated and driven by a kind of sexual hysteria is deeply problematic from an ethical perspective
6472464 i feel again to borrow dennis pragers and warren farrels phrase my personal experience is that i feel like ive been name raped
6472465 when i say name raped i dont in any way in any way minimize the experience of rape
6472466 so while violent rape is in a class by itself prager points out that when he talks about name rape people would call him and say how can you say that its offensive to women and he would say on his show what would you feel if this happened to your son
6472467 to have your kind of your sexuality distorted and demonized for 25 years and then put on the web in a distorted and demonized way and until i took these polygraphs i knew of no way of responding to it what could i do
6472468 it wasnt until i hired a fantastic group of lawyers here in salt lake city who said polygraph it
6472469 now as you said in the car everyone has a perspective but not all perspectives are equal you cant distort a past story for example you cant say im vicki polin i didnt like my parents i had a really hard childhood so therefore there was a jewish satanic cult that murdered babies
6472470 no thats not ok theres actually not a jewish satanic cult around america that murders babies thats not true
6472471 thats not a perspective problem thats an empirical problem if i can borrow your phrase
6472472 i would be willing to sit with anyone certainly with these two 25 and 30 year old stories in a facilitated context and create closure
6472473 every time i hear about it on the web she keeps getting younger id be 23 and she becomes 12
6472474 i went with her to her ninth grade classes at ramaz high school ill never never mention her name its inappropriate
6472475 i loved this woman with all my soul right i know she mocks that im completely aware of that but actually she wrote me a letter afterwards fully validating that she had the same experience right
6472476 so can i go back and own my part in that story of course i can did i not understand certain things then right of course i didnt but to move from there to some kind of demonization will actually demonize every man and woman in america
6472477 every man and woman in america who has a healthy sexuality has a complex story someplace somewhere which can be distorted and demonized
6472478 enough theory did you have any idea when the gary rosenblatt story came out that this was just the beginning of your nightmare that this was just the blood in the water
6472479 to fast forward at a particular time i got divorced from my third wife
6472480 im sniffing a rose while marc is crying in his soul
6472481 luke were not going to debate this this is where your blog did a profound disservice the whole negative blog thing created a kind of crazy environment
6472482 my site is the first one that comes up i own you
6472483 you dont anymore and hopefully youll move beyond that too laughing
6472484 thats a problem tom tugend wrote a thousand articles in his life i was interested in an article he wrote i googled him and the first thing that came up was luke and tom
6472485 its simply because it is the best work as reflected by other peoples links to it i do nothing to optimize i just try to put out the best story other people link to me
6472486 if you give people tabloid how many people have you seen stop to read the national enquirer the equivalent of that online is people like luke ford
6472487 that drives luke ford to the top of tom tugend whos written a thousand other great articles but luke fords tom tugend interview becomes first thats the power of the national enquirer and thats the tabloid coliseum playing in the blogosphere you should not be proud of that my friend
6472488 luke i want to say this to you directly if you want to come up second and third on a person fourth fifth say what you say i think its radically irresponsible in a thousand ways but you do what you do but i think theres something wrong in a virtual world to take tom tugends first place hes got a lifes work hes got a world hes not someone i know i dont have an investment but theres something off on that that may be kind of funny to you blessings
6472489 we can link that back to the beginning of our interview about lukes view of the world
6472490 im doing a movie this year on the shadow of the internet youll be a guest
6472491 im here to talk to your best and most beautiful side and im here to talk to the person who got a huge rush when you saved lives i dont buy into the luke ford monster view i just dont buy it im talking to the evolved luke ford that i write about in soul prints that you hate so lets go back to our story
6472492 so gary rosenblatts story comes out but then i get all this information that portrays you as the biggest creep from people who go back 25 years on you tell me garys story comes out then i pile on how was that for you
6472493 ill just say it this way luke angelina jolie says this about the tabloids 95 of what you write is just crap it is distorted i could take you through it line by line stories about me
6472494 i mean come sit in my basement where my books are
6472495 i could probably trace each line that you write to who said it from what situation you collected a bunch of half baked things and gave them a creep spin well call it the luke creep spin and there it went it was so inaccurate it was so distorted its not even possible to respond to
6472496 i told you i read your thing once a couple of years ago im sure its changed but probably the same core is there
6472497 part of the reason you do the creep spin is that thats your basic view of life right
6472498 thank you thats important your basic view of life is that people are creeps
6472499 my basic view of life is that luke ford is beautiful that doesnt mean that luke ford doesnt do really creepy stuff but i believe in that higher person and thats where we part ways
6472500 thats our sacred contract today we agree its beyond past and future its in the present
6472501 i said to this particular person who talked to me about whos a major mover and shaker in israel well do this and then well have these people come out from the closet and do their old stuff
6472502 i said that doesnt seem like such a great idea to me that doesnt seem like the best way to spend a sunday afternoon
6472503 a particular rabbi called him and said to him reopen the gafni thing a back bencher old friend of his so he reopened the gafni thing
6472504 once that story happened we realized it was going to get distorted again in israel the same two old stories being distorted so we then initiated the story in maariv the story was told relatively accurately then it was over so we thought
6472505 im not living this story im teaching every day im working with people im fundraising im lending people money im helping people im trying to be a mentch the story is like a sidebar sometimes it gets annoying but mostly its like a fly were swatting sorry to analogize you to a fly
6472506 there was a particular person im not going to mention names and ill ask you not to as well i want to hold everyones confidentiality there was a particular person who i was involved with at the end of my marriage who had something to do with the marriages breakup
6472507 i had no sense whatsoever then nor did the people involved at the time of anything transgressive about the relationships
6472508 if i can go deep for a second theres bad secrets and theres confidentiality what people do in a artificial way is say that secrets are bad thats not true confidentiality is sacred father sleeping with his daughter sordid secret is bad
6472509 theres this notion in victim feminism of breaking the silence but actually when you are holding sacred confidentiality and you break that thats not a great thing to do thats not breaking the silence thats just breaking a promise to cloak that as breaking the silence is absurd
6472510 i did not for a second not for a second luke see the rupture coming
6472511 the truth is i was moving so fast i was naive it didnt occur to me that this would be hurtful in a way that it obviously was hurtful to women for that actually i greatly regret
6472512 the question is what do we do with our hurt were all hurt
6472513 i remember someone said to me about a year ago when i said something about the situation she said but this or that person was hurt and i said hurt doesnt give a person the license to murder
6472514 thats something the earlier philosopher dennis prager you quoted understands
6472515 in the mafia when youre hurt rub em out my dignity was offended
6472516 but actually thats not the way it works when you evolve levels of consciousness i take my hurt and i make it into compassion
6472517 i know that youre a biblical kinda guy so can i give you a text here
6472518 you shall not oppress the stranger for you were strangers in the land of egypt
6472519 i dont think anyone intentionally filed an untrue complaint but there was a hysteria
6472520 there is one thing im going to say which she said that was completely inappropriate she said he told me the old stories were true not at all true
6472521 because everyone is now self protecting themselves in case they god forbid get accused of not protecting women everyone moves into a self protective stance lets sacrifice gafni and go home i basically became the sacrificial lamb
6472522 and if that is the only thing i have to say thats victim talk right thats not the only thing i have to say im not sitting here saying only the bastards did it
6472523 a im saying the police complaints werent true i dont even know if the women made police complaints maybe they were distorted in the press so im not blaming the women im just saying this whole thing that got reported just wasnt true
6472524 b it never should happened that way there shouldve been a healing circle we shouldve talked to each other it shouldve been facilitated it shouldve been handled privately right all those things
6472525 c i had a part in the contribution system that created it i didnt see it coming the relationships shouldve been either transparent or nonexistent
6472526 ive actually thought about it people pushed me luke for a year to take responsibility
6472527 for what for people whove lied about the nature of my sexuality what exactly am i supposed to take responsibility for of course youre in the new age world its your creation youve got to take responsibility
6472528 but youve got to take responsibility for what youve got to take responsibility for clearly i had a part in the contribution system that created this hopefully that will deepen something in me
6472529 let me go to maybe the last part as we wind down this is what you asked me outside in our sacred context i brought you out here i dont want to bring you out here on a pretext i told you ill talk in the first person
6472530 its not even imaginable how painful this was literally people leave you to die and they think you left them in connection with why are you going silent
6472531 youve got a group of people saying theyre breaking the silence when im the only person being silent
6472532 if i wasnt able to recover all this information not only my harddrive and not only my email and my instant messages but an enormous amount of other information which im not going into here which proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that catalyst magazine article which was a very serious investigative article that looked very carefully at all this first person information as written if i had not been able to collect that i would be completely and totally vulnerable
6472533 now in the beginning i wrote this letter as you correctly ask why did you write that letter i took all the sickness that happened upon myself
6472534 i wrote the letter as i said on my website for four reasons a out of complete shock and trauma id like to tell you i saw this coming i didnt see a thing coming i was completely i knew there was stuff out there as you said earlier that was your image there was blood in the water
6472535 i had no sense that this level of what i experienced as betrayal could happen
6472536 im not accusing anyone of betrayal but i experienced a massive betrayal i had no idea it could happen none
6472537 first off i was so traumatized i literally couldnt breathe
6472538 at a certain point i came to salt lake and i called up a friend here in salt lake and i said i literally dont want to live out the day
6472539 my whole life has been about service this is not service
6472540 i was just crying uncontrollably i just shut my eyes and prayed to god i shouldnt wake up i called my friend and said hey im done she said let me get it straight are you committing suicide or are you just dying i said im just dying
6472541 three or four times i literally thought my life was leaving my body i was teetering on the edge there for whatever reason almost unfortunately i woke up
6472542 i could tell this as a gafni early childhood story
6472543 every time i would talk to someone i wont mention any names but serious people and they would say this is what happened this is why it happened and if you dont take my advice youre gone
6472544 an hour later id talk to someone else and theyd tell me the exact opposite this is what happened and if you dont take my advice youre gone
6472545 little by little im trying to describe to you the experience because thats what you asked me my actual experience of life began to change in other words luke ford became not important hes saying that whatever
6472546 i began to live i want to be really careful here because i dont want to claim it as spiritual greatness it didnt come from greatness it didnt come from practice it came from either die or this two choices i began to live completely here and now
6472547 i remember there was a waiter that smiled at me not even a waitress like this morning and i remember he smiled at me and ohmigod i was just basking someone just smiled at me
6472548 you just hugged a tree outside if i can reveal that luke ford was outside hugging a tree
6472549 and thats how i began to live and to move into a different space i want to be really clear i dont want to over claim something its not that i didnt go back to fear i did but i would go back into that space
6472550 what gradually began to happen is that i would live more and more in that space and less and less in fear it was a gift it was a gift i would never have gotten
6472551 i love to teach i love to chant i love to meditate i love to live in divine space you can tell that about me you dont need me to tell you i love soul prints youre a shmuck that you dont like it
6472552 would i therefore not reverse it all of course i would reverse it all of course i would nobody would invite that level of pain right ohmigod
6472553 that gives you the sense of the story i want to wrap up by answering a question you asked earlier
6472554 what caused this in my understanding four different things caused this the fifth is the most powerful which is mystery meaning its beyond me theres a mystery here and theres a human arrogance when you work it all out
6472555 my four are just in the realm of small understanding then theres big mystery
6472556 part of what caused it is my own lack of wholeness
6472557 clearly my own lack of wholeness is a piece of the story
6472558 to see this 25 year old gafni hunt that created a fertile ground for this it created a prism through which everything can be viewed through that prism
6472559 unless were talking about violent sexuality or prepubescent molestation almost everything in between particularly adult sexuality is viewed through a prism if the prisms loving its good if people lay a negative prism you can make anything bad
6472560 there was a prism that was developed over 25 years that a couple of these people from 25 years ago participated in and this fed into the prism
6472561 so a my own lack of wholeness b malice c this prism
6472562 those are all different ways to go of course what is going to happen is that everyone will pick one prism and say this is it this is gafni lets demonize him but those are all incomplete completion integrates all of them together
6472563 my way forward is not going to be the way of attack
6472564 i couldnt let the women didnt make those false accusations
6472565 at the same time i made a decision to take the high road im not going to publish peoples private correspondence im not going to attack people im going to own whatever im able to own in terms of my own responsibility and move on in a way thats healing
6472566 i cant contact any of the people in the story
6472567 i know it is very hard for people to climb down the tree
6472568 my primary future direction is in writing and movies i have a huge interest in social activism there are two organizations around that are very involved in combating genocide and human trafficking sexual slavery two issues that have preoccupied me my entire life
6472569 im committed to being a lover im committed to loving people im committed to not let my heart close because of this im committed to not becoming bitter im committed to keep an open heart
6472570 if i can leave you with one phrase im sure youre going to hate it luke
6472571 but as luke says that he hates it let me make this clear to everyone listening hes sitting there hes been feeling the fragrance of a flower for the past hour he does hug trees that part of you might love this
6472572 when something happens to us in love we can make it an insult and have to insult the person back it can become a ritual of rejection
6472573 the other way to experience rejection is as a wound of love not as an insult of love can we practice the wounds of love
6472574 with that i want to thank you for coming its a beautiful day lchaim

6472626 there is an obvious israeli involvement in the present conflict between georgia and russia
6472627 melman wrote that georgia became a real el dorado for israeli arms dealers and numerous representatives of the army and intelligence services some former generals like israel ziv and gal hersh with his company defensive shield are very active there
6472628 hersh and ziv are mainly training and consulting georgian army units they are using the chain method common among israeli arms dealers a main contractor wins a tender and employs sub contractors in this case israeli officers and former shin bet employees
6472629 to every israeli agent representing an israeli defense company is attached a cousin of the defense minister who opens the doors for him

6472641 yes weve got to find solutions we absolutely should crack down on piracy people put a lot of blood sweat and tears into their content and deserve to be paid for it its absolutely wrong it is stealing
6472642 but at the same time i think there are better solutions than chasing people for money im not sure what they are other than to build game experiences that make it more difficult for there to be any value in pirating games

6472685 while negotiations are ongoing with time warner it appears very unlikely that an agreement will be reached before the first game of the year and anything beyond that is problematic
6472686 it appears the university is not being fully briefed on the status of the negotiations
6472687 weve had positive discussions with fox in recent days including the active exchange of proposals
6472688 theres no stalemate or breakdown in discussions as smiths letter would have our customers believe on the contrary talks are moving in the right direction
6472689 we will definitely spread it out between all of our backs me brent and stephfon
6472690 i think well have a steady rotation maybe two series per back and then if one back steps up and is playing a little better than the others then let him get more reps than anybody else
6472691 if its too close to call we send it to the supreme court like they did in 2000 and let them vote
6472692 i think ive made it clear that i would prefer to play one quarterback
6472693 but the way the game is played today where the quarterback is really physically so much more involved in it i think youve got to be careful that youre ready with two
6472694 you ideally want to have a no 1 guy because you want leadership
6472695 you want to know who goes into the game at the end games on the line two minutes to go weve got to drive to win the game theres got to be a guy who knows thats his role

6472701 senator stevens attorneys are now seeking approval from the senate ethics committee to establish such a fund
6472702 consistent with senate rules no contributions will be solicited or accepted until the fund has been authorized by the ethics committee
6472703 i think obviously im going to have legal bills and ive told you ive paid some of them myself right now out of my money and catherines stevens wife money
6472704 but beyond that all of those are reported according to senate rules and i will comply with those rules

6472740 you dont negotiate if youve already made the decision not to carry it
6472741 time warners decision not to carry the network is a huge disappointment
6472742 that nearly all michigan fans have the network but buckeye fans do not
6472743 it appears the university is not being fully briefed on the status of the negotiations

6472745 we have done a lot of work for the rich and famous this year we seem to be one of the go to bands to bop to whilst shaking your diamond earrings

6472753 prescription sleeping pills can be important in certain situations but they can cause a lot of adverse effects and are not a long term solution for older people sleep medication can increase the risk of falling as well as interfering with other medicines
6472754 sleeping pills are not the best way to solve underlying problems like depression or painful conditions that are interfering with a good nights sleep
6472755 most people know that coffee cola or black tea can interfere with their sleep
6472756 but many do not realise that alcohol is one of the major causes of a bad nights sleep
6472757 there is now incontrovertible evidence that marketing of tobacco and the depiction of smoking in the movies promote youth smoking and can cause young people to begin smoking
6472758 the role of the media in promoting and reducing tobacco use
6472759 the role of marketing in the success of the tobacco companies is conclusive
6472760 the reports recommendations offer the best approach to employ marketing techniques and the media to help prevent a further increase in youth smoking
6472761 this direct link between marketing and tobacco use is very powerful
6472762 anti tobacco ads before films and a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising are two effective strategies found to curb effects of tobacco images on youth now we need to use marketing to steer youth and others away from tobacco
6472763 at the bottom of the sea we find mountains which are about the same height as the alps

6472769 buffalo has a reputation for being a very strong hockey town and that should work in our favor
6472770 it certainly helps that we are so close to canada
6472771 i think we give usa hockey the best opportunity to maximize its profits
6472772 what helps us with these types of bids is that buffalo has strong track record of hosting all levels of amateur sporting events

6472775 i learned to drink in the homes of professors and after church services they showed me that drinking was part of a larger social fabric we cannot provide that social fabric because serving alcohol is against the law
6472776 while many americans are living paycheck to paycheck to effectively protect ourselves for the future we need to start saving paycheck to paycheck
6472777 our study shows that americans are better at saving money when they are thinking about it month to month on an ongoing basis rather than a long term goal
6472778 we plan on pay raises work bonuses and other monies to come forward but we cannot be thinking this way we need to start saving money every day
6472779 planning too far in advance not only makes consumers over optimistic regarding how much they will save but it also makes them behave in more aggressive and risk seeking ways in other financial arenas
6472780 the easiest thing to do is to be a smarter consumer and make spending and saving decisions thoughtfully on a daily basis that extra cup of coffee every morning carpooling with a co worker and cutting out the extras
6472781 the harder and more prudent thing to do is to mindfully take a portion of your earnings each pay period and save it in the bank
6472782 americans cant solely depend on their retirement plan it will be painful but like that mortgage or car loan payment we need to start thinking about a savings transfer every pay period
6472783 while nancy pelosi is off on her cross country tour trying to get her book moved off the new york times worst seller list voters are wondering why she and her fellow democrats cant be bothered to address the issue of out of control fuel costs

6472790 when are you going to try it you would never know unless you do
6472791 when a man receives hormone therapy initially the treatment works well and his psa prostate specific antigen level goes down
6472792 but inevitably the psa will start climbing again and that is usually the first sign that the treatment is beginning to fail its a sign that the cancer in the prostate is making a comeback
6472793 the androgen receptor acts differently in different cells in prostate tissue
6472794 its always been assumed that blocking the androgen receptor will stop all prostate cells from growing but we have found that thats not the case since current treatment acts non specifically on all the cells having androgen receptors in the prostate blocking the androgen receptor will give mixed results
6472795 while the androgen receptor is really driving prostate cancer in another sense it appears that the receptor also normally inhibits the spread of cancer cells it seems to have a dual role manipulating the androgen receptor can increase or decrease either of these actions depending on precisely how its done
6472796 the effects of the androgen receptor on hair growth in men vary dramatically depending on where in the body the receptor is working
6472797 when the receptor is very active in the mustache area more hair grows when its very active on the top of the skull toward the front hair falls out and men become bald and the hair on the back of the head is insensitive to the receptor the effects of hormones depend on the location
6472798 we found that the same is true within the cells of the prostate itself
6472799 only safe animal dietary supplements are allowed on the market
6472800 parents and caregivers need to remember that children are not small adults and often need help crossing the street especially if they are 10 years old or younger
6472801 all parents should set the example by accepting virginias highway safety challenge and always buckle up obey speed limits avoid distractions share the road and drive drug and alcohol free
6472802 if a new president and congress consider changes to the drug benefit it will be important to keep in mind that the coverage gap has consequences for some patients with serious health conditions
6472803 we urge beneficiaries to choose wisely when selecting their drug coverage
6472804 again we emphasize that any changes to the coverage gap would need to come from congress

6472823 time warner cable will not allow it it is just an absolute atrocity the amount of money theyre making off these cheap boxes i cant wait to find out how little they pay for them
6472824 three times weve missed big olympics swimming relays because weve rewound on dvr the events and then tried to watch them three times weve had the dvr re boot the mystro software and have been unable to watch or recover the broadcasts when i called to talk to time warner about the problem the customer service number was busy i e mailed them five days ago and havent heard a word what are consumers supposed to do if they cant reach the company i am e mailing you out of complete frustration
6472825 does anyone in kc care about the impression the city makes to returning residents im thrilled with the improvements to the metro system in the last twelve years and brush creek looks so clean that i might launch my kayak there next month but twc service dost seem to stink too much
6472826 i just stumbled across your blog entry regarding time warner cables switch to sdv on certain channels from early july sadly im just now learning about the issue after trying to setup cablecard service in my tivo hd
6472827 i recently concluded a nightmare experience with time warner cable of nyc i wanted to avoid the digital switchover next february as well as own my own equipment instead of paying time warner nyc 11 per month for another cable box that would not even be used on a daily basis
6472828 i purchased an explorer 3250 cable box from ebay this is the equipment i currently rent from time warner so i bought what i already have
6472829 upon further online reseach i needed an explorer 4250 hdc high def cablecard box
6472830 the serviceman said not to get a tv with cablecard technology because it was being phased out now im in limbo i havent looked into purchasing anything because i never get a consistent answer from time warner about what will or wont be serviced i have no idea if i should take a servicemans word over that of their web site its a big clusterf k and unfortunately its us the cable consumers who continue to get f ked
6472831 just recently i heard a ballpark figure of 400 for a hd dvr box clearly if someone has a digital box without the dvr thats probably cheaper but not 30 or 40
6472832 if you dont want a set top box you can get a unidirectional device and drop the box
6472833 he complained well its not as good well thats right weve been clear for five years that this is not the same
6472834 if you switched to directv or dish you have to have a new box if you switch to verizon fios or at amp ts u verse you have to have a new box it baffles me to no end why there are four companies competing with cable and nobody has ever complained that you have to have a set top box for them
6472835 you dont have to repair them every time you roll out new services you could just flip a switch to deliver them its just getting from where we are today to our digital future
6472836 different companies are dealing with it differently those fees for set top boxes are all regulated the idea that companies are making money of them not a chance
6472837 i was only permitted to write two majority opinions while i was there
6472838 i worked as a clerk at iowa illinois gas amp electric in iowa city as a kid
6472839 they didnt have a monopoly on equipment as long as you could plug it into the wall you were ok and i always though thats the way things should be
6472840 but at amp t took the position that anything that connected to the network that they didnt own was in their jingoistic term a
6472841 well i thought this was all bullshit i thought if you could plug something in the wall and it didnt blow out anything
6472842 the customer ought to have the option to either rent the box by the month forever or buy it outright for instance i have a little device that connects you to the internet by wi fi you pay once thats it i always say people should be allowed to rent and the companies should hire wheelbarrows to take the money to the bank every month

6472850 very rarely did you find triticum without wheat streak mosaic
6472851 i really need to survey everywhere i can this year
6472852 in calculating the counties with wheat acreage infected in the northern panhandle early diagnosis could save as much as 9 million for producers by eliminating wasted irrigations
6472853 we werent testing for triticum at that time so it is also a factor to be investigated
6472854 we have the potential to save producers billions of dollars in wasted irrigation and fertilizer costs

6472868 we dont believe at this time that any of the machines were owned by any of the local businesses
6472869 we do believe that they were placed there through outside sources that own the machines we think the profits were split between owner and business
6472870 we have information of rather large payouts and we have information of people losing rather large amounts of money on these machines
6472871 i think the cycle has gone around to where its now back in our area
6472872 weve tried to educate the public and business owners that these machines are deemed illegal we expected business owners to understand that and to get rid of them but some chose not to do so
6472873 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6472874 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues

6472894 with house building hitting rock bottom this governments centralised housing targets are beginning to look like nothing more than a pipe dream
6472895 but unreachable targets will not help the thousands of families in unsuitable housing

6472902 we are appalled to learn that the secretary of state has overturned the advice of english heritage

6472905 i was disappointed to lose my place last season and i knew that i would have to work very hard to get back in
6472906 all you concentrate on is playing as well as you can i had no expectations of ever leaving arsenal but when middlesbroughs offer came in i sat down with arsene wenger and we had a chat about the situation
6472907 i decided to come to middlesbrough and have a look at the set up and as soon as i came here i knew that the move was right for me
6472908 i met gareth southgate and was absolutely delighted to hear what he had to say
6472909 his ambitions to take the club forward are impressive and i think he is going to be a very successful manager so it is great to come here
6472910 i sat in the stands and watched the spurs game and i was really impressed
6472911 i know that david wheater is a centre back in fact he is very good centre back but he has shown that he has the qualities to play right back as well
6472912 i thought he did very well there it means that i can take nothing for granted but then i wouldnt expect it any other way
6472913 the reality is that in terms of the last number of years it is irrelevant
6472914 next sunday is a different game theyre may be different players involved to some extent what has gone before has no relevance what has happened in the past is history the way i see it is that im looking forward now i believe were going to be ready and focused for sunday
6472915 for the kildare match we wouldnt be the first team to get caught in that situation we were very dominant at the start and looked composed
6472916 we got a bit ragged and started taking wrong options that happens and its disappointing it was a difficult game for us to motivate ourselves for we were very much aware that we were on a hiding there
6472917 were not the finished article and were well aware of that but the reality is that no team puts it together for 70 minutes what we would accept is that we need to put it together for a longer period i do think weve a lot of positives
6472918 weve a lot of fighting spirit in the team and thats been proved to date in the championship thats a serious quality to have its nice to have that in your pocket heading into an all ireland semi final
6472919 we are keeping an eye on things and will have a look on saturday morning
6472920 it has been predominantly dry today and things are improving but very very gradually
6472921 with it being a bank holiday obviously we are very keen to race if we can but we need it to stay dry for the most part
6472922 we have got some contingency plans in place should the round course not improve much over the next couple of days
6472923 in that case we would abandon the two round course races and divide another race so we end up with six races on the straight course
6472924 we are due five to seven millimetres of rain overnight so we are going to have another look in the morning
6472925 the forecast is for a dry day on friday so hopefully we will have a good idea at 7am
6472926 what am i supposed to do with these at this rate well have 2 000 a year to process we wont have time to do any other work

6472932 i thoroughly enjoyed my time here last season its a great club and im just glad to be part of it again and i look forward to playing for the club for the next four years
6472933 i firmly believe we have a really good group of players now and hopefully we will have a good season ahead
6472934 obviously its a blow that we dont have european football i was keeping an eye on the fixtures and it was disappointing when the lads went out
6472935 so it makes the league all the more important and hopefully we can concentrate on that and do well
6472936 ah pas algo m s que el simple problema t cnico
6472937 all our planning for the next 12 months will come from the camp

6472939 we have three massive test series in the next year
6472940 i was disappointed to lose my place last season and i knew that i would have to work very hard to get back in

6472968 in the past first time home buyers were willing to purchase older more basic houses in an effort to save money and break into homeownership

6473016 he doesnt need much to score a goal and you almost know before he shoots he will score
6473017 we work very hard as a team and you know we will progress every game and be better
6473018 we have a lot of quality in the team like robbie keane steven gerrard and of course torres so we know if we work hard well get our chances and we have the ability to score in every game
6473019 i think we dont have to look to much to be teams like manchester united or chelsea or arsenal we just have to look at ourselves
6473020 if we can just win our own games the gap will be closer
6473021 the team is getting better and better and the most important thing is to look at ourselves

6473126 the accusation is dangerous defamatory and blatantly untrue victoria takes her position as a role model to young women very seriously and is horrified by this hurtful fabricated story it is now with her lawyers
6473127 victoria has told the girls her secret to staying trim is 200 sit ups a day and a diet of soya edamame beans strawberries and lettuce

6473143 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have
6473144 if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6473145 but if youre like me and you got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home then you might have a different perspective
6473146 and by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes
6473147 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6473148 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans

6473184 were not the finished article and were well aware of that but the reality is that no team puts it together for 70 minutes what we would accept is that we need to put it together for a longer period i do think weve a lot of positives

6473204 there has been an increase of children suffering from malaria and many are complaining of diarrhoea as well
6473205 these people are used to roti unleavened bread but we are providing them with rice and lentils and they cannot adapt to this change of diet
6473206 the flour is there but there is no facility to bake the bread in earthenware ovens called tandoor for so many people

6473232 i think the tibet issue is particularly special due a lack of facts and a deliberate suppression of the truth peoples understanding and powers of deduction have been impeded i often ask why cant we have a society with no supervision or control of the media what are we trying to hide what kind of facts can be so dangerous
6473233 inevitably runs counter to the olympic spirit the superficial prosperity cannot conceal the void within the need to reform bad governance is a fact that has been placed before every chinese person if the communist leaders continue to be arrogant and imperious on the question of tibet and coerce and trample upon the tibetan people and deceive and mislead the chinese masses and if they continue to deny your irreplaceable value towards peace in the world and your unrivalled spiritual contributions and adhere to the inhuman logic of power grows from the barrel of a gun then their days will come to a sudden end one not too distant dawn there is no doubt you will return to your land when you are reunited with the suffering tibetan people please extend the warm light of your benevolence to care upon the heavy sins of chinas vast land

6473250 aquino was being escorted to an avsecom van when the gunman dressed in the blue uniform of an airport maintenance man slipped through the security cordon and shot him from behind with a cal 357 smith and wesson magnum revolver
6473251 we asked him to defer his trip because of this reported assassination attempt
6473252 we did not give him travel papers precisely to discourage him at this time
6473253 he was so concerned with his children more than anything else
6473254 genuine national reconciliation founded on justice which aquino had advocated
6473255 for the best interests of all concerned this attitude of objectivity will better inform the people and tone down any partisan passion
6473256 came from all over the philippines to claim him as their own these solemn grieving dejected filipinos at the aquino residence where the body of the martyred former senator lies in state
6473257 because of speculations in media and other sectors of the country about aquinos killer
6473258 unity yes the stricken sea of humanity which paid homage to aquino was obviously capable of demonstrating but yesterday it was a sense of unity that could no longer be suppressed but rather had to be poured out defiantly albeit peacefully
6473259 i know as surely as i believe in fate that history turned a page that day in a way that inexorably altered the lives of 42 million filipinos the day is huge and vast and awesome in a very real sense and i try to etch it in mind the vast throng jammed in some areas 50 abreast along a 10 kilometer stretch at the heart of manila the sober faces the unspoken grief

6473263 we didnt want to put a flag on it that would have been be too easy
6473264 the average person is so much more interested in politics right now and we wanted to put a lot of hard work into it
6473265 i think there was one stretch where i didnt move from my computer for eight hours
6473266 we are really excited and honored to be part of the process the committee was really good to work with and the whole experience has been positive
6473267 we are keeping an eye on things and will have a look on saturday morning
6473268 it has been predominantly dry today and things are improving but very very gradually
6473269 with it being a bank holiday obviously we are very keen to race if we can but we need it to stay dry for the most part
6473270 we have got some contingency plans in place should the round course not improve much over the next couple of days
6473271 in that case we would abandon the two round course races and divide another race so we end up with six races on the straight course
6473272 we are due five to seven millimetres of rain overnight so we are going to have another look in the morning
6473273 the forecast is for a dry day on friday so hopefully we will have a good idea at 7am
6473274 it always makes me laugh when people say is she isnt she its like eventually you will know so just chill out for a minute

6473278 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have and he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and he said at least four at least four
6473279 or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes

6473283 the committee to review nasas exploration technology development program is broadly supportive of the intent and goals of the vse and finds the etdp is making progress towards the stated goals of technology development but is operating within significant constraints which limit its ability to successfully accomplish those goals the still dynamic nature of the constellation program requirements the constraints imposed by a limited budget the aggressive time scale of early technology deliverables and the desire to fully employ the nasa workforce
6473284 the agency lacks the budget the statutory authority and the scientific expertise to ensure the hundreds of nanoproducts now on the market among them baby bottle nipples infant teething rings paints waxes kitchenware and appliances are safe this problem will only worsen as more sophisticated nanotechnology based products begin to enter the consumer market
6473285 during the fall of 2007 many americans faced a hazard in their products that had been banned for 30 years lead as millions of childrens toys coated with lead paint were recalled it became clear that government oversight had failed and that the cpsc the agency primarily responsible for the oversight of these toys was stretched too thin from years of neglect underfunding and the challenges posed by an increasingly global manufacturing system
6473286 it is against this background that we need to ask the question is the cpsc adequately prepared to deal with nanotechnology which is now associated with more than 800 manufacturer identified consumer products ranging from infant pacifiers to paints to appliances to clothing
6473287 it took decades of research before lawmakers found the political will to keep lead and phthalates out of toys it could take a very long time to research and ensure that potentially dangerous nanomaterials are kept out too

6473295 i was disappointed to lose my place last season and i knew that i would have to work very hard to get back in
6473296 all you concentrate on is playing as well as you can i had no expectations of ever leaving arsenal but when middlesbroughs offer came in i sat down with arsene wenger and we had a chat about the situation
6473297 i decided to come to middlesbrough and have a look at the set up and as soon as i came here i knew that the move was right for me
6473298 i met gareth southgate and was absolutely delighted to hear what he had to say
6473299 his ambitions to take the club forward are impressive and i think he is going to be a very successful manager so it is great to come here
6473300 i sat in the stands and watched the spurs game and i was really impressed
6473301 i know that david wheater is a centre back in fact he is very good centre back but he has shown that he has the qualities to play right back as well
6473302 i thought he did very well there it means that i can take nothing for granted but then i wouldnt expect it any other way

6473531 apparently he has received threats to reveal his wifes private details including her place of work and contact numbers their home addresses and private information regarding their parents
6473532 and it seems they arent going to stop there in addition there are threats to reveal mr millers financial dealings at past employers and to have his directorships put under scrutiny the threats were made by the previously unknown davenport cats action group
6473533 i demand that the oc fair board of directors correct and cure the bagley keene act violation

6473535 indeed the very hairs of your head are all numbered
6473536 its been gradual it hasnt been all of a sudden
6473537 i dont think hes trying to hide anything hes proud of the few gray hairs he does have
6473538 when i was coming up we were told it was a sign of wisdom
6473539 it has nothing to with anything except your genetic milieu everybody is programmed to get it at some point in life
6473540 for all the talk about changing the electoral map the core of it is still the same right here
6473541 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6473542 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6473543 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama
6473544 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county
6473545 obama strikes me as a good family man he seems like hed be a decent guy but my values are more along the lines of what john mccain stands for and believes in
6473546 theres no way in hell im voting for the old establishment
6473547 its not necessary that each and everyone knows about financial crime division and probably one of them is you
6473548 everything they said literally just stressed me out to the max
6473549 the truth is that lorillard markets its newport brand cigarettes to adult smokers of all ethnicities
6473550 the truth is that our marketing is not disproportionately directed to african americans the truth is that we do not target underage smokers the truth is that there are twice as many caucasian menthol cigarette smokers as there are african american menthol cigarette smokers i challenge those who want to prove otherwise to come forward with evidence to support their charges
6473551 the climate has never knowingly ingested any illegal substances to enhance performance
6473552 this is the same old witch hunt led by a group of maverick scientists jealous of the size of american cars and homes
6473553 barry bonds marion jones the ozone layer the strategy never changes deny deny deny
6473554 the atmosphere has even been using a mysterious substance that our scientists have labeled black carbon
6473555 you simply cannot generate this pattern of warming from natural causes alone
6473556 the latest positive test signals that it is time to end the fruitless debate about the science we must move on to solutions to the doping problem

6473559 computer programs for disabling the history and file caching features of a web browser and computer software for notifying a user of a web browser when others are tracking web use and for controlling the information others can access about such use
6473560 users may wish to begin a private browsing session to research a medical condition or plan a surprise vacation or birthday party for a loved one
6473561 the larger challenge here is notifying users clearly about what sites theyre disclosing information to and enabling them to control that disclosure if they choose
6473562 the user is in control of what information the browser makes available to web sites
6473563 the family of emerson joseph santos eli would like to express our sincere appreciation to the people of topsail beach surf city and the staff of new hanover medical center icu after the tragic accident that occurred the afternoon of aug
6473564 eli was found and pulled from the water by a family member in the backyard of a family home in topsail beach approximately 10 minutes after the family noticed he was missing and began a search in the home and outside
6473565 eli passed away on august 13 and on that day saved seven to 12 lives through the successful transplants of his seven donated organs
6473566 eli taught our family many things including patience courage determination and acceptance of others words cannot express our sorrow his passing has left a void in our hearts and lives
6473567 again we would like to thank all of those who have shown us such kindness during this time
6473568 i am so delighted to be able to relate some positive news about new hanover teenagers recently i stupidly ran out of gas on north college road it was nighttime and i was not able to completely get off the pavement
6473569 as i was turning on the emergency blinkers a teen age boy on a bike stopped at my car he offered his help but since i had left my cell phone at home he continued on or so i thought
6473570 i then walked to nearby burger king to make a phone call
6473571 how nice it is to know firsthand that there are still some thoughtful young people around

6473578 targeting 9 growth getting up to 10 it may look ambitious with the global economic slowdown but in the medium term it is achievable
6473579 i think as labour costs rise in china and theres a price to pay for pollution that we will see manufacturing coming to india
6473580 theres been for some time a sense that agriculture can no longer absorb any more people
6473581 india has become a net exporter of fdi foreign direct investment thats because it is too difficult to start up labour intensive manufacturing of the kind you find in china sixty percent of indians depend on agriculture and i dont see that changing
6473582 the hardware estimate seems optimistic the auto industry seems in the right area
6473583 the important question here is what kind of jobs are created in the past it has been low security and low paid jobs in what is called the informal sector that needs to change

6473588 we are deeply saddened and shocked by the sudden and unexpected death of our leader gene upshaw
6473589 our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife terri and their three sons eugene justin and daniel gene learned he was sick just this past sunday and he died with his family at his side
6473590 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6473591 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6473592 he would hold a match in one hand and a hose in the other he could flip back and forth with effectiveness
6473593 his passion for his players was real his passion to lead was real
6473594 counting the afl championship in 1967 and victories in super bowls xi and xv upshaw became the only player ever to start on championship teams in both the afl and nfl

6473646 to halt international military cooperation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions
6473647 leading alliance members came to us and whispered in our ears hoping that we do not halt cooperation with nato on afghanistan
6473648 everything depends on nato if their priorities go to the unconditional support of the bankrupt saakashvili regime to the detriment of partnership with nato its not our fault
6473649 conducting a pre planned routine visit to the black sea region to interact and exercise with our nato partners romania and bulgaria which is an important feature of our routine planning
6473650 these cases resulted primarily from failure to vaccinate many because of philosophical or religious belief
6473651 this is the lowest percentage of imported measles cases since 1996
6473652 in the decade before the measles vaccination program began an estimated 3 to 4 million persons in the united states were infected each year of these 400 to 500 died 48 000 were hospitalized and another 1 000 developed chronic disability from measles
6473653 of the 95 patients eligible for vaccination 63 were unvaccinated because of their or their parents philosophical or religious beliefs
6473654 increases in the proportion of the population declining vaccination for themselves or their children might lead to large scale outbreaks in the united states
6473655 measles knows no borders but can be prevented for less than one dollar per child in a developing country we must be steadfast in our efforts to reduce measles cases globally

6473661 a 6 million government advertising campaign launched by the department for children schools and families dcsf the campaign aims to encourage young people to study foreign languages to open up future opportunities in their peoples professional and personal lives
6473662 the commercials were directed by th1ngs new breed of directors who have shown promising talent and very impressive capability the whole series has been very well received and the feedback is very encouraging
6473663 i went back and really submersed myself in the artists of the silver age
6473664 most of the artists from that era are my favorites so it was great theres a lot to learn from jack kirby alex toth steve ditko carmine infantino don heck wayne boring curt swan etc etc
6473665 but in order to really put yourself in a retro mood you must smoke a pipe and wear a robe when drawing
6473666 doing retro comics is all about solid anatomy and most importantly clear concise storytelling
6473667 youve got to learn the rules before you can break them it can be difficult because you cant hide behind your style or mistakes but as long as youre consistent it will work
6473668 though i always have to have correct positioning and expression lines it is easier than contemporary art over the time i have dedicated to comics i did my utmost to acquire a good level of anatomy and perspectives
6473669 in the last 10 years i have been working in illustration advertising and graphic humor however i feel like a comic book artist deep down and i always wanted to return to it i showed my work to editor mark paniccia and he proposed that i take up my classical comic line again and to adapt it to the retro way and im really happy because i could do it
6473670 but to get extra retro i just bust out my gigantic collection of essential marvels and read them under a blanket with a flashlight
6473671 my natural style when i draw super heroes is already kind of silver age to me it isnt a matter of consciously trying to be retro but rather trying to keep to the sprit of fun and excitement that those 60s era marvel comics had and those comics had a cosmic ray injected amount of fun
6473672 wachovia noted that some portion of the population which is attracted to the option arm product seemed to know something that the underwriters didnt so it seems that borrowers who choose a mortgage with the option of lower minimum payments may in fact be indicating to the lender that there is more likelihood that they will not have the resources to cover the fully amortizing payment
6473673 the deal is not done i dont want to eulogise about a player who has not signed in case it doesnt happen but it is no secret we admire the player and wed like to tie something up weve watched him for a while and he has got the technical ability to help our squad
6473674 i dont understand how confidentiality of the donor would be an issue
6473675 ill be very frank vietnam divided families divided people it was a terrible time of our country people didnt know one another since then ill be very frank ayers has been in the forefront of a lot of education issues and helping us in public schools and things like that
6473676 its really unfortunate theyre friends so what people do make mistakes in the past you move on this is a new century a new time he reflects back and hes been making a strong contribution to our community
6473677 will step forward and call on the university to immediately release all the records
6473678 it leads me to have tremendous fear for the documents
6473679 what if they are going through them right now and deciding which names to take out im completely alarmed i think public scrutiny is the only way to save the documents
6473680 theyll manage to take this all the way past the election
6473681 this is definitely a heartbreaking way to end my international career
6473682 and theyre taking this sport out as long as two teams come out here wearing a uniform anybody can win its anybodys game this is a great sport
6473683 i know there were a lot of ioc members here this week i know back softball is working their butts off to get the word out and make the rounds there are a lot of women here not just usa players that want to see this sport back in the games i mean this team japan played their tails off and they want to be here in 2016 just as much as we do
6473684 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6473685 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6473686 they didnt go into teaching just to make money they dont have seven houses
6473687 greg this response can mean only one thing obama has drawn blood and the mccain camp is worried
6473688 obama is foreign oversexed and non anglo saxon he cannot be trusted
6473689 so senator mccain if you say your tax proposals will help the poor does that mean you intend to help unhappy billionaires and when you say that the rich already pay a disproportionate share of all income tax revenue did you mean that people with homes and families did that
6473690 i never met britney spears i cant have animosity with someone i dont know you have way bigger fish to fry little mama than me about a couple songs
6473691 i tried to call her call her people they didnt want to return a phone call so i said all right well i guess i will take these songs that were written for britney and give them to other people time is money

6473800 persons who suffer from this unexplained skin condition report a range of cutaneous skin symptoms including crawling biting and stinging sensations granules threads fibers or black speck like materials on or beneath the skin and or skin lesions e g rashes or sores in addition to skin manifestations some sufferers also report fatigue mental confusion short term memory loss joint pain and changes in visions
6473801 to learn more about who may be affected with this condition the symptoms they experience and to look for clues about factors that might contribute to the condition
6473802 we are aware that many patients have suffered from this condition and i can tell you that here at cdc we have really been seeing an increasing number of these reports over the past year or so
6473803 all morgellons patients screened to date have tested positive for the presence of agrobacterium whereas this microorganism has not been detected in any of the samples derived from the control healthy individuals
6473804 agrobacterium may be involved in the etiology and or progression
6473805 theres almost always some history of exposure to dirt basically either from gardening or camping or something
6473806 release of these plants may also result in release of the agrobacterium with the foreign genes
6473807 very few authors actually test to ensure that the antibiotics succeed
6473808 here is where the possibility of gene escape arises the presence of the disarmed agrobacterium in the tissue would not be a problem if the binary vector had been lost but now its survival and spread are real possibilities
6473809 the opportunistic and systemically moving agrobacterium vector infectious to a wide host range might eventually cause infection and damage to crop plants or natural vegetation
6473810 not presently visited by the traditional vectors of the virus disease
6473811 future research has to show whether agrobacterium mediated transformation contributed to horizontal gene transfer between microorganisms in the rhizosphere
6473812 have a ready route for horizontal gene escape via agrobacterium helped by the ordinary conjugative mechanisms of many other bacteria that cause diseases which are present in the environment

6473835 i suspect that doctors feel that they would be under that obligation that they would already be making these determinations and that essentially adding an additional doctor who then has to be called in an emergency situation to come in and make these assessments is really designed simply to burden the original decision of the woman and the physician to induce labor and perform an abortion

6473974 i told him last night you know joe i cant stand john mccain
6473975 i think there are other people in the running and i think we could be surprised
6473976 but as soon as i have any free time thats vm my top priority
6473977 do you choose how you look you look the same here
6473978 yes we choose for some though how you look is not as important as it is for others
6473979 the worst part is having to pack and unpack al the time
6473980 yours is not a real marriage i am superior to you because my wife and i have avoided your misfortune
6473981 why dont you tell your friend you have to check with your wife
6473982 i cant tell my friend i have to ask my wife for permission
6473983 then why are you telling me to have plastic surgery
6473984 is there anything youd like to say to me before i start reading the paper
6473985 it was a two hour floor battle and we passed it by one vote
6473986 on cafos im a total believer in local control you can make an argument that a local county might want a cafo but that is their business the only reason to move it to the state is so that big ag can control the situation
6473987 im going to let the campaign speak for the campaign
6473988 he visited with my staff just to basically say hi to them and thank them for all their hard work
6473989 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have
6473990 true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and he said at least four at least four
6473991 now think about that i guess if you think that being rich means you gotta make five million dollars and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6473992 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6473993 what people are going thru every single day here in america
6473994 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6473995 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6473996 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6473997 maybe youre struggling just to pay the mortgage on your home
6473998 then again that same day when asked how many houses he owns mccain lost track he couldnt remember well its seven seven houses
6473999 and heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6474000 go obama obama 08 now back to counting my houses
6474001 ok now lets compare that to obamas abortion response debacle hmm didnt think so
6474002 ive been around the district quite some time and seen many changes in schools
6474003 we have the steepest decline in enrollment in three years
6474004 there is no set time frame but we are still waiting for the district to make its decision
6474005 having a school was one of the reasons why i moved here and now we are not going to have that
6474006 its devastating but its still our money that will be used to buy a dirt lot please dont buy this land because there is no need
6474007 we have a legal contract to purchase that property and we do have your interest at heart
6474008 i think smaller classes are the best way to ensure improvement
6474009 teachers will be able to be more involved with their students
6474010 i am apologizing to everyone who was embarrassed and humiliated but i do not apologize for the message of internet safety its a very good message
6474011 what happened was absolutely ridiculous im sure there was a way way better way to do this than that
6474012 but my mom said it was okay to see it because its pg 13 and that means there can only be two kisses in it
6474013 two children and uh one adult to see the sisterhood of the traveling pants part two
6474014 you had better enjoy the fuck out of this film
6474015 ha ha check it out theres some fucking loser 23 year old kid in here calling up his mom because he came too early to see the sisterhood of the traveling pants 2 its not event he first movie in the series so theres no way he can have been fooled as to what its really about dude is calling his mom what a fucking moron if i was him i would shoot myself right now
6474016 thats the stupidest thing ive ever heard pants arent magic im happy i dont have to go
6474017 who is laughing now you nutless fuck who is laughing now
6474018 hard pressed to think of a more serious set of offences

6474022 gun battles with the taliban are down fifty per cent this year
6474023 i dont know if its our immediate future its something we talk about every few months
6474024 its something we would never take lightly and just say that would be fun its a lot of work and we recognize that
6474025 in a way we want to be selfish because we love our life but we know how much that adds to it
6474026 if they would be as pretty as brad and angelinas kids we might
6474027 the possibility of a block is high and id say it should be due to a content issue
6474028 weve seen the situation but cant offer any more information
6474029 when he does come back we dont have to rely heavily on him playing every single day
6474030 we feel very confident in the young players we have in left field and also fernando tatis in right i feel very good about what they have done and how well they have played
6474031 i feel pretty good about church coming back in that particular situation it gives us a chance to freshen up tatis that would be a big plus for us in that sense when he does come back we dont have to rely on him playing every single day
6474032 the project was pretty easy with just some measuring and re measuring and some cuts with the utility knife oh and double sided tape thats right we adhered the wallpaper with tape so we skipped the extra work and commitment associated with pasting wallpaper
6474033 oh and also my friend megan that i introduced you to the one who is the white version of you i let her read my blog which she thought was pretty funny but thought the best part about it was how she stumbled onto your blog and is now obsessed just thought i should tell you because she probably wont but she talks about you constantly how she wants to stroke your hair and how she wishes she could live in l a because she knows you guys would be best friends and how even just reading your blog she feels closer to you than anyone shes ever known in her life including her mother who birthed her from her womb really creepy shit but thats what she says
6474034 im asking you to believe not just in my ability to bring about real change in washington im asking you to believe in yours
6474035 we just patched it up topped it off with helium and sent it back up
6474036 thats an upside down flag it may not be intentional but there it is
6474037 i think its one of the reasons its a real shocker its a real shocker we had no indication anything like this may be happening
6474038 not just me all the neighbors would never have thought something like this we all know the children
6474039 i would just like to say that my sister is a great person and worked hard for those wonderful kids this is a very hard time for us and we appreciate all of your thoughts and prayers
6474040 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6474041 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6474042 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist
6474043 why stay in paris lets do something fun while im there
6474044 why not seek some relief in one of the public bathrooms

6474057 anybody running for office has got to be at the ham breakfast at the state fair
6474058 ive been on the agriculture committee in the senate for a long time
6474059 in fact ive won the golden plow award that the american farm bureau gives out every year to the most effective member of the senate and house just two one in the senate and one in the house and ive won it twice
6474060 i think were doing a pretty good job you know were getting the new technology into agriculture we want to make sure agriculture which has been the backbone of our economy for a long long time remains that for a long time in the future
6474061 there have been many freshman senators the last couple of years who have been much more effective than some of the guys that have been there a long time
6474062 i saw a bumper sticker the other day that really resonated with me and its kind of been what ive been preaching since i became commissioner
6474063 it said summed it up in four words i farm you eat
6474064 kentucky needs to have its agriculture products all over this country and i think we will in the near future
6474065 you know the great thing about this year is that im not running for office and i might even get to actually eat some country ham for a change
6474066 how can we improve the system for everyone so that society as a whole benefits
6474067 we on the bche recognize that the promise of economic growth and prosperity in our state and nation depends on increasing the number of highly educated and qualified workers and to do that our systems of higher education must be responsive to market forces
6474068 the need to increase access to higher education for undocumented students
6474069 individuals who live in the united states even though illegally should be allowed to attend college if they pay the full cost of their education
6474070 if we accept as most americans seem to a de facto right of illegal immigrants to live and work in the united states it seems counterproductive to shut academically capable individuals off from education which is presumably good for individuals and for society
6474071 how can it possibly be fair to close the schoolhouse door to a young person who has lived in the united states since he or she was a small child speaks only english and is a model student especially in a state obsessed with the rise of gangs and gang related crime how can it make sense to intentionally add to the number of disaffected and alienated young people who make such ideal recruits for these groups

6474088 cant we just um do this tomorrow maybe when that typhoons gone is there really a rush
6474089 that interception we got last year happened to get us to where we wanted to be the super bowl whether he came back or didnt it didnt make much difference
6474090 we are going to go out there the same way and do what we do on defense keep them from scoring and eliminate the big plays
6474091 i know he has a big gun and tries to make big plays and we are going to try to put pressure on the quarterback and try to eliminate big plays
6474092 i just happened to read the route downfield and was able to undercut it and make them turn the ball over
6474093 i didnt know what he was doing at that time
6474094 im trying to watch the receiver i was able to get my head back around and played the ball in the air secured it and went down and helped us get to the super bowl
6474095 i never changed last year from the beginning of the season
6474096 i am still working hard doing the things that i normally do i go out and try to get better
6474097 n o o passado que vai mudar alguma coisa e sim o presente e o futuro

6474104 over all we waited about 45 mins for the front row but it was totally worth it the first drop is insane with very intense airtime and the ride really packs alot more forces than i expected its also very smooth and provides a nice head chopper right before the bunny hop at first i thought this would be too similar to storm runner but i think its a great addition just a little short
6474105 an overwhelming success that tells us that we need to add more to that whole water experience were looking in the future to a larger wave pool experience taking the canyon river rapids ride and changing that into something that has a little more excitement to it and larger and in the process of doing that we retire rides that have seen their day

6474129 it also means its our turn to be as corrupt and irresponsible to the democratic process as their white predecessors have been
6474130 i took all the beatings and insults and endured all the racist comments over the years from nasty republican committee chairmen
6474131 barack didnt have to endure any of it yet in the end he got all the credit

6474133 we should turn catastrophe into opportunity and meet continuously in brussels

6474149 in the face of record high energy costs and increasing volatility americans expect and deserve comprehensive energy reforms that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and increase our access to clean affordable and dependable energy for our cars homes and businesses
6474150 yet despite the publics calls for change the democratic leadership has chosen a darker path one that unfortunately appeals to special interest groups rather than actual market forces
6474151 indeed over the course of the year the majoritys calls for common sense reforms and a new direction for energy policy have echoed throughout the halls of congress yet nothing was done and no action was taken
6474152 for this reason i join my republican colleagues today to call on speaker pelosi to reconvene the house and vote on a comprehensive energy plan that will promote market policies that bring more energy to the market encourage conservation and develop new resources

6474174 we have a real need for broadband service in some of our rural communities
6474175 and this funding will help provide an important boost for broadband service in roane county im very excited to see reedy receive this funding
6474176 high speed internet access is essential for communities and small businesses across our nation to thrive
6474177 broadband internet access for reedy would increase quality of life and education for children and seniors
6474178 stephanie was a dear friend of mine and a great leader whose untimely passing came as a great shock i will miss her insights her wit and her charm here in the house she served the people of her community and her state with great compassion and vision and her absence will be felt for years to come my thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends as they absorb this terrible loss

6474183 both chainstays on the tcr advanced sl are reinforced with additional composite material to contribute to maximum bb stiffness because the driveside chainstay sees more force from chain force its asymmetrical and larger than the non driveside chainstay
6474184 these cases resulted primarily from failure to vaccinate many because of philosophical or religious belief
6474185 this is the lowest percentage of imported measles cases since 1996
6474186 in the decade before the measles vaccination program began an estimated 3 to 4 million persons in the united states were infected each year of these 400 to 500 died 48 000 were hospitalized and another 1 000 developed chronic disability from measles
6474187 of the 95 patients eligible for vaccination 63 were unvaccinated because of their or their parents philosophical or religious beliefs
6474188 increases in the proportion of the population declining vaccination for themselves or their children might lead to large scale outbreaks in the united states
6474189 measles knows no borders but can be prevented for less than one dollar per child in a developing country we must be steadfast in our efforts to reduce measles cases globally
6474190 the phone will ring and itll be him and ill maybe not answer
6474191 yeah tony and i both laughed at that yeah we got a chuckle out of that
6474192 no i know its not its not true definitely i looked at his call log
6474193 denise says it is declaration of war explosive stuff a national security issue she thinks there is a very real possibility of major danger for the buildings and staff and widespread violence thinks it will be far more controversial than the satanic verses and the danish cartoons thinks the book should be withdrawn asap
6474194 what i got back was a collective shrug of the shoulders
6474195 the thing that is surreal for me is that here you had a non muslim write a book and you had a non muslim complain about it and a non muslim publisher pull the book
6474196 i watched the guys warm up and its hot out there
6474197 i just sat there with my cooling vest on listening to music and just chilled out i think that really paid off
6474198 the majority are using it to block out everything else thats going on around them
6474199 essentially what theyre doing is really not thinking at all theyre just listening to music and being in a space before they actually get ready to narrow their focus
6474200 you have to also plan for contingency if you forgot your music or something happens
6474201 for many athletes that point in time would have been a turning point to really underperform
6474202 kevin drew and broken social scene brendan canning those guys jason collett all the guys from broken social scene thats my favourite band probably
6474203 but to relax myself when im preparing to come to competition i like to listen to some upbeat music
6474204 not before the dives because im the type of guy wholl keep the song in my head and lose focus on what im supposed to think about
6474205 im very electronic techno house music really gets me going
6474206 to start warming up its very helpful it gives me a lot of energy and gets me pumped heading into the warm up and into the meet
6474207 maybe 10 or 15 minutes before i get ready to warm up i dont do a lot of running with an ipod
6474208 i dont let my athletes have headphones and things while theyre warming up i think you have to focus on what youre doing
6474209 you do not isolate your brain from whats important thats just my idea and i know some people think its an old fashioned old man talk
6474210 porque era religioso porque era cristiano y porque era caritativo con los pobres
6474211 ha sido asesinado porque los misioneros cat licos est n de parte de los pobres en esta regi n en donde todav a existe una f rrea forma de servidumbre ligada al cultivo de la tierra a los campesinos no se les reconoce ning n derecho de parte de los latifundistas que se sirven de la bandas de fan ticos hinduistas para acabar con cualquier mejora de las condiciones de vida de la poblaci n rural
6474212 en esta regi n el fanatismo de matriz hinduista usa la religi n solo como un pretexto para realizar estos cr menes entre nosotros los cat licos y los religiosos hind es moderados no hay enfrentamiento cuando el di logo tiene que ver con los valores del esp ritu los enfrentamientos son creados por quienes usan pretextos pseudo religiosos
6474213 los fieles de mi di cesis con frecuencia viven en condici n de terror aqu lo cat licos est n en una minor a verdaderamente heroica y significativa en la parroquia en donde ocurri el asesinato son solo cinco familias las que se declaran cat licas por ello acudir regularmente a los servicios religiosos es ahora un riesgo serio
6474214 los campesinos de las reas rurales deben obedecer solo a los latifundistas que son de fe hind ser cristianos y ser en particular cat licos es una elecci n muy valerosa pero una elecci n que pone en riesgo la vida propia y la de los familiares
6474215 ha sido un acto de odio hacia la iglesia cat lica

6474219 still meetup doesnt offer the ability to post blogs from the group which nextny didnt even want at first then we realized what we really wanted wasnt just a blog but a way to aggregate the blog posts of our members that were already being posted perhaps its better that meetup didnt offer that because offering a full fledged blogging platform when others exists seems like a waste of resources especially to a bunch of geeks who were bent on using wordpress anyway perhaps that would make more sense for a grandmothers meetup group in des moines we thought we wanted several types of aggregation to aggregate events flickr photos twitter messages links etc then we realized that the group had gotten so big that some of those things werent as relevant just because someone is in the group of 1700 doesnt necessarily mean i want their del icio us links or to see their tweets what if theyre a hardcore c programmer thats not so interesting to me well so maybe we dont want that much aggregation

6474228 russia has informed us through military channels that the minister of defence of the russian federation has taken a decision to halt international military co operation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions
6474229 one would assume we would have to help them rebuild because they are a partner in the war on terror theyve been helpful they are going to ask us i am sure to replace and rebuild
6474230 i think that assistance is probably going to happen its a matter of how much and how fast
6474231 we need to rebuild the military we need to make them stronger
6474232 we need new people trained and we need new equipment and we will work very closely with the u s to get all of this
6474233 i have already prepared an address to the president of the russian federation to the federation council and state duma and to the heads of state of the international community with a request to recognise our independence
6474234 georgia itself has driven a nail into the coffin of its statehood
6474235 we proudly say today that we deserve to live in a free and independent republic of south ossetia
6474236 the recognition of our independence is not a whim of the ossetians this is a security guarantee for our tiny people
6474237 you must remember that russia is always with you and that russia will never leave you in the lurch
6474238 the americans together with saakashvili would of course like to be the commanders of the caucasus but this will never happen russia was is and will be always be present in the caucasus

6474256 over the 12 months ending june this year customers collectively increased their spending by 29 percent using the card a significantly higher rate than the industry growth of 19 percent
6474257 the current price level is not a big concern for us and we remain confident in our outlook
6474258 twelve months ago the price was rm2 000 per tonne and yet we had a good year so at rm2 400 per tonne we are still good
6474259 we also expect the oil extraction rate of 21 per cent to be maintained
6474260 this is based on the cpo price as it was roughly rm2 000 per tonne for the first quarter ended june 30 2007 but it has since gone up during our current first quarter period so we will definitely do better
6474261 but it will be over a staggered basis because were not going to develop in one go we have spent less than rm50 million so far for the land acquisition
6474262 but in december and january that is when the monsoon hits so yields will start tapering off
6474263 we expect the market to respond if you look at the trend when crop goes up the price goes up
6474264 the intent was to allow every two three or four on our team to play and show exactly where they stand and i was disappointed
6474265 knowledge of assignment execution of position mastery and effort overall wasnt there i was hoping to be able to take someone in and move up a player but what i saw was a lack of readiness offensively defensively and even on the special teams there was a drop off
6474266 if a player goes down and one of those players was in the game you certainly wouldnt want to see it on game day the best thing is that we saw it today with a week and a half to go
6474267 either its the wrong player in the wrong spot or its the right player blocking it that we havent considered yet
6474268 if the scrimmage uncovered a punt blocker a running back or a receiver or another defensive back then it was worth the format today there might be some positive to come out of it
6474269 i dont see any significant difference from this defense to last years or the year before
6474270 its logical to say they are inexperienced and young and that it will take them a while it might but when you look at the leadership of kellen fowler matt bauman david nixon and jan jorgensen i think it will end up being another good defense i dont think it will take as long as most expect i think were on track
6474271 i thought that they wouldnt let me get in but they put me in and took off the green jersey which means im live i just had the attitude of nothing to lose so on second down i went deep then on third down i thought i have to complete this or the scrimmage is over in my mind i just wanted to get it done
6474272 the whole objective of monetary policy at this point in time which is to contain and manage demand is going to face some hurdles
6474273 the pay revision is clearly going to add to demand pressures on inflation
6474274 not over and im not exactly sure when its going to end
6474275 that as the crisis continues you will see a lot of business failures
6474276 there is still a tremendous amount of deleveraging still necessary
6474277 it was a massive failure of the brains of the economy
6474278 there was a party going on and the regulator with the same mindset of those in the party didnt want to be a party pooper
6474279 the cost of regulation may be far greater than its benefits

6474289 xbox is a natural partner to help us reach out to youth voters
6474290 to realize our goal of registering 2 million young americans by this fall we need to go where young americans are and theres no doubt in our minds that many are on xbox 360 and xbox live
6474291 overall the electronics industry has been riding out the storm so far although people are still wary of potential further slowdown in the global economy
6474292 and a lot of the continued strength that people point to is the demand from the emerging markets
6474293 the market right now is definitely mixed just looking throughout the region things are very positive though
6474294 if there is an opportunity to invest we will look at it
6474295 growing with our blue chip companies and our direct investment activities temasek now owns a net portfolio of about s 185 billion us 131 billion at market value as at end march
6474296 it was a pretty difficult period in global equity markets for sure i suppose they were pretty clever
6474297 even the singapore dollar was strong during the period so it wasnt as if they got a big boost from the currency

6474306 a survey on electricity tariffs conducted by the local electronics industry among factories in malaysia singapore shanghai bangkok and south korea has revealed that since our recent tariff hike in july the cost of electricity here is higher than in shanghai and korea
6474307 due to a shortage of resources and price hikes in fuel and power companies have no alternative but to consider turning to natural gas in the near future
6474308 however there is inadequate supply in the northern region although a piping system for natural gas is already in place at the park
6474309 we hope the authorities will re look its policy on the supply of natural gas since this will meet the energy needs of manufacturing firms

6474312 so far 350 buyers have signed up but by next week we expect this number to swell to 500 we are seeing new participants from myanmar armenia romania poland bulgaria lithuania and ethopia
6474313 just like in the first edition the bulk of the participants are from the food processing sector food is always more important than fuel
6474314 although there are more participants here to explore business opportunities in bio diesel their group is small compared to food manufacturers
6474315 as you know attorney general guidelines were first implemented in the wake of the fbi abuses of the 1960s and 1970s and serve as one of the most important bulwarks against future abuses
6474316 given the importance of these guidelines providing a period of time for public comment would be a reasonable and responsible way to move forward and achieve the best possible end result
6474317 the guidelines will require all activities to have a valid purpose
6474318 the market was also very quiet yesterday without much demand as buyers awaited a further drop in price
6474319 this development is in line with the organic action plan 2008 2012 published by my department in april this year the plan was my departments response to the target in the programme for government for 5 of the land area to be under organic production by 2012 one of the specific actions in the plan was to facilitate the expansion of the organic dairy sector by allocating additional quota and i am pleased that we are able to deliver on this so soon

6474322 since we are driving for growth and more participation in the area of islamic bank and finance the lack of substantive law deters the development of this system
6474323 at the time of the emergence of islamic banking the syariah law was not fully practised thus other system was widely applied instead
6474324 as such syariah law loses touch with reality in all fields except in the case of ibadat practise of religion and family matters business and finance meanwhile were referred to the so called modern laws and legislation borrowed from outside muslim civilisation

6474337 weve been linked with quite a few but we have shown an interest in bullard indeed in quite a few other players
6474338 whether hes actually for sale im not so sure so thats not the only iron weve got in the fire
6474339 its not particularly going brilliantly but were trying to get good players for the right price and that does take a little bit of time because people want to hang on to their players
6474340 well wait and see and if we can bring them in then all well and good but if not well go with what weve got now
6474341 its not a case of being under pressure to bring people in
6474342 if somebody had a crystal ball and said were not going to get any injuries or suspensions before january were fine
6474343 but nobody can say that so what do we do do we go out and spend millions and then find we didnt need to do so then you put the future of the club financially at risk
6474344 hes a washed up never was bush were shit are they still around i dont even know thats how shit they were swallowed was overrated the guys just clinging to my coattails trying to bask in my success because no one gives a fuck about bush
6474345 i didnt invite him he lost me the match i looked up into my box to get some support from my camp and i see gavin fucking rossdale and gwen stefani up there im like what the fuck the guy keeps pestering me with phone calls in the middle of the night he sends me flowers notes which read lets be friends dont leave me i look out my hotel window at midnight and see him standing out there with a guitar singing in the rain you can imagine the horror that evokes im scared
6474346 he wants some recognition he wants to be roger federers best friend hes sick of being gwen stefanis bitch and less talented husband
6474347 ive given nadals address to rossdale im hoping hell take a hint
6474348 we continue to believe our offer provides a full and fair value to heelys stockholders and such a transaction would be in their best interests
6474349 after careful consideration our board rejected the offer after concluding that their proposal was not in the best interest of our stockholders
6474350 it was a last minute decision to declare him and weve done it on the basis that we feel he will definitely need the race
6474351 if it was june or july we may not have run him but there are so few opportunities that will suit him now so we decided on balance the best thing to do was to let him take his chance
6474352 hes probably not quite back to his best just yet but the ground is right and he likes the track so we just thought we should get a run into him
6474353 they are saying its good to firm ground and i would rather they had had a bit more rain to be honest as he needs some cut
6474354 he is in great order though and what will be will be so we will just have to hope for the best
6474355 moorhouse lad is well and he will love the ground so hopefully he will run a nice race as well
6474356 kingsgate native is in good form everythings fine with him
6474357 i would have preferred the race to have been at york but at least were running
6474358 i dont know what price flashmans papers is but he wouldnt be a million miles behind kingsgate native
6474359 if kingsgate native got a bad run through the race and flashmans papers got a good run then it wouldnt be the biggest surprise in the world to see flashmans papers beat him
6474360 why are canadians so reluctant to embrace data driven strategy is there something cultural about us is there something in our dna that makes us inherently skeptical of a marketing science approach is there something in our school system that turns people off and away from statistics whats the deal there
6474361 tottenham fans are no exception to any others they support the team and get behind the side
6474362 if a player is on form if he knocks in a couple of goals then im sure anyone who booed him last week will soon be getting behind him and cheering him that is what it is like
6474363 while he is still here he is very much 100 per cent a tottenham player that is how we consider things it is not a case of finding a solution to a problem before it occurs
6474364 weve got a list of targets that we are working very hard on
6474365 negotiations are tough and sometimes they are even tougher than usual we know what we are working towards and we know what our objectives are
6474366 the process of signing players sometimes takes time but fans should be aware we are trying to strengthen up front and sign a new forward quite often these things take time
6474367 we need to support barack obama and his quest for the oval office
6474368 what obama represents is we as a people are a part of the american dream
6474369 the message is for a kid from in marcy projects right now to say maybe i can be the president
6474370 not just for us blacks but also with all americans i think theres so much our president can do obama seems like a human being i say that because a lot of presidents dont seem like human beings they seem like straight up businessmen who care about nothing but the business
6474371 were a small part of it but were showing our support to show that we are aware of whats going on and where its going
6474372 we really want change we really need it its not the same no more
6474373 listen to what hes saying hes saying what i wanna hear just like my favorite rapper if an mc is saying what i wanna hear imma go buy his album if a candidate is saying what i wanna hear imma go vote for him i can vote by the way watch me im going to register to vote
6474374 i think the first thing the hip hop community has to do is let the man become president
6474375 they gotta work in other ways to get him in the white house its not really about doing a song right now he has to separate himself from that stuff hes in a political race everybody should kick back for a minute see what happens in november if he becomes president he wouldnt have to separate himself as much from some of these statements because obama cant come as hard core as ludacris as far as his message right now he cant do that us rappers might have to hold our tongues for a few months
6474376 all it takes is for a mutha er getting out there being real ghetto and people will be like we dont wanna f with obama theyll wanna smash on him because of what somebody else said someone speaks for himself and its baracks fault what did luda say thats baracks fault is it baracks fault what im saying i dont wanna be the reason he dont get the presidency
6474377 its cool to make a couple comments but be careful about what you say because theyre gonna try to pin it towards him
6474378 we know its so much tension around politics right now theyre trying to take him down maybe everybody needs to chill out a little bit im not sure how much barack mixtapes are helping him i dont think no person is doing a mixtape addressing baracks political views
6474379 i dont think luda or anybody ever thought it would be that big i heard the freestyle the minute it came out and in his defense thats what people do on the mixtape circuit ive put out multiple mixtapes where i might not actually feel a certain way about somebody but ill say a punch line to give them that shock value its nothing new to the mixtape circuit i dont think he really wants mccain in a wheelchair the lyric reads mccain dont belong in any chair unless hes paralyzed its just a freestyle thing it was crazy they took it that big

6474499 i have quality athletes 17 years of age and i dont know how to get them the quality training experience between 17 and 24 that will get them to this level
6474500 theres a big gap its so frustrating i have to wait until theyre in their mid 20s and national team members before i can get them out of the country to get them the training they require

6474591 have you ever walked by the back of a restaurant at night
6474592 its insane how much food goes to waste those huge garbage bins full of stuff
6474593 i think americas greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic p recept
6474594 while we are deeply respectful of your serious concerns about the practices and methods of abortions at this hospital we have concluded that there is no basis for legal action by this office against the hospital or its employees agents or staff at this time
6474595 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state mccain plays right in there
6474596 we can expect with high probability this year will be cooler than the previous five years
6474597 definitely the la nina should have had an effect how much we cannot say
6474598 up to july 2008 this year has been cooler than the previous five years at least it still looks like its warmer than average
6474599 of course at the beginning of the year there was la nina and that would have had the effect of suppressing temperatures somewhat as well
6474600 but actually la nina is showing signs of moving towards a more neutral state
6474601 revenge is a dish best served with a fortune cookie
6474602 my diet has a lot to do with my getting into shape i have no sugar i dont eat fruit or even fruit juice because of the sugar i eat chicken and salmon and rice i eat avocados ill have egg whites for breakfast and sometimes turkey burgers for lunch i try to do just 1 200 calories a day it may sound like its not much but its actually a lot of food if you eat the right things
6474603 if you follow a vigorous workout program plus this eating program it is possible to lose up to 12 pounds in 30 days in a very healthy non fad like way
6474604 the states failed school funding scheme has left many school districts particularly those who serve high concentration of low income and minority students with a mounting educational crisis
6474605 whether this case can thread its way through the two decisions already on the books is something that remains to be seen
6474606 the basic fact that you have a distinction between low property wealth districts and high property wealth districts ultimately that leads down the road to gaps in education performance
6474607 jeder mitarbeiter wird einen gleichwertigen arbeitsplatz in einem modernen callcenter erhalten
6474608 jeder mitarbeiter bringt die gleiche leistung egal ob in seinem umfeld hundert oder 2000 kollegen sitzen
6474609 we see quite a few children with back pain quite a few during the school year and many attribute their back pain to heavy book bags
6474610 i put backpack problems into the overuse injury category in other words you have a child who is doing something that is overusing over stressing or over straining the body
6474611 they have experienced some of these natural disasters and after a lot of hard work and support they are able to stabilize
6474612 thats what i think their challenge is and they seem to continue to have met it over the years
6474613 the real issue is whether or not were in a period where these floods are occurring more frequently or not
6474614 one of the most beautiful magnificent places in the world and should be seen by everyone
6474615 it really truly is among the most beautiful places on earth
6474616 when you get down by havasu falls its as though kodak made an outdoor movie set
6474617 i would never go back there in my life because if anything like that happens again theres no organization theres no plan
6474618 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6474619 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6474620 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6474621 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6474622 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6474623 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6474624 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6474625 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6474626 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6474627 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6474628 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6474629 the care and exactness of language itself elevates the story into something more artful than simply a comic novel there is a real sense of a complicated and contradictory human being and it infuses every page of the novel
6474630 the design africa brand serves as an example for creators on how to market their products internationally
6474631 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6474632 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6474633 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6474634 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6474635 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6474636 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6474637 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6474638 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6474639 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6474640 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6474641 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6474642 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6474643 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6474644 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6474645 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6474646 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6474647 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6474648 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6474649 who are open to doing something on the production side
6474650 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6474651 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6474652 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6474653 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6474654 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6474655 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6474656 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6474657 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6474658 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6474659 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6474660 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6474661 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6474662 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6474663 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6474664 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6474665 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6474666 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6474667 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6474668 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6474669 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6474670 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6474671 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6474672 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6474673 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6474674 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6474675 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6474676 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6474677 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6474678 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6474679 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6474680 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6474681 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6474682 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6474683 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6474684 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6474685 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6474686 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6474687 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6474688 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6474689 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6474690 given the pricing and lack of carrier sponsorship in the u s we believe initial sales of the treo pro will be limited
6474691 auch auf mittlere sicht m ssen wir uns wegen des enormen nachfragepotenzials der schwellenl nder wohl weiterhin auf h here preise als in der vergangenheit einstellen
6474692 dennoch bleibt der starke anstieg der energie und rohstoffpreise in den letzten jahren im verbund mit anderen risiken ein ernster belastungsfaktor f r wachstum und besch ftigung in unserem land
6474693 dazu z hlt dass der leistungssch dliche anstieg der steuerbelastung durch die kalte progression vermieden wird

6474701 we found two chemicals in particular that were significantly different when you compared a cancer patient with a healthy subject
6474702 its not surprising that there might be a physical or chemical basis to this distinctive pattern of odors
6474703 if some of those proteins are volatile its not a stretch
6474704 instead of a visual exam and a biopsy you could have a sensor that you could wave across the body
6474705 we have to have a window where its safe for them to be diagnosed and not come back to the doctor for a week or two
6474706 although i didnt realise it at the time having a stroke was the biggest blessing in disguise i ever could have wished for
6474707 i have amazed myself by the turnaround to be honest but im loving every minute of it now i wouldnt change my life for anything
6474708 my doctor told me following a stroke your brain usually rewires itself to avoid the damaged bits and often leads to discovering hidden talents

6474714 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6474715 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6474716 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6474717 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6474718 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6474719 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6474720 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6474721 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6474722 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6474723 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6474724 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6474725 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6474726 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6474727 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6474728 there were a lot of people talking bad about us about how the training camp was a disaster
6474729 the funding has been very limited and to be honest some of them would be financially better off if they were stacking shelves in a supermarket
6474730 theyre all contracted and theyre on full time training in dublin but the problem is how to get the younger ones the funding they need for the long term plans
6474731 it looks like were going to be the only irish medals coming out of beijing and hopefully that will mean we get a lot more funding in the run up to london 2012

6474735 but police put up many obstacles to make it difficult
6474736 the fact that there were so many undercover police following them just made them go with the action urgently
6474737 we are concerned about any actions taken by the chinese that limit freedom of speech freedom of movement
6474738 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6474739 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6474740 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6474741 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6474742 he was a tough negotiator but always reasonable and respectful with the ultimate goal of growing the game
6474743 great budget hotel in the center of the walled city
6474744 i didnt realize chris martin of coldplay worked at meijer
6474745 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6474746 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6474747 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6474748 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues

6474756 the thai economy got off to a scintillating start in 2008 with first quarter growth up six per cent on the same period last year and up 5 7 on the last quarter of 2007 after two years of political turmoil culminating in a coup last year it seems the new government is finally settling in and has made economic growth its top priority the main thrust of its efforts is centred on generating internal and regional investment with global investment currently slowing
6474757 the local real estate market has experienced an overall slowdown in response to numerous political and economic pressures the number of transactions registered at the chiang mai land office declined from 15 000 in 2005 to 10 000 in 2006 and 9 800 last year but in the middle and upper tiers where around 20 projects are under way sales remained strong major developers are moving forward with numerous residential projects in and around chiang mai
6474758 virtually all of these property buyers have seen their investment increase in value capital appreciation over the past four years has varied from 15 to 20 per cent per annum although some properties have seen the value of their asset rise by as much as 50 or 100 per cent between the launch of a project and the transfer of title
6474759 am i connected to the american people if not what can i do to reconnect with the american people you cannot be honest with yourself until you are honest with the american people are you personally aware of my struggle or just aware of my struggle through statisticians
6474760 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6474761 brazils central bank believes that it has underestimated the strength of its economy and has moved its previous forecast of 4 5 per cent gdp growth for 2008 up to 4 8 per cent
6474762 having studied figures just released which show brazils current gdp to be 749 billion in 2007 up 5 4 per cent on 2006 the official number crunchers decided that theyd been too cautious brazil does seem to be resilient to the turbulence in the northern half of the americas a turbulence which has sent shockwaves across europe and while the spanish property market is currently down on its luck brazil has the very same to thank for making a major contribution to its current fortune
6474763 judging by the figures from its sister resort pousada dos girassois in pipa which enjoys 80 per cent occupancy per year you could stand to make a lot more
6474764 girassois is one of the most successful developments in pipa and the value of property for sale in pipa has doubled in just two years
6474765 the property market in natal is in its relative infancy and the coastline is almost development free supply currently lags way below demand
6474766 new development is springing up alongside sporting and leisure facilities but the authorities are paying great attention to the environment before granting licenses aesthetics and stability are of greater importance to them than squeezing every last penny out of every last square metre
6474767 prices of property for sale in natal are incredibly low right now but outside investment in infrastructure such as golf courses and a new airport will increase demand for property and inevitably trigger natural price hikes
6474768 being the closest part of brazil to europe thus drastically cutting down flying times to between seven and nine hours from most european cities natal has phenomenal beaches a permanent summer and with year round rental potential suits both audiences the pure investor and the holiday home hunter
6474769 the investment in the general infrastructure and tourism in the north east of brazil has been significant over the past few years and is set to continue for the foreseeable future
6474770 the government is committed to developing the area and with the new airport just a couple of years away we feel that property in the natal area and along this coastline of brazil offer some of the most exciting investment opportunities we have seen in a long time
6474771 some people are wealthy and rich in their lives and their children and their ability to educate them others are poor if theyre billionaires

6474775 researchers also interviewed students parents and school personnel in texas and mississippi states that account for 40 percent of the 223 190 kids who were paddled at least once in the 2006 2007 school year
6474776 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have and he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff
6474777 but if youre like me and you have one house you might have a different perspective
6474778 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6474779 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6474780 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans

6474878 there is a mounting body of evidence of the systematic operation preparations and planning conducted by senior level lao military officials to target thousands of hmong for extermination in laos just as nazi military and security officials targeted many of the jews in eastern europe with special ss and gestapo forces and their mobile einsatzgruppen hunter killer teams and using their full use of the institutions of the state including the secret police and military to persecute marginalize starve to death and execute many innocent people this is what is going on now in laos and we in the hmong american community want the world to hold these lao lpdr military generals accountable so that they can eventually be brought to justice before the hague international court in the netherlands for their horrible crimes against the hmong people their crimes against humanity genocide atrocities and war crimes and other charges
6474879 widespread illegal logging in laos is an environmental and human rights catastrophe it constitutes the rape of the environment the rape of the hmong people and their homelands in laos as well as the brutal rape of the national sovereignty of the nation of laos itself by these corrupt and lao military generals and communist party officials that are pursuing this policy that is very much linked to the ethnic cleansing and military attacks on unarmed hmong civilians as well as the tragic mass starvation of thousands of hmong people today

6475024 further evidence of the persisting problems with the 2006 nhs dental reforms
6475025 more than a million people have now lost access to nhs dental care those that are able to access care are confronted with a system that discourages modern preventive care by placing targets rather than patients at its heart
6475026 the government is in complete denial over the fact that the new dental contract has been an abject failure
6475027 people want to see an nhs dentist but all the evidence shows they are finding this increasingly difficult
6475028 the latest figures show that nhs dentistry is on the road to recovery we now have more nhs dentists this year compared to last year the critics who claimed there would be a mass exodus of nhs dentists under the new contract are being proved wrong
6475029 there is also a perception amongst the public that there is a growing lack of nhs dentists and these latest statistics prove that there are actually more and more nhs dentistry services opening around the country

6475049 through the centuries men have displayed many different symbols to show that they are christians they have worn crosses in the lapels of their coats and hung chains around their necks of course there is nothing intrinsically wrong with any of this if one feels it is his calling but there is a much better sign a universal mark that is to last through all the ages of the church until jesus comes back love and the unity it attests to is the mark christ gave christians to wear before the world only with this mark may the world know that christians are indeed christians and that jesus was sent by the father

6475070 lets just put it this way there hasnt been an outpouring of enthusiasm for 1 000 fines
6475071 before this ship had sailed the mayor wanted to make sure the fines were reasonable
6475072 the point is to attract attention to our recycling and composting program so there is voluntary compliance
6475073 they face fines for not providing the service to their tenants
6475074 but they wont face a fine if their tenants dont do a proper job of sorting their recyclables
6475075 need to include increased enforcement by the city to stop organized recycling theft by poacher fleets
6475076 the point is not to fine people the point is to attract attention to our recycling and composting program so there is voluntary compliance

6475094 was it the dream where youre walking along this forest path at night and these people in odd victorian dress are shadowing you just off the path in the trees and this one little child jumps onto the path and tries to kill you with a kitchen knife but just misses so you kick him right back out into the trees and start off again but the people are just standing there now staring at you with these glowing red eyes
6475095 as discussed on friday given the passage of time we have to validate the assumptions used in the model to support our offer price of 25 74 per share in cash in addition we no longer believe we can integrate take two ahead of the important holiday season accordingly we require due diligence to support a transaction and are therefore letting the tender offer expire tonight however we are pleased to accept your offer to review your management presentation as outlined in your letter
6475096 we welcome ea into our formal process and look forward to demonstrating to their board the significant strides made by take two since they last undertook a detailed review of our business in early 2007 our board remains unwavering in its belief that eas unsolicited conditional tender offer of 25 74 per share was inadequate and undervalued take twos world class entertainment franchises and our strong operational and financial performance

6475106 most physicians in the united states have financial relationships with industry ranging from the acceptance of meals to the receipt of large sums of money for consulting speaking or conducting research
6475107 consumers should absolutely know where their doctor is coming from
6475108 doctors think they wont be influenced by these financial relationships but the research shows that they are
6475109 lets say your investment counselor went on a trip to aruba paid for by a certain company
6475110 then he comes home and recommends you invest in that company wouldnt you be concerned
6475111 look around for hints that your doctor sees a lot of drug reps
6475112 and if you see an extremely attractive impeccably dressed polite person with a briefcase in the waiting room watch out thats most likely a drug rep
6475113 ask the doctor whats the scientific evidence for prescribing that particular drug over another one they must have a scientific reason especially if its a high price brand name drug instead of a generic
6475114 there are circumstances where you want to take this extra step and there are other times where you really dont want to bother
6475115 the first priority of physicians is the health and well being of our patients

6475117 if you look at the last decade theres been an incredible growth of these programs
6475118 show this card at any participating orlando area exxon station to get your free save the tiger poster
6475119 if you look at the numbers the average us household belongs to 12 different loyalty programs but they only use about a third of them
6475120 that means that there is just so much money being invested into these loyalty programs that just sort of fall out of the wallet or end up in the sock drawer to never be used again
6475121 if i make an investment in this program at the end of the day is it going to make me more money
6475122 people dont tend to forget to carry around their credit card but theyll leave most of those 12 loyalty cards at home
6475123 how about combining the two and making it easier for consumers
6475124 the interest that weve seen from the credit card companies they are all very interested in this
6475125 so we know were on to something here and i think theyre looking at us and saying wow this is really the next evolution for consumers
6475126 what were seeing is really more of a trend of hey i usually go to three or four coffee shops if i consolidate my business then maybe ill get a free cup of coffee a week and that really adds up a couple dollars a week especially in this economy is important

6475135 a hopeful cry not to forget the mistakes of yesterday in our actions of today

6475139 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
6475140 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
6475141 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
6475142 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
6475143 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
6475144 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
6475145 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
6475146 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
6475147 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
6475148 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
6475149 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same

6475159 certainly here on the road we have seen lots of russian military personnel
6475160 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6475161 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6475162 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6475163 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6475164 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally
6475165 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6475166 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6475167 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6475168 we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6475169 gene was a true pioneer as one of the few african american leaders of a major union
6475170 he was the equal of owners in negotiations and made the league a better place for all players playing alongside of gene was an honor and a privilege he was a pillar of strength and leadership for our great raider teams
6475171 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6475172 in the past weve usually had flooding in pockets i have not seen anything this widespread throughout the county
6475173 if it was a category 1 2 or 3 hurricane making a direct hit on jacksonville youd have something
6475174 this is the first day we can actually see the tops of the roads
6475175 were pulling in our plants and porch furniture making sure we have our supplies and gas for the generator
6475176 i still think we all need to stay on our toes
6475177 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6475178 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6475179 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6475180 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6475181 after what happened in georgia i believe that this is good protection for us
6475182 made the americans agree to this deal sooner because the russians are getting too bossy
6475183 o mercado de altas taxas de transmiss o de dados para laptops n o grande como os demais
6475184 this decision serves as a written warning that the court will not tolerate sanctionable conduct by mr aretakis in any future litigation before this court
6475185 three quarters of the complaint takes about sexual abuse in the church which has nothing to do with ms zlotnik its crystal clear mr aretakis whats going on here this is just more of the same of the conduct for which youve been sanctioned by numerous courts in this state theres no basis for any of the causes of action that are alleged in the complaint
6475186 this lawsuit was filed because you have your own personal agenda and you were able to find a client that would poster your own personal agenda
6475187 sloppy and filled with mistakes for example it names a dead man as a defendant
6475188 this intent to humiliate and embarrass is further manifested in the amended complaint which is littered with wholly irrelevant inflammatory and embarrassing facts concerning defendants and non defendants alike that have no bearing on the actions brought such as it was widely known that he one of the defendants was an alcoholic accordingly the court finds that sanctions are necessary in this case
6475189 congratulations why dont you run for the senate or president of the united stae and do something about it

6475324 durch die eingenommenen barmittel st rken wir unsere position nochmals deutlich um aktiv an der gegenw rtigen konsolidierung in der finanzdienstleistungsbranche teilnehmen zu k nnen
6475325 au erdem sichern wir durch diesen gemeinsamen schritt von mlp und bedeutenden produktpartnern dauerhaft das gesch ftsmodell des unabh ngigen beratungshauses

6475330 im a relatively privileged american and have a great deal more than most as my baseline
6475331 im wary of making predictions the race in hungary showed just how unpredictable formula 1 can be

6475334 you get used to street circuits being quite slow with lots of slow to medium speed corners and very short straights but this is almost the opposite
6475335 there are a lot of fast kinks and esses a couple of decent straights and lots of high speed stuff

6475339 some large sized clients had to stream line operations and now can only effectively service a few counties in order to remain profitable
6475340 however many small businesses that never tried the government bidding arena before are turning to them to grow their companies

6475350 if i make an investment in this program at the end of the day is it going to make me more money
6475351 people dont tend to forget to carry around their credit card but theyll leave most of those 12 loyalty cards at home
6475352 how about combining the two and making it easier for consumers
6475353 the interest that weve seen from the credit card companies they are all very interested in this

6475460 the storming the castle narrative is a very powerful motivational tool
6475461 colorado liberals have now created institutions that possess all seven capacities
6475462 en esta era de la informaci n se sigue educando a la gente como se hizo durante la revoluci n industrial se educa para un mundo que ya no existe instilando valores anti ticos para la democracia del siglo 21 lo peor de todo es que demasiadas escuelas extinguen la creatividad y el goce que deber an nutrir por obligaci n
6475463 por qu deber a pedirse a los ni os o a los adultos que hagan algo que los computadores y otros equipos relacionados pueden hacer mucho mejor que ellos pueden
6475464 por qu la educaci n no se focaliza en lo que los humanos pueden hacer mejor que las m quinas e instrumentos que han creado
6475465 la educaci n tradicional se centra en la ense anza no en el aprendizaje incorrectamente asume que por cada onza de ense anza hay una onza de aprendizaje por parte de los alumnos por el contrario mucho de lo que nosotros aprendemos antes durante y despu s de asistir a las escuelas es aprendido sin que se nos haya ense ado un ni o aprende cosas tan fundamentales tales como caminar hablar comer vestirse etc tera sin que le hayan ense ado esas cosas los adultos aprenden la mayor a de lo que hacen en el trabajo o en la entretenci n justamente durante el trabajo o la entretenci n la mayor parte de lo que se ense a en las salas de clase es olvidado y mucho de lo que es recordado es irrelevante
6475466 it is an event where the words of hillary clinton are probably going to be exceptionally important

6475469 here this is a great way to get to know senator obama
6475470 cancel lunesta order for 10 and fill it for 30 one daily at bedtime for sleep wandering agitation
6475471 its cheaper to get 100 than to use the insurance like it says on this note
6475472 well it has a lot of issues but play it long enough and youll love it
6475473 we would have to cut between 100 and 125 positions and thats just on the lawrence campus
6475474 the medical center cut would be something similar we hope we dont have to do that
6475475 the continued failure to hire faculty creates a lack of expertise in emerging fields gaps in future leadership cohorts and undermines overall institutional reputation
6475476 theres an important piece of rhetoric we need to keep in mind the students come first
6475477 helping students work to a degree has to be the first thing we do if the students arent there theres no reason for us being there

6475482 how many nation of islam members will work in an obama white house
6475483 when youre a state senator you have little money given to you to hire staff it is ironic that two of obamas employees in those days were known nation of islam activists when obama employed perhaps a total of maybe three or four staffers
6475484 a key constituency for obama was hyde park where farrakhan lives to be successful politically in that area you need to be involved with farrakhan since hes a strong power in the district
6475485 she got an offer but turned it down she ended up doing real estate
6475486 under the guise of instilling african americans with a sense of empowerment since its founding in the 1930s
6475487 how many nation of islam members will work in an obama white house
6475488 you know i have been very clear in my denunciation of minister farrakhans anti semitic comments i think they are unacceptable and reprehensible i did not solicit this support
6475489 were not doing anything i assure you formally or informally with minister farrakhan
6475490 one of the most important voices in the 20th and 21st century
6475491 their live streaming had been down all day and they didnt know whether it was back up i regret the dramatization that i was naive enough to believe was just going to be kept among that church
6475492 not only should muhammad continue to serve on the commission but i think those that resigned because they disagree what have they done to bring about an agreement
6475493 music art dance theater i think there is this ongoing marriage between the arts
6475494 in terms of what we get from it its a feeling its a mood and we can see shapes forms color not only through music but also through art

6475499 only innocent people die when the pakistan army carries out airstrikes in bajur or swat
6475500 if the army is really fond of fighting it should send ground forces to see how we fight
6475501 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6475502 that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
6475503 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6475504 if you look at the last decade theres been an incredible growth of these programs
6475505 show this card at any participating orlando area exxon station to get your free save the tiger poster
6475506 if you look at the numbers the average us household belongs to 12 different loyalty programs but they only use about a third of them
6475507 that means that there is just so much money being invested into these loyalty programs that just sort of fall out of the wallet or end up in the sock drawer to never be used again
6475508 if i make an investment in this program at the end of the day is it going to make me more money
6475509 people dont tend to forget to carry around their credit card but theyll leave most of those 12 loyalty cards at home
6475510 how about combining the two and making it easier for consumers
6475511 the interest that weve seen from the credit card companies they are all very interested in this
6475512 so we know were on to something here and i think theyre looking at us and saying wow this is really the next evolution for consumers
6475513 what were seeing is really more of a trend of hey i usually go to three or four coffee shops if i consolidate my business then maybe ill get a free cup of coffee a week and that really adds up a couple dollars a week especially in this economy is important
6475514 dave you should have heard the reaction of the employees to me afterwards all they could see were a bunch of managers not paying attention to the new strategic rollout they let me know if management didnt think it was important enough to listen to why should they
6475515 we feel the outdoor room and dancing will make sunday a family night that is rich in pictures and entertainment
6475516 we are not programming to win nights or weeks but to create hit shows if we do that the other stuff ratings looks after itself
6475517 there is risk in every move you make its about assessing the size of the risk
6475518 there are going to be a lot of changes this year and i think a new audience will be brought to the show
6475519 more than 200 programs have gone up against 60 minutes over the years some have made our eyes water and no doubt some will in future
6475520 thats so we dont get vibrations from someone typing on their laptop
6475521 its looking for large numbers of triggers coming in all at once
6475522 we can figure out where you are within about a mile
6475523 los empresarios sienten que si no usan las mismas herramientas pueden quedar relegados de los negocios por eso ven el soborno como una pr ctica m s dentro del esquema
6475524 la encuesta evidencia que se requieren mejores controles internos y auditor as en las empresas para prevenir el soborno una pr ctica que sin duda es dif cil de controlar
6475525 las grandes cuentan con mejores condiciones para implementar pr cticas que prevengan el soborno y est n m s dispuestas a hacerlo mientras que las medianas y las peque as todav a no se ven en esa onda
6475526 la primera condici n de responsabilidad social para una empresa es ser transparente y eso implica que todo el proceso interno debe serlo
6475527 lo malo es que no son muchas las compa as que manifiestan contar con pr cticas para prevenir el soborno
6475528 aqu se ve la doble moral de los empresarios por un lado ponen el grito en el cielo cuando hablan de corrupci n y por el otro no reprimen las malas conductas y prefieren quedarse callados
6475529 dragonforce is a force multiplier in tactical and law enforcement missions and results in a much more efficient and safer emergency response
6475530 were looking forward to demonstrating dragonforce to the first responder audience at trexpo east
6475531 the results reveal that although learning the language of science remains a primary hurdle students taught using our content first approach demonstrated an improved conceptual and linguistic understanding of science
6475532 furthermore as we examined each groups differential performance the students were randomly divided into two groups it became clear that students ability to communicate using scientific language was significantly impacted by this treatment
6475533 we knew what an apple was before we said apple
6475534 we were hungry and saw an apple and we were able to say give me that apple need drove language acquisition
6475535 teaching science as a language a content first approach to science teaching
6475536 in contrast to foreign language instruction where students are learning new ways to express familiar ideas science instruction often involves the presentation of new ideas expressed through new language
6475537 in science class students get new words and new ideas simultaneously
6475538 wendy needs the healing powers of a full grown mandrake plant if you can help me grow we can save my friend wendy
6475539 the thing that were most excited about is that the students in the treatment group
6475540 they got higher scores when questions were asked in everyday language they got higher scores when questions were asked in science language and when they were asked to write answers to open ended questions they were much better at writing their ideas in science language
6475541 my response to that is that theres no research to document what happens if you teach in this particular way so how do teachers know it works
6475542 and in the classrooms ive seen teachers are not sophisticated in the way they teach good scientific language consistently
6475543 but putting students in situations where theyre required to use the language which is what we did in this study is absolutely not common
6475544 the american economy has been getting pummeled by the one two punch of soaring oil prices and the collapse of the housing bubble but a stubbornly resilient economy has failed to produce the two quarters of declining output that have become the focus of the medias recession watch
6475545 even if we are not in the midst of a classical recession the recent experience certainly qualifies as a growth recession sustained subpar growth accompanied by job losses and rising unemployment
6475546 although weve experienced seven straight months of job losses totaling 463 000 since last december the 2001 recession was twice as bad in the corresponding seven months in fact every recession dating back to 1953 produced considerably more severe job loss than weve just experienced
6475547 regardless of the price measure used changes in home prices from the same period a year earlier have rarely been negative and never as hugely negative as those now being reported at least since the 1960s
6475548 the corresponding drop in the price of gasoline isnt sufficient to reverse the shift in the vehicle market toward more fuel efficient cars or to curtail the push for alternative energy sources and additional exploration
6475549 some stability in the price of oil however should begin to relieve some of the pressure on consumer prices that has resulted from the sharp run up in oil
6475550 weve planted a new vineyard with over 700 grape vines
6475551 how are pasture based dairies coping with high grain prices
6475552 in the first three weeks of september the global board of reed business will give a management presentation to potential acquirers
6475553 the presence of the nanoparticle can hinder the function of lung surfactant by affecting the interaction between the lipids and peptides
6475554 there is mounting evidence that very small particles have a greater negative impact on health than larger particles
6475555 nanoparticles emitted by diesel engines and other combustion sources are a health concern because of both their size and the carcinogens with which they are associated this problem is exacerbated by the fact that there is currently no effective regulatory control of these nanoparticles
6475556 it could help us reach the goal of engineering biofuel molecules to reduce emissions
6475557 molecular dynamics simulation study of a pulmonary surfactant film interacting with a carbonaceous nanoparticle
6475558 the plane would not fail to the point of causing a tragedy
6475559 most likely whatever the malfunction of the probe was it is probably not related to what happened
6475560 when you look at all of the statin trials together what they show is there is no overall effect on cancer either increasing it or preventing it
6475561 a series of colossal celebrations tied to spring football games at top tier division 1 campuses across the country
6475562 the exposure of our brand at tier 1 schools will likely result in significant viral growth
6475563 i dont see that its the end of the bull market
6475564 until either a lot of supply comes on stream or the economy collapses the bull market will continue
6475565 i am contemplating whether its time to get involved in base metals again
6475566 i am bullish on opportunities in the agricultural commodities market i am investing there now the secular bull market in commodities will continue to go on now for some years
6475567 it always takes longer than you expect even when you take hofstadters law into account
6475568 lovallo and kahneman 2003 have expanded the original definition of the planning fallacy from being the tendency to underestimate task completion times to being the tendency to underestimate the time costs and risks of future actions and at the same time overestimate the benefits of the same actions according to this definition the planning fallacy results in not only time overruns but also cost overruns and benefit shortfalls
6475569 im not suprised they f amp ed up theyre hopeless
6475570 you just gotta let him go play you gotta let him make a few bad throws here and there and next time check over here check over there i really believe tommy is a young man that can learn from his mistakes and he can make quick good decisions
6475571 some coaches believe you ought to knock the crap out of your teammates or youll get in bad habits when the games start i dont believe that i believe were all on the same team weve got to protect each other and realize were practicing for the opponent ive always said when an army practices for the enemy they dont use live bullets in practice
6475572 it looks very nice and wide with a smooth surface
6475573 it also looks like good fun track but we wont really know until tomorrow as there is big difference between walking a track and driving it at almost 300 km h
6475574 and just takes a few laps to find out which way the corners go but after that you continue to learn small details about it i dont find it too hard to deal with a new track the only place i found any bumps is where the track goes over a bridge and theres one in the middle of a corner that might have an effect but apart from that it looks like the people here have done a very good job
6475575 of course i would have liked to have won more races but the opportunities were sometimes missed
6475576 but i am still in a good position in the championship and while the season so far could have been better it could also have gone the other way and been a lot worse i am hoping we get some good results for the remaining races to get back to where we should be
6475577 the main issue has been getting stuck behind other drivers in the race after having had a bad qualifying session if we can sort that out we should be fine coming up now are some circuits that i really like we have good speed in our package and the important thing is to make sure we use that speed in qualifying because that is the crucial point of the weekend getting the car to work the way i want is just a matter of some very small things but thats enough to make the difference some times we get it right but unfortunately we seem to have got it wrong more often so far now we have found a solution that helps to make the car a bit easier to drive in qualifying even though it looks as though you can overtake here it is still very important to try and start from the front but in general i am not worried about the rest of the season the pressure is always there but at the moment it is not getting bigger as the championship gets nearer the end then there will be maybe more pressure not to make any mistakes
6475578 i want to let you know i will bust your ass in that madden we can get it poppin
6475579 the winner can take the money and we can donate it to charity
6475580 this is the madden bus n a you cant f with me i been playing this sh since you was in diapers since 89 bill walsh college football you was 3 years old when madden came out
6475581 probably every colonial spanish shipwreck that has ever been discovered has had coins that originated in peru
6475582 so it will be interesting to see how successful they are in getting other governments and shipwreck explorers to recognize their interest
6475583 theres a surprising dearth of law on high seas salvage
6475584 there is virtually nothing that we have touched in the last six months that hasnt increased
6475585 the prices have increased so rapidly and so high compared to historically where theyve been its just been uncharted territory
6475586 the cure for the inflation problem is a recession in the united states and europe
6475587 we have a recession and while thats lamentable it makes the inflation numbers old news
6475588 the consumer is either going to get smacked around by inflation or a sagging economy if youre someone who depends on a paycheck neither one helps you very much
6475589 we believe treasury is going to be forced to act within the next couple of weeks
6475590 probably some time after labor day when investors are back from vacations so that the bailout has the biggest possible positive impact
6475591 paulson can play this game for as long as he wants but the end is becoming visible
6475592 at some point investors are going to say these companies are too big a risk to buy their debt
6475593 but what happened today indicates that things are getting much darker
6475594 perlas patra as disparates y trapacer as en los medios de comunicaci n
6475595 las declaraciones de domingo berriel son de lo m s tenebroso y p rfido que se ha dicho en canarias
6475596 la isla de lanzarote ha sido pionera en el cuidado y protecci n de su patrimonio natural
6475597 hay por qu preocuparse no son obras ilegales se trata de cuestiones puramente formales y lo que hay que hacer es retrotraerse a los expedientes originales se har una nueva ley y si hay dificultades se les dar salida a la totalidad de las obras
6475598 no se ha cometido ninguna barrabasada porque ninguna de las obras ha sido construida en un paraje natural protegido
6475599 las formas en el mundo del derecho son completamente irrelevantes y esto es una verdadera atrocidad
6475600 las declaraciones de domingo berriel son de lo m s tenebroso y p rfido que se ha dicho en canarias
6475601 what kind of photos should i post in my profile
6475602 focused on the adventure of today trying to learn from yesterday
6475603 but the affection we shared was wonderful even without the completion i felt loved id walk around the next day feeling on top of the world unfortunately he was transferred to japan
6475604 respect trust and honesty are all important in a loving relationship
6475605 he wanted me to live with him 80 miles from my office and commute to work impossible i said no again a few weeks later i met a man and weve been together ever since
6475606 what kind of photos should i post in my profile
6475607 focused on the adventure of today trying to learn from yesterday
6475608 celebrating 75 years of good health mind body and spirit
6475609 but the affection we shared was wonderful even without the completion i felt loved id walk around the next day feeling on top of the world unfortunately he was transferred to japan
6475610 he wanted me to live with him 80 miles from my office and commute to work impossible i said no again a few weeks later i met a man and weve been together ever since
6475611 respect trust and honesty are all important in a loving relationship
6475612 it is better to be fat but fit than thin but unfit
6475613 to consider that someone overweight or obese might actually be healthy and fit
6475614 i dont quite know but theyre part of the party you treat them with respect
6475615 democrats have been are and will continue to be people of faith and this interfaith gathering is proof of that
6475616 he acts just like forrest gump hes slow when you walk up to him but then he wiggles so hard he urinates all over himself hes the biggest baby in the world
6475617 esque a o moroni das campanhas passadas hoje temos um novo moroni mais tranq ilo seguro consistente nas argumenta es uma imagem low profile
6475618 desde julho moroni j percorreu praticamente todos os bairros de fortaleza e come a agora a rodar de novo nessas localidades
6475619 enquanto outros candidatos est o nos palanques ele est no porta a porta com o p no ch o abra ando e conversando com o eleitor
6475620 what if he wanted to kidnap us or something like that
6475621 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6475622 in the past weve usually had flooding in pockets i have not seen anything this widespread throughout the county
6475623 if it was a category 1 2 or 3 hurricane making a direct hit on jacksonville youd have something
6475624 this is the first day we can actually see the tops of the roads
6475625 were pulling in our plants and porch furniture making sure we have our supplies and gas for the generator
6475626 i still think we all need to stay on our toes
6475627 the nautilus shares were acquired for investment purposes only and not for the purpose of exercising control or direction over nautilus
6475628 at the moment gazmetall has no future intention to acquire ownership or control over or additional securities of nautilus gazmetall does not exclude that in the future it may wish to increase its stake in nautilus and participate in the management of nautilus
6475629 if you look at the domain of natural resources here in canada there are some opportunities there we might explore
6475630 certainly the tsx is well known as a place where we house some of the worlds best natural resource companies so to me it seems like it could be pretty interesting
6475631 where are the opportunities that maybe somebodys left open or are there opportunities to do things here in canada we havent looked at before
6475632 had the job been to come and run the stock exchange or conversely come and run the futures exchange i dont think i would have been interested
6475633 the idea of integrating the derivatives market and the equity exchange is both intellectually intriguing and i think a serious challenge
6475634 given the significant rally in the u s dollar that has taken place over the last two and a half weeks i think the market has gotten a little bit over extended here and weve entered into a bit of a corrective phase
6475635 for the most part the main catalyst still comes back to price action in the commodity markets and with a substantial spike higher in oil today were seeing not only the u s dollar weaken off against the major currencies but thats been a benefit for the canadian dollar given the positive correlation between crude and the loonie

6475657 chemotherapy can be very useful but can have a number of side effects so we only want to use it where we think theres a good chance it will help this test will help us determine that
6475658 the bottom line is that there is no evidence from this work the largest study published to date that the cholesterol lowering ability of statins increases the risk of cancer
6475659 lack an effect on cancer risk across all levels of on treatment ldl cholesterol
6475660 the so called j shaped curve has been seen repeatedly when cholesterol has been measured
6475661 in such studies persons with the lowest ldl cholesterol on entry show the highest death rate from cancer than those with higher ldl levels
6475662 this is especially true of cancers involving the blood cell system but it also occurs with cancer of the kidney and elsewhere
6475663 whatever the mechanism the main point should be that studies of much larger numbers of people in statin trials find no excess of cancers
6475664 we need to do a much better job of keeping track of these relationships
6475665 in major trials of statins some do not even report on the number of cancers we need a lot more research in this area in terms of biology virtually nothing is known
6475666 what we need is patient level data to see whether a pattern emerges of different risks at different ldl levels
6475667 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
6475668 im very happy that we can talk about this subject very very happy
6475669 i am lightning bolt i am not flash gordon or anybody my name is lightning bolt
6475670 i have been saying all season the 200 meter race has been my love since i was 15
6475671 i was the youngest ever to win the world juniors and from that day on it has meant a lot to me i have done a lot in the 200 meters the world junior record holder world youth it means a lot i can not really explain it is just close to my heart and i will always love the 200 meters
6475672 i will not compare myself to michael phelps he swims he is a great athlete to win eight gold medals that is just great i am on the track he is in the water so you really can not compare it pretty much but he is a great athlete and i congratulate him on being the best at what he does
6475673 i do not think i will be going up to the 400 meters anytime soon but right now i guess the next aim is really to just finish the season injury free and then i will be looking forward to the world championships in 2009 after the world championships i will probably think about doing something else i am not sure me and my coach will decide that when the time comes
6475674 i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast creeping thing and birds of the air for i am sorry i have made them

6475677 lintel developer forum uno di quegli appuntamenti segnati in rosso per chi guarda da vicino al mondo a cominciare ovviamente dagli sviluppatori di hardware e software per piattaforme intel esortati con particolare enfasi nel cammino verso linnovazione dal chairman di intel craig barrett nel suo discorso di apertura e anche questanno la tre giorni che si chiude oggi organizzata a san francisco dal colosso dei microchip californiano non ha tradito le attese per lo meno per la quantit di argomenti nuove architetture per device mobili e pc desktop visual computing consumer electronics internet trattati dopo linfinita campagna di propaganda della nuova piattaforma centrino 2 i vertici di intel hanno parlato dei chip di prossima generazione toccando ancora una volta il tasto della maggiore efficienza energetica abbinate a prestazioni sempre pi spinte pat gelsinger senior vice president e general manager del digital enterprise group ha illustrato i dettagli della roadmap dei nuovi prodotti focalizzandosi su come il computing stia diventando sempre pi pervasivo e ha battezzato personalmente una delle novit pi importanti dellevento i chip core i7 per pc desktop ad alte prestazioni e per server i primi processori andranno in produzione in autunno a segnare la nuova frontiera dei micro cervelli di elaborazione di un computer per le capacit di distribuire grafica e contenuti digitali e di operare anche in veste di controller di memoria di tipo ddr 3 e dei chipset consumando molta meno energia delle cpu attuali nel suo intervento gelsinger ha quindi toccato altri due temi chiave nelleconomia delle strategie intel e cio quelli della grafica per personal computer e dellembedded internet sul primo fronte i progetti ruotano intorno allarchitettura x86 a pi cervelli larrabee i cui chip arriveranno al pi tardi nel 2010 mentre sono attualmente in fase di sviluppo i prodotti che andranno ad equipaggiare i miliardi di dispositivi connessi in rete nel campo delle applicazioni mediche dei sistemi di comunicazione su ip dei prodotti di infotainment per veicoli e di home automation nehalem il cuore dei chip multi core ad alta efficienza energetica alla base di tutti i chip che costelleranno il futuro prossimo dei personal computer c una nuova microarchitettura multi core nehalem che andr a sostituire lattuale core 2 in diverse e distinte versioni per server computer desktop con i processori havendale e lynnfield e dispositivi mobili auburndale e clarksfield a partire dalla seconda met del 2009 alcune di questi avranno inoltre dalla loro il fatto di integrare la componente grafica sul corpo del processore aprendo di fatto la nuova guerra di cpu gpu con la rivale amd che dalla sua pu sfruttare la tecnologia e i prodotti di ati technologies il passo in avanti tecnologico che si compier con la nuova micro architettura dovuto a una particolare tecnologia denominata turbo mode che permetter un utilizzo pi intelligente sotto il profilo dellefficienza dei core della cpu per indirizzare i consumi dei singoli core fra loro comunicanti grazie alla tecnologia quickpath che saliranno presto in alcune configurazioni per server fino a un numero massimo di otto dai quattro attuali in una singola fettina di silicio le cpu nehalem potranno contare sullapporto di circa un milione di transistor dedicati a questa specifica funzione di power management in attesa di nehalem intel ha confermato per settembre lintroduzione sul mercato dellultimo nato della famiglia penryn a 45 nanometri lo xeon x7460 a sei core per sistemi server ecco calpella lerede di centrino 2 i nuovi notebook dovrebbero avere una durata delle batterie drammaticamente superiore a quella attuale tale promessa al condizionale ha gi un nome calpella la versione mobile della piattaforma nehalem i cui chip con controller di memoria e processore grafico on board si vedranno nel terzo trimestre del 2009 a descriverne allidf le prime caratteristiche stato david dadi perlmutter executive vice president e general manager del mobility group di intel che ha accennato a prestazioni senza compromessi partendo dal presupposto che calpella ridefinir il modo in cui utilizziamo i dispositivi di elaborazione on the go offrendo agli utenti una nuova esperienza visiva livelli superiori di gestibilit e sicurezza funzionalit turbo ottimizzate e strumenti di gestione energetica in continua evoluzione dunque notebook sempre pi capaci ed efficienti sotto il profilo dei consumi di energia e in attesa dei processori del futuro intel apporter alcune migliorie a centrino 2 larchitettura mobile lanciata a luglio migliorie che riguardano la disponibilit di unit di storage di tipo serial ata a stato solido a elevate prestazioni di una tecnologia anti theft caratterizzata da meccanismi intelligenti di rilevamento e risposta basati su hardware per disabilitare laccesso ai dati in caso di perdita o furto del computer e lintegrazione del noto modulo wi max wi fi per abilitare la connettivit internet alle reti wireless di nuova generazione e non solo chi nel notebook ci vede una stazione di lavoro vera e propria ecco i primi processori quad core i core 2 extreme destinati alla mobilit quattro cervelli su un unico chip con consumi limitati a 45 watt dopo netbook e mid il nuovo obiettivo si chiama smartphone un miliardo di apparecchi portatili che usano chip intel nel giro di dieci anni lobiettivo fissato dallo stesso perlmutter non lascia dubbi la casa californiana vuole fare la parte del leone per quanto riguarda mini computer e dispositivi collegati a internet e il rilascio della piattaforma e dei processori atom utilizzata fra gli altri anche sugli eee pc di asus i best seller della categoria netbook stato solo il primo passo da settembre questi chip a basso consumo verranno proposti anche in configurazione dual core per equipaggiare i cosiddetti nettops e cio computer desktop in miniatura ad elevate prestazioni sui mini notebook low cost e sui mid lacronimo che identifica i mobile internet devices invece atom vivr in versione single core mentre un nuovo chip a 45 nanometri core 2 ultra low voltage con consumi inferiori ai 10 watt sar destinato alla fascia degli ultraportatili con schermi da 12 pollici come i macbook air di apple i lenovo x300 e gli appena annunciati latitude e4200 di dell ma la vera novit arriver pi in l con moorestown a fine 2009 o al pi tardi allinizio del 2010 inizier infatti lera dei chip intel per smartphone chip che avranno dalla loro prestazioni memory controller e grafica integrata ed efficienza energetica decisamente superiori ai livelli attuali di questi processori e di lincroft in particolare ha parlato allidf anand chandrasekher numero uno dellultra mobility group della societ californiana il futuro descritto dal manager vede laffermazione di dispositivi mobili sempre pi performanti non solo sotto il profilo della connettivit voce e dati ma anche sotto quello

6475714 we could expect to see a dramatic decline in citis investments in coal over the coming months
6475715 hey i dont really work at citi uhhhhh i mean im on the executive committee but
6475716 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6475717 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues

6475729 we are a small rural district in the bible belt with strong christian beliefs and feel like homosexuality is wrong
6475730 i dont think we are that different from a lot of districts at least in the panhandle that have beliefs that maybe are different from societal changes
6475731 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
6475732 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to insure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
6475733 i just felt like i had to stand up for the kids heather wanted to do this and i had to back her
6475734 i think a shirt that says i support gays is very different from a shirt that says gays are going to hell
6475735 one can be very disruptive for a childs self esteem the other supports other people and their ideas
6475736 what happens when these kids get out in the real world after they leave ponce de leon and they have a black homosexual supervisor at their job
6475737 i emphasize that daviss personal and religious views about homosexuality are not issues in this case indeed daviss opinions and views are consistent with the beliefs of many in holmes county in florida and in the country

6475748 if you look at the last decade theres been an incredible growth of these programs
6475749 show this card at any participating orlando area exxon station to get your free save the tiger poster
6475750 if you look at the numbers the average us household belongs to 12 different loyalty programs but they only use about a third of them
6475751 that means that there is just so much money being invested into these loyalty programs that just sort of fall out of the wallet or end up in the sock drawer to never be used again
6475752 if i make an investment in this program at the end of the day is it going to make me more money
6475753 people dont tend to forget to carry around their credit card but theyll leave most of those 12 loyalty cards at home
6475754 how about combining the two and making it easier for consumers
6475755 the interest that weve seen from the credit card companies they are all very interested in this
6475756 so we know were on to something here and i think theyre looking at us and saying wow this is really the next evolution for consumers
6475757 what were seeing is really more of a trend of hey i usually go to three or four coffee shops if i consolidate my business then maybe ill get a free cup of coffee a week and that really adds up a couple dollars a week especially in this economy is important

6475780 its a pretty different team to the test side and a lot of lads have come in wanting to impress and cement spots within the side so theres a freshness about the squad
6475781 kevin has obviously taken over as captain and everyone is eager to impress england for a long time now have under performed in one day cricket and weve got a chance to address that now and hopefully put some performances in
6475782 we got to the world cup final in 1992 and since then weve never been consistent
6475783 were definitely aware of that but we cant let it lie too heavily on us weve got to go out there and perform and were well aware of that but weve got to do it consistently
6475784 theyre the form side theyve beaten everyone theyve come up against
6475785 they are a formidable team in one day internationals and its going to be tough for us but weve got to test ourselves against these sides
6475786 weve beaten the best sides in the world before but weve got to beat them over a period of time and not just in one off games
6475787 hes won his only test and in the past week or so theres been a really nice feel about the camp
6475788 kevins taken to the job really well he was really enthusiastic about doing it and i dont see why he cant be a successful captain for a while
6475789 hes stamping his own character onto the job weve seen the way he plays and hes bringing that into his captaincy and bringing that into the team a little bit as well
6475790 hes confident hes single minded hes an aggressive bloke and his team especially in the last test match also played like that and i wouldnt be surprised if the same thing happens in the one dayers
6475791 kevin is keen for people to express themselves and have no fear of failure but theres a balance between doing that and being reckless and weve got to find that balance as a team

6475823 whats becoming quite apparent is that the way you actually have an impact on health development and poverty alleviation is when people adopt certain behaviours

6475826 we do walks of shame where you take a group of people and you walk around and you say look heres some human faeces
6475827 and you do this community mapping where everybody comes and says where they defecate
6475828 and you get them to realise how disgusting this is to live in an environment that is totally contaminated
6475829 and once they start using a toilet even if its just a pit latrine they refuse to go back to open defecation so they begin to climb the sanitation ladder
6475830 families were spending money on treating diarrhoea and other diseases but would not spend money on installing a toilet because they expected to be given money for that by aid groups

6475941 movable type 4 2 was released today with a pile of new features and enhancements that make the payoff well worth the anticipation building on the solid foundation of its blogging and content management functionality mt 4 2 adds a substantial new set of functionality in support of social networking probably the most trumpeted accomplishment of movable type 4 2 is the improvement in speed across the board page publication speed has been greatly improved as has end user facing search movable types user community has been clamoring for these improvements for quite some time and 4 2 really delivers
6475942 movable type pro allows you turn your blog into a full social network platform with features like user registration profiles ratings forums
6475943 its been almost seven years since six apart embarked on its quest to make publishing available to everyone and it is still going strong in the new era however it is now all about the ability go beyond blogging and into the social publishing mt 4 2 is here to offer a new level of interaction between bloggers and audience integration with social networks and a lot more that is certainly a very interesting development in the world of blogging and well continue reporting on it
6475944 blogging pioneer six apart is souping up its movable type publishing platform with plans to release a new version that will include a slate of social networking features such as profiles and discussion forums six aparts evolution of its popular publishing platform is very much in keeping with the spirit of adding social features to content sites across the web
6475945 now that companies have begun to find more productive ways of interacting with their customers online six apart is capitalizing on this growing necessity with additional social networking tools that can be integrated with the movable type blogging platform
6475946 six apart summed todays release with a simple question what are the other things we can do with blogging six apart is certainly gaining a leg on its competition by jumping on the social bandwagon with what sounds to be a very polished and integrated package movable type pro is an appealing all in one package for bloggers and businesses looking to ride the social wave
6475947 the 4 2 platform gives blog publishers better performance according to six apart but the really interesting thing about this launch is the new social features in mt pro just as blogging is changing publishing social networking is going to change blogging
6475948 movable type gets social with pro version built on mt 4
6475949 blogging and social networking have been happy partners for some time so its not surprising that at least one blogging platform is making the most of that alliance in their latest pro version it sounds like a great out of the box solution for those already using or keen to use movable type who want to integrate more social tools
6475950 now the next revolution for publishing is to bring that same ease of creation to the process of building social networks with six aparts recent release of movable type 4 2 that revolution has begun the new release provides diy tools for building your own social networking platform which includes member profiles forums friending capabilities rating of content and more
6475951 considering blogs were the first link in the social networking chain it seems only right that it would come back full circle most bloggers use social networks extensively to extend the reach of their blog and it has become the common secondary effort of most bloggers so this move by sixapart is a savvy one that accepts the direction the web has gone and im definitely downloading and installing movabletype pro on one of my personal blogs to see what its all about
6475952 six apart today announced an update to movable type and the launch of movable type pro a new version thats designed to let you build your own social networking sites the announcement is good news for all bloggers because it raises the bar for blogging platforms if youve got a popular podcast blog or internet video youll soon be able to turn your site into a social network
6475953 as the only full scale blogging app on launch typepad free is almost a category of its own but is nonetheless notable for just how complete it is
6475954 i downloaded a free program for typepad the popular blogging platform from six apart it writes posts copy and pictures and updates the blog i set up like i was at my main computer
6475955 i prefer the web app for the typepad blogging software because it allows me to manage track where the readers are coming from or approve comments for example the eric 2 0 blog

6475974 of the 95 patients eligible for vaccination 63 were unvaccinated because of their or their parents philosophical or religious beliefs

6476047 if we produce a phase space map of energy we have a contoured landscape in which unequal conditional probabilities are represented by wells or valleys in different regions with differences in potential energy being shown as valleys and ridges of different depth and heitght the phaswe space will includemultiple atrtractors
6476048 what kinds of maps best describe human thought when represented as an energy landscape in phase space the dimensionality of thought is fractal thought is not a point on a straight line continuum on a flat surface or within a cube or even a multidimensional hypercube it falls within a space in which we can discover infinite complexity if we make finer and finer distinctions to use the analogy of real hills and valleys it is as tough the hillsides are covered in sheet ice smooth at every point with nothing to grip onto if we want to draw a landscape which allows people albeit with effort to climb a hillside that is remove themselves from an attractor we need something more

6476075 whats becoming quite apparent is that the way you actually have an impact on health development and poverty alleviation is when people adopt certain behaviours
6476076 its just a matter of getting them to understand that what is a long established habit is in fact harmful and that you can do something about it
6476077 we actually use shame we go into communities and say to people do you realise how fecally contaminated your community is
6476078 we do walks of shame where you take a group of people and you walk around and you say look heres some human faeces
6476079 and you do this community mapping where everybody comes and says where they defecate
6476080 and you get them to realise how disgusting this is to live in an environment that is totally contaminated
6476081 and once they start using a toilet even if its just a pit latrine they refuse to go back to open defecation so they begin to climb the sanitation ladder
6476082 families were spending money on treating diarrhoea and other diseases but would not spend money on installing a toilet because they expected to be given money for that by aid groups

6476107 basescu i a provocat o rana narcisiaca pe care nu o poate asimila ea este dublata si de teama pentru ca nastase nu e un tip barbatos in plus sufera de complexul masculului alfa
6476108 nici in saloanele noastre de la spital nu avem cazuri atit de grave cum sint cele provocate de basescita
6476109 nastase este o victima directa a lui basescu a pierdut totul din cauza lui asta dupa ce astepta sa devina un fel de ludovic al xiv lea si pregatise totul pentru asta insclusiv constitutia isi apara acest eu supranascisiac prin mecanismul de negare adica faptele de care e acuzat nu exista realitatea nu exista si prin cel de proiectie in sensul ca altul e vinovat adica basescu
6476110 totul este dublat de teama pentru ca nastase nu e un tip barbatos nastase evita orice fel de confruntare ca dovada ca a apelat la votul colegilor din parlament si se apara pe blogg in loc sa se duca in fata procurorilor unde totul s ar fi terminat mult mai rapid
6476111 aceasta superobsesie basesciana arata ca in forul lui interior aspira sa fie ca basescu despre care crede ca i a luat locul ce i se cuvenea este vorba si de complexul masculului alfa
6476112 narcisismul il determina pe nastase sa aiba numai reactii afective si nu rationale
6476113 in plus este o ura nesfirsita care ii blocheaza mecanismele elementare de aparare daca faptele nu exista de ce nu se duce la dna

6476117 tv will fundamentally change how we talk about imagine and experience the internet
6476118 no longer just a passive experience unless the viewer wants it that way intel and yahoo are proposing a way where the tv and internet are as interactive and seamless as possible our close work has produced an exciting application framework upon which the industry can collaborate innovate and differentiate this effort is one of what we believe will be many exciting new ways to bring the internet to the tv and it really shows the potential of what consumers can look forward to
6476119 please please help us we are losing our treasure our freedom i am almost crying because im seeing my country is falling
6476120 states are applying ever more fine grained methods to limit and shape the information environment to which their citizens have access
6476121 some states block access to a wide swathe of content while others tend to concentrate on one or two narrow baskets south korea for example tends to block access only to sites related to north korea
6476122 filtering can help shape the message a countrys citizens see including as may have happened recently when georgia filtered some russian web sites for the purpose of preventing enemy propaganda from reaching ones citizens
6476123 filtering isnt the primary technological way that internet freedom can be compromised
6476124 another type of cyberwarfare that occurs more regularly is hacking into computers and stealing information as well as planting trojans or viruses
6476125 they range from the electronic frontier foundations tor software to commercial anonymizers and virtual private networks and buddy system software like psiphon which allows a person in one place to handle requests for web sites from someone in a place that filters
6476126 we owe it to our young people to do everything we can to help them fulfil their potential
6476127 we have already set in motion a number of measures that are bringing about improved results and we are determined to keep up the momentum of positive change raising school standards is at the heart of all our work with children and young people
6476128 we will continue to work closely with all schools in manchester to support them in further improving outcomes for young people
6476129 with the unprecedented programme of investment now underway in school buildings and a range of exciting developments ahead in the way pupils learn i am sure we can look forward to further stories of success in the future
6476130 as we said at the launch of national challenge many national challenge schools are improving fast with strong leadership and high aspirations
6476131 national challenge schools will still be receiving extra funding help and support to help them continue to improve and sustain those improvements for the long term
6476132 we still do have a great concern about the governments arbitrary target of branding all schools as failures who do not achieve 30 a cs at gcse

6476140 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate on houses
6476141 this step by the indian government demonstrates its determination to tackle the vulture crisis and we are very hopeful that other measures will follow
6476142 measures that make veterinary and human diclofenac less easy to use are crucial if we are to save these birds steps to make meloxicam which is just as effective in treating livestock more widely available are just as important
6476143 vultures are critical to the way of life for millions of people in india and the contribution from boehringer ingelheim is hugely welcome
6476144 vultures need immediate action from across the board to stop vets using diclofenac and to support the captive breeding programmes that are so badly needed to prevent the extinction of these fine birds
6476145 to sit down and go through the documents and negotiate
6476146 we have offered to sit down and discuss the matter in detail because it is a complex situation involving scores of third parties intel amd and class action attorneys
6476147 even though the events took place so long ago that there is no likely reason that their disclosure could cause competitive damage
6476148 litigants may not seal information merely because public disclosure will be embarrassing or will otherwise reflect poorly on them
6476149 i have a feeling that it is far from over
6476150 i think there will be another wave of mortgage related problems emanating not from the subprime part of the market anymore but from people with slightly more normal credit and mortgages
6476151 it is entirely plausible that there will be some hedge fund failures and commercial bank problems
6476152 i think this is going to bubble along for a while now
6476153 you dont have the resilience now to shake off bad news
6476154 i dont mean to sound like phil gramm but there has been a huge amount of financial market disruption and the actual impact on the real economy has been limited
6476155 the point is that what we did was instead of really approaching this in an open and forthright way we went to war basically trying to sell it to the american people much like you would sell any other policy issue youd want to get passed in congress
6476156 what happened here was we got caught up in the very thing the president campaigned against when he was first running for president back in 2000 the destructive partisan tone in washington
6476157 set up a massive political operation that was aimed at really continuing that permanent way of governing going out and shaping and manipulating the narrative in the media to ones advantage
6476158 thats something i think most americans are ready for us to move beyond
6476159 its not a deliberate effort on the presidents part or many of his advisers to go out there and be misleading or engage in spin its just the way the games become played in washington and we embraced it too often
6476160 i felt that it was important to give this solid team around the president and the president himself the benefit of the doubt
6476161 and as time went on i think some of my views have evolved
6476162 absolutely he has to accept responsibility for the things that went right and the things that went wrong unfortunately the things that went wrong overshadowed that which went right
6476163 tschechien und slowenien selbst die hauptstadtregionen von ungarn und der slowakei haben im vergleich zu ostdeutschland bessere zukunftschancen
6476164 slow growth the rest of the year and possibly an economy grinding to a halt
6476165 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
6476166 file gt jess uses on her page but i asked permission why because i am a hardcore admin and can make
6476167 targeting 9 growth getting up to 10 it may look ambitious with the global economic slowdown but in the medium term it is achievable
6476168 i think as labour costs rise in china and theres a price to pay for pollution that we will see manufacturing coming to india
6476169 theres been for some time a sense that agriculture can no longer absorb any more people
6476170 india has become a net exporter of fdi foreign direct investment thats because it is too difficult to start up labour intensive manufacturing of the kind you find in china sixty percent of indians depend on agriculture and i dont see that changing
6476171 the hardware estimate seems optimistic the auto industry seems in the right area
6476172 the important question here is what kind of jobs are created in the past it has been low security and low paid jobs in what is called the informal sector that needs to change
6476173 many casual restaurants in arizona and the nation are experiencing profit losses
6476174 the biggest winners are the lower priced quick serve restaurants
6476175 thats because people with less disposable income still want to eat out so they go to places they can afford
6476176 at the upper end the expensive fine dining restaurants are holding their own mainly because they generally serve wealthier customers who arent affected as much by the economy
6476177 were concerned about the economy but weve been able to find a product and a price that is reasonable and attractive to our customers
6476178 the rise in fuel prices for example raises just about everything from the price of electricity to the higher cost of buying plastic spoons
6476179 until i lost my job id go to a lot of fancy restaurants after work
6476180 i didnt want to work all day and then go home and cook but now i dont eat out as much and when i do i go to quick serve places that i can afford
6476181 the growth in our states restaurant industry is slowly coming down
6476182 we expect revenues to improve but not until late 2009
6476183 bored of hollywood and looking to find a place in nyc
6476184 theyre trying to find a place in chicago as well so pete can be close to his family
6476185 you dont really expect to score a lot of runs off one of the games best pitchers
6476186 we trust the court can find a way to protect the companies trade secrets without blocking all information on the allegations in this case
6476187 intel has already been fined 25 million in south korea for engaging in this illegal anticompetitive rebate program we would hope evidence related to that illegal behavior and business practice would not be something anyone would want to or could afford to emulate
6476188 the public has a well established right to observe what is going on in our courts whether it is a criminal trial or a business dispute
6476189 each in its own way has an important impact on society and public access promotes confidence that justice is being done fairly
6476190 for example intels response to the plaintiffs amd statement filed on may 15 most parts which allege intels individual behaviors toward the computer manufacturers were redacted even though the events took place so long ago that there is no likely reason that their disclosure could cause competitive damage
6476191 similarly some redactions clearly contain nothing more than lists of third party employees identifying personnel in companies not party to this litigation cannot reasonably be construed to cause competitive injury nor does such information implicate personal privacy interests yet this information has also been redacted from public view
6476192 of course litigants may not seal information merely because public disclosure will be embarrassing or will otherwise reflect poorly on them
6476193 not something that lends itself to on the job training
6476194 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean

6476200 limbaugh everyones afraid to criticize the little black man child

6476202 the church lets itself be seduced invaded dominated by the ease with which it can now spread the gospel by force another force than that of god and use its influence to make the state too christian it is great acquiescence to the temptation jesus himself resisted for when satan offered to give him all the kingdoms of the earth jesus refuses but the church accepts not realizing from whom it is receiving the kingdoms

6476223 the sight of a feather in a peacocks tail whenever i gaze at it makes me sick
6476224 how can this trait be made in one gender and not the other
6476225 males and females basically have the same set of genes so how do you specifically modify the activity of a males genes but not a females genes
6476226 the flies did not need new genes to make a new pattern
6476227 they just changed how males and females use a common set of genes
6476228 the switch existed for tens of millions of years because it had a different job
6476229 but it got remodeled evolution is a cumulative process you have this machinery and its easy to add a bell or a whistle with this particular trait it evolved by exploiting genetic information that was already there to make male bodies different from female bodies
6476230 we have enough evidence to believe this evolved in a male specific way
6476231 if female tastes change these traits go away there is no reinforcement
6476232 as long as the gain outweighs the cost the feature will survive the fruit flys color pattern is a paradigm for understanding how to use the same sets of genes in different sexes to come up with different features
6476233 we and others had demonstrated the existence of a dna detection pathway within cells but we are still early in our understanding
6476234 our findings offer an important piece of evidence that this pathway is not only very relevant but it can be the cause of severe autoimmune disease
6476235 just as commensal bacteria outnumber our own cells by four or five orders of magnitude endogenous retroelements outnumber our genes by at least 100 fold
6476236 both have the potential to be detected by the immune system and cause autoimmune disease therefore specific mechanisms evolved to prevent this and trex1 represents the first example of a mechanism to prevent autoimmunity caused by endogenous retroelements
6476237 random processes could promote job sharing in many different types of organisms
6476238 we found that eventually they senesced and were cleared from the liver to protect it from an excessive fibrogenic response to acute injury
6476239 cell cycle arrest in the cells that generate the fibrosis places a kind of brake on the process limiting how far it can go
6476240 we hypothesize that hscs when they senesce secret less fibrogenic protein and also stimulate a process that tends to degrade proteins that are still present in a lesion
6476241 senescence is a kind of homeostatic mechanism that enables the tissue to return to its pre damaged state
6476242 this may prove to be broadly relevant to other wound healing processes
6476243 fibrosis is a disease of many organs lungs kidneys pancreas prostate skin
6476244 its possible this mechanism in the liver is relevant to fibrotic situations in other tissues
6476245 once a lot of extracellular matrix has formed its very hard to clear
6476246 the material just sits there and creates an inflammatory environment
6476247 we suggest that following tissue damage hepatic stellate cells become activated and proliferate intensely senesce and are eventually cleared to protect the liver from an excessive fibrogenic response to acute injury
6476248 however in response to chronic tissue damage for example as produced by viral hepatitis or fatty liver disease continual rounds of hepatocyte i

6476278 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6476279 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6476280 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6476281 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6476282 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally
6476283 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6476284 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6476285 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6476286 we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6476287 gene was a true pioneer as one of the few african american leaders of a major union
6476288 he was the equal of owners in negotiations and made the league a better place for all players playing alongside of gene was an honor and a privilege he was a pillar of strength and leadership for our great raider teams

6476304 among the key findings of this study are most of the regulation of professional fees provided by the bankruptcy code is valuable primarily for its deterrence effects retention applications are rarely denied and requested fees are rarely reduced this of course does not mean that the regulatory system is broken but rather that much of the system is not easily viewed by outsiders unlike prior studies i find that time spent in chapter 11 seems to have very little independent effect on the costs of the case factors like the size of the debtor corporation the number of professionals retained and whether a committee is appointed play much bigger roles professional fees in chapter 11 are subject to economies of scale in particular with every 1 percent increase in the size of a debtor professional fees only grow by less than half a percent holding other key factors constant lost in the sound and fury about large professional expenses in large cases is the fact that almost 35 percent of the chapter 11 cases result in no payment whatsoever to the professionals these are typically smaller cases that are often converted to chapter 7 or dismissed outright

6476438 tempel steel company has deep roots in chicago since it was founded here in 1945 by tempel smith our recent expansion into international markets has not hampered our ties to the city or the importance of our headquarters and manufacturing operations here
6476439 although we have an investment in manufacturing in monterrey mexico our decision to keep important manufacturing operations in chicago reflects on the citys ability to provide tempel with the talent to fill nearly 800 premium manufacturing jobs in an expanded advanced centrally located facility so we can best meet the needs of our customers around the world
6476440 when a company such as tempel makes a commitment like this one it sends a strong message to the business community that our leaders work together and that chicago can meet the needs of any company in the world from the largest to the smallest

6476449 and just working with really big equipment theres something magic in that too its the force of people you stand next to a car and compared to the size of it you weigh nothing yet you get to move trains sometimes with 100 cars or more with only two people and i think thats really exciting
6476450 university is great but for those like me who dont you just end up in debt
6476451 we only survey the people who graduated the ones weve really failed are long gone so they never get asked
6476452 and you can tell from the pattern theyre taking that they dont know what to do theyre hoping like hell theyll just hit the right thing and that will send them off on a career we often find younger students come because someone mentioned it or they didnt know what else to do and it sounded good and they tend not to do so well and its sad because they waste their time and i think your self image suffers when you bomb out of something
6476453 i wish people had told me before i could just take a certificate
6476454 paramedics have no life all they do is work and try to get seniority it seemed like an awful life so i decided not to go with it
6476455 they told us in the program it was ridiculous but they didnt fully explain the ridiculousness
6476456 i wish id gone right into trades after high school
6476457 i wish i was really skilled right now before the mass construction slowdown id already have my own business but you dont know anything when youre 18
6476458 we started off with 30 students in the program but graduated 11 or 12 a lot of people go in thinking that its just going to be fun and games but really its a lot of hard work too
6476459 if anyone thinks theyre going to make it rich in this industry theres the door
6476460 its a decent job with a decent salary so we can have a comfortable life
6476461 were simple people were not materialistic i like my toys though and i have a big screen tv with surround sound but i live within my means
6476462 i thought we needed to get a bigger home a better car we all get stuck in that
6476463 but now i just accept what happens everything happens in steps
6476464 they probably lose a good 30 percent of their first year students and we do too in fact we probably lose more but you go in and you try it and you think this isnt where i want to be and thats okay
6476465 if you invest in a semester then you can figure out if its what you want to do or not and if it is you can finish the program and youre on your way to starting your career
6476466 i dont think kids should expect to have one career path you have to go hard with whatever interests you but you change so much after high school you end up changing what you want to do
6476467 and maybe thats just another part of your educational process and we need to reframe how we think about it
6476468 he has a close personal relationship with john mccain i dont fully understand why he does
6476469 i told him last night you know joe i cant stand john mccain
6476470 bobs response was to tell peaches this is your mess you made it you clear it up
6476471 its fairly typical of his approach to parenting and while it may leave something to be desired you cannot accuse him of being inconsistent its the same with all the girls
6476472 ever since paula died bob has found it incredibly difficult to give them boundaries he lives in fear that if he stifles them too much theyll end up going off the rails like their mother did
6476473 i used to admire him for being brave enough to trust his kids but now im not so sure its not just peaches all the girls have been damaged by losing their mum and im worried it will all end in tears
6476474 peaches has never been someone who likes to be controlled so when bob laid down the rules she was angry but she knows that there is nothing she can do
6476475 bob is one of the most trusting parents and peaches knows that which is why she feels that she has let him down even more whats harder for her to digest is that she will have to cut off all her mates who she has met recently because bob sees them as a bad influences
6476476 she is not allowed to dj for a while or go to many parties because he is worried that she could be led astray again
6476477 her cash and credit cards have been taken away so she now has to ask him for money to do anything when she does she will face a grilling over what she needs the money for its going to be pretty hard for her to deal with but her main concern is making it up to her dad because deep down she knows he is only doing all this because he loves her
6476478 okay this is now crossing the line and as a parent i have to set boundaries
6476479 and fred was withering about her showbiz lifestyle he hated drugs and used to tell her she was a wannabe who should start doing something worthwhile with her life
6476480 it was tough love but he was right and she responded brilliantly to it but in the end he grew tired of her spoilt ways and dumped her
6476481 why dont you make sure you have enough film in your camera before making me start talking
6476482 to our knowledge this is the first study to directly investigate the effect of both acute and short term flavanol rich cocoa frc consumption on cerebral blood flow
6476483 we show that two weeks of regular frc intake providing 900 mg of cocoa
6476484 based on early in vitro data that showed nitric oxide synthase the enzyme that produces no activation by flavanols and our own work which showed that frc induced no dependent peripheral vasodilation in healthy humans we propose that the cerebrovascular effects of frc consumption are also no dependent
6476485 studies using specific nos inhibitors such as n g nitro l arginine methyl ester l name will help to better define this pathway in the future
6476486 it is likely therefore that any increase in cerebral blood flow measured acutely following frc consumption must emerge upon a background of vasoconstriction induced by its caffeine and theobromine ingredients
6476487 with this information we can proceed to determine the effect of frc consumption on cerebral ischemic syndromes including
6476488 just one more study adding to an increasing body of literature connecting regular cocoa flavanol consumption to blood flow and vascular health improvements throughout the body
6476489 though more research is needed these findings raise the possibility that flavanol rich cocoa products could be developed to help slow brain decline in older age

6476491 never never never believe any war will be smooth and easy or that anyone who embarks on the strange voyage can measure the tides and hurricanes he will encounter the statesman who yields to war fever must realize that once the signal is given he is no longer the master of policy but the slave of unforeseeable and uncontrollable events
6476492 the art of war is simple enough find out where your enemy is get at him as soon as you can strike him as hard as you can and keep moving on
6476493 the death of one man is a tragedy the death of millions is a statistic
6476494 there is nothing so likely to produce peace as to be well prepared to meet the enemy
6476495 war is an ugly thing but not the ugliest of things the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse the person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight nothing which is more important than his own personal safety is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made or kept so by the exertions of better men than himself
6476496 in such a world of conflict a world of victims and executioners it is the job of thinking people not to be on the side of the executioners
6476497 television brought the brutality of war into the comfort of the living room vietnam was lost in the living rooms of america not on the battlefields of vietnam
6476498 it may be typical of the pro obama dungeons amp dragons crowd to disparage a fellow countrymans memory of war from the comfort of moms basement but most americans have the humility and gratitude to respect and learn from the memories of men who suffered on behalf of others

6476502 i felt excited when watching the opening ceremony of the beijing olympic games and the audience in the birds nest national stadium that night must have been overwhelmed by the strong visual impact of the performance
6476503 with advanced modern technology the opening ceremony of the beijing olympics has successfully displayed chinas time honored history and splendid culture to the world
6476504 chinese athletes have won the most gold medals from the beijing olympic games so far which has brought international honor to china
6476505 the organizational work of the beijing olympics is excellent the advanced sports facilities and stadiums in beijing have proved to the whole world that the city has the capacity to organize olympic sports events
6476506 the birds nest itself is a splendid piece of work which demonstrates the chinese peoples wisdom power and technology
6476507 the gold medal also shows that mongolian athletes can compete with those of other countries in the international sports arena and make outstanding achievements

6476509 leading alliance members came to us and whispered in our ears hoping that we do not halt cooperation with nato on afghanistan
6476510 everything depends on nato if their priorities go to the unconditional support of the bankrupt regime of georgian president mikhail saakashvili regime to the detriment of partnership with nato its not our fault

6476514 fuel skepticism about gardasil which has already faced questions surrounding its safety and effectiveness
6476515 despite great expectations and promising results of clinical trials we still lack sufficient evidence of an effective vaccine against cervical cancer
6476516 with so many essential questions still unanswered there is good reason to be cautious
6476517 is nearly universal and generally benign eighty percent of people will contract hpv in their lifetime and most will clear it on their own
6476518 clearly cost the health system money rather than saved it in contrast to less expensive shots against measles and tetanus for example that pay for themselves by preventing costly diseases

6476520 the investor class is buying back oil as a hedge because the value of the dollar is weak
6476521 all else equal people would think that in a stable commodity market and a negative financial market people would have more faith in the commodity place
6476522 if the dollar does fall off a lot of these guys foreign investors are able to consume more and buy more on a pure dollar per dollar basis
6476523 running back to gold running back to oil so it seems we are seeing some of the running back to safe haven
6476524 running back to oil as a hedge against this risk again
6476525 the risk factors are back on the rise with the latest fears about fannie mae and freddie mac and that seems to have captured the imagination of the market
6476526 the reason why gas supplies are so tight is because refineries are not making any demand is not there
6476527 the summer driving season is coming to an end and if the refineries chose to they could ramp up the production of gas because they have plenty of crude but there is no desire to ramp up
6476528 we are going up for the same reasons we went to the highs concerns about the dollar the economy the feds ability to raise interest rates
6476529 it looks like we could potentially test the 120 area that would be the big number that everybody would be looking at
6476530 the dollar had been rallying very sharply for a little bit more than a month a little bit overbought
6476531 ongoing concerns in the u s on the financials thats taken its toll on stocks on top of that oil you have all these negative factors kicking in
6476532 profit taking off recent gains and the fact commodity prices are edging higher once more is ensuring that the dollar retreats further from the highs it saw earlier in the week

6476535 consumers are still going to want chocolate however hershey will find it hard to compete with other major confectionery companies if this strategy continued particularly considering the strength of mars following its recent merger with wrigley
6476536 commodity costs have been volatile over the last several years and continue to remain at levels that are well above historical averages market prices for ingredients such as cocoa corn sweeteners sugar and peanuts are up 20 to 45 per cent since the beginning of the year as such in 2009 we expect our commodity cost increase to be more than double the 2008 increase
6476537 premium chocolate has driven interest in the mature chocolate market since 2002 and it continues to be a strong force
6476538 consumers are likely to see higher every day and promotional retail prices as we implement the price increase and as a result we expect volume in the fourth quarter and next year to be lower than previously estimated in 2009 we expect net sales growth of 2 3 percent versus our previous projection of 3 5 per cent
6476539 have come to the earliest agreement in any general election in recent history
6476540 after meeting him and talking to him and seeing how down to earth he was with us and understanding he just sold me 100 percent
6476541 will include a broad spectrum of speakers and delegates from across the country including everyday people whose own stories reflect the challenges and opportunities americans in communities across the country face and who are committed to change
6476542 they said we want you and your wife to come to the convention and we want you to speak
6476543 be right in front of 20 000 people i went oh boy

6476545 we are examining the order and will evaluate our next step
6476546 whatever momentum that obama took into the summer he really appears to have lost it
6476547 the hillary clinton campaign may be over but the clinton factor remains an important part of the election
6476548 theres no question that we will sustain some agricultural losses from the storm including flooded vegetable fields dropped or damaged citrus fruit and possibly saturated pastureland for livestock
6476549 but it will be a number of days after fay runs its course before we can begin putting together accurate assessments of the extent of damage
6476550 we had 50 mph winds with gusts to 60 mph we were pleasantly surprised no fruit fell to the ground
6476551 despite that situation we came out of this in pretty good shape
6476552 we are still assessing the total impact hopefully this is the last major storm to hit florida for a long time the citrus harvest is right around the corner and we are primed for a good season and a quality crop
6476553 the saving factor was it didnt have a chance to gain much strength before it made landfall
6476554 those winds near the eye consequently were not nearly as bad as what we have come to expect
6476555 ich finde es sehr mutig von spellbound dass sie dieses projekt bernehmen

6476566 warcosm is similar to starfire but with a bit more interesting ship design and operation warcosm provides more flexibility on designing ships for firepower maneuverability and protection
6476567 yes it is that good everything you need to design and deploy your own starship fleets

6476569 its a pretty sweet little game easy to play with just enough options to keep things interesting
6476570 its been a wrong decision not to sell spanair for a very long time
6476571 spanair has been up for sale for almost a year and a half but sas have apparently been unable to get the price they wanted and the further they got into the process the worse the situation has got
6476572 i think i felt it hit my hand but i dont think it was in all the way before i grabbed its probably my fault i take the blame for it
6476573 sweeps up from the bottom of the screen to next to the globe then
6476574 moves from the right the letters upward then unfolded as it goes under
6476575 he secured the stick in my hand and i thought it hit my hand but i dont think it was in all the way if it hits your hand you should have it im a veteran ive never dropped the stick in my life its upsetting
6476576 tyson gay is a very humble guy i know its my job to put the baton across i did not do that i thought he had it i let it go and he dropped it
6476577 the stick was there the stick had a mind of its own it popped out it wasnt either of ours fault
6476578 if people want to assess blame to me thats ok i can take it i thought the baton was secure and i let it go its very heartbreaking
6476579 you dont become a champion without being mentally and physically tough and you know what i showed up and got it done
6476580 i said nothing is going to get in my way i said before the race this is my domain and im going to get it done
6476581 i ran the best i could i just didnt have anything at the end im disappointed it happens its a long season i started back in february its now august the body can only take so much
6476582 that was the only thing i could think of and it got me the bronze it was a last second decision i had to go for it
6476583 n o vamos copiar a experi ncia de ningu m claro que aprendemos com outros modelos como o noruegu s mas vamos criar um modelo brasileiro
6476584 o governo ainda n o decidiu como far a gest o dessa riqueza mas ela n o ser usada em benef cio da empresa a ou b mesmo que seja estatal mas em benef cio da popula o parte do dinheiro deve ser aplicado em sa de em educa o para aumentar reservas e para pagar d vidas
6476585 n o sei se vai para esse fundo ou se para outro o certo que o modelo que est no congresso est preparado para receber os recursos do pr sal
6476586 eu at gostaria de ser o felizardo que vai receber toda essa riqueza
6476587 n o existe nova estatal o que existe uma discuss o do conselho interministerial que conta com muita gente do governo para discutir o que vamos fazer a partir do pr sal
6476588 a nica coisa que disse at agora que o petr leo enquanto estiver debaixo da terra da uni o precisamos usar esse potencial para resolver o problema cr nico desse pa s acabar com a pobreza e recuperar o tempo perdido de investimento em educa o
6476589 at agora n o sei se a petrobras pode tomar conta da reserva
6476590 as descobertas feitas com o investimento da petrobras colocaram o brasil numa situa o altamente privilegiada entre os pa ses detentores de grandes reservas de petr leo
6476591 n o sei a quantidade exata mas penso que certamente tem menos do que desejar amos mas muito mais do que aquilo que a gente pensou em algum momento ter nesse pa s ningu m precisa me dizer os n meros porque vejo isso estampado na cara dos diretores da petrobras
6476592 a petrobras t o grande e tem tanto dinheiro que s vezes esnoba algumas coisas mas aos poucos vamos mostrando que n o o brasil que da petrobras mas a petrobras que do brasil
6476593 quem precisava de mais sorte eram os jogadores da sele o brasileira para jogar menos bola na trave e mais bola no gol
6476594 passei metade da minha vida ouvindo que n o tinha capacidade de governar esse pa s que n o tinha experi ncia deus queira que eu continue tendo muita sorte
6476595 tive a oportunidade de ligar para o morales ap s o referendo ele teve uma boa vit ria penso que ele deve tomar uma iniciativa do processo de conversa o com outros setores para construir a paz tenho dito para meus companheiro presidentes da am rica do sul que s h uma forma de o pa s crescer a paz
6476596 n s tivemos um progresso muito bom ao longo da semana e n s tivemos uma boa briga com o bruno e o robert
6476597 mas eu tinha a impress o o sentimento de que amos ganhar uma medalha
6476598 isso um exemplo cl ssico de que a coisa s termina quando acaba porque com a pontua o que eles estavam na nossa frente era uma coisa praticamente imposs vel de acontecer o que aconteceu aquele meio metro que eles perderam para o time franc s deu a medalha de prata para n s
6476599 quer dizer uma li o para a gente tamb m para quando a gente estiver na dianteira com alguns pontos poxa n o pode vacilar um segundo na regata porque tudo pode mudar com essa medal race a coisa fica muito aberta

6476605 fernando showed last year that hes maybe the best striker in the world
6476606 he doesnt need much to score a goal and you almost know before he shoots he will score
6476607 we work very hard as a team and you know we will progress every game and be better
6476608 we have a lot of quality in the team like robbie keane steven gerrard and of course torres so we know if we work hard well get our chances and we have the ability to score in every game
6476609 i think we dont have to look to much to be teams like manchester united or chelsea or arsenal we just have to look at ourselves
6476610 if we can just win our own games the gap will be closer
6476611 the team is getting better and better and the most important thing is to look at ourselves
6476612 he did well but he had already showed his quality in pre season
6476613 late august early september is the peak time for bird and human infections with west nile virus
6476614 while this summers rain has created lots of breeding sites for mosquitoes the lack of heat waves has slowed down west nile virus growth somewhat summer still has a way to go though and west nile virus activity can easily continue to increase please protect yourself from mosquito bites

6476631 i first heard of forgans plans at the senior open championship at dinner with woosie and simon millington having seen the clubs and looked closely into their incredibly accurate online fitting system it was clear that here was an innovative company steeped with an unbelievable history that was going to change the way people buy quality golf clubs at that point i knew this was something i wanted to be involved in
6476632 we are determined to make forgan the most innovative company in golf we cant do that without getting expert advice and guidance from the most knowledgeable people in the industry dj understands all aspects of the game and will work closely with ian woosnam in helping us achieve our goals of producing the finest golf clubs custom fitted to the players exacting standards

6476638 im sure we are going to talk about their military
6476639 we will have to help them rebuild because they are a partner in the war on terror they are going to ask us im sure to replace and rebuild i think that is probably what will happen
6476640 i have no information i cannot confirm or deny that we have no one missing there were no reports of anyone wounded among us trainers
6476641 the air force flew c 130 hercules aircraft many times in iraq carrying just a few passengers or a single pallet of medical goods because that is what the warfighters needed at that moment he said this is not a very efficient use of an aircraft but the warfighters needs come first
6476642 the usd at amp l approved the milestone c decision in an acquisition program baseline dated april 17 2008
6476643 the decision has to be made very soon because if its jacksonville work must start on building the line by year end
6476644 we operated c 27s in panama for years and the benefit doesnt justify the cost
6476645 and we know that the rand report pooh poohs jca for the air force the army needs it but the air force has no business with a two engine aircraft
6476646 instead he wanted effective airlift that is available when he needs it
6476647 the c 27j a rugged reliable airplane and itll do wonders for short range airlift
6476648 the plot continues to thicken on the mystery of the joint cargo aircraft contract
6476649 the c 130 may be too big to adequately support these operations as it generally requires 3 500 5 000 feet of runway to operate in south america and central america for instance only 5 of all airstrips are 5 000 feet or longer in africa only 15 of all airstrips meet this criterion while the air force c 130 community is rightly proud of its ability to operate from unprepared surfaces such as roads or even fields such operations are the exception and not the norm

6476666 what were going to do is a comprehensive sanitization and in fact dismantle the two production lines in question with external supervision to ensure that we can determine the source do some testing if in fact it is there
6476667 i wanted to discuss with the county commission what we might propose to do in the cities and counties to develop some consensus for co supported projects
6476668 our key cities are impacted greatly by what happens with the state highway program
6476669 that would be el dorado augusta andover and even this year rose hill because of looking for possible sources of funding for the butler road cooridor whether its an economic development tool or not these plans always have an impact on the local road system because all transportation begins and ends on a local route
6476670 a significant issue with bridge inspections and repairing bridges is that whatever solution the state comes up with for funding the local government is receiving their share of that
6476671 i think that is a major project that we need to do
6476672 we need to protect that not necessarily in terms of right now building a new highway but developing plans and maybe acquiring right of ways so development can occur along that corridor without impacting our ability to upgrade the freeway
6476673 i dont know right now what your current level of interest is but those were the type of projects that we want to sit down with the cities because they are very important to moving traffic in and out of those communities
6476674 we want to sit down with them see what theyre interested in and if theyre seeking county support then we can see about developing some sort of resolution
6476675 the bridge really hasnt had much going on at all for the last three to four months and a lot of it to do with the contractor and subcontractor getting back into town to finish up the pipe work and actual grading of the road
6476676 they have around 60 working days left to complete both of the projects
6476677 theres a lot of work on the north main bridge theres a lot of the bike path to be put in parking lots paved retaining walls put in lighting on the bridges
6476678 we set out with two main objectives on this event first to safely excavate and search a huge possible crime scene and secondly to recover whatever evidence might be found there
6476679 we have completed the first objective and although we didnt recover any evidence we are confident that this scene can be considered thoroughly examined
6476680 we are grateful for the media exposure in this investigation and our hopes are that the people who have pertinent information about this case will be encouraged to help bring closure to the family for the anguish of their missing son
6476681 one would assume we would have to help them rebuild because they are a partner in the war on terror theyve been helpful they are going to ask us i am sure to replace and rebuild
6476682 i think that assistance is probably going to happen its a matter of how much and how fast
6476683 we need to rebuild the military we need to make them stronger
6476684 we need new people trained and we need new equipment and we will work very closely with the u s to get all of this
6476685 my intent here is to understand better and find out how we can be more helpful if thats needed

6476711 this is something its really too early to talk about but its definitely a possibility
6476712 theres so many possibilities with this thing because what matters now is just the story you want to tell do you have a good story to tell then you can do it because this thing isnt specific to the series you can tell any story with this interface because its entirely contextual

6476737 he is a bloke who is inspirational because he does intimidate and blokes alongside him tend to respond to that
6476738 it is good to have him back but most importantly it is good for him he didnt enjoy watching the last outing and hopefully he brings that grumpiness with him
6476739 you dont need to read too much into that because the volume of game time wont change just the order
6476740 it is not a reflection of ranking so to speak it is the order we are using this week we will be looking to matty to put the afterburners on and well respond to what we see it is a matter of how far he goes it is going to be dry it is going to be fast
6476741 we have got versatility in the mix and in terms of covering fullback ryan cross will do that he has background in that position and he has done well with each opportunity he has got
6476742 at times there it was obvious we took the wrong option a couple of times it was on and we just didnt pull it off so skill execution and wrong options a couple of times there were off but the thing is were having a go
6476743 hes been working the place down im very happy with him
6476744 hes first up and i want to keep him fresh so if its real heavy well keep him for the mcneil at caulfield the following week well delay a decision until race morning
6476745 he handled the heavy in the golden slipper but it hadnt rained for three or four days
6476746 if it stopped raining tonight i may run him but i dont want to be running him on a slop heap which can happen when it rains on the day

6476757 they had a lot of material about being in toronto and being gay and the gay community here
6476758 they also referred me to immigration services where i found out what to do if i have a partner but am not legally married and what the legal mplications are
6476759 we send family relocation services kits to all the departments that request them they customize them and send them to shortlisted candidates and newly appointed faculty
6476760 a letter to all department chairs is sent out every august with a listing of services
6476761 they answered questions like where do i get a sin number and what exactly is that how do i get ohip and what does that mean i didnt know any of these acronyms
6476762 they give the framework so you know what to ask
6476763 the faculty housing program is important because it can help people out while they take a few years to get acquainted with the city and the housing market its also a great way to save some money
6476764 it helps take off a huge pressure of having to find a great family home when you arrive as a new faculty the houses are large well looked after are in a great location and the faculty housing team are really helpful and responsive
6476765 my family and i found faculty housing invaluable in our transition from the u k they provide a great first home in toronto

6476774 but well be different than we were in the pre season cup and they probably cant get much stronger
6476775 its true that we need to work with the game its owners and key commercial partners to ensure players like greg inglis stay in rugby league
6476776 greg will look at his options after this contract we are hopeful people associated with rugby league can put together a package for greg to be suitably remunerated in the game
6476777 thats none of your business the nrl recognises it needs to work with the clubs so that marquee players are recognised how that is done is none of anyone elses business
6476778 generally sponsors have committed to a club or to the league or a broadcast partner
6476779 the idea of them taking on individuals is not something theyve got lots of money for and i guess mark gasnier is a case in point
6476780 very simply greg inglis has stipulated that he does not break contracts whether they are with his club or his manager
6476781 the scale of the failure to plan for britains energy security has been brought into sharp relief by the georgian crisis which underlines the risks of
6476782 potentially hes the best ever convert from rugby league to rugby
6476783 sonny bill is going to be exceptional as a rugby player its that simple
6476784 hes dynamic hes very tough has enough speed for the centres and against saracens he was squeezing balls between players or around them with great off loading
6476785 hell be in the all blacks squad for the 2011 world cup for sure the big intrigue is what route hell take in his best position as inside centre
6476786 id be targeting sonny bill as an overseas player for 2010
6476787 hes box office gold youd imagine hed sign for a new zealand side but you never know the kiwis may be picking test players from off shore by then
6476788 he absolutely smashed our centre kevin sorrell with a shoulder
6476789 hes got the timing but he has to start wrapping the arms or hell keep getting penalised
6476790 scoring pole at bathurst was the point this team started believing we could go all the way we were unlucky last year but we want to give ourselves the best chance to finish what we started
6476791 im just glad steve will still have me after last year
6476792 i made a mistake and i want the chance to wipe it out everyone wants a bathurst win on their cv
6476793 all our planning for the next 12 months will come from the camp
6476794 i think the one thing i want to make clear is we have some really tough cricket coming up before england next year
6476795 we have three massive test series in the next year
6476796 we invited them to see a practical demonstration of the security during two exhibition matches on august 22 and 30 but we have not received any reply
6476797 we are still pressing for that to happen so that doubts can be removed
6476798 i know that there are some expectations to do something before the end of the year
6476799 bridge gaps that maybe its premature to bridge or to reach something which is not the comprehensive agreement that we want to reach
6476800 the pressure the international pressure this can lead to clashes this can lead to misunderstandings this can lead to violence as we had as we faced after camp david 2000 and the circumstances in a way are similar
6476801 were focused on sectors that have the potential to do very well regardless of economic conditions
6476802 the tobacco sector is internationally a great business not at a
6476803 he jumped off the plane and had a barry crocker but games two and three were very good
6476804 he didnt have to be serviced with a lot of the basketball to score 24 and 27 hes very athletic and a very good rebounder we just wanted to get him in for a look during the games against perth and then it will be up to brian to make a decision when he gets back from china
6476805 ebis got a couple of balls in the air but were pretty sure there are some more alluring prizes in ebis lucky dip than what the nbl can offer right now good luck to him but i just dont think we can wait around we had to put plan b into place
6476806 if you look at the last decade theres been an incredible growth of these programs
6476807 show this card at any participating orlando area exxon station to get your free save the tiger poster
6476808 if you look at the numbers the average us household belongs to 12 different loyalty programs but they only use about a third of them
6476809 that means that there is just so much money being invested into these loyalty programs that just sort of fall out of the wallet or end up in the sock drawer to never be used again
6476810 if i make an investment in this program at the end of the day is it going to make me more money
6476811 people dont tend to forget to carry around their credit card but theyll leave most of those 12 loyalty cards at home
6476812 how about combining the two and making it easier for consumers
6476813 the interest that weve seen from the credit card companies they are all very interested in this
6476814 so we know were on to something here and i think theyre looking at us and saying wow this is really the next evolution for consumers
6476815 what were seeing is really more of a trend of hey i usually go to three or four coffee shops if i consolidate my business then maybe ill get a free cup of coffee a week and that really adds up a couple dollars a week especially in this economy is important
6476816 if people get down there on the floor and want to start blowing kazoos and making a scene we want to make sure weve got people who stand in front of them with obama signs

6476818 but if youre like me and you have one house you might have a different perspective
6476819 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6476820 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6476821 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6476822 given these circumstances the university has taken this time to re evaluate the strategic value in devoting such significant resources toward this property and concluded its resources may be better invested in its existing physical plant
6476823 we have always maintained that the purchase is a long term investment decision the fruits of which would not be fully realized for 25 to 50 years
6476824 we have reached a point in this process at which we need to turn our attention toward exploring other strategic initiatives and facilities upgrades to ignore these other priorities while in a long term holding pattern over the high school offer would be fiscally irresponsible and compromise our ability to move the institution forward in the best interests of our students our faculty our staff and our alumni

6476896 i think things look really grim at the moment i think theres a good chance that it will be a while and i mean years before we can get back to where we were before the court order stopped the agreement from being implemented
6476897 but i think as well there are real questions about whether either party negotiating the agreement did enough work with its own constituents
6476898 theres been some fairly bellicose statements coming out of the armed forces
6476899 i think probably both sides would prefer not to have to go back to conflict but what was holding hostilities back was the prospect that peace was at least if not around the corner on the horizon and now its a big question mark

6476936 the financial turbulence we have seen had its immediate origins in the problems in the subprime mortgage market but the effects have been felt in the broader mortgage market and in financial markets more generally with potential consequences for the performance of the overall economy
6476937 more generally investors may have become less willing to assume risk
6476938 some increase in the premiums that investors require to take risk is probably a healthy development on the whole as these premiums have been exceptionally low for some time

6476970 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6476971 this is a sad day for all of professional football the nfl and the entire football world will miss him greatly gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6476972 he was a giant in the nfl since entering the league in 1967 first as a hall of fame offensive lineman then as an active member of the collective bargaining process in the late 1970s and early 1980s and finally as executive director of the nflpa gene continually served in the best interests of the game of football he played a colossal role in the success the nfl enjoys today even more than many people realize
6476973 gene was one of the most important figures in sports history he brought freedom to the players he was a rock for the national football league he was a man of great courage and strength he was a great human being there are so many superlatives regarding gene upshaw its hard to do him justice
6476974 gene was an incredible leader for anybody that knows anything about nfl locker rooms obviously there are a lot of egos in there each team elects a player representative so theres a little bit of ego built into that position as well what gene was able to do was bring together all those voices in one room and lead them and convince them that their own personal agendas werent necessarily what was best for the union and that the union always needed to consider past present and future it was an honor to work with him
6476975 when you have a situation particularly in the modern era of union versus management theres some elements of that that are always going to be adversarial but the one thing that you want in all those that make them productive are trust and respect i think that everyone on the management side had that for gene upshaw
6476976 i have great respect for gene i think he brought the players association to a point where its recognized as probably as good a union as there is in all of sport in all of life probably

6476980 once the tv can handle todays polarized 3d glasses the technology will take off in a big way
6476981 the 3d tools used today have largely been created internally inside the studios
6476982 eliminating the cost of developing these tools will really help

6477000 satellite radio providers sirius and xm have retained end to end control of their value chain from hardware to content this has allowed them to develop an entire ecosystem with the freedom to push through proprietary broadcast and receiver standards

6477002 we are going to execute on the eds acquisition and we are going to bring the strength of hps operating discipline the strength of hps innovation the strength of hps position in the marketplace to make a combined business that we think will be quite competitive
6477003 as weve seen in the last few weeks currency rates can be at times volatile
6477004 if the dollar remains where it is today there will be downward pressure on our revenue but we will be able to come in on our earnings per share range

6477006 the imaging amp printing group was the only segment that missed our revenue and operating income targets a sign of lengthening lifecycles in the slower macro environment

6477008 we believe the acquisition and integration of eds should help hp manage the macroeconomic storm better than others
6477009 we see room for significant operating leverage particularly in fiscal 2010 regardless of economic conditions
6477010 the plan is going well and we are confident in the benefits this business combination will bring to customers partners and shareholders
6477011 the feedback from the vast majority of the customers that i talk to continues to be extremely positive as they contemplate the power of hps innovation coupled with eds scaled services business

6477014 we link up with them and do joint patrols and give them some instruction get them used to working with locals and get people used to seeing them down here
6477015 the biggest thing here is getting out with the anbp letting the people see them get them trusting and working with the anbp if we are guests in the area and they only see us it doesnt quite seem like we are guests if we are accompanied by anbp we are perceived more as guests and partnering with them helps establish the government out here
6477016 im tasked with supervising the training of the anbp and what ive done is come up with a campaign plan on what i want them to learn and on what i want the marines to focus on until we are out of here
6477017 they are all willing to work ive built a special relationship with the platoon sergeant for this group of guys his name is nassar ahmad and his guys want to work they are real proud of what they do
6477018 especially patrols while driving and while hiking we learned we need to train more because the marines have techniques for patrols we hope to learn we like it
6477019 i enjoy being able to work with the marines its a good chance to work together and bring peace and security to afghanistan and its people they the insurgents are a big problem for us the border patrol and marines
6477020 the first day we started the job we had problems like we needed weapons supplies clothes boots and these things the marines and coalition forces help us they give us what they can
6477021 every time they come out they improve so the only challenge i have is me not being able to tell that platoon sergeant of that police officer what i want done i have to do it through a linguist
6477022 on yesterdays patrol i was watching some of the police officers take their own initiative to stop vehicles and turn them around like we briefed before we stepped off the things we are briefing are sticking and they are learning that is one of my goals that i wanted to hit
6477023 we are trying to get them into intelligence gathering from the local people and information operations sending messages out because they dont get a lot of news from the rest of the country so we are trying to get them to pass out news we also want them more involved with civil military operations like handing out chow clothing for children and school supplies
6477024 we were kind of overwhelmed by how much they didnt know then we got another group and these guys have been nothing but good things for us
6477025 from what ive seen and from what ive heard the locals are happy the trust hasnt always been there with the anbp and we are building it slowly the locals are happy to see these guys it puts an afghanistan face to what is being accomplished down here
6477026 people are coming up to talk to us telling us there is enemy activity in the area before they were afraid to tell us for fear of the insurgents coming in at night the night letters they are telling us these things because they know were out there and that the marines and anbp care enough to provide security for them
6477027 to serve my people and to protect my land and my people
6477028 people are happy when they see us together and they know that its a sign of afghanistan that we have the coalition forces like the marines to keep the area safe they like the idea of us working together
6477029 they are very similar in that they want their country to be safe they want to control the area they want to work down here and they are very excited to be able to come down and patrol with us i think having those guys just like in iraq was essential to controlling the area as long as we get those guys working with us and the more of them we get the quicker we can work ourselves out of a job
6477030 they speak the same language and once we leave the area they will be the ones controlling it so the more we can get those guys out with us the more influence they will have the more trust is built and the more the government is established down here
6477031 we wont always be in this country eventually we will be leaving the afghanistan national police and anbp will be here all we want to do is leave that lasting impression they can refer back to it and say this is how the marines did it and it worked maybe we can do the same thing they have a lot of pride lets see what they do from here

6477048 reacting to weak sales and declining profitability panel suppliers began to slash their utilization rates starting in july
6477049 lcd tv and desktop pc monitor manufacturers also are starting to cut their prices to reduce inventories and boost end user demand these developments along with recovering demand from the notebook segment will bring stabilization to large sized lcd panel pricing in september some panel prices may even increase by 1 to 3 percent especially those that reach at par or below the cost levels

6477091 judge otoole said he disagreed with the basic premise of the mbtas argument that the students presentation was likely a violation of the computer fraud and abuse act a 1986 federal law meant to protect computers from malicious attacks such as worms and viruses

6477097 senator obama has asked for nearly a billion dollars in earmarked pork barrel projects and he rails against lobbyists ive never taken a single one
6477098 i point out what my record is which is one that has not won me miss congeniality over the years people want change in america we all know that and very legitimately so
6477099 lobbyists dont come to my office because they know theyre not going to be an earmark they know theyre not going to get a pork barrel project senator obamas gotten lots of em
6477100 as long as you have earmarking and pork barrel spending and bridges to nowhere and money for dna of bears in montana and museums and all that then youre going to have lobbyists
6477101 so its kind of entertaining to me to attack the lobbyists rather than the source of the problem which is the earmark theyd all be out of business most of em would be out of business if we stopped pork barrel and earmark spending
6477102 i have and continue to question his judgment whether it be his initial reaction to the russian invasion of georgia or whether it be his failure to acknowledge that the surge has succeeded or his opposition to nuclear power among others so i question the judgment i dont question the patriotism
6477103 im sure that if senator obama were president of the united states if the american people chose him to be their president that he would act as a president who would get my full and complete support
6477104 we have been and are working closely with the obama campaign to make sure we have an exciting and unified convention

6477126 just how would paul mccartney handle a situation like russias ongoing aggression in georgia
6477127 people are afraid its like fear creates this veil of impossibility and it is hanging over all of our heads
6477128 and the problem with fear is that it cuts us off fear is the worst enemy it cuts us off from one another and our own families and our communities and it has certainly cut us off from the rest of the world we dont know our neighbors we dont talk we believe that our pain is our own we dont realize that the struggles and challenges of all of us are the same we are too isolated
6477129 when you dont have much when you know how precious life is even in the worst state you are afraid to give up what you have for fear that something different will be worse but the truth of the matter is things have gotten worse
6477130 and folks are struggling like never before working harder than ever believing that their hard work will lead to some reward some payoff but what they find is that they get there and the bar has changed things are different wasnt enough so you have to work even harder
6477131 you work and you struggle you do everything that they say and you think youre getting close to the bar and youre working hard and youre sacrificing and then you get to the bar youre right there youre reaching out for the bar you think you have it and then what happens they move the bar they raise it up they shift it to the left and to the right its always just quite out of reach
6477132 you dont have time to get to know your neighbor you dont have time to reach out and have conversations to share stories in fact you feel very alone in your struggle because you feel that somehow it must be your fault that youre struggling so hard everybody else must be doing okay i must be doing something wrong so you hide
6477133 when your worlds not right no matter how hard you work then you become afraid of everyone and everything because you dont know whose fault it is why you cant get a handle on life
6477134 on top of all the other worries that families have now theyre worried about education teachers dont have the resources to teach
6477135 my father like most americans just wanted to know that after a lifetime of hard work and sacrifice that one day he could put his feet up and look over all that he had done and retire with a little respect and dignity thats all most americans want but the truth is right now that little nugget of a dream that was my life is getting further and further out of reach for most americans
6477136 throughout my life i have been told that i could have it all and the truth of the matter is that you cant we have to lift up our voices in these places of business and demand that ceos and owners of large companies take the necessary steps to make sure that women like me can continue to work and raise our families and be good parents and mothers
6477137 rebellion for me is articulating my views trying to be honest about what i see i dont think a lot of people in the public arena do that because why are people so amazed when i do
6477138 my father like most americans just wanted to know that after a lifetime of hard work and sacrifice that one day he could put his feet up and look over all that he had done and retire with a little respect and dignity
6477139 we spend between the two kids on extracurriculars outside the classroom were spending about 10 000 a year on piano and dance and sports supplements and summer programs do you know what summer camp costs
6477140 you work and you struggle you do everything that they say and you think youre getting close to the bar and youre working hard and youre sacrificing and then you get to the bar youre right there youre reaching out for the bar you think you have it and then what happens they move the bar they raise it up they shift it to the left and to the right its always just quite out of reach
6477141 believe it or not there is an edible compound consumed by the great majority of americans that we think is harmless but in fact over the years causes great harm to us anyone know what it is
6477142 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on
6477143 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist
6477144 obviously though mccain is a racist and this is all just a distraction from the fact that mccain started a war in georgia
6477145 any university that allows a radical or cop killer rapists or any such crinimals give speeches while excluding conservatives should have their entire goverment funding cut off
6477146 yes barry i think senator mccain knows exactly what hes dealing with here and pretty soon a whole lot of us citizens will know too
6477147 bill ayers ive said this his father was a great friend of my father
6477148 people keep trying to align him with barack obama its really unfortunate theyre friends so what people do make mistakes in the past you move on this is a new century a new time he reflects back and hes been making a strong contribution to our community

6477157 when i asked gore vidal at dinner why the white house seemed so serene and at ease about the vote he replied that this time around the bush cheney henchmen could simply call on martial law he glumly noted that we are so far down the road toward totalitarianism that even if democrats do win back the congress it would take at least two generations before the last six years of damage to the nation could be reversed gore frankly despaired that any amount of time could ever return the country to where and what it previously was this prediction left me reaching for some fernet branca

6477211 this hadith speaks about three matters and in doing so it brings together everything that good manners entail with respect to both word and deed
6477212 o you who believe fear allah and speak a word that is right he will set right for you your deeds and forgive you your sins and whoever obeys allah and his messenger has certainly attained a great achievement
6477213 no good is there in much of their private conversation except for those who enjoin charity or that which is right or bring reconciliation between people and whoever does that seeking allahs pleasure then we shall grant him a great reward
6477214 shall i inform you of the foundation of all of that
6477215 o prophet of allah are we held to task for the things that we say
6477216 may your mother be bereaved of you o mu dh does anything topple people headlong into the hellfire save the harvests of their tongues
6477217 allah does not like that evil should be mentioned in public except by one who has been done injustice and allah is all hearing all knowing
6477218 he does not utter a statement except that there is an observer by him ready to record it
6477219 indeed a servant will speak a word pleasing to allah that he thinks to be insignificant but because of it allah raises him by many degrees and indeed a servant will speak a word displeasing to allah that he thinks to be insignificant but because of it he will consign him to the hellfire
6477220 a man might speak a word without thinking about its implications but because of it he will plunge into the hellfire further than the distance between the east and west
6477221 this hadith encourages us to guard our tongues a person who wants to speak should think upon what he is about to say before he utters it if it then shows itself to have some benefit to it he may speak it otherwise he should refrain from doing so
6477222 worship allah and associate nothing with him and show kindness to parents relatives orphans the poor the near neighbor the distant neighbor the companion at your side the traveler and those whom your right hands possess indeed allah does not like those who are conceited and boastful
6477223 gabriel continued to impress upon me the rights of the neighbor until i thought that he would soon confer upon him the right of inheritance
6477224 he is not a believer who lets himself be satiated while his neighbor goes hungry
6477225 none of you should prevent his neighbor from placing his rafter in his wall
6477226 o muslim women none of you should consider insignificant a gift that you give to your neighbor even if it is but the trotters of a sheep
6477227 whoever believes in allah and the last day should show hospitality to his guest according to his right
6477228 oil is the driver and then it depends on a series of other factors that are kind of like magnifiers

6477242 nascar gave them a bunch of considerations from a parameter point of view a dimension point of view that was outside the box in terms of what the ford engine was
6477243 so nascar in the interest of fairness and balance in the competition from a potential point of view after they went to great lengths to be able to check the engines to find out what they were doing decided that they needed to rein toyota in and thats what they did
6477244 the error wasnt ours for getting behind the error was in what toyota offered and what nascar approved
6477245 the minimum being suspension for the remainder of the season for those involved including our two nationwide series crew chiefs
6477246 theyre still going to be at the shop putting together some race cars and doing all the work that they need to do to keep the stuff up to par were just going to have different guys here at the race track to crew chief during the race
6477247 there is little time left to get a solid negotiating text on the table clearly the clock is ticking
6477248 people in a burning house cannot afford to lose time in an argument

6477256 they should have interviewed somebody who is currently a member of the congregation in order to get a fairer picture
6477257 whats becoming quite apparent is that the way you actually have an impact on health development and is when people adopt certain behaviours
6477258 its just a matter of getting them to understand that what is a long established habit is in fact harmful and that you can do something about it
6477259 we actually use shame we go into communities and say to people do you realise how fecally contaminated your community is
6477260 we do walks of shame where you take a group of people and you walk around and you say look heres some human faeces
6477261 and you do this community mapping where everybody comes and says where they defecate
6477262 and you get them to realise how disgusting this is to live in an environment that is totally contaminated
6477263 and once they start using a toilet even if its just a pit latrine they refuse to go back to open defecation so they begin to climb the sanitation ladder
6477264 families were spending money on treating diarrhoea and other diseases but would not spend money on installing a toilet because they expected to be given money for that by aid groups
6477265 its not like we are wealthy people but theyll kidnap you for a watch everyone is living in fear
6477266 before they only kidnapped key well known economically successful people like industrialists and landowners now they are kidnapping people from the middle class

6477269 efficient tool to mechanize certain mundane and repetitive examination functions
6477270 weve been very pleased to work with complianceease on this initiative this has far reaching implications for the way regulators and financial institutions will be able to approach what has been in the past a time consuming and cost prohibitive process
6477271 technology and automated solutions have become essential elements for csbs to leverage as we seek new ways to standardize and improve regulatory supervision while streamlining the examination process for institutions and for regulators complianceease has helped us to achieve a very specific goal of our improving mortgage industry supervision through collaboration and technology initiative
6477272 we are very excited to be working with csbs and state regulators on the examination automation initiative the goal is to achieve efficiency effectiveness uniformity and standardization while reducing the cost and burden to regulators and the industry
6477273 financial institutions know that they need to be prepared for major regulatory changes and tougher regulations in the near future its critically important for institutions to determine the best regulatory strategies particularly given the present economic landscape

6477276 our goal is to provide new housing for current residents of south gate and to offer an opportunity for young people to purchase homes near their families and become residents of the community where they grew up
6477277 tierra del rey realizes our vision for urban redevelopment that supports the dreams and aspirations of the people who live in underserved communities like south gate
6477278 we know that families dont think of their homes as housing and we dont think of our work as projects but as communities
6477279 thats why we take the time to create the high quality workforce housing
6477280 budgets are more restrictive but we add value with an inventive design approach using common materials in uncommon ways paying attention to scale and detail
6477281 we provide more than architecture we create a sense of possibility
6477282 despite the substantial slowdown in the suburban housing markets we strongly believe there is a continued shortage of urban housing alternatives for working families in los angeles and orange counties and we are focusing our initial efforts on developing housing for that deserving demographic
6477283 by providing housing for working families at the same time we will be revitalizing many of the southlands older established urban communities

6477285 we need to be realistic about what we can and cant do with hydrogen right now

6477288 the sight of a feather in a peacocks tail whenever i gaze at it makes me sick
6477289 how can this trait be made in one gender and not the other
6477290 males and females basically have the same set of genes so how do you specifically modify the activity of a males genes but not a females genes
6477291 the flies did not need new genes to make a new pattern
6477292 they just changed how males and females use a common set of genes
6477293 the switch existed for tens of millions of years because it had a different job
6477294 but it got remodeled evolution is a cumulative process you have this machinery and its easy to add a bell or a whistle with this particular trait it evolved by exploiting genetic information that was already there to make male bodies different from female bodies
6477295 we have enough evidence to believe this evolved in a male specific way
6477296 if female tastes change these traits go away there is no reinforcement
6477297 as long as the gain outweighs the cost the feature will survive the fruit flys color pattern is a paradigm for understanding how to use the same sets of genes in different sexes to come up with different features
6477298 its an entire generation thats been lost in the shuffle and its a generation thats very different from the one before it and the one after
6477299 its also the first generation that is smaller than the one before it
6477300 the lucky few between the greatest generation and the baby boom
6477301 but after the war those tough times evaporated and the reality exceeded their expectations so they felt really lucky
6477302 theyre healthier living longer and retiring earlier while the younger generations pay for their social security benefits
6477303 birth and fortune the impact of numbers on personal welfare
6477304 no matter who you are you can define yourself as part of a generation
6477305 the circumstances of your generation may help make sense of the way your life has gone you can see the broader currents that have shaped your life the lucky few just happened to have a smoother ride
6477306 he was supposed to pray for me but instead he threw himself on top of me and knocked me to the ground
6477307 it is like compacting your entire wardrobe into a shoebox
6477308 what takes care of neutralizing dna to allow chromosomes to condense
6477309 did dinoflagellates once have histones and then lost them or did dinoflagellates never have histones and just figured out a different way to fold large amounts of dna into chromosomes
6477310 chromosomes would fall apart when calcium and magnesium were removed
6477311 cations play a very important role in the folding and charge neutralization of dna in all eukaryotes but more so in dinoflagellates
6477312 i find it truly amazing that in all other eukaryotes histones help in this charge neutralization and dinoflagellates constitute the only exception to this nearly universal rule it looks like this may have been the first and very efficient step toward the goal of neutralizing dna long before histones came into play

6477320 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6477321 in the past weve usually had flooding in pockets i have not seen anything this widespread throughout the county

6477329 our results appear to demonstrate that vigabatrin induced satiety in these animals
6477330 given the growing obesity epidemic we felt that examining vigabatrins therapeutic efficacy for obesity was particularly relevant
6477331 the fact that these results occurred in genetically obese animals offers hope that this drug could potentially treat severe obesity

6477349 howard was gonna speak his mind and he didnt have a problem playing the devils advocate taking the other side just to see if you really believe what you say you believe

6477417 a violent education corporal punishment of children in us public schools
6477418 every public school needs effective methods of discipline but beating kids teaches violence and it doesnt stop bad behavior
6477419 corporal punishment discourages learning fails to deter future misbehavior and at times even provokes it
6477420 minority students in public schools already face barriers to success
6477421 by exposing these children to disproportionate rates of corporal punishment schools create a hostile environment in which these students may struggle even more
6477422 every public school needs effective methods of discipline but beating kids teaches violence and it doesnt stop bad behavior
6477423 he took me into the office and gave me three licks he made me hold onto the wall and he paddled me it hurt for about two hours it felt like fire under my butt
6477424 the other kids were watching and laughing it made me want to fight them when you get a paddling and you see everyone laugh at you it make you mad and you want to do something about it
6477425 what made me so angry hes three years old he was petrified he didnt want to go back to school and he didnt want to start his new school i was so worried that this was going to constantly be with him equating going to school with being paddled
6477426 i went into the principals office he gave me a chair and said hold onto the chair the paddle had holes in it then he just did three swats i was hit on my buttocks there were holes in the paddle to make it go faster it hurt very much there were definitely red marks and then swelling almost welt like markings it didnt last for more than a couple days it left me feeling very humiliated i think there were several levels of emotion physical pain mental humiliation and being a female at that age it was like there was this older man hitting me on the butt thats weird even at that age i knew it was inappropriate
6477427 ive heard this said at my school and at other schools this child should get less whips itll leave marks students that are dark skinned it takes more to let their skin be bruised even with all black students there is an imbalance darker skinned students get worse punishment
6477428 i see corporal punishment as a form of slavery beating on the slaves was how the headman got them to do something were focused so much on making kids do what we want think about the mental capacity that this kind of treatment leaves our children with we are telling them we dont respect them they leave that principals office and they think they dont consider me a human being that young person loses self respect

6477462 when you start the season against a club with a big tradition with young players as arsenal do it makes it all the more exciting
6477463 its one of the few fixtures where we take the lads down their on friday and we stay overnight so its giving the boys a flavour of what it would be like if they were in and around the first team
6477464 a number of the boys will be foreign so it will be a local flavour against a foreign flavour
6477465 were not going to use the fact that some of our boys are not with us as an excuse because we would hope that we have players who can emulate the success of the players that have made the step up
6477466 we have a couple of injuries to lee mcardle and shane duffy
6477467 it hasnt gone too well in terms of results i think weve lost two against teams that we should have done well against but the results dont matter pre season one of the results we actually gave all of our under 17s a game

6477506 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors

6477517 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
6477518 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to insure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
6477519 i just felt like i had to stand up for the kids heather wanted to do this and i had to back her
6477520 i think a shirt that says i support gays is very different from a shirt that says gays are going to hell
6477521 one can be very disruptive for a childs self esteem the other supports other people and their ideas
6477522 what happens when these kids get out in the real world after they leave ponce de leon and they have a black homosexual supervisor at their job
6477523 i emphasize that daviss personal and religious views about homosexuality are not issues in this case indeed daviss opinions and views are consistent with the beliefs of many in holmes county in florida and in the country
6477524 where davis went wrong was when he endeavored to silence the opinions of his dissenters
6477525 david davis is a fine man and good principal and we are a gentle peaceful christian family oriented community

6477595 funds should be better used to support graduate students in china whose pay is too low
6477596 the biggest problem for top scientists who have returned is the lack of postdocs
6477597 all the phds i train go abroad to do postdocs
6477598 this should not become a routine for the government to decide specific projects
6477599 the institute has done extremely well in 5 years far exceeding my expectations
6477600 the success of nibs is a bright spot of the past several years
6477601 in the next 25 years chinese scientists will become major contributors to the advancement of life sciences throughout the world
6477602 it is possible that salesforce coms business is simply becoming more seasonal as it increasingly addresses large enterprise wide deployments and will hinge more upon large sequential increases in fourth quarter billings
6477603 we are concerned that smbs which make up 2 3 of salesforces customer base may suffer more markedly than their larger counterparts amid any ongoing economic weakness and that this may in turn impact salesforces bookings new and renewal and ultimately salesforces top line
6477604 indeed salesforce appears to have had some softness in its deferred revenues and bookings in the quarter perhaps giving fuel to this concern

6477651 its a pretty different team to the test side and a lot of lads have come in wanting to impress and cement spots within the side so theres a freshness about the squad

6477658 hes won his only test and in the past week or so theres been a really nice feel about the camp
6477659 kevins taken to the job really well he was really enthusiastic about doing it and i dont see why he cant be a successful captain for a while
6477660 hes stamping his own character onto the job weve seen the way he plays and hes bringing that into his captaincy and bringing that into the team a little bit as well
6477661 hes confident hes single minded hes an aggressive bloke and his team especially in the last test match also played like that and i wouldnt be surprised if the same thing happens in the one dayers

6477823 what ia the difference between tcp ip model and osi model
6477824 on any given night its a matter of the little things
6477825 and tonight we just couldnt buy a hit when we needed to the reality is japan was the better team tonight
6477826 we felt like we were on them all game long it was only going to take an inning or two to make something happen
6477827 we just couldnt get that big hit we got people in scoring position we did our job that way and then we just couldnt capitalize
6477828 im not every hitter i know at the plate we struggled our pitching wasnt quite on point like it has been but you know what we came out and gave it everything we had

6477852 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
6477853 this reminds me of greg oden playing against high school basketball players
6477854 todd is a veteran hes got total command of what we are doing hes been very accurate making good decisions and were giving him a lot of responsibility on the line of scrimmage
6477855 he just looks the part of that returning quarterback from a good team
6477856 from what i understand about his ability his desire and his work ethic i would think hell see the field
6477857 chris had been the starting quarterback for a couple of years
6477858 being able to get along with him was very important chris did a good job of handling everything and i tried to go in and do the best i could and help the team out i contributed as much as i could
6477859 i know hes a great player and can do a lot of great things
6477860 hes very very fast and i know he really wants to learn and become a complete player i think history speaks for itself with florida and lsu the last two years if it works out for us lets use it
6477861 he told todd i cant wait to come learn from you
6477862 terrelle has kind of become his shadow he has a real passion to learn from todd boeckman
6477863 you cant turn the ball over and i know i had at least 14 last year
6477864 i think terrelle and joe are going to give us a little bit more depth than weve had at quarterback
6477865 it will be interesting because this is a different era and there was so much attention
6477866 im as interested to see what happens as everybody else

6477870 muito importante salientar que essa extradi o vem em curso de um exame t cnico profundo jur dico feito pelo minist rio da justi a que recomendou que a extradi o fosse realizada
6477871 yesterday john mccain was asked again what do you think about the economy he said i think the economy is fundamentally strong
6477872 now this puzzled me i was confused what he meant but then there was another interview where somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have and he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and they said at least four at least four now think about that i guess if you think that being rich means you make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then it is not surprising that you think the economy is fundamentally strong but if you are like me and youve got one house or if you are like the millions of people struggling now to keep up with your mortgage payments you might have a different perspective by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes
6477873 there is just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america and you dont have to be a nobel prize laureate economist
6477874 you just have to have a little bit of sense to understand that we cannot go through the same eight years of the failed economic policies that george bush has put in place
6477875 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6477876 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people
6477877 seven houses and heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6477878 some of you saw the saddleback forum where john mccain was asked what was rich and he said i dont know maybe if you make 5 million 5 million then you are rich which i guess means if you are only making 3 million a year you are middle class
6477879 i guess thats what he meant his top economic adviser said the other day that americans should stop complaining that theyve become a nation of whiners that all these economic policies we are talking about is a mental recession that if you just changed your mind you would be ok
6477880 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president
6477881 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp

6477911 senator mccain you are exceedingly proud of being a political maverick you wear it as a badge of honor well poke the base of the republican party the conservatives in the eye one more time by choosing a pro abortion vice presidential candidate and conservatives will show you that two can play the maverick game

6477914 main criteria would be a person that would allow us to sleep at night knowing that we had selected someone that could immediately be president of the united states
6477915 he will select the person that is best and if that person happens to be among other things pro choice the party will support that
6477916 perhaps you could say that you are concerned for her and that you dont want to see her end up with fines etc

6477929 we expect the water level to go down further to 204 metres by friday once that happens we can safely declare the situation out of danger
6477930 this is a coalition government i am giving congress point of view if government has the proof we do endorse its stand
6477931 he threw a kick and i threw a kick and in my humble opinion i thought it should have been 1 1

6477933 i am going to start training for 2012 and hopefully i will get my gold medal then
6477934 we call for an immediate end to the ongoing political drama of arithmetic manipulation through horse trading
6477935 while the people were overwhelmed by spiralling prices the upa government and the independent ministers and mlas had been overwhelmed by a game of power politics
6477936 instead of mitigating the problems of the people they are submerged in power play
6477937 we have repeatedly conveyed to the indian and world leaders that if the ongoing talks between india and pakistan fail to resolve kashmir issue the kashmiris will be compelled to head for another revolution but nobody listened to us at that time
6477938 today the situation is before everyone kashmiris have once again taken peaceful and democratic way to struggle for freedom
6477939 even children are raising their voice in support of freedom this is the democratic referendum and should be honoured
6477940 opening of all routes is the need of the hour
6477941 we have a bronze medal match to go for we will play hard to win it it is the olympics we are not here to have fun
6477942 it is my last time to coach in the olympics i will retire after the games so it is very important for me
6477943 we had a good start and put a lot of pressure in the field generally speaking we played very well but it is very disappointing that we cannot fight for a gold medal now
6477944 the match was dominated by australia in the second half the most important thing for us was to make attacks
6477945 there is a clear instruction from the high command and also state leadership that backward class leaders should be promoted in all districts and they will given top priority
6477946 my desire is to see that more than one third of the assembly candidates are from weaker sections our mission is to come back to power in the next years assembly elections

6477948 we all are really happy to receive such response from our audience the hard work has really paid off
6477949 though ratings given by trade analysts and media count the verdict given by the audience is more important their appreciation motivates us to come up with new package of innovative ideas
6477950 our expectations and its time to celebrate its success we have proved ourselves by connecting with the audiences
6477951 the masses have related themselves to the characters though my role was small but small things comes in good packages
6477952 if xbox live were a state it would rank as the countrys seventh largest giving it approximately 20 electoral votes

6477958 new drilling has to be part of our energy solution it will not solve this problem alone alternative energy will not solve this problem alone conservation will not solve this problem alone solving our energy crisis requires an all of the above approach
6477959 it will require aggressive development of alternative energies like wind solar tidal and biofuels it also requires expanding traditional sources of energy like clean coal nuclear power and offshore drilling like that done on this rig
6477960 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6477961 is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6477962 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks
6477963 behind all of these claims and positions by sen obama lies the ambition to be president whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief
6477964 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain
6477965 when i look out at this audience i see people of different political views you are democrats and republicans and independents but you all served together and fought together and bled together under the same proud flag you did not serve a red america or a blue america you served the united states of america
6477966 my car has been sitting for three months so it needed a little work
6477967 i wouldnt want that to become a mockery of itself
6477968 we may do it again if we feel like it but this time around we wanted people to focus on the music and not the spectacle
6477969 it felt good to be able to go back between then and now on tour and see the reception and acknowledgment of both records not just the first one it allowed us to sort of bear witness to our fans it felt like the bond with the fans solidified this time around
6477970 we have a pretty diversified portfolio but i do believe thats a first for us
6477971 more than just trying to do something new we were trying to do things we didnt get to completely do on the first record
6477972 we went in with a lot more self awareness and certainty this time we knew what we were doing
6477973 its not something thats very introspective its usually a reenactment of whatever experience im addressing its something i survived or something that rings true to me as a common experience its never so personal that it cant pertain to someone elses life if its about pain ultimately pain is pain to everyone
6477974 that was unconscionable to do we didnt even try i think people wouldve been disappointed if we had people might initially miss that theres not a big hit record on there like crazy but if there was any failed attempt at that magnitude of a song again it wouldve spoiled an otherwise solid album
6477975 i was so used to moderacy over my 15 year career so it was surprising
6477976 but at the same time i was poised for it by that point i did feel like it was well earned and deserved and instead of causing me to be frantic or panicked i could be more like steel and just bask in the moment of it
6477977 i was misquoted once saying i didnt like billys version
6477978 i always try to correct that i grew up to billy idol he was like the first image of a true rock star to me in my life i loved billy idol so actually i was very proud of that

6477985 i dont think there is another industry like this industry
6477986 its so strongly relationship driven because its filled within independent contractors its a parade without a leader its a fun place to be during good times and during bad times
6477987 im a great believer in capitalism i dont really like regulations too much but i think the logic of returning to some old ways of doing business would be helpful at this point the value of having local community banks that lend on value in their community was one of things that kept the business vital and logical the further we get from local real estate business the more difficult and more regulated its going to need to be
6477988 they need to learn to work with reluctant buyers and difficult sellers all over again
6477989 last and not least the industry has not learned how to celebrate this market in other words we are all happy when its going up but the market offers great opportunity for buyers the industry seems glum about that fact
6477990 what is it that the consumer is experiencing when they go to real estate web sites today and what would it take to have a better experience thats the question that needs to be answered
6477991 in a nutshell ed is one of the most creative and original thinkers in the entire industry
6477992 im always fascinated to hear his take on the business in general or on a new product nor is his thinking purely theoretical ed is able to absorb and evaluate new ideas and often be the first to successfully bring them to market
6477993 anybody who is moving toward developing a consumer experience is going to be a leader in the business we have been in a 10 year battle over content real estate information i think that battle is over and we are going to need to learn how to present context not content
6477994 although the industry is going through very difficult spasms right now this is probably the best time for a startup it gives the opportunity to work from the bottom up instead of coming into a fast industry most of the industry leaders came in a bad market most brokers need to continue to experiment go forward and not just freeze up and hold onto what they have tech innovators will continue to come and they will add value to the industry
6477995 several years ago when i first began working here ed had a phrase that he used quite often wiifm it means whats in it for me he used this acronym internally because he wanted us to become a company that understood the needs and wants of the consumer he knew that the internet was changing the tide and that if we could help our agents to become consumer centric they would ultimately succeed because they would get and retain clients for life
6477996 i have six children and very little time for hobbies
6477997 i am very passionate about gardening and maintaining a green lifestyle i grow 20 varieties of bananas passion fruit and taro
6477998 i am very proud of this work and my familys involvement and commitment
6477999 it is a new adventure for me and is currently published in five cities oakland denver seattle hartford and long beach with 30 other cities under contract to produce magazines
6478000 ive known ed for a long time more than 20 years
6478001 ive always admired him as a competitor and enjoyed working with him to address the challenges of our industry he is a visionary person who is adept at strategic thinking and problem solving
6478002 i have been given so much by this industry that i cannot figure out how to retire
6478003 i do want to give back for what i have been given
6478004 yes you are see that pole in the middle of the room if this was your church and once you recognized it as a distraction you would want someone to remove it immeidatley and if they didnt do it fast enough you would do it yourself

6478013 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us
6478014 this year we certainly have had parents asking more questions
6478015 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6478016 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6478017 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6478018 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6478019 these cases resulted primarily from failure to vaccinate many because of philosophical or religious belief
6478020 this is the lowest percentage of imported measles cases since 1996

6478072 of the 95 patients eligible for vaccination 63 were unvaccinated because of their or their parents philosophical or religious beliefs
6478073 increases in the proportion of the population declining vaccination for themselves or their children might lead to large scale outbreaks in the united states

6478087 texas is scheduled today to execute a mentally ill man for conspiracy to murder in a case that death penalty opponents say illustrates why the practice is deeply flawed jeffery lee wood 35 has never taken a human life by his own hands and was outside the building in a car at the time of the murder his lawyers said in a statement woods partner in crime daniel reneau was executed in 2002 for killing a store manager during a robbery at reneaus trial the prosecution had argued that reneau was the person chiefly responsible for the crime and that woods role was secondary the death penalty information centre said wood was involved in the robbery in this case because of his longstanding mental illness that allowed him to be easily manipulated by the principal actor daniel reneau his lawyers argued texas is the top executioner in the united states with 413 executions over the last 30 years out of a national total of 1 119 for that period it is also one of the few us states that permit capital punishment in a case involving conspiracy to murder not murder itself seven people were executed for conspiracy after 1976 when the death penalty was reauthorised in the united states but wood will be the first to die since 1996 executing someone who didnt kill violates the most basic principles of justice david fathi us program director at human rights watch said in a statement in right leaning texas support for the death penalty and the states tough law and order approach remains high advocates argue the punishment is just deters crime and provides comfort to victims families ambiguity surrounding mental illness also makes woods case controversial woods lawyers asked the governor of texas to delay woods execution by one month after he had been in solitary confinement on death row for 10 years 23 hours a day to evaluate his mental health in 1986 the supreme court effectively banned executing anyone too mentally ill to understand what was to happen to them and why but it did not establish criteria for evaluating mental competency if a person is only mentally ill and not incompetent the decisions are less clear and are up to individual judgments by the governor or the jury richard dieter director of the death penalty information centre told afp in march 2008 richard taylor condemned to death for murdering a prison guard 27 years earlier when he was gravely afflicted with schizophrenia had his death penalty commuted to life in prison in the southern state of tennessee but kelsey patterson was executed in texas in may 2004 despite having been diagnosed with paranoia and schizophrenia prior to his criminal act the pennsylvania supreme court recently authorised the state penal system to administer by force if necessary psychotropic medicine to two convicts on death row to render them mentally competent and subject to execution the case of raymond riles on death row since april 2 1976 more than 32 years is emblematic of the ambiguity surrounding mentally ill inmates his execution was delayed three times and after 1986 the texas department of criminal justice never set a new date for it but he is still on death row
6478088 the goal will give me confidence for the season and hopefully i can get more goals in the coming games
6478089 theres a lot of competition for places especially up front and all i can say is thats got to be good for the club
6478090 the problem for us is the international week because that kills the momentum of the team
6478091 its not as good as if you can stay together work as a team and build for the weekend so it will be tough but its the same for every club and a lot of players are going to be away
6478092 its part and parcel of being in the top league and all clubs have to deal with it we just have to keep working hard
6478093 its a massive advantage playing at home the fans will be right behind us and we are looking forward to the everton game as we are to every game
6478094 you cant afford to be afraid of these teams like arsenal you have to show great mental strength and character and we showed that at the emirates in the first 25 minutes we showed them a little bit too much respect other teams probably would have crumbled and let it get to them but we didnt

6478097 namun sekiranya anwar merasakan beliau tidak bersalah beliau boleh membuat pengakuan di mahkamah ataupun membuat sumpah laknat terpulang kepadanya
6478098 saya yakin beliau mungkin bersedia bersumpah tetapi sekiranya datuk seri anwar enggan masyarakat tidak perlu mendesak lagipun sumpah laknat itu hanya releven untuk kes kes membabitkan pertikaian suami isteri

6478108 tony is a player that ticks all the right boxes hes played in middlesbroughs first team and is very highly valued by gareth southgate
6478109 ive spent a large part of my career at united the last nine years and ill remember that time fondly but feel im ready for a new challenge
6478110 arsenal is known for playing technical and skilful football and has a young but experienced squad im really excited about this next stage of my career hopefully playing my part in helping the club to new successes
6478111 we have a strong squad but a young squad and mikaels versatility experience and calibre will provide the extra depth we need to reinforce our challenge for honours this season
6478112 his defensive adaptability will serve us well and its a big plus that mikael has top level experience and a great understanding of football in the premier league
6478113 talks have taken place it was a positive discussion and we will now move forward together
6478114 i definitely missed playing after i picked up the injury against darlington
6478115 i didnt realise how much id missed it until i stepped back on to the pitch against kilmarnock at the weekend
6478116 it was great to play some part in saturdays game because my injury was a nightmare to be honest thats the thing with back injuries they are totally different from ankle knocks or leg injuries
6478117 we have got just less than two weeks but i am hopeful we can sign some players we are still actively trying to get some people in
6478118 i have the support from the chairman randy lerner who has shown his intentions and done exactly what he said he would in supporting the team

6478209 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

6478262 when our rivalry can unwittingly damage the business and employment prospects of indians in companies run by pakistanis and for pakistanis in companies run by british indians those who look back cannot look forward we must look forward to living in peace and harmony not only in britain but throughout the world for our own good
6478263 our roots are the same we can always live in two countries but this should not stop us from being friends
6478264 they both remain committed to working for prosperity friendly rivalry is always good but to the extent which harms is unjustifiable
6478265 our people need bread and not bombs we are wasting our meagre resources on weapons of mass destruction when we cannot even provide clean water or feed them

6478271 if you look at the last decade theres been an incredible growth of these programs
6478272 show this card at any participating orlando area exxon station to get your free save the tiger poster
6478273 if you look at the numbers the average us household belongs to 12 different loyalty programs but they only use about a third of them
6478274 that means that there is just so much money being invested into these loyalty programs that just sort of fall out of the wallet or end up in the sock drawer to never be used again
6478275 if i make an investment in this program at the end of the day is it going to make me more money

6478284 the first thing that happens that you probably dont hear enough about is the cleansing of the former character
6478285 theres usually a process and i dont think a lot of actors talk about it where you essentially purge yourself of the character you played before the movie and then you want to think about what the character represents and you kind of create this mental chalkboard if you will and write down all the elements about this character and then take the time to allow all these elements to find some synchronicity
6478286 there was something interesting about doing a film that had the trappings of an action film but was helmed by a french auteur that felt unique
6478287 i work within the confines of hollywood and rarely get the opportunity to branch out and this was one of those opportunities to branch out and try something that was of the european mind

6478883 theres no question that obtaining secured credit has become harder and in many cases more expensive
6478884 as a second charge on a home a secured loan involves a certain risk from a lenders perspective so secured lenders are keeping a very close eye on issues in the housing market
6478885 todays falling prices are reducing the number of homeowners with enough equity to make a secured loan a viable solution and deterring many who are keen to retain their safety margin against negative equity
6478886 having said that its important to see recent falls in house prices in their correct context as relatively small drops following a decade of rapid growth according to nationwides house price index for example the average house in q2 2008 was still worth almost 10 000 more than it was in q2 2006 in just ten years nationwide reports the average house price rose from 60 754 to 184 131 homeowners may be worried about falling prices but many are still likely to own significant levels of equity for them a secured loan can be an excellent debt solution a realistic way to consolidate their unsecured debts into one manageable lower interest debt which they can arrange to repay at an affordable rate secured loans providers like firstplus announce theyre ceasing to make new loans its clear that the secured loans market as a whole is suffering under todays adverse conditions with lenders tightening their criteria or even turning down new business its more important than ever that borrowers choose a company that works with a wide range of lenders and specialises in finding secured loans for people from all kinds of financial backgrounds talking to the right company can make all the difference between being offered credit at a competitive rate and being unable to avail a secured loan at all
6478887 depending on the individuals circumstances a number of other debt solutions may be more appropriate than a secured loan such as a debt management plan an unsecured debt consolidation loan an iva individual voluntary arrangement or for residents of scotland a trust deed for anyone in debt the important thing is to seek impartial debt advice from a company that offers a wide range of debt solutions a company that has an in depth understanding of each solutions benefits and drawbacks and can recommend the one that constitutes their optimal route out of debt

6479000 to halt international military cooperation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions
6479001 the united states has consistently counselled georgia over a long period of time that there is no military solution in south ossetia
6479002 including the day before georgian troops went into south ossetia we said dont do it dont be drawn into a military conflict its not in your interest
6479003 but the pressure on georgia was too great and they felt they had to act and that gave russia the excuse they were looking for to launch a massive military operation with over 20 000 troops
6479004 its easy to see the careful preparation and the deliberate pressure put on georgia to which they responded unwisely

6479093 these cases resulted primarily from failure to vaccinate many because of philosophical or religious belief
6479094 this is the lowest percentage of imported measles cases since 1996
6479095 in the decade before the measles vaccination program began an estimated 3 to 4 million persons in the united states were infected each year of these 400 to 500 died 48 000 were hospitalized and another 1 000 developed chronic disability from measles encephalitis
6479096 of the 95 patients eligible for vaccination 63 were unvaccinated because of their or their parents philosophical or religious beliefs
6479097 increases in the proportion of the population declining vaccination for themselves or their children might lead to large scale outbreaks in the united states

6479101 while headline inflation picked up on the month this morning s report shows little evidence of these higher prices filtering through to core inflation
6479102 looking ahead it appears as though the worst may be behind us
6479103 while headline inflation is now running at its fastest pace in more than five years it is still near the bottom of the pack globally and more than two points below the current u s pace
6479104 look for the headline readings to hang around three per cent for some time yet while core looks poised to grind higher as the loonie at par discounts begin to fade out of the calculation later this year
6479105 whether inflation is or isn t a problem in canada depends on which number you look to for an answer
6479106 if you don t drive don t have a mortgage payment and don t eat fresh produce you re in luck conveniently the bank of canada strips out many of the fastest rising categories from its core cpi measure but the typical canadian has all of those costs
6479107 for those of us who don t believe that oil grain and import prices are down for the count inflation is still a looming threat
6479108 it s hard to get too excited about the prospect that the bank of canada will ease the policy rate any time soon

6479114 ajudar o aluno a escrever melhor uma tarefa dif cil para o professor pois ele precisa cobrar que seus alunos escrevam de uma maneira diferente da que falam as crian as crescem se comunicando com a linguagem popular e sua maneira de se comunicar n o pode ser substitu da pela forma culta de escrever sem que haja conflitos o melhor antes transformar a fala ensin las a falar a linguagem dos livros

6479117 a linguagem culta utilizada na televis o fico me perguntando por que ela n o assimilada pelas pessoas que assistem acho que por que ningu m mostrou para elas a necessidade de se apropriar da linguagem o professor deve mostrar esta necessidade e ensin la sem tentar substituir o modo antigo mas sim deixando o aluno livre para conhecer e aprender um modo novo

6479136 i believe colins death was a direct result of this kind of sequestered binge drinking
6479137 if anything it really strengthened my sense that we really need to intervene in some way to try to mitigate this behavior
6479138 obviously some people who have deep concerns about this issue have suffered tragedies in their families
6479139 emotions may be shutting down the desire for debate some people have said just crack down well it turns out thats probably not very effective but one can understand how some people feel thats a simple answer
6479140 it is absolutely false that presidents have washed their hands of this issue and are not concerned with this issue
6479141 in fact worrying about our students health and safety around alcohol takes an enormous amount of our energy every weekend during school we are on tenterhooks worrying about whether one of our students is in serious harm by no means are we closing our eyes or turning our backs
6479142 thats one of the things that makes it so hard
6479143 now that youre whatever appropriate age drink responsibly learn to moderate but thats not a message we can send right now
6479144 some researchers speculate that were the drinking age to go down there would be a short term spike in overall consumption which would then level off
6479145 we are not against alcohol what we are against is the abuse of alcohol thats one of the difficulties we find ourselves in were essentially in a period of a mini prohibition and we know from our own experience and from the experience in a couple of other nations that tried it that prohibition has not been successful
6479146 i think a good way to look at that is to think of ones own experience as a parent whether its ice cream thats off limits or you cant go into that drawer or whatever it is i do think theres a fairly strong tendency just in human nature for the forbidden to exercise a kind of lure
6479147 we could even say we know men and women are going to want to mark their passage into maturity and cultures can shape those

6479149 lets get clear as clear as we can about what the true effect of the current practice is and then lets look at whether there are other alternatives we could imagine discover what we can learn from others and just think about ways that we can handle young people and alcohol more effectively

6479187 the united states has consistently counseled georgia over a long period of time that there is no military solution in south ossetia
6479188 including the day before georgian troops went into south ossetia we said dont do it dont be drawn into a military conflict its not in your interest
6479189 but the pressure on georgia was too great and they felt they had to act and that gave russia the excuse they were looking for to launch a massive military operation with over 20 000 troops
6479190 its easy to see the careful preparation and the deliberate pressure put on georgia to which they responded unwisely

6479217 we also have been working with some of their key software providers to port some of the applications that they have internally natively onto force com for them to use
6479218 and all of that together suddenly we were one of their key technology vendors and it really gave them the ability to sign what we call an enterprise license agreement with us
6479219 having a big hitter commit to developing on force com is really important
6479220 previously those committing have tended to be saas smb players like centive or xactly or midmarket on premise apps vendors looking to get saasy quickly like coda
6479221 talked proudly about not needing to rely on a third party vendors erp but creating its own apps
6479222 so i wonder if that might be a possibility as well as the ability to tailor salesforce crm more to the needs of its sales reps
6479223 you are going to see us offering our customers natively google app engine and other cloud computing paradigms directly from our application programming interfaces

6479241 we can expect with high probability this year will be cooler than the previous five years
6479242 definitely the la nina should have had an effect how much we cannot say
6479243 up to july 2008 this year has been cooler than the previous five years at least it still looks like its warmer than average
6479244 of course at the beginning of the year there was la nina and that would have had the effect of suppressing temperatures somewhat as well
6479245 but actually la nina is showing signs of moving towards a more neutral state

6479252 im used to playing comic characters who are often unpleasant people and who you somehow have some kind of empathy for this guy isnt awful or nasty hes vulnerable and foolish and slightly self delusional i could see how you could make him funny the trick is to make sure the audience would care enough about him to see it through to the end that was the tough thing
6479253 its the heaviest of users that are directly contributing to the degradation of the service for the other people on the network

6479256 the fcc has required them to disclose all the details so we look forward to seeing that before we can fully evaluate any move that doesnt involve blocking consumers access to the internet is a positive step but we wont know for sure about this particular practice until we see the details

6479261 the name of the position is part of the joke
6479262 were using the campaign to make fun of how farcical the system is
6479263 damien was on the short list of people who were energetic and confident and politically astute
6479264 i think the videos reflect the reality of the position that hes running for
6479265 the only way to really address the issues was to take them from a sideways angle truth presenting itself as falsehood sometimes a lie is truer than the truth
6479266 i think that one of the things thats cool about the stuff we picked is its so wide open to interpretation
6479267 you have a monster eating the world trade center and then you have two presidents to lock it down loses its power
6479268 pretty much kleos is glory or fame but it also kind of pertains to what people hear about you and the word that spreads around about you and most heroes sought after it in battles
6479269 so the reason i chose kleos is i think every musician nowadays especially wants to be remembered and everybody is trying so hard to stamp their face on the music industry and not be forgotten
6479270 i would say our music is very passionate and i dont feel like it stands in one place really i feel like it moves around a lot which is cool
6479271 its edgy and heavy in different ways like in more melodic ways its not necessarily such a straightforward type of music all the time
6479272 when i found out that we even got into the top 15 i was so surprised because wed entered a bunch of the contests theyd had before and never even gotten placed
6479273 so that was a shock just to get into the top 15 and then actually being in the top 3
6479274 our friend said you guys should really do this contest because its a good idea and i think you have a good chance to win
6479275 me being myself i said oh yeah right theres gonna be some totally popular san francisco band that ive never heard of before thats going to come and blow us out of the water
6479276 that was the part for me where i felt like it kind of depended on like did coldplay actually think we were a good band
6479277 for me personally it was the best experience of my life knowing that we won and that we were there
6479278 we had our terrible van next to these big tour buses we didnt know what to expect but they gave us as much respect as anybody
6479279 our drummer rico made a really good point and i thought this was a perfect analogy
6479280 he said this is like the pizza party at the end of the week that you get at school after youve sold enough magazine subscriptions its not going to make our grade and its not gonna make us pass high school but its a really cool moment that were all very proud of so for me the coldplay thing is really cool but i wouldnt want people to think that were a one trick pony in that sense
6479281 the one thing that i felt was really cool was we were really scared before we went up to play like we were really nervous
6479282 we usually dont get nervous because we play local shows but the thought of playing for so many people is pretty terrifying but then we got up there and the first 30 seconds were like uuuhhh and then everything after that was a lot easier than i expected it to be
6479283 i didnt get nervous at all until after we played and then the lights went out and we could see everybody and i was like oh we just played for like 14 000 people
6479284 we got hundreds of adds on myspace but at the same time you cant really tell whos going to care the next day were being realistic about it
6479285 i feel like we should keep doing what we like and not worry so much about how its going to end up but at the same time not be afraid to try different things and really in essence get weirder without getting too weird
6479286 because things have to change or you might get stuck in one spot and stay forgotten
6479287 i just want to be able to make the music we want to make while gaining more recognition and respect for what were doing and touring full time

6479336 the scouts and schools will be able to do things here the park offices will be here and a classroom it will have a lot of uses
6479337 the old gravel pit was abandoned in the early fifties
6479338 this joins what was originally split back together when the land for the original park was purchased
6479339 the north branch and the east branch of the kokosing converge on this property
6479340 it would be a perfect outdoor classroom for young people
6479341 just about every species of bird in the area will be in this park because of the trees and the water
6479342 this will bring some tourism to town and we will have an information kiosk to tell visitors whats going on around town
6479343 they are holding it until we can arrange the grant money we are pursuing grants at every level federal and state
6479344 they are very community minded theyve done this for other parks in the county and we really appreciate it
6479345 we talked about this land years ago how nice it would be to have this and then the opportunity came up how special is that that well have a 70 acre park within 2 1 2 blocks of downtown the possibilities are endless and the whole thing will invent itself over time
6479346 it would have gone to development to be split into lots with super homes
6479347 it would have been lost to the wildlife then its a real gift to the community

6479431 ab 1991 was a better deal for both the city and for me
6479432 the deal we settled on when we settled this litigation was a or b it was ab 1991 or 18 million and it looks like were going to get b instead of a
6479433 the difficulty with 1991 was that there was so much opposition that there was no way 1991 was going to pass at all the compromise that ive been able to structure i think is a win win for everyone

6479437 we are seeing some things that should concern the people of west virginia
6479438 more suspicious members of the public would have assumed that judge kahn had simply returned past favors provided to him by mr levin and mr childers
6479439 whether you have a right to bring an individual engle suit or some other suit against big tobacco is an extremely complicated legal question that should be answered by a competent who is familiar with the engle litigation
6479440 i cant go into a lot of details right now papantonio said
6479441 this story is not just about dupont its about other associated industries and the u s chamber of commerce the owner of legal newsline influencing the governors office and influencing regulatory agencies and courts in west virginia
6479442 only in the perverse world of a plaintiffs trial lawyer would it be inappropriate for industry associations to talk with regulatory agencies
6479443 its not unusual for industry trade associations to talk to the governmental agencies charged with regulating them
6479444 certainly gov manchin has made it no secret hed like to attract additional businesses to west virginia and so it would not be unusual for him to talk to business associations
6479445 our brief is solely based on the issue of due process and whether or not our supreme court follows the same standards as established by the u s supreme court with regard to the right to appeal punitive damages
6479446 we did not take sides in the actual case in any way and want any citizen that has been adversely affected to get the benefits and compensation that they deserve
6479447 this puzzled me i was confused as to what he meant then there was another interview where somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and he said at least four at least four now think about that i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong but if youre like me and you got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america you dont have to be a nobel prize laureate economist you just have to have a little bit of a sense of what ordinary people are going through to understand that we cant afford eight more years or four more years or one more year of the failed economic policies that george bush has put in place
6479448 john mccain with those homes they get a mortgage deduction up to 1 million
6479449 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6479450 i understand that senator mccain was asked yesterday this question how many houses do you own and he couldnt answer that question
6479451 he couldnt count high enough apparently to even know how many houses he owns

6479472 we dont have management by choice and we dont have a label by choice
6479473 before all of that had led us astray but now everything has come back to the very beginnings of the band its about being able to write a record and release it tour with our friends and just do the things that make us happy
6479474 with this new strategy every time we go out on the road our fans will have new music
6479475 often times with a standard album cycle theres this weird gap between when the band writes and records and when the band finally plays it to an audience now were more flexible and we have the ability to better stay in touch with our audience
6479476 the best part of keeping things small and manageable is that were more able to stay focused on those fans whove stuck with us and who will always stick with us
6479477 with these new songs i looked back over the different ways that i had expressed myself lyrically over the past four years and tried to take stock of what worked and what didnt nolan says
6479478 these lyrics were sort of a culmination of everything ive learned as a songwriter combined with the new perspective that this last year has given me after everything i experienced this year i realized that there was no way to use these songs as a way to make sense of anything or explain it i let go and just decided that the songs would be about documenting thoughts and feelings and not about finding answers or sending any particular message ive found a sort of peace in understanding that there arent always answers or ways to explain things and that its all right

6479571 we dont believe at this time that any of the machines were owned by any of the local businesses
6479572 we do believe that they were placed there through outside sources that own the machines we think the profits were split between owner and business
6479573 we have information of rather large payouts and we have information of people losing rather large amounts of money on these machines
6479574 i think the cycle has gone around to where its now back in our area
6479575 weve tried to educate the public and business owners that these machines are deemed illegal we expected business owners to understand that and to get rid of them but some chose not to do so
6479576 what would i do if there was an eartquake right now

6479590 if you look at the numbers the average us household belongs to 12 different loyalty programs but they only use about a third of them
6479591 that means that there is just so much money being invested into these loyalty programs that just sort of fall out of the wallet or end up in the sock drawer to never be used again
6479592 if i make an investment in this program at the end of the day is it going to make me more money
6479593 people dont tend to forget to carry around their credit card but theyll leave most of those 12 loyalty cards at home
6479594 how about combining the two and making it easier for consumers
6479595 the interest that weve seen from the credit card companies they are all very interested in this
6479596 so we know were on to something here and i think theyre looking at us and saying wow this is really the next evolution for consumers
6479597 what were seeing is really more of a trend of hey i usually go to three or four coffee shops if i consolidate my business then maybe ill get a free cup of coffee a week and that really adds up a couple dollars a week especially in this economy is important

6479612 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6479613 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6479615 esperamos que el gobierno implemente esta medida la cual vendr a a hacer justicia a miles de mujeres chilenas
6479616 el senado aprob por unanimidad un proyecto de acuerdo en que se solicita a la presidenta de la rep blica que instruya al ministro del trabajo osvaldo andrade para que estudie la posibilidad de modificar las leyes de tal forma que las mujeres que reciben montep os no pierdan este derecho si contraen matrimonio como asimismo las mujeres que tienen una pensi n en caso de fallecimiento de su marido no deban tener que elegir entre continuar recibiendo esta o acceder a un montep o
6479617 actualmente las leyes establecen que las mujeres que reciben un montep o si se casan pierden este beneficio motivo por el cual muchas optan por convivir con su nueva pareja y no contraer matrimonio
6479618 a esto se agrega los casos de las mujeres que han cotizado durante toda una vida para obtener una pensi n y que deben renunciar a ella para obtener un montep o es decir en la pr ctica pierden todos sus ahorros ya que ambos beneficios son incompatibles
6479619 afectan principalmente a mujeres de escasos recursos que reciben una pensi n o un montep o del sistema provisional p blico
6479620 espera que el gobierno haga suya la solicitud del senado de la rep blica y por tanto implemente a la brevedad este proyecto de acuerdo que vendr a hacer justicia a miles de mujeres chilenas

6479624 negotiations are tough and sometimes they are even tougher than usual we know what we are working towards and we know what our objectives are

6479626 tottenham fans are no exception to any others they support the team and get behind the side
6479627 if a player is on form if he knocks in a couple of goals then im sure anyone who booed him last week will soon be getting behind him and cheering him that is what it is like
6479628 while he is still here he is very much 100 a tottenham player that is how we consider things it is not a case of finding a solution to a problem before it occurs
6479629 because the cost is suffered by the benchmark index itself it will remain hidden from index investors who simply focus on the explicit fees of index funds and their performance relative to the index yet it represents an unambiguous drag on returns and it can be avoided with simple index neutral strategies which have otherwise similar risk and return characteristics

6479633 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged

6479665 the thing that has impressed me the most has been his attitude

6479676 t here is nothing more important to the jockey club and the stewards of the jockey club than resolving the medication dilemma we have to level the playing field for the sake of this industry and everyone involved in it

6479700 thoroughbred horses so called have been bred and used mainly for the development of speed upon race courses so far they would appear to be only a means of amusement but they are more copperbottom and other notable strains of thoroughbreds infused through domestic bloodlines have produced that strictly american horse the saddler who carries his rider with ease and without discomfort to horse or horseman and so mambrino was the progenitor of a tribe of coach horses of excellence and value indeed it would seem not to require a knowledge of the history of the breeds of horses to appreciate the fact that where are to be found in a breed of horses those qualities imparted to any other breed of horses lacking in any of them will necessarily improve the latter stock
6479701 to whatever extent breeding for speed has resulted in a more fragile horse it has also hurt the market for the off the track thoroughbred the general perception correct or not is that thoroughbreds tend to be too fragile for a long career and let me put this out there a complete steroid ban would go a long way to making sport horse owners more willing to invest in an off the track thoroughbred

6479730 the stewards of the jockey club think its a disgrace that numerous horses in our sports most prominent and highly visible races are routinely trained by people who have repeated medication violations at the present time there are no penalties for owners of horses that test positive for a banned substance in the past we believed that was correct but if owners are picking trainers who are routinely fined or suspended for medication infractions we should reconsider an owner responsibility rule

6479829 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6479830 does a guy whose wife made more than 27 million last year just got back from pretending to know bikers and bought who knows how many houses really want to get into a debate about houses
6479831 my fellow americans this debate is not about whether i own one house or whether my opponent owns ten houses

6479894 i thought the audience walked out on the high film frame rate because it was too realistic now youre saying they cant tell the difference must have been an audience of supermen eh

6479898 another movie he directed brainstorm was originally designed to highlight a projection technology he was promoting the movie was about recording experiences in the film the recorded experiences were going to be played at 48 frames per second as opposed to the standard 24 frames per second his feeling was that audiences had gotten used to the look of standard film people were subliminally aware of the 24 frame per second flicker by projecting the film at twice the standard rate the flicker was harder to perceive and the film would be given that much more immediacy however it was impossible to convince the theater owners to install the special projectors to show the recorded experience sequences the movie was released as a conventional film fortunately the story stood up well on its own partly correct showscan runs at 60fps when he was doing test work for 2001 i believe it was on the spacewalk footage but its been years since i read up on the process and things have blurred for me he accidentally ran a sequence at 60fps and the uniform reaction in the booth was shock that hed gotten a 3d effect with a conventional camera he did dream up brainstorm to use the process but the studio hed been working with didnt want to install the only projector on the market that would run 60fps for an extended period without breaking for just one film and he ended up taking the story idea with him to mgm as i remember it he had to do a sizable payout to get it from his previous studio even then mgm wouldnt go for it compare and contrast with the ua chain which installed a highly sophisticated 3d system in a number of their theaters including seattle and ended up offering a couple of million dollars as a bounty to get someone anyone to shoot a feature using it there were several showscan shorts shot the one at expo 86 the one on magic tricks starring christopher lee and it looked like hed finally get them in widespread distribution when he signed a deal with a major restaurant chain to add a showscan theater to each of their restaurants but the chain was chuck e cheese and the deal was about two months before they imploded of all the reviews i read about the process the one that stuck with me was the one in cinefantastique that said makeup technology was going to have to improve greatly if the process was going to catch on you could apparently see every pore on christopher lees face
6479899 i hope that chinese officials will reverse this misguided decision the world is paying close attention to the way in which beijing conducts the olympics as they begin its relationship to the government in sudan including weapons sales to that government is a matter of legitimate concern to all who care about human rights and ending genocide the hope that china would host the games with openness is greatly diminished by this action

6479902 my administration will create a veterans care access card to be used by veterans with illness or injury incurred during their military service and by those with lower incomes this card will provide those without timely access to va facilities the option of using high quality health care providers near their homes for many veterans the closest va facility isnt close enough and many of their local providers are already familiar with the most common needs of veterans often all that prevents them from receiving local care is a system for sharing medical records among va dod and civilian hospitals and doctors my reform will improve care reduce risks and broaden access all at the same time

6479908 the u s environmental protection agency is sponsoring a voluntary initiative to reduce the use of lead wheel weights but has not banned them

6479912 we conscientious objectors planned to go to prison together but the army has apparently learned its lesson and arrested udi as a preemptive measure
6479913 i cannot take part in the activities of an occupying army that regularly violates human rights as an israeli citizen and as a drafted teenager i feel that it is my duty to refuse to enter the circle of blood and add fuel to the fire of hatred that is raging in our fields
6479914 i refuse to join an army so as not to support the occupation and other acts that go against my most basic principles human rights democracy and every mans social responsibility towards his fellow man
6479915 deliberate attempt on the armys part to prevent our voices from being heard we were surprised by how quickly udi was arrested but we were prepared for such a scenario and knew that this was a price we were willing to pay
6479916 fortunately people are beginning to realize that the army is not a sacred cow and enlisting in it is not a must
6479917 if more and more people voice their objection to the occupation the governments policy will have to follow suit
6479918 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6479919 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6479920 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6479921 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6479922 when this critical column buckled due to lack of floor supports it was the first domino in the chain

6479925 they didnt treat us badly our village is close to tskhinvali and as soon as we were left without any protection some ossetian guys from there stormed in they came into my house and set my bed on fire then they left they didnt take anything and i was able to put out the fire but then they came again and took me and others from the village they herded us out and brought us to tskhinvali we spent 12 days there in prison
6479926 as long as the war was going on we stayed there to protect our houses from being burned down
6479927 were not politicians or fighters were peasants ordinary working people look at our faces so we thought we had nothing to fear some of those who came were very aggressive some less so but in the end they burned down all our houses and then we had to flee
6479928 after we fled the ossetian police protected us from being killed then we were put in prison we spent nine days there and they treated us well they gave us food and something to drink they didnt humiliate us they were protecting us from those hooligans
6479929 they hit me three times in the neck with the handle of their gun my son i was covered in blood and they broke my arm
6479930 i provided an incomplete list of captured south ossetians to the georgian authorities and the georgians promised they would also hand over those who are not on the list
6479931 i was told that eight people would be handed over to me today one of them is heavily wounded and he will be taken to a hospital in tskhinvali by car
6479932 these are civilians who were taken hostage and we appreciate this gesture
6479933 we were asked for two things first to start the process of returning those who were captured by the georgian side while engaged in military actions against us
6479934 second to pardon 14 people ossetians who were given prison sentences before the start of the conflict they gave us a list were working on them now one of the eight soldiers is heavily wounded and is receiving care in a hospital in georgia
6479935 yesterday john mccain said the economy was fundamentally strong this puzzled me
6479936 ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so he asked his staff and they said at least four at least four now think about that i guess if you think being rich is you have to make 5 million a year and you have to think about how many houses you have then you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6479937 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective and by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes
6479938 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6479939 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people
6479940 nothing just making sure that im as inoffensive as i can possibly be so i dont make anybody angry and scare them away from buying me

6479944 in the creative field surfing non work sites may be considered part of the job because it allows professionals to keep up with trends and seek new sources of inspiration

6479947 the church is unaware of any movement in this regard on the part of the congregations involved in the pending litigation
6479948 a standstill with you will never happen because there are just too many bishops and other interested persons within the church who want this fight to go forward there is just too much at stake in terms of power and any one bishop or church chancellor or even a few of them together who called for such a step would immediately be branded as cowards in the eyes of their colleagues see you back in court
